Welcome to the March 2022 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | March 2022
**Mindscape Podcast:** [March 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boFa4Z9BT8Y)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the March 2022 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll. A little bit late coming out this month, sorry, it's March 5th.
*  I usually try to get it out by the beginning of the month, but things have been hectic.
*  Things are probably going to be hectic again next month. Lots of things I'm supposed to be doing
*  other than doing AMAs. So we get when we get it. There you go. For those of you who are listening,
*  I don't know, far in the future or whatever, the world is in bad shape at the moment. We,
*  in the last couple of weeks, have had the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is intrinsically bad.
*  The plucky Ukrainians are fighting back as best they can. NATO and the US are trying to help them
*  in various different ways without actually getting into a shooting war with Russia,
*  which could lead to World War III. That's where we are right now in the world. I don't have a
*  lot of wisdom about that particular conflict, although it's easy after the fact, of course,
*  to say, well, we should have done a lot more before the conflict started to prevent it from
*  happening in the first place. The West does have the ability to put economic squeeze on Russia
*  in order to prevent it from doing things like that, but we didn't. International cooperation
*  is not always easy and it's certainly never fast. But of course, this invasion has brought
*  a whole bunch of countries together on the other side in ways that were unanticipated. So I guess
*  there's a tiny little silver lining. I mean, everyone knows everyone in the current era here,
*  listening to the news, et cetera, has just enormous respect and admiration for the people
*  of Ukraine who are fighting to keep their homeland and not be part of the Russian
*  dictatorship. It's heartbreaking because it's very, very plausible, I would say,
*  that it won't work. Maybe it works. I certainly hope that they're able to maintain their sovereignty,
*  but they're a tiny country against a big country. So who knows? I'm not optimistic about that, but I
*  keep my fingers crossed. There's, of course, a whole bunch of other things going on in the world.
*  Politicians are doing stupid things as usual. We still have a pandemic that we're going through.
*  Yeah, it's tough to keep your eyes on the positive aspects of things. I just put up a tweet
*  with a picture of Ariel just to cheer people up a little bit. That's the best I can do. I can
*  offer kitty pictures. But I'm actually a believer that even in very, very trying times, and I should
*  say needless to say, these times are not nearly as trying for me or for Americans more generally
*  as they are for other people throughout the world. So a bit of empathy there. I'm not trying to make
*  it as if my personal situation is all that bad compared to that of others. But it is actually
*  important, I think, to kind of not become too monomaniacal about these things, especially when
*  these things involve world events that you or I individually have very little control over.
*  Life is complicated and rich and multifaceted, and there will be bad things going on and good
*  things at the same time. I don't think it's a mistake to acknowledge both. So just because
*  terrible things are happening, it's okay to remember that there are some good things happening,
*  and vice versa. Even if things are going very well, it's important to keep in mind that things
*  aren't going well for everybody, and they could be better and working to make them better. So
*  this is a very long-winded way of saying, I think it's okay to have an Ask Me Anything episode of
*  the Mindscape podcast, even when the world is falling apart. The world doesn't stop. It doesn't
*  just come to a halt, even when bad things are happening. And it's important to sort of keep our
*  chins up and think about big questions that have an eternal aspect to them, as well as the pressing
*  questions of the moment. We can do both. That's the point. We should be able to multitask on this.
*  So as always, if you aren't a regular listener here, this is the Ask Me Anything episode for
*  Mindscape. We do this once a month, except for the end of the year. And the questions are asked by
*  supporters of Mindscape on Patreon. So if you would like to be a supporter, you can go to patreon.com
*  Sean M. Carroll and pledge your support to this little project that we have going on here. And
*  you get to ask a question. Back in the days when we were a Wee Plucky podcast, everyone who asked a
*  question would get it answered. These days there are too many questions. Sorry about that. But I
*  try to answer the questions that I think I have something interesting to say about. As usual,
*  every single month, there's more and more really, really good questions that I don't get to answer.
*  So my heart breaks. I would like to be able to answer all the questions, but there's lots of
*  things I'd like to be able to do that I can't quite get done. There you go. That's the world,
*  the constraints of reality in time and space and energy and effort and ability. Gotta deal with them.
*  And with that, with that not completely optimistic conclusion, let's go.
*  Crafter Lutha says, After all this time, I still don't understand why people chose to be Bayesian
*  when it comes to epistemology. For example, where does knowledge actually come from within a Bayesian
*  framework? And how does it deal with entirely new ideas, i.e. with no relation to any priors?
*  Well, I think, as I said before, you have to separate out two different things. One is Bayes'
*  theorem. And Bayes' theorem is a theorem. It's just right. No one is allowed to disagree with
*  it unless you disagree with basic facts about math and logic. And Bayes' theorem says that when we
*  have some credences and some propositions, and then new evidence comes to bear, here's a formula
*  that tells you how you change your credences. So you're sort of not allowed to disagree with
*  that formula if you accept the basic axioms. But Bayesian epistemology or Bayesian inference,
*  whatever you want to call it, is a slightly more broad scope kind of set of claims where you're
*  saying that that is the way that we should think about gaining new knowledge. You always start
*  with some credences and you always update them. Now there's many, many details that are worth
*  trying to get into here. Like when I say new knowledge, new data, what counts as new data?
*  Is it literally new facts about the world that we've been empirically measuring? Or can a new
*  insight count as new data in some sense? And I think the clear answer is yes, new insight
*  definitely counts as new data. If you realize that your proposition is actually predicting
*  something that is true, even though you didn't originally realize that, then that should increase
*  your likelihood in that particular, your credence if you like, in that particular proposition.
*  So the question I take it is that the usual, I mean, maybe I'm not sure, Krath or Luca, if I am
*  force feeding or forcing your question into a framework that I understand, but
*  the usual question is about the priors. So a Bayesian starts with prior credences. You have
*  to start somewhere and then you update them. And everyone agrees on the updating. The priors are
*  sort of philosophically difficult. I mean, where do they come from? I take it that that is the
*  basic question here. Yeah, so they come from human beings inventing priors. As I joked, I forget
*  whether it was in the big picture or one of my other books. Everyone is entitled to their own
*  priors. No one is entitled to their own likelihoods. The likelihoods are the functions that tell you
*  the likelihood of getting certain data, given some proposition being true. But everyone's entitled
*  to their own priors. So where do they come from? They come from the fact that we are human beings
*  embedded in the world. Our brains are not blank slates. We have models of the world. We have the
*  manifest image. We believe in three dimensions of space around us and gravity and all sorts of
*  things like that. Continuity over time of various course features of the world. And that brain,
*  as part of the physical universe, has opinions. It just has opinions, whether you like it or not.
*  Even if you give somebody a proposition that they have never contemplated before,
*  they can come up with a prior on whether they think that proposition is true or not. Different
*  people will have different priors. The hope is that they can collect enough data so that their
*  priors go away. And that's always the hope of Bayesian epistemology, which is a fancy way of
*  saying that we do science to the world. That's how we make progress. We gather data and it doesn't
*  matter what our initial opinions were. If those opinions become flagrantly in conflict with the
*  data, we get rid of them. So philosophically, you might not like that idea that our brains come up
*  with these priors in different ways, in fundamentally subjective ways. I just think that that's it.
*  There's no other, there's no better way to do it than that. There's no out there in the world
*  objective handle that we have. I think that this is part of my own intellectual journey. I was a
*  person so many years ago who was as foundationalist as anybody, who really thought that
*  we should go looking for absolutely solid grounding for all of our beliefs, including
*  beliefs about morals and aesthetics and so forth. And the more and more I think about it, the more
*  and more I read, the more and more I exist in the world and try to make sense of it, the more
*  subjective I believe that some things are. The physical world is not subjective. There's a real
*  honest world out there. But when you say, okay, how do these little agents called human beings
*  develop knowledge about the world? There's going to be a necessarily subjective feature there.
*  There's not a rock hard foundation on which to build an unbreakable edifice of pure knowledge.
*  Maybe we'd like that to be true, but I don't think it is. Anonymous says, if you take our
*  observable world and retrodict without a past hypothesis, what are some concrete ways your
*  retrodiction would look like the future and ways your retrodictions would look like the real past?
*  I.e. does ice melt, but the rotation of the earth reverses, do stars shine, etc.?
*  Okay, so the setup for this question is the arrow of time question. We think that entropy is
*  increasing toward the future for two reasons. One is because starting from today, we start with some
*  coarse-grained information about the world, right? We don't know the microstate of the world. We
*  don't know every atom and molecule and what they're doing, but we know some coarse observable
*  features of it. And we have a probability distribution of what the microstates could
*  be doing within that macroscopic set of constraints. And so you can from that predict the future
*  in some probabilistic way. Okay. Now you could also try to predict the past, but in fact,
*  what we actually think happened in the past is utterly different than what you would get
*  just on the basis of predicting from the current macrostate. We think the entropy of the universe
*  was lower in the past. And so we assume that the early universe started with very, very low entropy.
*  That's the past hypothesis. And then we conditionalize on that. When we make predictions,
*  if you will, about the past, we don't just say starting with our current information.
*  We say starting with our current information and the hypothesis that the past had very low entropy,
*  what do we reconstruct about the past? And this is so ingrained in how we think that it is very
*  difficult to break out of just assuming that past hypothesis. And so in particular, if you didn't
*  have it, this is the question asked by anonymous. If you didn't have the past hypothesis, if you
*  only had information about the current macrostate of the world, what would you predict about the
*  past and future? And the important thing here is this division of knowledge into microstates and
*  macrostates. So the earth going around the sun has a macrostate. And let's imagine that that
*  macrostate is just defined by the center of mass of the earth, where it's located, how it's moving,
*  and maybe its rotation or something like that. You're already noticing that the level of coarse
*  graining is important. For some people, astronomers, it's usually okay to just treat the earth as a
*  point going around the sun. For geologists, it's not good enough. You need to take care of all the
*  mountains and oceans and things like that, but we're being astronomers right now. So that is a
*  macrostate because we're ignoring details of what all the molecules and the particles in the earth
*  are doing. And when you say, I take the current macrostate and evolve it backward in time without
*  a past hypothesis, what happens is to evolve backward in time, you just imagine reversing the
*  momentum. Reversing the momentum of every object and evolving it forward in time gets you the same
*  kind of answer as just evolving backward in time. So for imagination purposes, it's useful to think
*  about reversing the momentum. And that macrostate of the earth has a momentum. It is moving around
*  the sun, the center of mass of the earth. And so that would reverse. So that's just a fancy way of
*  saying that if the earth is moving around in a certain direction toward the future, it would
*  still move backward toward the past. The earth moving around the sun is a physical system that
*  has very small numbers of moving parts to the earth and the sun, as long as we can ignore some
*  very, very tiny tidal effects and outgassing and things like that. And it's very, very predictable,
*  right? There's no entropy increase or decrease as the earth goes around the sun. There's entropy
*  increase or decrease because of radiation and things, but we're ignoring that for right now.
*  So you can easily retrodict the earth going backward. That's no problem at all. You've
*  reversed that momentum. What you don't do is reverse all the microscopic momenta. You're not
*  allowed to do that because you don't know what they are, because you only know the current macrostate.
*  So roughly speaking, if all you knew is the current macrostate, if you want to know what
*  you predict for the past, it is exactly the same as what you predict for the future,
*  except for these macroscopic momenta being reversed. So in particular, you predict that
*  toward the future, the sun is shining. What does that mean? That means that there's radiation that
*  is leaving the sun and escaping to infinity, escaping to distant space. So if you had a little
*  meter that was counting the flux of electromagnetic radiation, you would get a lot of flux going from
*  the direction of the sun out into the opposite direction. If you retrodict the past without a
*  past hypothesis, you predict the opposite of that, which is you predict radiation flowing from the
*  sun into the past, if that makes sense. It's equivalent to saying you predict radiation
*  coming toward the sun. If you had a little meter there in the past, it would detect a strong
*  amount of radiation coming toward the sun from empty space. And you say to yourself, well, why
*  in the world? How does it know? Does that radiation know to go toward the sun? But the point is,
*  without the past hypothesis, the current moment in the history of the universe is very, very special.
*  We do not live in thermal equilibrium. We are in a relatively low entropy state compared to
*  thermal equilibrium. So that's why entropy can still increase toward the past. But without
*  the past hypothesis, entropy also increases toward the past. I meant that's why entropy
*  does increase toward the future starting from now. Without the past hypothesis, it would also
*  increase toward the past in exactly the same way. So the reason why this radiation focusing in on the
*  sun knows to do that is because the sun right now is in a very special low entropy state,
*  all things considered, if you don't think that there was an even lower entropy state before that.
*  Of course, this seems weird because we have an intuitive feeling about how cause and effect works
*  and the arrow of time is built into that. But you've erased the arrow of time toward the past by
*  saying we have no past hypothesis. So you're going to get some weird behavior. Dan Pye says,
*  given the fuzzy nature of the term emergence, strong and weak, meaning almost the opposite of
*  other, do you think there could be room to somewhat expand the meaning of the much less
*  used word consilience to capture what is usually meant by weak emergence, understanding that it
*  usually refers to agreement between academic disciplines, it has a strong overlap with
*  agreement between levels of reality, and reconciling different ways of speaking about the same reality?
*  I think that consilience is related and a fine thing to think about it, but it's not the same.
*  It doesn't capture the same meaning as weak emergence because consilience would be completely
*  possible if there were no higher levels. It's compatible with the idea that there's just one
*  level that you can talk about. The statement of weak emergence is the statement that there are
*  additional patterns that we can sort of grasp and make predictions using only macroscopic
*  information. You don't need, in the example we just gave, to know all the details about all the
*  particles in the earth to predict how it's going to revolve around the sun. That is an example of
*  weak emergence. Of course, ex post facto, there is consilience with thinking about the earth as a
*  point with its center of mass versus thinking of the earth as 10 to the 50th atoms and molecules,
*  but there's an extra fact that is conveyed when you say there is a weakly emergent higher level
*  description. I don't think that it's a good substitute for that kind of vocabulary. Carlos
*  Nunes says, what's your view on the trade-off between free speech and misinformation?
*  Is it okay for platforms to restrict freedom of speech if that has a considerable positive
*  effect on social welfare? It's hard to answer these questions. They're important questions,
*  but it's hard to answer in the abstract. I think there's a temptation, similar to what I just
*  talked about a second ago, there's a temptation to find a simple rule and just apply it absolutely
*  and unthinkingly once you've made up the rule. But the real world is a little messier and more
*  complicated than that. I mean, if you take this question at face value, is it okay for platforms
*  to restrict freedom of speech? Platforms can't redistrict freedom of speech. They can only
*  restrict what you do on that platform. Freedom of speech was never supposed to be the freedom
*  to say whatever you want on any platform you chose. No one ever had the right to say,
*  I would like to print something on the front page of the New York Times. The New York Times has some
*  legal obligation to print it. There is a difference now than in the past that we do have the
*  technological capabilities to allow people, anyone, to use a certain platform. But we never do allow
*  anyone. There's always people who are banned from these platforms for misbehavior of one form or
*  another. That's perfectly legal and perfectly legitimate. It would be nice in terms of simplicity
*  and clarity to say everyone can say whatever they want, but no one ever says that nor should
*  they say that. So you have to do the hard work. You have to do the hard work of saying, okay,
*  how do we balance the consideration of letting people have as much free speech as we can possibly
*  get away with, with considerations of both social welfare and the rights of the people who make the
*  platforms, right? I mean, the true libertarian response to this would be make your own platform.
*  If you don't like it. And I don't think that's a completely convincing response either because
*  it's easy to say that. It's hard to actually do it. There are lock-in effects. There are monopolies.
*  There's a whole bunch of issues going on that we can't sweep under the table. But
*  at face value, yes, it is okay for platforms to kick people off of them if there are good
*  reasons to do so. Now, clearly delineating what are the good reasons, et cetera, that's hard work.
*  And there's no way we're going to make it anything other than hard work. We need to do that work.
*  Andrew Jaffe says, in any of the many worlds, is there a better trade than the hardened for
*  Simmons trade? What do you now think of the Sixers chances for winning it all this year?
*  So those of you who do not follow basketball might not be aware of the epic trade that was made by
*  former Mindscape guest, Darrell Morey, president of basketball operations for the Philadelphia 76ers.
*  Ben Simmons, one of the Sixers all-star players, became unhappy for various reasons that I will
*  not go into, demanded to be traded. And James Harden, another all-star player who was playing
*  for the Brooklyn Nets and previously had played for Darrell Morey in Houston, also became unhappy
*  at the same time. And so the two teams traded their headaches for each other. And I think,
*  I'm very biased as a Sixers fan, but I think the Sixers came out of that trade great. I could not
*  imagine it really working out better. I'm sad because we lost two really good other players in
*  Seth Curry and Andre Drummond, as well as a couple draft picks. But James Harden and Joellen Bede and
*  Tyrese Maxey are just perfect complements to each other. I do think that the Sixers will have
*  a learning curve. I don't think it's all going to be, they're not going to go undefeated,
*  let's put it that way, between here and the playoffs, especially on the defensive end.
*  I think on the offensive end, it's just going to work perfectly. And that's something that I've
*  never said about the Sixers since 1983, that we've really had a killer offensive scheme in place. But
*  the early returns are that, unsurprisingly to me, James Harden and Joellen Bede, who are both
*  all-stars and basketball geniuses, work really well together. So optimistic. If we can stop other
*  people from scoring, we'll go very far. So I do think, I actually think the Sixers have a very
*  good chance of winning it all this year. I think that the only team I would clearly put ahead of
*  them is Phoenix. If they get Chris Paul back, then I think that Phoenix deserves to be the
*  favorite team to win it all this year. But the Sixers are right up there. Okay, I'm going to
*  lump together, group together two questions. One is by Sandro Stuckey, who says,
*  I'm amazed by the length and quality of the Ask Me Anything episodes. The number of questions
*  left here by patrons, patrons, is it patreons? It's probably patrons. I think, Sandro, you're
*  correct. Just seems to go up and up. Can you tell us about your process for making an AMA episode?
*  How much time does it take you to select and edit the questions, to record them, to prepare the
*  auto material for upload, etc.? And then Frank Layman says, in your AMA instructions, you
*  explicitly note, I am not a huge fan of special relativity, puzzles, and paradoxes. I'm curious,
*  what is it about these kinds of scenarios you don't like fielding? Okay, so two questions,
*  two meta questions about the AMA process itself. So thank you, Sandro. It's a good way to get your
*  question chosen by first saying how amazing the podcast is. That's always a very, it's a strategy
*  worth trying. Let's just put it that way. I think that I'm impressed by the quality of questions,
*  by both their variety, they're not the same things over and over again, and by the depth. It's a fun
*  mix of different things. I like the trivial fun questions. And if I don't answer your trivial fun
*  question, it's not because I'm, you know, trying to diss you or anything like that. It's just
*  because I don't have a good fun answer to give you. That's all. So the process is, you know,
*  we're getting, I don't know, between 100 and 200 questions per AMA each month. And so I cut and
*  paste all of them from the Patreon post into a text file. And then I go through them all. And I
*  just read them and decide which ones I have a possibility of saying anything interesting about
*  and deleting the ones that I don't. And, you know, with a rough idea of how long the thing should be,
*  I think that the long term equilibrium here is between two and three hours for the length of
*  these. I can't do three and a half or four hour AMAs every month. I just don't have it in me.
*  But given that constraint, you know, and so it does take some time to do that. It takes a few hours
*  not. I mean, the copy and pasting is easy, but reading them all, grouping questions that belong
*  together, putting them in a sensible order, thinking about what my answers are going to be,
*  that takes a few hours. Then recording is pretty easy. You know, look, I'm not writing out answers.
*  I'm just, you know, talking off the spur of the moment, given that I've answered, I've read the
*  question ahead of time, but otherwise there's no preparation or anything like that. As I also say
*  in the AMA instructions, I'm not going to answer questions that involve me doing homework. So
*  there's not that much extra effort. It's the amount of time to record is the length of the
*  episode plus, I don't know, half an hour, you know, just for, because there will be some interruptions,
*  the phone rings, whatever. I have to do a little bit of editing, noise reduction in audacity and
*  things like that. And then posting is another, you know, I don't know, at most 20 minutes or something
*  like that. So I mean, that, that had gotten down to a science. Otherwise I could not keep doing
*  Mindscape on a regular basis. If I, if I didn't get the recording, editing, posting down to a
*  pretty efficient system, then I would not be able to work very efficiently. So, you know, all in all
*  between recording and editing and things like that, and then choosing the questions, it's not a full
*  day's work, but on that order, roughly speaking. Frank says, what are the special relativity puzzles
*  paradoxes? Why not? Well, you know, part of it is because there's not a lot of intellectual progress
*  made in talking about special relativity puzzles and paradoxes. I completely recognize that there's
*  plenty of people out there who are not experts in special relativity and for whom these questions
*  are endlessly fascinating. I get it. But I don't actually think of my own role or the parts of this
*  role that I enjoy the most as being a physics professor. You know, I like being a physics
*  professor, but I do that already. I want to move the frontier of knowledge forward, not just clean
*  up the frontier of knowledge in the regime we're already in. So special relativity puzzles and
*  paradoxes are not, I mean, it's not a real puzzle or a real paradox. It's just that we don't
*  understand it because we're so used to speaking in ordinary pre-relativistic language of taking
*  space and time as separate things. I mean, as soon as you say, I have a rod that is one meter long,
*  boom, you're already not thinking relativistically because real rods are not one-dimensional things.
*  They're four-dimensional world volumes, right? And you've already cheated by saying I have a
*  rod one meter long. As soon as you start thinking in space-time terms from the start, most of these
*  special relativity puzzles and paradoxes just evaporate. And that's a journey we all got to go
*  on on our own. And it's just sort of like a little redundant and not new and fun for me to go over
*  that. This is not Quora or Reddit or something like that. This is not a, you know, let's solve
*  our favorite physics puzzle kind of thing. I have immense respect and appreciation for that kind of
*  activity. It's just not what I'm interested in doing here. Benjamin Zand says, does the
*  coordinate system we choose for the metric in general relativity tell us something about the
*  location of the observer? For example, where is the observer in the original coordinate system used
*  in the Schwarzschild metric? No. Coordinate systems have nothing to do with observers. And again,
*  this is something where I just talked about the intellectual transition from Newtonian space-time
*  to special relativity. Here's a transition from special relativity to general relativity.
*  In special relativity, you know, it's called relativity because different observers measure
*  different things, okay? And it's all okay. The real physical stuff is invariant, but different
*  observers measure different amounts of elapsed time between different events and things like that.
*  But there's still a very simple space-time that you're in, Minkowski space, that has a lot of
*  symmetries. And so this idea that an observer can construct a coordinate system by sort of
*  sending out signals all around and, you know, building a little system of rods and clocks is
*  still perfectly valid in special relativity. In general relativity, it's just not. You just generally
*  can't do that. You can send out two light signals and they could intersect at some point in the
*  future or whatever. Or there's a great deal of arbitrariness in how you might imagine doing that.
*  So it never was true, even in special relativity, even in Newtonian mechanics, that there was some
*  relationship between observers and coordinate systems. But for certain approximations in
*  certain circumstances, it made sense to act as if it were true. So we're always talking about the
*  reference frame associated with an observer. And there's a kind of complicated construction that
*  is in the back of your mind when you say that. In general relativity, that's just no longer a useful
*  thing. So we're more honest. In general relativity, we just say you have a coordinate system and you
*  also have maybe observers and they have nothing necessarily to do with each other. In particular,
*  if there's multiple observers, they're all going to be moving in different places in the coordinate
*  system. So no, the origin of the coordinate system shouldn't in any way be associated with
*  an observer in any particular relationship. Tara Lumagi says, are there mathematical objections
*  to super determinism as opposed to just philosophical ones? So Tara, I'm going to apologize
*  ahead of time. I'm going to use your question, not really to answer it, but to make a point.
*  And the reason why I'm not going to answer it is because I don't know, I don't really know
*  what the objections to super determinism are. Well, I don't, sorry, I don't know if there are
*  mathematical ones in particular. There could be. So I mean, I imagine that what you would mean by
*  that is that there's some inconsistency or some mathematical hurdle or objection you have to
*  overcome to write down a fully coherent and consistent theory of super determinism.
*  And maybe there's some obstacle to doing that. And the reason why I don't know, and I don't,
*  I think it's okay for me not to know, is I'm not really, I don't pretend to be an expert in
*  foundations of quantum mechanics as a field. That might sound weird because I write a lot of papers
*  in the foundations of quantum mechanics. But my angle within that field is I think that the many
*  worlds interpretation is right. And I think that given that many worlds interpretation is right,
*  there's still lots of foundational questions left to be answered about probabilities and structure
*  and all sorts of ontological, metaphysical and epistemological questions. There's a full
*  employment for a whole bunch of people to work in that field. But I'm not actually paying attention
*  to the discussion around other interpretations of quantum mechanics or formulations thereof.
*  And as I'm always very quick to say, this is a bet that I make how to spend my time and it could
*  be completely wrong. I could be wrong. I don't think I'm wrong, but it's very, very possible.
*  I'm not being absolute or certain about it. But we always have to do this in any
*  endeavor that involves spending time on something intellectual, trying to understand how things go,
*  you have to take some things as, all right, I'm going to assume this is right. And I'm going to
*  build on that. If every single academic, whenever they did a research project, started with zero
*  assumptions, and I'm not Tara, I'm not saying that you're saying anything like this. I'm just
*  giving my background feeling about it. But you would never make any progress, right? If you always
*  said, well, let's not assume that we know what the foundations of quantum mechanics are. That's a
*  perfectly valid thing that there are people who are experts really in the foundations of quantum
*  mechanics as a field. And they can tell you the relative differences between the pros and cons of
*  pilot wave theories and epistemic theories and many worlds and all these things, super determinism.
*  I just, I just am not spending time trying to do that. And I don't make assumptions about other
*  things that other people think are perfectly settled. You know, I think that inflationary
*  cosmology might be right. But I don't think it's a 95% chance. I think that the chance that
*  inflation is right is substantially less than the chance that many worlds is right. Many other
*  physicists would flip that and put it the other way around. But there you go. You have different
*  people with different opinions. That's how you make progress. So I don't really know the answer to
*  your question, Tara. Sorry about that. But I'm letting you know why I don't know it.
*  Brad Malt says, How is it possible that we were able to observe the cosmic microwave
*  background? It has had 13.4 billion years to travel to us. But with the expansion of space,
*  aren't we more than 13.4 billion light years away? So there's a simple answer to this and a
*  complicated answer. The simple answer is the cosmic microwave background doesn't come from
*  some location in space. It comes from everywhere in space, right? It is what was happening
*  everywhere in the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang. The universe was recombining the
*  electrons and protons were joining back together. So from everywhere, there was light being given
*  off, there was radiation being given off. And so if you start today and trace light cones backward,
*  doesn't matter where we are, doesn't matter how old the universe is, you will always reach a point
*  in the past that was glowing, okay, at the recombination surface at the surface of less
*  scattering. And that will be sending light to us that we can observe. Okay, so that's the simple
*  answer. But the reason why I want to answer this question is because there is a more subtle thing
*  here about we being more than 13.4 billion light years away. It's again, it's relevant to this
*  question of our intuition, Newtonian versus special relativity versus general relativity.
*  What does it mean when you say we're more than 13.4 billion light years away when you're in an
*  expanding universe? Okay, what they mean by that, people say that and it's true. And what they mean
*  by it is if you could extend a line through a space like surface of the universe, you know,
*  in other words, through a surface of constant time since the Big Bang, and you extended it out to
*  the point where the thing that we see in the microwave background that that atom that we see
*  emitting at the microwave background is now sitting that distance along a space like surface
*  is more than 13.4 billion light years because the universe has been expanding. At the moment when
*  the light was emitted, that the analogous distance between where we would have been and where that
*  atom was actually emitting is much less than 13.4 billion light years away. So that's because there's
*  not really any good such thing as the distance between two different observers in an expanding
*  universe. There's different distances that you can draw at different times. So you just have to like
*  not think that that quantity is important. You know, you can measure it, you can define it,
*  you can't even measure it. Sorry, you can't measure it, but you can calculate what it would be. But
*  kind of who cares? So if you have some reason to do that, fine. But it's not a quantity that has any
*  essential meaning to us. The distance between two points on a space like surface defined in some
*  particular way. Okay. What matters in relativity are light cones. Those really exist, right? You
*  can trace back the path of light and everyone agrees on that. That's not relevant or relative
*  to some observer, some coordinate system, some slicing of space time or anything like that.
*  And so the robust statement is starting from us here and now trace backward in time on light
*  cones. You will hit the surface of last scattering somewhere. That is the cosmic
*  microwave background that we observe. When a group two questions together, one is from Ken Wolf,
*  who says, if the simulation hypothesis posits that we can never tell for certain that we are not in
*  a simulation, then is an assertion that either we are or not just a statement of faith? Is there
*  anything that differentiates this from statements of theology? And then Noble Gas says, I was
*  surprised at how seriously Chalmers in his recent book takes the idea that we were living in a
*  simulation. To me, this idea seems to recreate theism from a technological standpoint. Do you
*  see it this way as well? And as someone who stood against theism, does the growing acceptance of
*  the simulation idea in philosophy circles bother you? So for those of you who don't know, David
*  Chalmers, former Mindscape guest, recently came out with a book, Reality Plus, where he really,
*  really takes seriously the idea that we could be living in a simulation. And his major
*  goal in that book to boil, it's a wonderful book. I very much encourage you buying it. He's really
*  just a terrific writer. And this is the, I mean, of all the books he's written, this is the one that
*  is most aimed at a non-expert audience. It's still full of full strength philosophical arguments,
*  but it doesn't assume a lot of the linguistic background that experts would have. So it's very,
*  very readable. But his primary concern is not to argue that we do live in a simulation, but to ask
*  if we do, is what we're experiencing still real, right? And as a good poetic naturalist should do,
*  I don't think he's a poetic naturalist, but he says, sure, it's real. I mean, it's as real as
*  anything else. So that's his main philosophical point that he's trying to make. Okay. So both of
*  these questions here from Ken and from Noble are saying, doesn't this smack of theism and the
*  existence of God somehow? And amusingly, if you read the book, Chalmers says, I'm a really good
*  atheist, but this whole simulation argument thing has made me rethink that because in some sense,
*  if we do live in a simulation, it is like having God. It's not the same kind of God as the
*  traditional theological Christian God, but some higher being that actually wrote us up in their
*  little computer simulation somehow. So look, I don't care if it is theological or not. I care
*  if it's true, right? And the same thing goes for theology. I mean, when you say that I am not
*  theistic or I don't like theology, it's not that I sort of have objections to contemplating the
*  possibility. It's that I have contemplated the possibility and I don't think that the evidence
*  supports that hypothesis. I'm perfectly happy with other people also contemplating the possibility,
*  and also I could be wrong, right? New evidence could come in and convince me that I'm wrong.
*  I think that I do, my hackles get raised a little bit whenever people compare a certain idea to
*  theology as a way of dismissing it via guilt by association, right? Don't tell me whether
*  something is like theology. Tell me if it's right or wrong. What is your argument for or against it?
*  I once gave a talk, you can find it online. It's actually gotten quite a few views. I gave a talk
*  at an Oxford conference on cosmology and theology, I think. And so I gave the talk with the title,
*  God is not a good theory. And the whole point of the talk was to say that we can use all of the
*  usual ways of evaluating scientific theories about the world to evaluate theism, okay?
*  But there was a typo in the conference program where my talk was entitled, God is not a theory
*  rather than God is not a good theory. So that ended up being the exact opposite of my point.
*  My point is that theism, the simulation argument, the multiverse, many worlds, all of these things,
*  these are perfectly legitimate scientific ideas and you should judge them, okay? You should not
*  dismiss them by using dirty words against them. Now, when it comes specifically to the simulation
*  argument, I try to do this. I try to judge it as an argument and I say, I try to be a good Bayesian,
*  as I said before, Bayesian epistemology. I try to say like, what would I expect the universe to look
*  like if we lived in a simulation? And I try to compare it to what the universe looks like.
*  And to me, the world that we observe around us does not look like it would if we lived in a
*  simulation. And this is the crucial Bayesian point, which is that it's not that we look at the world.
*  And again, this is exactly analogous to what you would say about theology. So in that case,
*  the analogy is pretty good. It's not that you look at the world and say, can I explain this
*  by positing the existence of God or positing the existence of a simulation? That's not the
*  right move. The right move is to say, let's imagine that we are comparing our expectations
*  from a purely naturalistic self-contained universe versus a theistic universe versus a simulation.
*  What would I expect in each of those cases? So it's not sufficient to say, I can explain the world.
*  I want the theory to explain what I do see about the world, to say that, oh, yes, this is exactly
*  what I would have expected. And it's not what I would have expected. As I've said before,
*  the resolution in terms of pixels of our universe, as far as we know, it's infinite, we have no idea,
*  but it's certainly really, really, really good, way, way better than it would need to be for any
*  simulation. I see no reason why a simulator would want to cook up a universe like ours. That's not
*  to say they couldn't. But if I'm being a good Bayesian, what I'm supposed to ask is, is this
*  what I expect? And it is not. Marion Markali says, I was thinking how entropy is increasing,
*  but knowledge and complexity seems to be increasing in lockstep as a function of the
*  self-referential nature of the universe. So in computational terms, the universe and therefore
*  humans can abstract anything to create new computational primitives or objects ad infinitum.
*  Girdles and Turing's observations can therefore be considered the primary and most important feature
*  and not a bug at all. So I don't know whether Girdles and Turing's observations, and for that
*  matter Tarski, I would throw him in there also. I don't know whether they should be features or
*  bugs. They seem to be true facts about mathematical logic. I'm not, and then also not quite sure
*  when you say the universe and therefore humans can abstract anything to create new computational
*  primitives ad infinitum. I'm not quite sure I'd want to go that far either. I mean, it's the ad
*  infinitum that worries me there. I do think, and I've said this before, and I'm not an expert at
*  it so you shouldn't take my word for it, but I do believe that there is this kind of phase transition
*  in reasoning, in cognitive capacity, when a brain or an information processing system of some sort
*  gains enough capacity to be a Turing machine, right, to run any sort of Turing available
*  computer program that you might want to run. And as Turing showed, this is a lot of computation,
*  essentially all the computations you would ever want to do. There are limitations on what such
*  computations can do, like the halting problem. You cannot prove that a certain computer program
*  will halt, et cetera, et cetera. But in the world of computations, there's a universality class that
*  all computers of a certain strength can do all the computations. Now, there's still computations
*  we can't do. That's why I'm a little bit averse to the ad infinitum at the end of your sentence,
*  Marion, because we have finite resources in space and in time, and there's some computations that
*  are literally impossible to do, like the halting problem, for example. So I think I know what
*  you're saying, but I would just sort of edit that a little bit with the ad infinitum there.
*  And the other thing that I'm not quite sure about is you say,
*  entropy is increasing, but knowledge and complexity seem to be increasing in lockstep.
*  That I just think is not true. If I take a book and I burn it, entropy is increased,
*  but knowledge is not increased. Information, you know, good old accessible information or
*  complexity has not increased in any way. I think the reality is that entropy is increasing,
*  complexity information kind of come and go, right? You know, there's pockets of them and
*  they can disappear and there's no law of nature that says that those things must increase in the
*  same way that entropy is going to increase. So I think the relationship there is a little bit more
*  delicate and nuanced, and I think that, you know, it's a little bit too quick, a little bit too
*  glib to just attach them to each other in some correspondence. We need to think harder about what
*  the relationships are there. Deepthi Amarasuriya says, if you could redesign the familiar format
*  of the undergraduate physics curriculum, what changes would you implement in the content
*  delivery and assessment? You know, I don't have a great set of answers to this because I have not
*  been teaching undergraduate physics for a while. I taught one undergraduate course in the last 15
*  years, one quarter of one course. So one quarter in the sense of, you know, one term in the quarter
*  system that we have at Caltech. So I'm not an expert in all of the details there. You know,
*  I have certain vague feelings. I do think that as with any curriculum, the curriculum in physics
*  tends to lag behind the times a little bit, right? Usually the curriculum that we teach now is what
*  we really needed to be teaching 30 years ago and not what we need to be teaching now or 30 years
*  in the future. The obvious example here is how we teach quantum mechanics, and that's what's motivated
*  me to think about writing a quantum mechanics textbook, things like quantum information,
*  decoherence, entanglement, quantum computing are not mentioned in a lot of undergraduate quantum
*  textbooks and there's no good reason for that, whereas we beat to death perturbation theory and
*  Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and a whole bunch of things. So that one course I think could be
*  improved by quite a lot. The curriculum as a whole, you know, I think that there's a lot of,
*  certainly, you know, there's a lot of smart undergraduates who are zooming through
*  the curriculum that I had when I was an undergraduate so that they're like taking
*  string theory in their senior year or whatever. They've already taken quantum field theory in
*  their junior year, which seems dizzyingly fast to me. There's no reason why general relativity
*  should not be part of the undergraduate curriculum, maybe not as a required course,
*  but I would like to see it at least be optional for everyone. I did introduce undergraduate GR
*  course at University of Chicago and that was very, very popular. It's a very, very accessible subject
*  for undergraduates. There's no reason not to teach it. I think the first year is always the
*  crucial one, right? And I do, it kind of depresses me that the first year for many physics students
*  has a kind of weed out the weak feeling to it, which I don't like. Maybe there's a better way
*  to do it than that, but honestly, I don't know what the better way is given constraints of
*  resources and numbers and things like that. So I don't have any good suggestions there.
*  I do wish that we could, well, I mean, let me be specific about this. For physics majors,
*  you have to just go through a lot of drudgery in the early days of your physics curriculum,
*  right? You need to learn the inclined planes and the electrical circuits and that stuff. That is
*  important. And so it takes time before you can get to the fun stuff of relativity and quantum
*  mechanics and stat mech or what have you. So I don't think you should actually sort of put
*  relativity or quantum mechanics in the first semester of your first undergraduate course,
*  but maybe there is some way to get first year undergraduates acquainted with some of the
*  research being done in the department. Whatever that is, like little seminars or a one credit
*  course or something like that. And a lot of places do this. I just think it should be a regular thing.
*  Let's make sure that people are excited by the prospects of doing this research themselves.
*  For people who are not going to be physics majors, I think we do them a dramatic disservice by
*  very often just offering them a course that is a watered down version of the course we offer
*  to physics majors, right? If you're not going to be a physics major, then why not learn a little
*  bit about relativity and quantum mechanics? You don't need to learn about circuits and inclined
*  planes necessarily. Maybe a little bit of that is useful too, but I think the purpose is completely
*  different if you're just trying to teach people physics for the sake of physics rather than
*  teaching them for the sake of a prerequisite that will be useful when they get to other physics
*  later on. I don't know. Those are not very coherent thoughts, but those are the thoughts
*  that I have right now. Peter Benham says, is there one set of quantum fields to house all the many
*  worlds or does each one have its own? I have no idea what the words to house mean in this case.
*  Fields live in space-time. Forget about quantum mechanics for a second. We have space-time and
*  at every point in space-time, there's a set of fields, a value of the electron field and the
*  gluon field and the gravitational field and so forth. In many worlds, there's a set of worlds
*  and each world has its own space-time and its own quantum fields. The fields are in the worlds,
*  not the other way around. Space-time is in the worlds, not the other way around. That's why you
*  can't say where other worlds are located. There is no space in which they exist.
*  There's a separate question as to whether or not it's the same set of fields in all of many worlds.
*  Let's put it this way. In the simplest versions of many worlds, without thinking too hard,
*  it's exactly the same quantum fields and laws of physics in all the worlds.
*  I do think it is possible to have slightly more sophisticated versions,
*  but I don't think that's a necessary part of the theory.
*  Jim Murphy says, what's your view on how pornography affects society, especially in its
*  modern, highly accessible form? Do you see it as dangerous? Well, it's a tricky question. I mean,
*  it's dangerous, but in the same way that many things are dangerous. Pornography is dangerous
*  in the same way that driving cars is dangerous or drinking alcohol is dangerous. They can be
*  misused and cause a lot of deaths. I think the number of deaths caused by cars and alcohol is
*  probably way bigger than the number of deaths caused by pornography. Yet, they are perfectly
*  allowed and very easily accessible. I do think that, I mean, maybe I'm not an expert on this,
*  the psychology here, so I probably should say nothing. My vague feeling is that there's some
*  sense in which pornography can be addictive in a way that alcohol can be addictive. Again,
*  that doesn't mean we ban alcohol. We just try to give people, number one, the freedom to choose
*  and hope that they make the right choice, and number two, hope that they use it responsibly,
*  and number three, some resources if they do get addicted to it. I wish that society did all those
*  things anyway. It doesn't always measure up to those hopes, but that would be my hope.
*  Do I see it as dangerous? It depends on what you mean by dangerous. I mean, I guess there's a
*  potential danger in the sense that people become immersed in pornography and lose the ability to
*  connect with regular human beings in the same way. That doesn't sound like a huge worry to me,
*  and even if it were, I still think that there is an individual choice that I would err on the side of,
*  but I'm not an expert, so maybe there's some deeper worry there that I don't know about.
*  The other set of dangers, which has been well talked about, is of course,
*  it gives people a degraded image of women. When we talk about pornography, it's usually men looking
*  at pornography of women, and that can have all sorts of effects on how they think about women
*  more generally. This was a bigger deal, something that was talked about a lot more, I guess, probably
*  in the 80s than it is today, but it's still out there. I think that this is a case where
*  it would be important to separate the symptoms from the real problem. I think that if we lived
*  in a society where women were treated more equably from the start, then you could very easily imagine
*  non-deleterious forms of pornography, they'll be perfectly okay. In other words, I don't think it's
*  the pornography that is the trouble. The problem is that women are not treated equably or thought
*  equably in our society. That's the real fundamental problem. I would not put a band-aid on pornography
*  and claim victory there. I think that's not really the way forward. Saad Ahmed says,
*  have you ever been taken by feelings of nationalism or patriotism in the past or now, I suppose?
*  I guess probably no is the short answer, if I'm trying to guess what you mean by that. I might
*  root for the dream team, the US basketball team in the Olympics when they were the dream team,
*  back when Michael Jordan and Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were playing for them.
*  These days, I don't care as much about the Olympics one way or the other, but sports and things like
*  that are completely harmless or almost completely harmless versions of nationalism or patriotism.
*  I think that the US is a big complicated country with a big complicated history.
*  My version of patriotism is to both appreciate the good aspects of its current existence and
*  its history and very much appreciate its bad aspects as well. I'm very much against whitewashing
*  the bad aspects of our history. I think that teaching how horrible we have treated the rest
*  of the world is really, really important. I think that's part of the ability to do that,
*  to the extent there is such an ability, is part of what makes a country strong. You should do that.
*  Different countries have different success rates at doing that. I think the United States is kind
*  of mediocre at that. The US does tend to perceive itself. The average American, if that's even a
*  sensible concept, is way more sanguine about America doing bad things to the rest of the world
*  than they should be either currently or in the past. I can still appreciate the values that the
*  United States was founded on. By that, I mean the sort of aspirational values, not the reality of
*  what was going on back in the 18th century because that was obviously very messy and compromised.
*  But I can accept that and at the same time think that the people who started up the United States
*  were on to something good when they thought that the authority of a government comes from its people,
*  not from God or from someone having more power than anybody else. We had a long road that is
*  nowhere near finished yet to actually achieve that ideal. But I think that's a good thing.
*  Something that's perfectly okay to be proud of, realizing that we were not the first,
*  we're not the best, but it is something we did right. I'm not out there waving the flag or
*  anything like that, but I think the nuanced view of the history of a country is an important thing.
*  This is not the United States, so it's not quite à propos, but there's this wonderful meme that
*  has gone around for years of how people in the UK view the UK and how people outside the UK view
*  the UK. Inside, it's like this cute little bulldog puppy and outside, it's like this terrible
*  ravenous wolf. The United Kingdom, England and Great Britain, they've invaded everywhere.
*  If you ask them, they're like, just bring in civilization everywhere. Shouldn't they be
*  thankful? I don't think that big powerful countries bringing civilization elsewhere has really been
*  as successful from the point of view of the people whose civilization is apparently being
*  imposed upon them as the imposers would like to believe. So this is all very complicated stuff.
*  I think that again, simplifying it is the one bad thing that you can, oversimplifying it is the one
*  big mistake you can make. Justin Bailey says, I used to see you quoted in New Scientist often for
*  various cosmology related articles. How did you get on the list of scientists to call? Do reporters
*  just cold call you? Yeah, there's no magic bullet or special procedure to get called by reporters.
*  It depends on the situation and it usually sort of accumulates over time, right? Sometimes you
*  meet reporters at conferences, APS meetings, AAAS meetings, AAAS meetings or what have you.
*  Sometimes reporters go to meetings like that and meet scientists and then get to know them.
*  Sometimes the scientist has done some work that is associated with a press release and therefore
*  they get known that way. Or sometimes the scientist just has a public presence,
*  blogging, Twitter these days, whatever, writing popular articles. There's various ways that a
*  journalist might get to know the name of a scientist. And then the journalist is going
*  to very, very naturally have their favorite scientists to talk to. Scientists are not all
*  equally adept at explaining science to a wider audience or speaking in non-jargon terms or even
*  the slightly more subtle skill of providing a juicy quote, right? A quote that is both accurate
*  but also makes things sound exciting rather than boring. Now ideally a journalist will try to
*  spread the wealth, right? They will try to talk to various people, different people for different
*  articles, different kinds of diversity along various axes. But you know, life is short,
*  you don't always get there. Sometimes you just want that juicy quote and you go for the same
*  person over and over again. And a related question here, Scott Lewicki says, I'm going to relate this
*  even though it's not obviously related. Frequently in your episodes you will reference a previous
*  Mindscape podcast guest when talking to the current guest. There's often some great discussion that
*  comes from this comparing or contrasting the views of more than one guest. Have you considered
*  inviting back two or more previous guests and creating a panel discussion that you could
*  facilitate? If so, which guests would you bring together and what would be the theme? So you know,
*  I've considered things like that. So but as you'll notice, I have informally instituted a policy
*  where I do not repeat guests other than myself. That's a special dispensation for solo episodes,
*  right? But other than that, I never have the same guest on twice. And a number of previous guests
*  have asked to come on. In fact, people who I think would make great repeat guests. But this is
*  something I thought about quite a bit. And I've decided that the value added by with, you know,
*  this goes back to the previous question, the value added just by forcing myself to spread out and not
*  just have the usual suspects over and over again, is more than the value added that I would get by
*  having a favorite set of guests and going back to them over and over. This is not to say that
*  there are not very real benefits of having a favorite set of guests going to them over and
*  over again. There's a sort of institutional memory that gets built up from previous discussions,
*  you know, ahead of time, the person is going to have good things to say, etc, etc. But I do think
*  that, you know, a lot of people do that, right? A lot of podcasts have their favorite guests,
*  they go back to again and again, I do try to be different, try to differentiate in some ways.
*  And part of the spirit of mindscape, as I see it, is really about exploring the ideas, right? It's
*  not about our favorite set of personalities to interact with. And again, this makes it a
*  slightly quirky thing. So if you want me to spin it this way, you the audience for mindscape are
*  an elite group. You are willing to listen to a bunch of episodes that are driven, not primarily
*  by the fact that you've already heard of the guest before. I suspect that for most people listening,
*  many of the episodes, most of the episodes, I don't know, are with people you've never heard
*  of before. But you would like to listen to this episode just because the topic is good, or even
*  maybe the topic doesn't naturally appeal to you. But you have an assumption that there's some
*  reason why I picked that person, there must be something worthwhile. And of course, I usually do
*  have reasons why I picked the people, they don't always work out, you know, most of my guests,
*  I think are very, very good. But there is certainly a spectrum of success. But you got to do the
*  experiment, right? You have to try different things. There's a comfort to going to the same restaurant
*  every Wednesday and ordering the same thing. But then you might miss some things elsewhere on the
*  menu or at other restaurants. And given my own personal preferences, I tend to want to be more
*  experimental. And given that plenty of other podcasts do it differently, this is one way to be
*  different. So reluctantly, in some cases, I've stuck with the policy of not inviting guests back.
*  Now, I make no promises that I will continue to stick to that policy. And part of it is also
*  there's a rich get richer kind of thing, right? You know, the kind of people you invite back or
*  people who are like smooth talkers who are good on podcasts, and those people get to talk plenty
*  of places, they don't really need mindscape all the time. And sometimes I have people on the podcast
*  who are less naturally good at talking, but still have interesting things to say. So I think it's
*  important to get to those people, you know, that no matter how wonderful a person is, and no matter
*  how much you love listening to them, there was always a time when you had never heard of them
*  before. There was always a first time when you heard of them. So I think that the possibility
*  that the next episode is going to be some brilliant magical person who you've never heard of before
*  is a big thing that I try to keep alive, which would be less likely if I had the same people
*  over and over again. Now, that's not exactly what you said. I mean, Scott, you're asking about having
*  panel discussions with previous guests, things like that. You know, I've thought about lots of
*  things. I've thought about having a conference, right, where you get people in previous guests
*  in the same place in the real world back when we would get together in the real world.
*  I guess most of mindscape's existence now has been in a pandemic, hasn't it?
*  Maybe that's not exactly true, but it's getting there. And I thought of having, you know, different
*  formats for different episodes with different numbers of guests and things like that.
*  You know, it's all number one, it's more work. Because as I said, I have the current system down
*  to more or less a machine that I can get it over with pretty quickly. There is a lot of, you know,
*  behind the scenes time that it takes to schedule to get people microphones to get the transcripts
*  done, all that stuff. And it becomes exponentially more complicated when there's more than one person
*  at a time involved. So I haven't really come up with a great way to expand the format that would
*  not be way more work for me with any obvious tangible benefit. If the benefit were huge,
*  then maybe I would do it. But you know, especially because many of these are on, are remote, right,
*  many of these interviews and having multiple guests is even harder when you're doing things
*  remotely. You know, we don't see each other as well as harder to interrupt and to ask questions
*  in real time. So I'm not leaning toward doing that at this time, but I do keep the possibility
*  open. And I'm certainly open to suggestions about how to be creative with the format.
*  Andre Dinu says, you explained in the past that the state of the universe could be described by
*  a vector in a Hilbert space. The evolution of the universe is equivalent to the trajectory of this
*  vector in Hilbert space. However, the state of a system with variable number of identical particles
*  is described by a vector in Fox space, which is the direct sum of several Hilbert spaces.
*  How is this last space called? And why do you not refer to this space when you think about the
*  universe as a whole? There's a lot going on here. This is a technical level question, but I think
*  it's interesting enough to the broader audience that I thought it was worth talking about. The
*  point is that when you do quantum field theory, one of the reasons why quantum field theory is so
*  cool is because even though when you quantize a single non-interacting field, what you get is a
*  set of particles with a definite number of particles or some superposition of different
*  numbers of particles. But when you let the field interact with itself or with others,
*  that number of particles can change. So whenever you have a situation where particles are created
*  or destroyed through interactions, field theory is a way to sort of summarize what's going on there.
*  And one way of thinking about that is to construct what is called Fox space, which is to say
*  there's a part of Hilbert space where there are no particles, the vacuum, okay, empty space. Then
*  there is the one particle Hilbert space. So you excite the field just enough to have exactly one
*  particle. And that particle can be doing different things. It has a wave function, has all the
*  different infinite number of possible wave functions. Then there's another part of Hilbert
*  space that has two particles, okay, and all the way up. And then you add those all together because
*  the wave function for the quantum field will be a superposition of zero particles, one particle,
*  two particle, et cetera. And that sum is called Fox space, F-O-C-K, after Vladimir Fok, the Russian
*  physicist and mathematician. So two things to say here. One is Fox space is still a Hilbert space.
*  It's not a different kind of thing. It's a particular kind of Hilbert space that you construct
*  by adding together these individual Hilbert subspaces, but it's still Hilbert space. So
*  it's still perfectly okay to call it Hilbert space. Secondly, thinking of field theory in terms of
*  particles is not completely comprehensive. It doesn't always work. It works when you can think
*  safely about tiny perturbations in the field, right? Tiny fluctuations look like particles.
*  So that generally refers to the perturbative regime of the particle, of the field theory,
*  where you can just start with the vacuum and then perturb it by adding a particle or two,
*  watching them interact. In more general circumstances, like when the Higgs field
*  just smoothly evolves from zero to its expectation value in empty space, you cannot easily describe
*  that in terms of particles at all. So the Fox space description is just not very helpful.
*  So Fox space is a specific kind of Hilbert space that is only relevant in specific circumstances.
*  It's not a more general concept. Jonathan Goodson says, when you were a member of the World Science
*  Symposium, World Science Festival Symposium on Quantum Mechanics, the moderator asked the panel,
*  will the scientific community reach a consensus within the next 100 years? As I recall, the other
*  participants said yes, but when it was your turn, you opined the consensus will be achieved within
*  50 years. What was your thinking giving that response? And was it anything more than confidence
*  in MWI and the ultimate competency of your peers? I mean, part of it, just to be slightly flippant
*  about it, is that 50 years is my go-to amount of time to make predictions because I will probably
*  be dead. I'm not sure. Maybe I'll get lucky. But at least it's a period of time when I cannot be
*  held responsible with whether I was right or wrong. So it's a good number to pick. But also, yes,
*  I am kind of optimistic that we are making progress on the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  Like I said, I specifically think that many worlds is going to be the right answer. But even if it's
*  not, I still think we're making progress. I still think that we have a lot more IQ points worldwide
*  trained on the problem of understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics than we have
*  in previous decades. And I don't think it's an intractable problem either. So I think that there
*  will be a consensus about it sooner rather than later. David Harrington asks a priority question.
*  Remember, to those of you who are new, priority questions are questions you're allowed to ask
*  once in your life. And you can drop them into the AMAs on Patreon. And I promise I will answer them.
*  I don't promise I will give you a satisfactory answer, but I will definitely answer them one way
*  or the other. So choose your priority questions wisely because you're on your honor to only ask
*  one ever in your life. And David says, I have since reading Lee Smolin's book on universes from
*  black holes been bugged by a simple question. Where does the energy come from? In Smolin's
*  hypothesis, a black hole of only a few solar masses would create a full fledged universe.
*  Where does all that extra energy come from? The short answer is that the energy of the universe
*  is zero, at least in this model. This is just a fact of general relativity that in a closed
*  universe, in a universe whose spatial slices are something like a sphere or a torus or something
*  like that, the total energy is zero, which you can roughly informally but not precisely
*  think about as saying that there is a positive contribution from the energy of matter,
*  from stuff, you know, matter, radiation, dark energy, what have you, and a negative contribution
*  from the energy of the gravitational field, the curvature of space time. That's a rough informal
*  thing. I mean, really, what you should think of is we're talking about cosmology in the whole
*  universe. There's no reason at all that your intuitive notions of energy should even apply
*  in this case. But at a formal mathematical level, there is a quantity that is conserved
*  in general relativity, which looks energy like, and for a closed universe, it is exactly zero.
*  So even more formally than that, the point is that you can in general relativity, quantum gravity
*  rather, you can imagine bubbling off a baby universe, as I've written about in my paper with
*  Jennifer Chen and Ellen Guth and Eddie Fari and others wrote about years ago, in a way that costs
*  exactly nothing because it has zero conserved quantities. So not only zero energy total in this
*  universe, but zero angular momentum, zero electric charge, all of those things. So there's no obstacle
*  to having quantum processes that create as many of these as you want. That's sort of the secret at
*  the heart of the mechanism that Jennifer Chen and I proposed for making more and more entropy in
*  the universe. If you can make more and more universes, each one of them adds a little bit
*  to the entropy of the whole shebang, you can just increase entropy without bound.
*  Matt Rapoport says, it occurs to me that the act of observing or measuring a particle requires
*  hitting that particle with something like a photon, and then having the photon bounce back into a
*  detector. I'm wondering if the act of hitting the particle during an observation might change the
*  particle's properties such as its momentum. If you wanted to measure the particle's position with
*  increasing accuracy, you would want to use photons with smaller and smaller wavelengths, thus higher
*  and higher energies. Is this a reasonable way for a lay person such as myself to understand the
*  Heisenberg uncertainty principle? Well, I kind of want to say yes and no here. If you just want
*  sort of an intuitive answer in a way that it's kind of connects with your Newtonian feeling about the
*  world or your classical mechanics feeling about the world, yes, to measure the position of something
*  small requires a small wavelength requires a lot of energy. Therefore, you're going to have to kick
*  the particle a little bit. But if you're a little bit more careful, if you're a little bit more
*  trying to understand at a deeper level, that's not the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The
*  Heisenberg uncertainty principle has nothing to do with measurements or observations. I guess I
*  shouldn't say that it has implications for measurements and observations, but it's not
*  about measurements and observations. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a feature of the states
*  of particles, the states of any quantum system, whether or not they're observed.
*  In quantum mechanics, the momentum is related to the position in a complicated way because there
*  is no such thing as either momentum or position. There's a wave function. Momentum and position are
*  observables associated with that wave function, and they are what we call complementary observables.
*  What that means is that if you have a wave that is a wave function, if you try to compress that
*  wave in space, in position, so this very, very carefully localized around some particular point
*  in space, then the complementary feature of it, the momentum, gets spread out all over the place.
*  If you have a sine wave for position, wave function, you will have a delta function for momentum,
*  and vice versa. If you have a delta function for position, you have a sine wave for momentum,
*  and if you have a bell curve, something that is spread out but only a little bit,
*  then you can have that for both at once. These are all statements about the wave function of
*  the particle and how it has to be. It has nothing to do with measurements. Again, it has implications
*  for measurements, but it's not about measurements. Another way of thinking about it at a much simpler
*  level is just think about a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Forget about position and
*  momentum. Think about spin. Think about the spin in the z direction of some particle. It could be
*  spin up or spin down. Now, the tricky thing is you naturally think of spin up as pointing vertically
*  up and spin down as pointing vertically down, but in Hilbert space, in the space of all possible
*  quantum wave functions, these two possibilities are perpendicular. You are either spin up or spin
*  down or you're some combination, but they're orthogonal to each other. You'd make a plot of
*  spin up horizontally and spin down vertically or something like that, and that's all with respect
*  to the z direction. Then if you ask about spin in the x direction or y, which is let's pick one, pick x,
*  the x spin can be figured out in terms of the z spin, but the way to figure it out is that the axes
*  are rotated by 45 degrees. The spin up with respect to x-axis is tilted at 45 degrees with respect to
*  spin up and spin down in the z-axis. So what this means is if a particle has a spin that is in a pure
*  state of z spin, so it's either pure spin up or pure spin down, it can't also be in a pure state of
*  x spin. It's going to be an equal combination, an equal superposition of spin up and spin down
*  in the x direction just because the axes are tilted with respect to each other. It's a mathematical
*  fact not related to how we observe it or anything like that. That's the uncertainty principle.
*  Samuel Cohn says, I've heard you mention that the Hilbert space of the universe is large but finite
*  dimensional. How do you reconcile this with the commutation relation between the momentum and
*  position operators? It's an elementary exercise that in a finite dimensional space if the commutator
*  of two operators is a multiple of the identity then the commutator is zero. Yeah, that's true,
*  and just to be super duper careful here when I say things like the Hilbert space of the universe
*  is finite dimensional, that's a speculation. We don't know that for sure. We are saying that
*  we have good reason to believe that the Hilbert space of our observable part of the universe is
*  finite dimensional. It's not an absolute statement that we know the answer to. But as you might guess,
*  if you have a finite dimensional Hilbert space that dimensionality is really really big,
*  like 10 to the 10 to the 120 dimensions, that's pretty close to infinity for a lot of local
*  purposes. So you would be very very surprised if some you know persnickety mathematical fact
*  that distinguished between finite and infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces really mattered.
*  And indeed in a finite dimensional Hilbert space you can construct analogs of position and momentum
*  that are not exactly the same, but they have the same kind of commutator the position and momentum
*  do. And then you can take a limit as that number becomes really really big, the dimensionality of
*  Hilbert space, they become more and more like position and momentum. So in fact I did this
*  with Ashmeet Singh who was a student here at Caltech. We wrote a paper on doing exactly this,
*  and I will read you the title of the paper. Modeling position and momentum in finite
*  dimensional Hilbert spaces via generalized Pauli operators. Pretty good, huh? You asked a question
*  that I actually wrote a paper about. So you can go to the archive and look for that paper.
*  Modeling position momentum and finite dimensional Hilbert spaces via generalized Pauli operators.
*  So it can be done. I mean obviously I presume that you know a little physics here if you're
*  asking questions like that, so you should be able to read the paper and see what we have to say.
*  It was just a it was it came out in what 2020 not too long not too long ago. So there you go.
*  Anonymous says, do you have any advice for casually talking about academic or intellectual
*  interests and hobbies without coming across as bragging or trying to act superior? How would you
*  describe the middle way between heavily editing yourself to make people comfortable on one extreme
*  versus refusing a responsibility to read the room on a basic level on the other extreme? So I just
*  want to make this question a bit more general because I think that it's a question that's
*  nothing to do with intellectual interests or hobbies or acting superior. It's just a general
*  question about how do you talk about things you care about that the rest of the room may or may
*  not. If those things happen to be intellectual or whatever that's great and if they're not that's
*  also great. Maybe you like watching the rodeo, maybe you like knitting, and maybe no one else
*  who you're talking to does, or maybe they do and you don't know it. So I think that it's no different
*  than if you like knitting versus if you like quantum mechanics perfectly honestly. The ways
*  in which you might get a negative reaction differ in details. If you like knitting and someone is in
*  the whole room is full of macho people who would look down upon that they might be condescending
*  whereas if it's a full of a bunch of people who are anti-intellectual and you like quantum mechanics
*  then you might get defensiveness kind of reaction. But the general strategy is the same namely
*  on the one hand you should simultaneously be proud of your interests. You should not apologize for
*  them. You should be able to express enthusiasm for things you're enthusiastic about and at the
*  same time recognize that if other people aren't interested then this just isn't the room to talk
*  about that. You shouldn't force it on them whether it's knitting or quantum mechanics.
*  Some people are going to be interested some are not. Try to discover who those people are by you
*  know maybe mentioning that you're kind of interested in this stuff and if they're just not then move
*  on to something else and if you're unable to talk to them about other things if you're unable to
*  find any overlap between what you're interested in what they're interested in either then there's
*  some issue with you or more likely you're just in the wrong room and you should go to a room where
*  you can talk about stuff that you both agree are interesting. James Maddux says in the standard
*  model what is a mixing angle? They seem to determine strength of interactions and relate
*  closely to symmetry and unification but do they have a physical interpretation?
*  Yeah they do have a physical interpretation. So I mean I don't want to spend too much time because
*  again this is a technical physics question but basically think about quarks. You have the
*  positively charged quarks up charm and top. I may or may not get this right which is positive
*  and negative up charm top and then down strange and bottom the negatively charged quarks. And roughly
*  they're in pairs right up and down are a pair charm and strange are a pair top and bottom are
*  a pair. What does that mean? That means that the up quark when it interacts when either you know
*  transforms when it gives off a W boson so it changes its identity usually the up quark is
*  going to change into a down and the down is going to change into an up and vice versa but not all
*  the time. So the up quark is actually going to change into some linear combination of all the
*  negatively charged quarks. So you have an up quark which is charged plus two-thirds it gives off
*  a W plus right a positively charged W boson so it converts into a minus one-third charged quark
*  but it's not purely a down quark it's a combination of up sorry of down strange and bottom. There you
*  go and that which combination it is that's what the mixing angle is telling you this the precise
*  amount by which you get these different combinations. Same thing is true with neutrinos
*  and leptons and so forth. Roughly speaking this is all just saying that there are different
*  properties that quantum fields have and the properties don't always march in lockstep.
*  So in the neutrino world for example the important fact is that there are mass states okay there are
*  well I should say the other way around. You may have heard that in the world of neutrinos there
*  are electron neutrinos muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos and what that means is
*  these numbers are conserved. So when a tau lepton decays it's going to have to give off a tau
*  neutrino and then maybe like a muon and an anti-muon or something like that okay. No that can't be
*  right. To conserve charge if a tau decays it will have to spit off a mu a muon and then a an anti-mu
*  neutrino so muon number is conserved plus a tau neutrino so tau number is conserved.
*  Okay but what it turns out to be the case is that the states of definite mass are not purely
*  electron neutrinos muon neutrinos or tau neutrinos. They are mixed together and figuring out what
*  exactly that mixture is is a very high priority thing that we're trying to do in the world of
*  neutrino physics right now. Jake McNeil says Scott Aronson suggested that during a lecture
*  I attended that quantum computing might be a useful method of teaching core concepts of quantum
*  mechanics. Do you think that might be a good approach to introducing quantum mechanics
*  especially for those with more of a computer science background rather than a math and physics
*  background? You know it could be. My brain is thinking these days about teaching physics
*  students quantum mechanics so that's what I know and care the most about. For computer science
*  students it might be different. I mean there is a sense in which quantum computing is a generalization
*  of classical computing. You replace bits with qubits and and not gates etc with their quantum
*  gate equivalents and so forth and you have this whole new thing which is that states can be in
*  superpositions and then you have to read out the outcome with the measurement that collapses the
*  wave function but otherwise it is a generalization of the of the whole idea of bits and computing.
*  So you could teach things that way sure absolutely. You're never going to get to the hydrogen atom
*  that way though. You're never going to get to the simple harmonic oscillator or quantum tunneling
*  or a whole bunch of other interesting phenomena. So I think you know honestly my current thinking
*  is to be hybrid about it. You know given that I am interested in how to teach physics majors
*  I take that they come into it knowing some classical mechanics. They know a little bit about
*  positions and velocities or momenta of particles right. That's how they're trained to think a ball
*  rolling around in a potential on an inclined plane and the usual traditional way of doing quantum
*  pedagogy is to take that classical system and quantize it to replace positions and momenta
*  with wave functions and go on from there. I think that's fine. I think it's a good thing to do but
*  you instantly get into difficulties or at least sticky wickets mathematically speaking because the
*  Hilbert space of a single particle is infinite dimensional and infinity is harder than two.
*  A qubit has a two-dimensional Hilbert space which is a lot easier to deal with. So conceptually
*  qubits are a lot easier way to introduce quantum mechanics. The problem with them is they don't
*  connect with anything you've heard of in classical mechanics. There's no equation of motion for a
*  qubit classically. So I think you can do both. I think you can say here's a classical particle
*  let's quantize it. Oh we get a wave function. Oh we notice that wave functions are vectors in a
*  Hilbert space. Oh we notice that there are much smaller Hilbert spaces than that like two-dimensional
*  Hilbert spaces and then use that two-dimensional qubit language to introduce a lot of the concepts
*  of quantum mechanics. Just do both. That's what I would like to do. I would like to do both.
*  Anonymous, different these are all different anonymous. This is not one anonymous asking many
*  questions. Anonymous says the collection of homeostatic chemical processes we call life
*  self-propagate in the direction of the arrow of time because this is the direction where
*  entropy increases. The intelligent computational systems based on these chemical processes we call
*  our minds thus experience the arrow of time. As a whole the entropy of the universe increases
*  but there exist regions where entropy decreases. Could there be homeostatic chemical processes
*  that propagate in the reverse direction in these regions life in the reverse direction?
*  So no. The answer is no. But it's a little bit tricky to explain why and in fact this
*  might very well be something where I just don't understand it well enough to give you
*  the simplest answer here but let me explain to you why I'm quite confident that that is the right
*  answer. The second law of thermodynamics applies when you have a closed system and you say a closed
*  system that starts in a state of low entropy will with enormously large probability evolve to states
*  of higher entropy. There are ways to have systems spontaneously decrease in entropy namely they're
*  not closed systems. They're open systems. So my favorite example you put a bottle of champagne in
*  the refrigerator and it will lower its temperature and if you calculate the entropy afterward it has
*  a lower entropy just because it's lowered its temperature that counts as lowering its entropy.
*  But the point is that even though we say and it is true we correctly say that the arrow of time is
*  due to the fact that entropy is increasing that little glib motto slides over some important
*  details. Okay so the details matter and actually this came through a little bit in the podcast
*  with David Wallace where we're talking about the arrow of time that you know sure entropy is
*  increasing but there's more to it than that. Entropy is increasing in a particular way.
*  So think of it this way so I mean roughly what I want to say just to get to the answer to the
*  question is if I put something in a refrigerator its entropy will go down because it's in a closed
*  system but there's no it's in an open system sorry there's no sense in which the arrow of
*  time is reversed inside that bottle of champagne and the way that you can see this is you know
*  think about a very typical thing that we use to illustrate the increase of entropy. If you have a
*  cup of warm water and you put an ice cube in it the ice cube melts and you get a cup of cool water
*  and entropy is increased along the way okay but if you take that cool water and now you put it
*  into a refrigerator it's not going to it will lower in entropy if its coolness is not quite
*  as cool as the refrigerator it will lose it will radiate photons and heat out to its environment
*  its entropy will go down but it will not spontaneously form into an ice cube plus a glass of warm water
*  just from sitting in the refrigerator the whole thing is just going to cool down okay. So there
*  are differences in the details of the way in which entropy increases or decreases in a closed
*  system naturally increasing entropy versus an open system leaking entropy out into the world around
*  it so and there's details there upon details that I'm not going to get into but the short answer is
*  you don't expect a reversed arrow of time in an open system that is going downward in entropy.
*  Jim Watson says regarding cosmic redshift due to expanding space time where does the energy loss
*  from the photon go as it is redshifted? Two answers to this depending on what level you care about.
*  One answer is energy is not conserved in an expanding universe the total energy of stuff
*  of matter and radiation etc is not a constant number because space time is changing underneath
*  it okay. I wrote a whole blog post about this if you go and google energy is not conserved you'll
*  probably get my blog post about this. The longer answer which I have to give usually I stop there
*  but the longer answer because I have to give it now because I've already mentioned that in
*  general relativity there is a conserved energy that includes the energy of the gravitational field
*  okay so the energy that is not conserved is just the energy of the stuff inside space time if you
*  try to attach an energy to space time itself you can do that it's tricky there's details there's
*  mathematical subtleties but you can do it and that number is conserved okay so in that way of
*  thinking about energy because there's no single way of doing it there are different ways of doing
*  it in that way what you would say is that there is a transfer of energy from space time between
*  space time and the photons if it's photons they lose energy which is absorbed by space time
*  if it's dark energy you know dark energy increases its total amount of energy in a certain way
*  region of space as the universe increases so energy can either go up or down in stuff
*  and in either case space time responds appropriately. Ru Phillips says David Chalmers
*  refers to you in his new book reality plus he believes we are in a pure simulation his credence
*  comes from statistical analysis if it is possible for someone in our universe to create a pure
*  simulation then it will be much more likely that we are sims because it is much easier to create
*  billions of sim worlds than the universe to create billions of physical worlds with life
*  what are your credences on these concepts and what if anything is Chalmers neglecting in his
*  argument for us probably being sims you know I don't I'm not going to give a full account of this
*  because I think these are subtle issues but what I really think is that people tend to misuse
*  anthropic reasoning in this case and this is something you know I don't want to be too
*  mealy-mouthed about it but I'm not completely sure that my opinion is the right one but it is
*  my tentative way of thinking right now the as I said before the simulation argument there's a
*  there's a step you know if you take the simulation argument to just say maybe we live in a simulation
*  then that's fine that's completely true maybe we do but if you take it to say we probably live in
*  a simulation well then you're assuming some measure right on the space of who we could be
*  and people tend to use some kind of principle of mediocrity or typicality or whatever you want to
*  call it you know we are randomly selected from the set of all possible people intelligent beings in
*  the universe and I think that's just wrong I don't think you should assume that we are randomly
*  selected from the set of all people in the universe there's many ways in which I am not
*  randomly selected from the set of all intelligent observers even here on earth much less in the
*  whole universe so I think that step just doesn't work what I would rather do as I said before is
*  to ask the question what would the universe look like if it were a simulation and I don't think it
*  look it would look much like our actual universe does to be a little bit more clear about that
*  typicality point here's the way that I like to put it I'm borrowing language from other people and
*  I forget who it is so I can't keep credit sorry about that but it seems humble when you say I
*  think that I'm just a typical observer in the universe right that's why it's literally sometimes
*  called the principle of mediocrity but you don't know what a typical person in the universe looks
*  like you don't know what the space of all possible observers in simulations and elsewhere in space or
*  whatever you have no idea right so really when you're assuming that you are just a typical
*  observer you're actually assuming the typical observers are like you and that's not humble at
*  all that's sort of maximally arrogant you're assuming that you can infer some facts about
*  all the observers in the universe just on the basis of your local parochial experience of the
*  world so I think that's wildly unwarranted by anything that we know about reason or logic or
*  experience or anything like that I do think there are ways to still make anthropic like arguments
*  I think that it's okay to say that models of cosmology that make it more likely that observers
*  like us would exist observers exactly like us so forget about typicality observers exactly like you
*  okay models of cosmology that make it more probable that a person exactly like you would come into
*  being should be preferred in a Bayesian sense over models that have low probability of you coming
*  into being that's the kind of thing that I think is okay to say without making any assumptions about
*  your typicality in the cosmos joe asks have you ever used linux on a desktop laptop or server if
*  so what did you think of it so uh yeah I did when I was at the university of Chicago for several
*  years I had a linux desktop machine um it was fine you know I'm not my attitude towards these
*  things operating systems and so forth is there's no right or wrong I mean some are better than
*  others for different purposes but different users and different sets of needs are going to
*  be better served by different operating systems so if you're really into it if you're really into
*  operating your operating system getting into the guts of it and changing things around to please
*  your whims then linux is great you can tinker with it if you just want it to work and forget about it
*  if your intellectual energies are focused elsewhere then linux is not the operating system
*  for you so I'm very happy with the mac these days I don't love being you know beholden to the mac
*  ecosystem overall but the things that they do are good enough for me that it works fine and there
*  is a cost in switching back so you know the ipad iphone macbook pro combined system works quite well
*  for my own needs and so I have no motivation to contemplate switching jeff b says as I listen to
*  your interviews with guests I'm always impressed by your ability to come up with questions that
*  cut to the heart of a topic do you believe this is something that you are naturally talented at
*  or was it a skill that took practice well thank you jeff for the nice compliment like I said I'm
*  not above including questions here that involve the uh uh compliments that to begin with so I'm
*  not sure though to be to be super duper honest here I'm not sure that I have a special ability
*  to come up with questions that cut to the heart of a topic what I what I do think is that there's
*  a simple feature of mindscape which is that it's just me right I am the one choosing the guests
*  booking them interviewing them whatever and my motivation for doing it is not primarily greed
*  or fame it's because I'm interested in what these people have to say that is literally my primary
*  motivation I started the podcast because I wanted to talk to these people and hear what they had to
*  say learn from them so I think that gives me a leg up like I'm not a professional interviewer who's
*  handed a guest and some talking points and asked to talk about them if I'm inviting them on the
*  podcast there's something that they know that I would like to know so I'm just being you know
*  sincere in my questioning because I'm actually trying to get at what it is they have to offer
*  there's one you know aspect that may or may not be relevant here which is that you do get trained
*  as a scientist and not just a scientist but as an academic more broadly you get trained to
*  understand things in such a way that you could do research on them right you know it's one thing to
*  be handed a book or a paper and say read it it's another thing to be handed a book or a paper and
*  say read it and there will be a test on it okay so you're going to be a little bit more careful
*  reading it if there's going to be a test it's a whole nother thing to be handed a book or paper
*  and say read it and then do your own research and write a follow-up paper or book right that's a
*  whole nother level of understanding and that's just what you're trained to do as a professional
*  academic so I do try to understand things in such a way that I could afterward I mean it's certainly
*  not true for all the podcasts I do that I could then go off and do research in these areas
*  but it's the beginning of a start to understanding things well enough to be able to do that so I'm
*  not going to be satisfied with you know words that sound like I understand it I really need to
*  understand it well enough to think that I could sort of use the ideas myself at a research level
*  it's not true as I just said that I could actually start doing research but it's the beginning of
*  that process Patrick Hall says you've spoken extensively on the importance of increasing
*  interdisciplinary projects between philosophy and theoretical physics what branch of philosophy do
*  you think can benefit the most from collaborating with theoretical physics do you think the problems
*  of metaphysics can be solved with theoretical physics I think that this is like this like kind
*  of a hodgepodge I guess I mean I don't have a systematic theory of what kinds of philosophy
*  can benefit from physics or vice versa but there's a general kind of obvious
*  set of ideas right I mean I do think that philosophy is continuous with physics they're
*  not really separate things they're both attempts to understand the world and probably you know you
*  can throw in mathematics and a bunch of other things that are in some sense continuous it's
*  we human beings especially university administrators who end up drawing these bright lines between these
*  different fields but if there's a philosopher thinking about what is the correct foundation
*  formulation of quantum mechanics and there's a physicist thinking about what is the correct
*  formulation of quantum mechanics they're doing the same thing they're asking the same question
*  okay whatever department they might be in so the kinds of problems that I forget I won't necessarily
*  accurately answer your question but the kinds of problems that I think are most interesting
*  at this intersection are questions where our physics knowledge needs clarification
*  okay so it's not just we need more data but we need more clarity of thought
*  and there's plenty of ideas like that in cosmology in quantum mechanics in statistical mechanics and
*  entropy and so forth that's that's like sort of I'm answering the inverse question what can
*  physics ask for philosophy what philosophy can get from physics is more like
*  well two things one is they can be inspired by discoveries in physics right like it's easy
*  it's too easy in certain areas of philosophy to sort of lazily think that features of the
*  world you're familiar with are necessary right there's an argument about whether
*  immanuel kahn thought that it was necessary that space had three dimensions so he wasn't always
*  clear so it's not it's not obvious what he thought but it's not necessary in any logical
*  or mathematical or physical sense that space had to have three dimensions it's a feature of our
*  world so even the existence of space itself is something where I think a lot of philosophers
*  just take for granted and you will hear them say that we couldn't have you know I don't know
*  interactions or structure or memories without spatial locality which I think is obviously
*  not true because I don't think it's spatial locality is fundamental so that's an area where
*  you can really learn something from listening to the physicists I think and finally you can
*  just be inspired in the sense of being given new questions to ask right I mean philosophers
*  invent things like the sleeping beauty problem or other thought experiment kinds of things
*  and physicists come up with real questions about boltzmann brains and the the multiverse and you
*  might think those are very speculative but they were not invented to be cool philosophy puzzles
*  they were invented because they might actually apply to the world and so like those new puzzles
*  that come in are directly germane to metaphysical questions I mean you read David Lewis and you know
*  a lot of the stuff that he did is pretty directly resonant with modern physics even though he wasn't
*  pretending to actually do modern physics himself rob F says as a lay person it seems strange to me
*  that the square root of minus one is of such fundamental importance to quantum physics and by
*  extension to nature can you help me understand why this imaginary number is of such importance
*  versus any other type of number I do think that uh there's kind of two levels of answering this
*  question is sort of the math level and the physics level the math level is why were you ever motivated
*  to invent imaginary numbers in the first place and that I think that's very natural answer coming
*  just from the natural progression of mathematics toward greater generality and abstraction right
*  like you have an equation like two plus three equals five that's good you can understand that
*  no no issues and then you try to generalize it so you say well what if x plus three equals five
*  right I'm not going to tell you what x is but then you can solve and you can figure out you can solve
*  that equation x must equal two okay and you're still very happy this is you know this we're
*  talking about 3 000 years ago you could still have had that conversation but then some says
*  okay wise guy what about if x plus three equals one what are you going to do then and you can say
*  well you know what are we going to do you're going to invent negative numbers I know that now we just
*  take those for granted but back in the day that was a big deal you would say if x plus three sorry
*  yeah x plus one equals five then x has to equal if you say x plus three equals one then x has to
*  equal minus two and you can sort of intuit your way into that right like there are you could have
*  money or you could have debts so debts are kind of like negative money and imaginary numbers are
*  invented the same way you say x squared equals four cool so x could be plus x could be plus two
*  minus two but what if x squared equals minus four well you could just say there's no solutions
*  that's okay but maybe you like the idea that every time you have an equation with x squared in it
*  anytime you have a quadratic equation there are two solutions maybe you like that idea
*  that's tricky because if x squared equals zero the only solution is zero but then you talk yourself
*  into thinking that you have zero two different times and more generally if you have x squared
*  equals minus four you could say that x equals plus or minus two times the square root minus one
*  two times i so you invent imaginary numbers that way and that might be just you know not very useful
*  mathematical abstraction if it weren't so useful right so that's the second level of the answer to
*  your question why does this mathematical construction find so many uses in physics
*  and that's a more tricky one because you never need imaginary numbers you never absolutely
*  absolutely need imaginary numbers you could always just replace any discussion of imaginary
*  numbers with separate discussions of their real parts and their imaginary parts right you're
*  allowed to do that it's just what much less convenient so the question becomes why is it
*  convenient to talk in the language of imaginary numbers so i want to i'm going to try to give you
*  an answer we'll see whether it actually works or not so here's my attempted answer think of the
*  double slit experiment okay think of a electron wave function it's a wave it's passing through
*  two slits on the other side it interferes so what are the features physically that you want to have
*  happen and forget about observations and decoherence and all that stuff we're just thinking the simple
*  wave goes through two slits and get an interference pattern on the other side so
*  one thing is it's clearly got a wave right it can't be particles if you're getting an
*  interference pattern on the other side there needs to be a contribution to what you're seeing on the
*  other side which is partly a positive part and partly a negative part so they can some places
*  cancel out that's what it means to get an interference pattern so that's why waves are
*  the natural place to look the wave be up or down it could be positive or negative so you might think
*  okay i'm going to invent something called the wave function it's going to be real valued but it could
*  be positive or negative but then you say well if i observe the particle somewhere along the way
*  okay then i need a probability of observing it and for various reasons you want that probability
*  to look like the wave function squared okay if the wave function is a real number and the
*  probability of observing it is the wave function squared and that wave goes up and down right so
*  it's positive then zero and negative and zero and positive etc that means that the probability
*  of finding the particle at all seems to be oscillating between zero and one that's not
*  what you want you want the probability of the particle being somewhere just to be one all the
*  time so this is a job for imaginary numbers or for complex numbers more generally if you say that
*  the wave function squared equals one i mean it's really the integral of the wave function squared
*  but hopefully you know what i mean if the wave function squared overall has to equal one but you
*  also want it to go up and down and be able to interfere that's what complex numbers can do
*  because it's not really going between positive and negative it's circling around with constant
*  magnitude in the complex plane okay that's an attempt i don't know if that attempt worked
*  that's an attempt to explain how negative numbers become or imaginary numbers become very very
*  convenient in real world physics situations anonymous says what are your thoughts on the
*  current graduate student employment crisis as an undergraduate student i was blissfully unaware of
*  the extreme number of steps one has to take and roadblocks that are in the way when one wants to
*  work as a phd scientist grad school postdoc little no control over the final location does the academy
*  have a responsibility to make prospective students aware of what they're likely walking into even
*  though it doesn't benefit the academy are there any creative solutions you've thought of besides
*  moving the bottleneck from getting a job to getting into grad school i do think that we
*  absolutely have a responsibility to make prospective students aware and i try very hard to do it every
*  student who is either a prospective student or one who has arrived and wants to work with me
*  we have the talk and the talk involves saying you know the odds are against you you get a phd from
*  the best place in the world and the odds of getting uh becoming a tenured professor are still
*  small well maybe one in four i don't know that's the number i heard once in my life and i think
*  that's you know in the right ballpark ballpark it's not one percent but it's not 90 either
*  and somewhere in between um i think we do need to let people know and then let people choose
*  whether or not they want to do it anyway i don't think the solution is to just let fewer people
*  get phds for lots of reasons one thing is there's more reasons to get a phd than just to become a
*  tenured professor somewhere getting a phd is a useful thing it's education it's a degree
*  okay you can become a smarter better thinker by getting a phd and so it's not like you've
*  completely wasted your time if you get a phd and then don't end up being a professor um but i do
*  think you should make that decision yourself right so if we i mean think about it this way if
*  the graduate schools just stop taking as many students that means the graduate schools are
*  deciding for all those people they're rejecting that they shouldn't get a phd because maybe they
*  won't get a job i don't think that should be the graduate school's decision i think that should be
*  the student's decision they should make the decision with all the information they can
*  possibly have but it should be their decision to make i mean the overall problem honestly is
*  just not solvable if you if you define the overall problem as there are more people who would like to
*  be tenured professors than there are tenured professorships right that's just a feature of
*  the arrangement of society and the way that we distribute our wealth and and things like that
*  okay that's not going away anytime soon and to sort of conflate that fact with some statement
*  about graduate school admissions is a mistake there's a lot more people who want to be professional
*  basketball players than there are room for professional basketball players i think that's
*  not going away anytime soon there is one tweak i would make to the system that i think is pretty
*  obvious which is not we should have fewer grad students but that we should have fewer postdocs
*  you know as you say in in fields like theoretical physics anyway you spend five years getting a phd
*  and then you get a postdoc which lasts for three years just doing research trying to buff up your
*  resume your list of publications you can apply for faculty jobs and these days regularly people
*  get two or three or even more postdocs and that's much less defensible i think as a system right
*  a phd is an education it's a you're in school you're getting a degree
*  postdocs are just you know sort of training programs for researchers and if you spend five
*  years getting a phd and then six or seven or eight years as a postdoc it's hard to then switch into
*  a completely different field so i actually think this was you know i give credit to kim body who
*  was a graduate student of mine when she first applied for postdocs she said i wish there were
*  fewer postdocs out there because of exactly this reasoning and i never thought of it before and
*  she's exactly right she actually made it she's a professor now at the university of texas so
*  congratulations to kim but i get the logic you know professors love postdocs because they're
*  trained they can do research they help make professors really really productive i'm much less
*  convinced that it's good for the postdocs themselves that's a small tweak that's what
*  i would do i'd provide more funding in the world of grant funding and institutional funding i would
*  put more of it to supporting grad students less of it to supporting postdocs even though i like
*  having postdocs around they're pretty awesome anonymous says priority question would it be
*  possible to calculate the minimum size the universe would have assuming it's infinite to
*  have all possible interactions take place this would be assuming all possible outcomes are
*  realized in many worlds so there's always the danger with priority questions namely i have no
*  idea how to answer this question sorry about that i don't even know what it means to have all
*  possible interactions take i literally don't know what that means is that all possible
*  interactions between two particles at a time or all possible configurations of all particles
*  and i have no idea how that is associated with the size of the universe at all and furthermore
*  i don't know how many the interactions there are or anything like that sorry about that i just have
*  zero idea how to answer this question i don't think there's any to try to be a little bit more
*  constructive i don't think there's any relationship between the number of possible
*  interactions and the minimum size of the universe at all but i don't know i might be wrong because
*  that seems to depend on features of the laws of physics that i don't know the answer to
*  you sid huff says on quora recently someone asked why gravity has been so difficult for science
*  to reconcile with quantum theory victor taut the physicist who often responds to questions such
*  as this refer to semi-classical gravity while he called semi-classical gravity an ugly clutch
*  he also noted that in all regimes accessible to us semi-classical gravity provides answers
*  to the degree with experiment what exactly is semi-classical gravity is it a step forward
*  towards solving the problem of quantum gravity uh yeah semi-classical gravity is just gravity when
*  you quantize it but don't push it too far okay so when i talk about the core theory the core theory
*  includes both the standard model of particle physics and quantum gravity but that quantum gravity is
*  restricted to weak field gravitation you can just take the ordinary classical dynamics of
*  general relativity and turn the crank on quantizing it where that breaks down is where you go to
*  higher order interactions with gravitons running around loops and so forth and even more importantly
*  in black holes or cosmology singularities the big bang stuff like that but okay don't include that
*  stuff if you want to know why the earth goes around the sun or why apples fall from trees
*  you can do you can quantize gravity in this weak field not very dramatic regime perfectly well and
*  that's semi-classical gravity the problem is no it is not a step forward towards solving the problems
*  because all the problems are in the regimes where semi-classical gravity doesn't really apply cooper
*  says i've heard david tulmer's and other proponents of the hard problem of consciousness completely
*  dismiss emergence as a viable answer to consciousness in fact this dismissal appears to be one of their
*  primary arguments against physicalism however it's not as if we have finished the work to
*  comprehensively describe every element in the emergent ladder between quantum field theory and
*  say a chair and yet i don't hear philosophers fretting about what it's like to be a chair do
*  you think there is hypocrisy here in the philosopher's attitude towards emergence
*  no i don't think it's uh hypocritical i don't agree with it either so it seems strange for me
*  to defend the formulation of the hard problem of consciousness but it's it is an argument that
*  makes sense it may be not be right but it's not cheating in any way the argument is supposed to
*  be the whole point of drawing the distinction between the hard problem of consciousness and
*  the easy problems is that the hard problem is supposed to be a different kind of problem
*  than describing a chair or something like that okay so of course you're correct that we've not
*  described all the emergent levels in between quantum field theory and chairs but it seems that
*  all of those levels are sort of connected in pretty straightforward physical ways right
*  atoms are made of particles molecules are made of atoms all the way up to chairs made of whatever
*  whereas the claim is that consciousness is not like that and the reason why it's not like that
*  is because it has this ineffable first person experience what it is like to be something kind
*  of thing there is nothing that is like to be a chair so that's a different kind of problem so
*  the argument is supposed to be that you can have all the emergence you want you will never reach
*  consciousness because it's a different place to be than just being a chair now again i don't believe
*  that argument but i don't think it's necessarily anthropocentric or or special or anything like
*  that it's just i just don't i think it's a failure of imagination more than it is a being too
*  hypocritical or anything like that jimmy summer says does intuition tell you that the universe
*  began with the big bang or some eternal cyclic model it seems in the former the universe has to
*  come from nothing and the latter the universe doesn't have to come at all but only because it
*  was always here should one seem more likely than the other door intuitions even mean anything when
*  it comes to these kinds of questions i don't think our intuitions should mean very much honestly
*  when we're talking about the beginning of the universe what does my intuition know about
*  anything at all having said that there's two little footnotes to that statement about intuition one is
*  that of course our intuitions can get trained right we get an intuition just from biology and
*  from our experience of the world but as we learn more about theories of the universe that are
*  beyond our everyday experience our intuition can grow to encompass the way that those theories work
*  the other thing is that we need as we talked about before in the discussion of bayesianism
*  you need some kind of prior on something right so if you don't know very much about the theory
*  of everything or quantum gravity but you do know that either the universe had a beginning or it
*  didn't you bayesian reasoning says you got to put a prior on the universe had a beginning or the
*  universe didn't i think that the right thing to do in those cases where there's no empirical
*  difference to us today and there's very very little theoretical guidance is to be pretty open
*  minded so take whatever priors you want but i think it makes sense to have priors that are
*  not too wildly different between the universe lasted forever and the universe had a beginning
*  both are very much on the table dan o'neill says as a physicalist how do you explain
*  suicide having lost a close family members member to suicide i find it hard not to think of it in
*  dualistic non-deterministic terms as an incorporeal mind incorporeal mind choosing to destroy its own
*  body i'm sorry to hear about your your family member that's always a terrible tragedy when
*  that happens i should i shouldn't say that i should say it is often a terrible tragedy when
*  it happens i am someone who believes that people should be allowed to end their own lives under
*  precisely the right circumstances when they're of some sound mind they discuss things with their
*  doctors and so forth so there's different ways in which that kind of thing can play out but there's
*  absolutely no question a lot of circumstances under which people are in depression or something like
*  that whether it's external circumstances or you know their their neurological signals failing them
*  that causes them to commit suicide when maybe a day later they wouldn't have and that's a completely
*  different situation i've also known people to whom that has happened i don't i don't really
*  think that there's any issue here about physicalism versus dualism to be honest if you're a dualist
*  like you say you can imagine the mind choosing to destroy the body if you're a physicalist
*  the body is deciding to destroy itself so the question is are you the kind of physicalist who
*  thinks you can come up with an explanation of free will and making decisions and things like that
*  so i am that kind of physicalist so when when people do things to themselves whether it's
*  suicide or something much less dramatic i don't necessarily need to interpret it in terms of any
*  dualistic terms related question casey mahone what are your thoughts on euthanasia so i just gave them
*  i think that it should be allowed but i think it should be controlled you really want to make sure
*  that people are doing this in you know the clear light of day as it were not because of some
*  temporary chemical imbalance or temporary condition that they're in or whatever but if
*  if you're you're facing terrible diseases that are not going to go away i think that there's
*  absolutely a place for that in a well-formulated society anonymous says we have a lot of information
*  from history and a lot of smart people on the planet why is it that we can't get these smart
*  folks to figure out a solution to what's going on in the ukraine smart folks found a decent vaccine
*  for covet 19 why can't we just put an end to war well the glib answer is finding vaccines is way
*  easier than finding end to war human level questions are always going to be much more
*  complicated but also i think the question is a little bit misplaced in the sense that there are
*  people who wanted the war right there are people who started the war it's not like everyone agrees
*  we should find a solution to it the reason why we have wars is because people have incompatible
*  desires right some countries want to control other countries or just want think that they've
*  been insulted or whatever it is whatever the economic social political religious motivations
*  are they're incompatible with each other so it's nothing different than people well it's a little
*  bit different but it's related to the fact that people get in fights people get in arguments
*  you know people do this all the time as part of the human condition and so i don't even know
*  if there is such a thing as an end to war as long as we are human beings what we can try to do is
*  minimize war and make it not be that bad right i do think that when countries get to be prosperous
*  and democratic trading with each other they are less likely to go to war there's no absolutes here
*  there's no you know hard bright lines between when countries will and will not go to war
*  but look the united states and canada are not going to invade each other anytime soon they might
*  annoy each other but they're not going to send troops to control each other and france and
*  germany are not going to do that i mean france and germany is a much bigger much better example here
*  i mean nobody thinks that france and germany have any non-trivial probability of invading each other
*  anytime soon but they've invaded each other a lot over the last few centuries this is real progress
*  that those two countries are not going to do that so progress is possible okay i mean we're very
*  very far away from some utopian situation like that but we can work to construct an international
*  order where invading other countries just isn't done that often it won't be 100 but we can work
*  to it has nothing to do with being smart it's not like there's a puzzle that we're solving like
*  finding a virus or something like that it has much more to do with you know motivation values like
*  i said and those are trickier things to deal with russell wolf says last month you answered a question
*  from pablo's papa georgiou about having multiple conceptually different models of physics
*  and mentioned the possibility that the ultimate theory might include multiple models that each
*  have different domains of applicability as you were describing that i started to wonder if quantum
*  mechanics and relativity are an example of this scenario because they use very different language
*  but agree in the classical limit but then you finish by saying we're nowhere near this becoming
*  a realistic question to worry about so what's the difference between the hypothetical you are
*  describing and the situation in physics today well you know there is an overlap between the
*  regimes described by gravity and the regimes described by quantum mechanics so you said
*  relativity relativity in quantum mechanics are 100 compatible i think you mean gravity which is
*  classically described by general relativity but we don't have a good full theory of quantum gravity
*  yet as we said we have a semi-classical theory but we don't have the full theory yet but it's not hard
*  to look at regimes where quantum mechanics is important and gravity is important my favorite
*  regime is the sun the sun causes gravity it also causes heat and light both of these are very
*  important to our lives here on earth that heat and light are generated through quantum mechanical
*  processes you cannot consistently describe what the sun does by not including both quantum mechanics
*  and gravity now you sort of use different languages when you do that but it's the same physical
*  situation so i was imagining a situation where different physical situations are described by
*  different models and those sets of physical situations don't overlap but for gravity and
*  quantum mechanics they definitely do overlap liam mccarty says my understanding is that an
*  interpretation of a theory is so called because it doesn't imply any difference in experimental
*  results compared to other interpretations if so i'm curious how you pick one over the others is
*  it based on ockham's razor or do you interpret such an argument to advocate for the many worlds
*  of quantum mechanics so we so i guess the short answer here is you're probably implicitly going
*  on the idea that we are deciding between different interpretations of quantum mechanics but we're not
*  that is just not the modern discussion that we have in the foundations of quantum mechanics
*  i will often talk about the many worlds interpretation because that is the label that
*  was given to it back in the day but it's a theory it's not interpretation of anything it's a physical
*  theory it has a set of things in this case the wave function of the universe it has a set of
*  rules for what happens to those things in this case it obeys the schrodinger equation okay it's
*  an ordinary physical theory the copenhagen interpretation is in some sense an attempt to
*  interpret something but it's unclear what it's interpreting or how it's doing it but you know
*  many worlds compared to like super determinism theories or pile wave theories or whatever these
*  are just separate distinct physical theories the word interpretation there is just old-fashioned
*  and doesn't really apply anymore if you did have a situation where you had a single agreed upon
*  physical theory but there were different ways of interpreting it then it's just up to you go nuts
*  right if you think that newtonian mechanics is equivalent to lagrangian mechanics or hamiltonian
*  mechanics the same exact physical happenings described using different words i don't think
*  there's any right or wrong there at all you just use whatever is most convenient for the situation
*  you're in kevin o'Toole says whenever i hear the word decoherence in quantum physics i can't help
*  but think it's named backwards if an electron starts in a state totally uncorrelated with
*  anything else then evolves into a state where it's highly correlated with many other particles
*  the latter seems distinctly more coherent a measured particle seems more coherent than an
*  unmeasured particle in what sense is it intuitive to think of decoherence as a process of becoming
*  less coherent yes that's perfectly fair i get exactly where you're coming from the reason for
*  the lingo is that the issue of decoherence first drew notice in the context of you start with two
*  particles that are entangled and then you measure one of them or one of those two particles becomes
*  decoherent it becomes entangled with the rest of the world so imagine you're trying to build a
*  quantum computer okay so you have qubits and you want them to remain entangled and do their things
*  so you put them through gates and they evolve according to the gates and the schrodinger equation
*  while remaining entangled in the appropriate way it would be a shame if some photons came along and
*  bumped into one of your qubits and then that qubit became entangled with those photons but it
*  becomes unentangled with the other qubits in your quantum computer that's why it's called decoherence
*  because within the set of entangled things measuring one of them or entangling one of them
*  with the environment decoheres it or disentangles them with everything else it's not the best word
*  i i agree on that but you know sometimes we're stuck with the words that history gives us
*  p walder says within discussions around the concept of panpsychism the nature of matter is
*  frequently queried in particular philip goff suggests that physics on a fundamental level
*  only describes what matter does and not what matter is can you give an explanation of what matter is
*  i'll be honest i don't think this distinction makes any sense between what matter does and
*  what matter is what matter is is matter you know the stuff of the universe i don't even like to
*  use the word matter because that has some pre-existing baggage that it comes along with
*  i think there's the physical universe okay and we're looking for ways to best describe it i've
*  argued that our best current description is as a vector in hilbert space but other people will
*  disagree that's fine but it is whatever it is i'm not even sure it would make sense to ask what
*  matter is or what the universe is it's the universe it's sui generis it is by definition
*  a unique thing okay even if it's many worlds then what we mean by the universe in this sense is all
*  the worlds together there's nothing like it how in the world would you explain what matter is in
*  terms of something else right i just don't know what that even means i do know what matter does
*  or you know i know certain things that it does we that's all physics all of science is what matter
*  does so that makes perfect sense to me i think that the desire to explain that matter is something
*  is just a leftover from a pre-scientific way of thinking about things
*  mishy stern says i recently heard your interview with daniel dennett you discussed the manifest in
*  scientific image my question is as the years go by do the things in the realm of the scientific image
*  move to the realm of the manifest image what once was was considered essential becomes a useful
*  superficial description from molecules to atoms to neutron protons electrons to quarks to leptons
*  etc so i think yes and no is going to be one of those yes and no answer questions here um
*  the manifest image is never quarks and leptons that might be the best image we have but the
*  manifest image is supposed to be manifest that is to say it's supposed to be right in front of our
*  eyeballs at all times okay the manifest image is supposed to be the world that we instantly see
*  when we look around tables and chairs and computers and microphones and things like that
*  your scientific image gets better and better you realize that the things are making sense
*  you realize that the things are made of atoms and quantum fields and so forth that doesn't change
*  the manifest image at all and in fact i honestly think that the whole idea of the manifest image
*  is underappreciated i think that sometimes we skip over it when we think about interpreting
*  things philosophically or scientifically you know we go from um we try to say that this is the world
*  at the fundamental level and we kind of imagine that we apprehend that world directly but we don't
*  everything that we see is moderated through the scientific image even the manifest image rather
*  even if you look at a picture of you know crystal crystal graphic picture of some atoms in a solid
*  you're looking at a picture you're looking at a photograph you're not looking directly at the
*  atoms even if you're staring through a microscope you're staring at a some dots on a screen right
*  so i think the manifest image actually like plays an important role in how we interpret the world
*  we're constantly comparing the parts and features of our best scientific practice to the manifest
*  image so i don't think it really changes over time it might change a little bit you know if you learn
*  this and that it's easy to like flip a switch and go oh the earth goes around the sun not the other
*  way around that's fine but the fact that there's something called the earth and something called
*  the sun those are both part of the manifest image and they're not going anywhere napoleon's corporal
*  says i recently read somewhere that bell's theorem has been called the most profound discovery of
*  science one of your strengths is explaining challenging concepts so that they are understandable
*  to non-scientists would you explain the details of the test experiment that supposedly proves the
*  violation of locality your opinion of the test and the result and how that fits into the many
*  worlds concept i don't think it's actually very complicated bell's inequality just says imagine
*  that you have two sets of observations that are separated okay so they're space like separated
*  they cannot signal back and forth to each other and in the back of your mind you have something
*  like two entangled particles right and you're going to measure them in some axis up or down
*  but not always along the same axis you're going to measure them at different angles and what bell
*  noticed is that in quantum mechanics because of entanglement these things could be really
*  highly correlated okay now classically they could be correlated also but given things like the
*  uncertainty principle and so forth there's an upper limit on how correlated they could be
*  if there was no wave function that spread across the distance right if there were only objects with
*  definite values at different locations of space there's an upper limit to the amount of correlation
*  because you're not predicting you're not specifying ahead of time what observation
*  you're going to make right you can always just say well i i pick um you know a particle that
*  is spin up and i know the other one is spin down okay but if it's just classical um then you have
*  you need to tell me what happens if i measure it along a different axis in quantum mechanics
*  where there's a superposition you have a very definite answer to that but you have to invent
*  some theory for what is going to be the measurement outcomes if you measure along a different axis
*  and what bell proved is that that theorem can never be as correlated as it would be
*  in uh quantum mechanics because of the fact that in quantum mechanics the wave function
*  spreads across these two particles even though they're very very far away so that is interpreted
*  as evidence for locality but look as i said before i think many worlds is right so to me this is not
*  a profound result at all it's a very simple consequence of the fact that the wave function
*  describes the world right bell's theorem seems very profound if you were going to doubt that
*  the wave function describes the world wave functions are not local that's just how they are they
*  describe what is going on all over the place at the same time okay it's profoundly non-local
*  so if you already thought the quantum mechanics was many worlds bell's theorem is you're given
*  bells there me oh yeah sure that's it's not extra profound it was already part of the
*  profoundness because i already believe that the wave function is the whole thing there you go
*  perry romanowski says i often tell people that if you rewound time all the things that happened
*  would still happen the same way recently a friend pushed back and said he wasn't it wasn't correct
*  because of heisenberg's uncertainty principle i think that's a misunderstanding of the uncertainty
*  principle which of us is correct um it's not the uncertainty principle for sure that's not what is
*  going on as we already discussed the uncertainty principle before but it's actually a difficult
*  question to answer because as many as often happens for these questions it depends on your
*  favorite formulation of quantum mechanics so um if you were a copenhagen quantum mechanics person
*  then no what would happen if you reround the world would not be exactly the same because there is a
*  truly random element in the laws of physics okay when you observe something it truly collapses in
*  an unpredictable way likewise in objective collapse models that have nothing to do with
*  observers right like there are grw models and penrose's models and so forth where the wave
*  function really does collapse randomly and if you thought that was the be all and end all the laws
*  of physics then if you rewound the tape it would not play the same thing now in uh something like
*  a pilot wave theory in bohmian mechanics that is deterministic okay but the determinism is governed
*  by some hidden variables that you don't have access to so if you rewound the tape starting with
*  the same values of the hidden variables then indeed you would get exactly the same history
*  played back and then as usual many worlds is in this middle position where the wave function of
*  the universe uh evolves in exactly the same way but there's many many universes right there's many
*  many copies of the universe and it's not clear what you mean when you say my universe would be
*  the same there's a lot of universes and they would be different from each other one of them
*  would be the same as yours the other ones would be different okay nowhere in any of those words
*  that i mentioned the heisenberg uncertainty principle because it's this all has to do with
*  measurement which as i said before isn't about the uncertainty principle tim ryan says how is
*  the bass playing going have you explored any music theory can be very fun and rewarding
*  yeah you know the bass playing was going really well uh before i went to boston for my sabbatical
*  in the fall and i didn't bring the bass because i was trying to focus on other things and since
*  i've gotten back i've just been swamped with other stuff it's really i have too many things
*  on my plate right now part of the reason why this ama is a little delayed um so i've fallen off on
*  the bass playing i was playing it every day at least a little bit and it's not like that anymore
*  it is fun and rewarding i like doing it uh i wish i had more time to do it i have every intention in
*  the world of finding more time to do it at some point in the future i'm not quite sure what that
*  point will be tom says i really enjoyed the arvin argren episode on the genes eye view of evolution
*  in your experience does the i would die for two brothers or eight cousins rubric have explanatory
*  power for how people treat others in the world eg is the lower degree of genetic overlap a primary
*  explanation for the west historically devoting fewer resources to sub-saharan african africa
*  than to other eurasian populations you know i think that uh it's worth saying about that idea
*  that you would die for two brothers or eight cousins that uh the our unconscious is not that
*  good at math so even if there's something to that motto it's certainly not true that we really
*  follow that at a careful quantitative level rather how i would interpret that is saying that
*  evolution kind of trains us to favor our family and maybe even uh well as is often true with
*  evolution evolution doesn't actually change our traits right the thing the the the thing
*  that about the selfish gene theory the genes i view that certainly is correct is that what is
*  passed on from generation to generation is our genome right the pressure the selection pressure
*  acts on traits that we have as organisms but then the result of that is that certain genes get passed
*  on the next generations and other ones don't so the genes that get passed on is going are going
*  to you know give us certain traits and those traits might be be a little bit more concerned
*  with your relatives right but i don't know how genes would even be able to tune themselves to
*  such a degree where they would say care as much for your own life as for two brothers and brothers
*  or eight cousins or anything like that it's much more vague than that so i absolutely think that
*  that kind of selection helps explain why we are more likely to do things for people more like us
*  right closer to us i think as uh nicholas kristakis said back in his podcast episode
*  we have a weak in-group bias so all else being equal we are going to draw a circle around people
*  like us and people not like us and prefer the people like us and that's true in many many
*  ways and that makes perfect evolutionary sense but i wouldn't get too precisely quantitative about it
*  paul torek says gary mark has said that for an ai to have common sense it needs certain mental
*  faculties we have including to quote him a cost benefit system which i think is innate you seem
*  to agree or at least not object yet in your may ama you question the idea that an ai will have
*  values you're replying to a question about stewart russle's argument that ai presents an alignment
*  problem because ai's values might not align with ours have you changed your mind about whether or
*  not artificial general intelligence will probably have values so the point i was trying to make is
*  an ai will act in certain ways okay and that way that the ai acts can certainly be accounted for
*  in terms of a cost benefit system the point i was trying to make was that that kind of cost benefit
*  system that the ai might end up having need not be recognizable to us as a set of values okay if i
*  throw a rock outside the window it falls down but i don't say it values being down the values being
*  at a lower elevation i say it's just following the rules of gravity okay so i'm open to the
*  possibility that ai's will act in such a way that we could sensibly take the human centered concept
*  of values and apply them to ai's there's no obstacle in principle to that i just want to
*  be open-minded about it i'm also open to the possibility that ai's will not be recognizable
*  as things with values they will be recognizable as things that do things and that those things can
*  be accounted for by cost benefit analysis but it may or may not make sense to talk about them as
*  having values razi amed says why is ferdinger's equation constructed such that it only has a time
*  derivative if time and space are essentially the same why single out one coordinate well
*  ferdinger's equation is part of quantum mechanics time and space being the same is a lesson that we
*  get from relativity and in quantum mechanics as as it was originally formulated in non-relativistic
*  quantum mechanics they were different time and space schrodinger's equation is a formulation
*  of quantum dynamics that does treat time and space differently so you can ask is that incompatible
*  with the lessons of relativity and the answer is you have to work do some work in there and this
*  again special relativity okay not general relativity not talking about gravity you're just talking about
*  the speed of light being the speed limit and so forth it's 100 compatible but it's sort of
*  spiritually intention if that makes sense what i mean is that whenever you write down
*  a quantum mechanical state as a wave function in some frame of reference in a relativistic
*  theory so you have you know the standard model of particle physics that is a completely relativistic
*  theory i can pick a reference frame i can say here are my coordinates on space time here's my
*  reference frame and with respect to that reference frame i can construct a quantum state and it will
*  evolve according to the schrodinger equation okay so what i've done is i have broken the manifest
*  sorry i have taken the lorenz invariance the uh invariance with respect to different coordinate
*  systems and i have made it non-manifest by choosing a coordinate system this is what we
*  do all the time you know we choose coordinate systems all the time but we know that that's
*  just a choice that we made then we describe what's happening in that coordinate system
*  but the underlying dynamics if your dynamics are relativistic they don't care you could use
*  a different coordinate system and get the same physics same thing is true in quantum mechanics
*  you could choose different coordinate systems you would describe the quantum state differently
*  but it would still have a schrodinger equation that evolved it forward in time so that symmetry
*  between space and time can be hidden by a choice that we arbitrarily make but no physical results
*  depend on that arbitrary arbitrary choice that we made nicklaus walker says when is the book
*  out based on biggest ideas and will it be e reader friendly uh it's scheduled to come out in september
*  of this year 2022 um it's supposed to be reader friendly there's definitely going to be electronic
*  editions we are working hard to make sure the equations come out right i you know i am not
*  there in the design department of whatever the electronic bookseller is or anything like that so
*  you know i'm not the one to complain to if they don't but we're trying we certainly want it all
*  to be um operational it's a challenge that my publisher who publishes trade books is not used
*  to but they recognize the challenge and they're working hard at making it all work claudio says
*  i thought i had an understanding of the cause of hawking radiation from black holes however
*  lately i heard some conflicting versions that made me realize that my version
*  pairs of particles popping out into space one of them falls into the black hole the other
*  applies in the other direction is pure bs can you give us an updated no clickbait explanation for
*  the origin of hawking radiation so i wouldn't say that that's pure bs in fact that explanation you
*  just gave pairs of particles popping out into space has also been given by steven hawking in
*  his popular writings right so he knows what the real explanation is but it always depends on what
*  you mean by real or correct because there's different levels here okay um you know here's
*  a set of statements that are true and they may or may not satisfy you if you have a black hole and
*  there are quantum fields so you're in a world that has quantum field theory and there's a black hole
*  configuration then if you imagine converting exchanging that black hole for a slightly smaller
*  black hole plus some outgoing radiation that configuration slightly smaller black hole plus
*  outgoing radiation has all of the same conserved quantities same energy same angular momentum same
*  charge and whatever and a higher entropy okay the conserved quantities are important because you'll
*  never get evolution from like a state with one electric charge to a different electric charge or
*  something like that but within the configuration set the same conserved quantities you expect
*  physical objects or whatever you want to call them to evolve into states of higher entropy and
*  that's exactly what the black hole is doing okay there you go that's a reason to expect the black
*  hole should evaporate should give off radiation it's not quite the physical mechanism beneath it
*  if you want to understand that physical mechanism beneath it and you don't and you correctly think
*  that the story about pairs of particles fluctuating out of existence is a little bit
*  too um hand wavy and click baity you have to admit that there is such a thing as quantum fields
*  okay and quantum fields evolve with time and this statement of particles and antiparticle pairs
*  popping in out of existence is a colorful metaphorical way of expressing the fact that
*  quantum fields live in superpositions of zero particles one particle two particles etc
*  and the particular superposition of the quantum fields in the vicinity of the black hole of
*  enter isen is unstable it tends to leak out particles the the existence of particles outside
*  the black hole grows with time and the size of the black hole shrinks with time under evolution
*  according to the schrodinger equation if you want to know more details than that then you need the
*  math then you know read hawking's paper or read a good textbook on it i mean you really got to dig
*  into it but it it is exactly what is predicted by the theory of quantum field theory in curved
*  spacetime there you go matt hickman says what do you think the odds are there's an extinction level
*  event for humanity in the next 100 years do you think we're doing more or less enough to prevent
*  such a thing or should we be we be doing more well i think there's different kinds of extinction
*  events i think extinction level event is hard to imagine honestly it's not zero certainly but even
*  a major thermonuclear war wouldn't be wouldn't render humanity extinct it might wipe out advanced
*  technological civilization if it were bad enough but it wouldn't render us extinct i mean maybe
*  it would be so catastrophic that 100 000 years in the future we would all have died out so maybe
*  we'd count that as an extinction level event but mostly i think that you know i'm more worried
*  about really bad events that are not quite extinction level like if only a million people
*  died i think that would be bad if a hundred million or a billion people died that's all the
*  worse right so i think we should worry more about those events than probably we do and it's easy to
*  understand why human beings are just not meant not built to appreciate risks that occur on
*  time scales longer than a human lifetime right so there's a one percent chance of a billion people
*  dying because of some event per century things that happen once per century are just not things
*  that human beings are good at preventing we're not even good at preventing things that might
*  happen next year right so i do think we could be better at worrying about nuclear war biological
*  warfare accidental or terroristic use of nuclear weapons and biological weapons big solar flares
*  terrible pandemics things like that asteroids hitting the earth asteroids actually pretty small
*  number but again it's pretty cheap to worry about it compared to the other ones so i do think we
*  should be doing more but it's not like a huge amount more it's not i don't think we need to spend
*  large fractions of our gdp's worrying about those things we need to spend a small but prudent fraction
*  on them eric chen says what is the largest cardinality of infinity used in modern physics
*  do infinite sets with cardinality greater than that of the real numbers have any use in physics
*  so you may have heard for those of you who are not experts that uh there's different levels of
*  infinity the number of integers is infinite but it is less than the number of real numbers which
*  is a bigger infinity and which infinity we're talking about is the cardinality of the set
*  and there are bigger infinities than the number of real numbers so roughly speaking eric physicists
*  don't care about this stuff at all that to a first approximation the difference between different
*  kinds of infinity is just irrelevant to physics now there are certain corners of physics where
*  they're a little bit more mathematically careful where countable versus uncountable namely uh
*  integer level infinities versus real number level infinities do matter to them in certain corners of
*  mathematical physics especially quantum field theory and quantum mechanics so they care about
*  those things but there's no experimental difference right i mean there's no uh empirical result that
*  depends on whether or not the reality of the situation is countable or uncountable as far as
*  i know beyond uncountable beyond just the number of real numbers the cardinality of real numbers
*  i know of no use in physics uh but maybe i wouldn't like maybe there is some in some deep deep corner
*  of mathematical physics that i'm not aware about uh but anyway it does not percolate into most
*  working physicists consciousness pete falconer says listening to your one dream course on time
*  and i heard you talk about cp leer which is an experimental particle physics experiment
*  and the demonstration of time asymmetry in the weak force could this time asymmetry be in some
*  way an explanation of the matter anti-matter asymmetry we see in the universe well it could
*  be related um but it's probably not the explanation for two reasons number one what we see in the
*  experiments uh like cp leer which looks at uh kaons and anti-kaons that's a time reversal
*  invariance violation from the standard model of particle physics and that violation just
*  numerically seems to be too small to play an important role in explaining the matter anti-matter
*  asymmetry in the universe the other point is that to explain the matter anti-matter asymmetry as
*  saccaro pointed out a long time ago you need more than just time asymmetry you need time asymmetry
*  baryon asymmetry kind of obviously and you need departure from thermal equilibrium and you need
*  them all in the right place at the right time working together in the right way so it's impossible
*  just to point to one of those you know violation of time asymmetry and say that's why there is this
*  difference between matter and anti-matter you need all three at once baryon asymmetry time asymmetry
*  thermal thermal equilibrium violation maybe you have that in the early universe probably you do
*  since there's more matter than anti-matter in the universe but we don't know which of the many many
*  specific scenarios for that asymmetry is the right one right now oleg ruvinsky says you mentioned in
*  the past that you love ian banks's culture series what are your favorites in it and why
*  uh i think my favorite is accession actually uh i can never look i'll be honest i don't think
*  that his titles are great so i can never remember which plot goes with which title of the books
*  except for like easy ones like player of games but accession is the one that places the most
*  emphasis on the minds these giant ai spaceships they're talking to each other telling jokes and
*  everything i just like that that's what that's why it's my favorite book that's a kind of a
*  cheap answer but there you go rob griber says you recently had two podcast guests who talked
*  about language specifically the mathematics and analytics underneath human vocabulary language
*  and stories number 174 with tawdene bradley and number 181 with peter dodds listening to both
*  episodes it seems bradley laid out a theoretical explanation of language and dodds does a sort of
*  experimentalist application of some kind of approach like that i'd be curious to hear your
*  thoughts on this field of study generally is this analytical study of language and stories
*  just a descriptive exercise about emergent language of our culture or does it have some
*  power to help us understand what deeper general ai for example might look like i'm not quite sure
*  if i understand the two options here they they seem both completely compatible to me it can be
*  descriptive exercise about an emergent aspect of our culture and have the power to help us
*  understand what deeper general ai might look like you know emergent aspects of culture or anything
*  else aren't arbitrary right there are reasons why certain things emerge and certain things don't
*  so the fact that we use language in certain ways that the entropy that we can assign to different
*  words or phrases or sentences has certain structure certain patterns this is not arbitrary
*  there are reasons why it is like that so it both is a descriptive exercise trying to understand
*  how we actually talk the information that is conveyed how we use language to sway people make
*  persuasive arguments a toy with people's emotions and also give us some insight into how ai might
*  itself use language like i said before it would be a little bit presumptuous to imagine that ai is
*  just like us i especially think that i forget whether i've talked about this on the podcast
*  or not but the fact that artificial intelligences are generally these days not embodied right they
*  don't have bodies they're just in software and they certainly don't have the kind of complicated
*  biological bodies that you and i have i think this matters a lot i think there are bodies are
*  crucially important to making us who we are as human beings we are not just software
*  that is working on any different machine that you want to run it on but okay aside from that
*  i do think that there's probably regularities and similarities in how general intelligences will
*  speak to each other but i'm open i'm willing to do the experiment there too so it's it's you know
*  if we find ways that human beings use language that can be mathematically studied it's a hypothesis
*  to say that a gi will also have those features and then we can go test that hypothesis when we
*  actually get it phil says is there a deeper reason why quantization works so well why would replacing
*  classical observables with operators give such good results or maybe i should ask this the other
*  way around since quantum mechanics is more fundamental yeah you know in some sense you
*  should ask it the other way around the question is we have quantum mechanics why is there a good
*  classical limit okay and that's a non-trivial question again one of the recent papers that
*  ashmeet singh and i wrote together is pointing in the direction of answering that question other
*  people long before us have thought about it why and under what circumstances is there a classical
*  limit to quantum mechanics but there is but your question is actually a little bit deeper than that
*  because even if there were a classical limit even if you have theory a and under the right
*  circumstances there's a limit of that theory that looks like a different theory theory b okay the
*  question we're asking here is how could you ever reconstruct theory a just given theory b
*  reconstruct the full theory from the limit in principle there's no reason at all why you should
*  be able to do that i mean the limit might only give you a tiny hint of what's going on in more
*  general circumstances so that's why i think you shouldn't expect that every single quantum theory
*  in fact it's certainly not true that every single quantum theory comes about by quantizing a
*  classical theory the weird thing is that in our experience we've done pretty well in finding out
*  what the quantum theories of nature are by starting with the classical theory and quantizing it that's
*  the weird thing why are the theories that work for us in that particular class of theories where you
*  can reverse engineer the full theory from the classical limit that i have less strong ideas
*  about i'm really not sure why that is true maybe there's a good theory for that and of course i
*  also think it's failing in the case of gravity so that's that would have to be a thing to consider
*  when you're inventing the explanation to this puzzle volair oh says a bit of a dark question
*  but would you rather survive a nuclear exchange or be amongst the first to go i think it's pretty
*  easy to say i'd rather survive right i mean yeah you know for the most human history times were
*  tough times are still tough for many people right now the fact that you live in a circumstances
*  where times are tough does not take away my motivation to live and try to make things better
*  in fact you know it's easier to know what to do to make things better when times are really really
*  tough because you just have to like make people survive and help out each other and i would want
*  to be around for that robert rux and rescue says in my system of values my moral system
*  i think everything is acceptable as long as no suffering is brought by that action suffering is
*  what gives an act its moral worthiness however using this framework brings me to a very taboo
*  situations for most people like the situation where a pedophile is satisfying his or her sexual
*  fantasies doing a video chat with a parent who bathes their baby let's say the parent gets the
*  money pedophile gets sexual satisfaction without hurting anybody and the baby's just completely
*  unaware of anything like this happening in my own system of values this whole situation is not
*  immoral i've been trying to analyze it to see if i'm making a mistake anywhere but i don't see
*  anything wrong with it however most people would be appalled at my conclusion and think i'm insane
*  do you see anything wrong here is there any argument i could use to come up with the conclusion
*  of this situation is wrong so i think that the situation here there's two things going on
*  one is that sure many people's uh morality comes very much from instinct rather than from a
*  well worked out rational system and that's not even necessarily a bad thing you know it's not
*  ideal i would prefer if everyone were completely rational but i don't think that as i've often said
*  that morality is a simple matter of just being rational you need some starting point and your
*  intuitions your your inner feelings are the starting point i think the morality comes about
*  by starting with some moral inclinations or intuitions that we have and trying to make them
*  into a rational system i think there's a mistake to be made by inventing a rational system and
*  then saying that even though this disagrees with my intuitions i nevertheless i'm going to stick
*  with the system because the whole point of the system was to systematize your intuitions okay
*  but that's that's one aspect the the bigger aspect that you're asking about is are there arguments
*  that you're not considering that might make this situation immoral or moral rather you know i i can
*  imagine there would be situations like this in some very very broad sense which i think could be
*  perfectly moral the particular one that you're writing about i think it's pretty easy for me to
*  see where it's where it could be argued to be not moral i mean i think that the the basic lesson is
*  that it's a little bit too simple to do philosophical thought experiments of this form
*  and neglect features of the real world and features of the real world matter in these
*  circumstances in particular both the parent and the pedophile in this circumstance you have to be
*  sure are not going to do anything that actually does cause cause harm to people right i mean it's
*  a little bit weird for a parent to be pimping out their baby to give cheap thrills to a pedophile
*  and and imagine that the parent doesn't do anything else that we might find objectionable i think
*  that's going to be the origin of a lot of people's worries there but more importantly and this is
*  really the heart of the matter to me i don't think it's fair to say the baby is just completely
*  unaware of anything like this happening you know i think that it is okay to be troubled by things
*  you would think are bad even if everyone is unaware of them right and in particular in the case of
*  this baby maybe they will grow up and find out about it and be very very disturbed sometime in
*  the future you can certainly not know for sure that that won't happen right so it's just much
*  easier safer a better moral choice to not put the baby in that kind of situation where the baby has
*  no agency to give consent for anything like that so to me that kind of argument is a perfectly good
*  reason not to allow something like the situation you're talking about steve pilling says what do
*  you think of the black hole as fuzzball or ball of string model it seems to avoid problematic issues
*  with the singularity where serger sir professor roger penrose says that space and time come to
*  an end um you know i don't know a lot about it i've tried to understand it for those of you who
*  don't know there is a model that is uh most associated with samir mather of ohio state
*  university where he tries to let's put it this way if you think that information gets out of black
*  holes eventually if you think that the laws of quantum mechanics are purely information conserving
*  including uh processes such as black hole evaporation and you think that string theory
*  is the right theory of the world then you need to believe that black holes can be described in the
*  context of string theory in a way that is perfectly happy to just obey the schrodinger equation for
*  evolution right there have to be a set of degrees of freedom in hillbred space that interact with
*  the outside world etc etc and the question becomes what are those degrees of freedom how do we think
*  about them and so uh mather has described a way or proposed a kind of way to think of the black hole
*  as a fuzzball as a as a set of strings that are sort of tied up together and wound up in different
*  ways my impression and i've tried to understand this and not quite succeeded because i think that
*  in part because no one understands it in part because of my limitations but um it's not a
*  complete description so samir is able to describe what would happen in certain very very very special
*  circumstances you know perfectly extreme well black holes in supersymmetric situations etc
*  but not give a completely generic understanding of an ordinary black hole that you might find in our
*  galaxy or something like that so it's hard to know what to think of the proposal because i don't think
*  it's fully fleshed out yet i mean maybe it has been since i last paid attention to it but that's
*  my impression i do think that the general idea has to be on the right track again if you think
*  that information is conserved coming out of black holes which i think is likely but i'm 100 wedded
*  to it there have to be some degrees of freedom in there you know it's almost like i don't see how
*  you can object to it right i mean people sometimes read about this and they're acting as if they're
*  translating it as if there's not really a black hole because instead there's a bunch of strings
*  behind the event horizon that's just not the way i would think about it at all it's saying that
*  what is behind the black hole is a bunch of strings you know it's it's it might be perceived to an
*  infalling observer just as ordinary space time inside a black hole but you know in string theory
*  the world is made of strings so there's a specific configuration of those strings that makes up a
*  black hole that is different than the configuration you find that makes up empty space or the earth or
*  something like that so something like that even if we don't know the details yet is going to have
*  to be true if string theory is on the right track as raparza box says what are your thoughts on
*  preppers or prepping for disaster personally uh you know nuanced thoughts i hope you know i'm in
*  favor of being prepared for disasters look i live in los angeles there are real disasters that happen
*  around here whether they're brush fires or earthquakes or mudslides or droughts or whatever
*  so we are you know not very well prepared for that kind of thing but we have our little earthquake
*  kit okay you know we have some water and some food and first aid stuff uh flashlights and things
*  like that that makes perfect sense i mean why would anyone object to preparing for potential bad things
*  happening to you now of course the answer to that why would anyone object is that some people take
*  it too far they fetishize the idea of preparing for disasters that are extremely unlikely there's a
*  bigger discussion to be had here about the whole way we think about really bad possibilities that
*  happen really rarely right a low probability event but it would be really really disastrous
*  this goes back to questions we've already talked about in the ama i think that those kinds of
*  questions are intrinsically difficult i don't think we have a well formulated clear theory
*  of how to deal with them and the reason why is because it's not just a matter let me put it this
*  way when you have things that are of fairly ordinary probabilities between one percent and
*  99 let's say and the consequences would be pretty bad or pretty good but not overwhelmingly good not
*  like end of the world or ascend to heaven kind of stuff but somewhere in between then roughly
*  speaking you can multiply the probability by the utility uh plus or minus of that event happening
*  and work on the basis of that okay and be kind of a consequentialist about the whole thing
*  when the probabilities become 10 to the minus six or 10 to the minus 12 or something like that
*  but the consequences become cosmically good or bad it's not it's no longer just a matter of multiplying
*  the probability by the utility because maybe there's an error bar on your probability right
*  you don't really know and who knows what the space of possibilities is you know i love this
*  one of the gems of wisdom i took from the podcast interview with martin reese was in the context of
*  the large hadron collider turning on and potentially swallowing the earth right and physicists worked
*  out all the probabilities and they said it's possible was very very very unlikely and people
*  said well it's destroying the earth even if it's possible at all you shouldn't do it and martin
*  reese's response was well it's possible but unlikely that you get free energy forever a
*  perpetual motion machine out of science that comes out of the lhc it's possible unlikely but possible
*  and the point is that the space of very very unlikely events is something that we don't have
*  a good handle on uh plus or minus so anyway this is getting far away from the preparation question
*  but i wish we had a better set of rules for being rational in these cases of extreme uncertainty and
*  extreme risk combined together and that's kind of what is going on in the prepper community where
*  they really are there are people out there who treat prepping for a big natural disaster as
*  something like that should take up an hour a day of your time which is probably way more than it
*  deserves honestly so there's some happy medium in there to be found okay holographic cosmology asks
*  a priority question we use two eyes to focus on one object's position to create the illusion of
*  depth we didn't always have this ability it had to evolve is it possible that we're looking at space
*  wrong could we be missing depth or other information that we need two or more eyes capable
*  of looking in two different positions at once in order to find you know never say never i would
*  say but my strong feeling is no that we're not missing something analogous to depth in the same
*  way and the reason why is because we've gone far far far beyond what our two eyes can tell us about
*  space we understand a lot about space we're able to do experiments in it the inverse square law
*  behavior of gravity and electromagnetism depends crucially on the fact that space is macroscopically
*  three-dimensional there's many many pieces that go into our current understanding of space any one
*  of which would go wrong if we were missing something dramatic like a whole new sense of
*  depth or something like that so our eyes were really useful back in the day but we're not
*  dependent on them in the same way to get our best scientific image of the world these days
*  lewis b says following up on the previous answers regarding falsifiability as a criterion for science
*  in a beyond falsifiability worldview where does the hypothesis of a supernatural god
*  fit philosophically i know you consider it a bad hypothesis but it is it a scientific one the
*  supernatural and gods are typically dispensed with as non-scientific because they are non-falsifiable
*  but it wouldn't seem you but it would seem you don't have this luxury is positing a god somehow
*  less scientific than hypothesizing what is beyond the edge of the observable universe or inside a
*  black hole so two things one i think you should read more carefully or or read the paper i wrote
*  on beyond falsifiability because the point is not that there was some idea that we agreed on
*  that scientific theories need to be falsifiable and we're changing that idea that is not the
*  what's going on what's going on is that there was this idea from pauper that involved falsifiability
*  as a demarcation criterion between scientific and non-scientific and it never was accepted
*  philosophers of science never had a period of time where most of them were on board with this
*  idea because it turns out the demarcating science from non-science is more subtle than that but at
*  the same time they were appreciative of what that idea was trying to get at and so it's not a matter
*  of saying we don't need falsifiability anymore it's a matter of saying okay falsifiability is
*  a step in the right direction but we need to do better and we're continuing to do better that's
*  the beyond that we're talking about in this sense we want theories that are empirically judged and
*  we want theories that are definite in what they say about what happens in the universe okay and
*  as far as that is concerned so the reaction in my paper is not against pauper who's just a step in
*  our understanding a better and better understanding of how science works but against scientists in the
*  current era who misuse pauper by being lazy you know they think that there's a motto that they
*  can put on a bumper sticker that tells them what a theory is scientific or not and that's just not
*  the world is just not that simple it's a little bit more complicated than that sorry so those
*  scientists need to do better at their philosophy of science and likewise there's a whole bunch of
*  atheists who are a tip who are similarly subject to oversimplifying things to get where they want
*  to go they want to go to the fact to the result that you shouldn't take theism seriously and so
*  they say well it's not like a scientific theory it's not falsifiable therefore we shouldn't
*  consider it you have never heard me say that i think that is lazy and silly to say those things
*  okay that's why as i said before i had a talk said saying god is not a good theory it did not say god
*  is not a theory god is a perfectly good theory it's a statement about the ontology of the world
*  saying there's more than just the physical in the world okay and we should judge that idea about
*  the physical world how in exactly the same way that we judge any other scientific theory one way
*  or the other we ask what predictions it makes what we should expect if it was true and we compare
*  those predictions against the world in which we live okay so i don't see any problem i've never
*  said that supernatural or gods are non-scientific i think the whole idea of what is called
*  methodological naturalism the idea that science starts by assuming natural explanations for
*  phenomena 100 wrong that is total totally bogus okay what science is is methodologically
*  empiricist it judges things by the predictions that those things make for the world so i think
*  that god makes predictions i think that if god existed the world would be a very different place
*  it would be very very noticeable if god existed that's the whole point that's why it's not a
*  very good theory kathy seger says michael dine wrote in his new book about weinberg's weak
*  anthropic principle just to explain the cosmological constant would require an absurd number of
*  different universes 10 to the power of 120 at least but far more if other constants of nature
*  are fixed this way and he wrote such a mode for explaining the world around us is just too much
*  to swallow would you as a person not try invoking a huge number a huge amount of worlds in quantum
*  mechanics be as hesitant as dine regarding the multiverse so i actually i mean i read michael's
*  book but i don't remember that exact line because you know i i know this stuff pretty well i skim
*  sometimes okay when reading popular physics books but i know that michael dine takes the
*  anthropic principle totally seriously himself including the necessary number of universes so
*  he might have been you know either describing a point of view that he temporarily had or maybe
*  describing the point of view of skeptics of the whole idea but he's absolutely willing
*  to consider this many universes personally you know when you say statements like an absurd number
*  of different universes i don't know how to respond to that what what counts as an absurd number of
*  different universes i recognize the difference between one universe and two universes you know
*  if you can get away with just one universe that would be better i mean in favor of that all else
*  being equal but i don't think you can all else being equal i think you have to make certain
*  sacrifices that are that are too far to go in order to make that happen but once you have two
*  then there's no difference in my mind between two and ten to the hundred and twenty or ten to the
*  ten to the ten to the ten to the ten to the hundred and twenty factorial like who cares it's a number
*  it's a big number don't worry about how it considers how it sounds to be absurd or ridiculous to your
*  puny little human brain i don't think that's something we should worry about that much
*  anita tomasic says does does state of thermodynamic equilibrium of the universe in which
*  does a state of thermodynamic equilibrium of the universe in which times arrow no longer exists
*  affect in any way our four-dimensional structure of space time i doubt it but i wonder how it looks
*  like highly hypothetically from a god-like point of view perspective of the block universe so i think
*  the answer is no if i understand the question correctly if the universe were in thermal
*  equilibrium four-dimensional space time would still be four-dimensional space time except there
*  would be no arrow of time so i always try to distinguish between time as a coordinate on
*  space time and the arrow of time which is the feature of the behavior of matter and stuff in
*  the universe which differentiates the past from the future you know there's no arrow of space
*  if you're out there in space floating in between the planets there's no difference between up down
*  left right forward backward but there's space space still exists you don't need an arrow for
*  something to exist the arrow of time is a feature of time but it is not time itself so time would
*  still exist in thermodynamic equilibrium in particular if you just imagine a box of gas as
*  a simple model right as we'd like to do when we do thermodynamics thought experiments if you had
*  a box of gas and thermodynamic equilibrium the macroscopic features of the box of the gas in the
*  box do not change with time you're in equilibrium but microscopically the particles are still moving
*  there's still time evolution there so time and space would still exist in the ordinary way
*  herbert burkowitz says i recently saw a reference to a particle called the anti-neutrino
*  that is true in fact you've seen references you've heard references earlier in this podcast
*  that stopped me in my tracks how can a particle with no charge possibly have an anti-particle
*  that will obliviate it so there's a short answer to this and a longer answer to this the short
*  answer is um it doesn't a neutrino does not have electric charge but a neutrino does have lepton
*  number and the lepton number can be positive or negative and the lepton number is conserved that's
*  why in this example of that's why it took me a while to get it right there but when a tau decays
*  to a muon okay so a tau has tau number as well as lepton number a muon has mu number as well as
*  uh lepton number so if a tau turns into a muon the lepton number is the same the um electric charge
*  is the same but tau number suddenly changed to muon number so that can't be right because they're
*  both conserved at least as far as we know therefore you need to have tau number carried away somehow
*  and it's carried away by a tau neutrino but that gives you extra lepton number so you need uh to
*  get rid of the lepton number to cancel it off and also to cancel off the extra muon number and you
*  do that by adding one anti-muon neutrino so and this is what is actually happening when you go
*  into the details i did a lot of this in my um higgs boson book the particle at the end of the
*  universe if you're interested so a tau actually decays into a muon a muon anti-neutrino and a tau
*  neutrino the longer answer is the word obliviate bothers me a little bit there because this idea
*  that every particle has an anti-particle that is defined by the thing that annihilates it
*  is way too simplistic what there are is a bunch of particles they interact and all those interactions
*  are in accord with the symmetries and conserved quantities of the standard model of particle
*  physics it is convenient to separate particles into particles and anti-particles but it is not
*  a fundamental feature of nature uh the existence the fact that there is a fundamental the fundamental
*  feature that exists is that certain kinds of particles that have quantities like spin like
*  a neutrino has better have anti-particles unless there is some fundamental breaking of the symmetry
*  um well let's put it this way once you have spin you can imagine anti-particles you don't need to
*  have them i'm hesitating because there are myorana theories of neutrinos where you could have some
*  kinds of neutrinos without anti-particles but that's a whole different kind complicated kind
*  of thing which proves my point my point is that there's not a simple distinction into particles
*  and anti-particles in nature i mean photons right photons do they not have an anti-particle or are
*  they their own anti-particle the real answer is it's more complicated than that the anti-particle
*  particle distinction is not the be all and end all of this way of talking peter bamber says i
*  understand that in general relativity time is not absolute that the passage of time at different
*  points in space varies because of mass energy densities between and around the points i've also
*  heard it said that in quantum mechanics time is a fixed backdrop along which wave functions evolve
*  are these views incompatible and if so is this one of the reasons why gr and qm are difficult to
*  combine in a single theory so i'm going to say no to a bunch of things here and it's not your
*  fault peter you've been misled by the world it's not true that the passage of time at different
*  points in space varies the passage of time is always one second per second it is never two
*  seconds per second i don't even know what that would mean the true fact in relativity whether
*  special or general is that there can be different amounts of time elapsed if you take different
*  paths between the same two events so in special relativity that happens because one path is sort
*  of curvy you zoom out there in a spaceship and zoom back and the other one is straight
*  whereas in general relativity they can both be pretty straight as long as one of them hangs out
*  in a strong gravitational field sometimes this set of words is sort of mangled into saying
*  that the rate of time flows differently at different points but i think that's just a bad
*  way of thinking about it having said all that as far as quantum mechanics and gravity are concerned
*  this is related to a problem but this is not the problem you know in general relativity there is no
*  obvious choice of time parameter in the same way that there is in special relativity or in well in
*  newtonian mechanics there's a perfectly obvious choice of time parameter because there's only one
*  in special relativity there's a set of different choices you can make depending on different
*  inertial reference frames but they're all on an equal footing they're all equally good
*  for whatever problem you want in general relativity there's an infinitely bigger set
*  of different things you can use but again they're all fine you know people in general relativity
*  talk about many-fingered time so time can sort of you can move your slicing of the universe in
*  different ways in different regions it's all fine that's not really one of the fundamental issues
*  in quantum gravity it's closely related to a fundamental issue which is called the problem
*  of time which is that if you just naively quantize general relativity for a closed
*  universe with zero energy like we were talking about there's no time evolution at all in that
*  theory so you have to get time being emergent and you can try to do that it's tricky there are
*  details that's for a whole other podcast maybe david boardman says is there a way to describe
*  what a low entropy universe at the time of the big bang looks like compared to a higher entropy
*  situation if by the time if what you mean by the universe at the time of the big bang is a very
*  hot dense rapidly expanding state the thing that makes it low entropy is that is it is
*  extraordinarily smooth right it's homogeneous the same amount of stuff at every different point
*  in the universe to a very good approximation that is not what you would expect in a high entropy
*  state because gravity is really really important right if you have a bunch of particles in space
*  and you just let them evolve under gravity they will come together they will squeeze together and
*  they become more inhomogeneous they will not even out because gravity sort of works in that direction
*  so a high entropy version of the early universe would have been wildly fluctuating from place to
*  place not at all small that's smooth not all smooth sorry that smoothness is the crucial ingredient
*  samuel benjamin says i've noticed from your books and podcasts that you like to use the term lucy
*  goosey see now you've now you told me that i like to use that now i'm never going to use it again
*  i'm going to be self-conscious but okay probably you're right samuel continues please can i get a
*  shout out for my cats lucy and goose they're sisters who we've had since eight weeks old
*  lucy is a more conventional cat in her behavior whilst goose is i think more like ariel she likes
*  to lie in her bath after it's drained much like ariel's morning shower routine so shout out to
*  lucy and goose how you doing lng what are your thoughts samuel continues on giving animals the
*  same rights as humans do you think this would be sensible and or practical so at face value if i
*  just take your question as you've asked it uh no i think that'd be crazy giving animals the same
*  rights as humans you know ants are animals i don't want to give ants the same rights as humans i
*  don't want them to vote i don't want them to be able to drive there's a million ways in which i
*  don't want to give animals and humans the same rights now probably you're thinking about animals
*  that are a little bit closer to human beings behaviorally or evolutionarily like cats and
*  dogs or chimps or pigs or something like that and and i am a big believer that it's fuzzy right that
*  there's no hard bright line there either between animals that deserve rights and animals that don't
*  and there could be different rights that are deserved by different groups of animals uh as
*  i've sometimes mentioned before to me like the single most crucial thing that makes human beings
*  special is the ability to as a species not every you know people can have brain damage and things
*  like that but as a species we have the ability to conceptualize the future in a more intricate
*  way than other species do we have the ability to bargain on the basis of future rewards to
*  suggest hypothetical situations to talk about them symbolically make agreements with each other
*  contracts and all that stuff and we and that ability brings with it the ability to sort of
*  be sad or be angry or be disturbed in some way if our future is threatened
*  in ways that i don't think other animals have maybe they have some and maybe i'm wrong maybe
*  future research shows that i'm wrong in which case we update and we change our minds but
*  that's the most important thing to me and i think that's an important distinction all these
*  distinctions are important again i i think that a statement like and i know you weren't trying to
*  say this but if someone were to say give animals the same rights as humans just way too simplistic
*  i think it the reality is going to be much more complicated than that and we need to
*  understand and appreciate those complications and deal with them roll up our sleeves and try to
*  figure out what to do with them robert henderson says my impression is that it's not necessary to
*  get into quantum field theory when thinking about quantum theories foundational questions that
*  non-relativistic quantum mechanics is sufficient is that so and if it is can you say why given the
*  questions around locality and the nature of space and time seem to be relevant to interpretational
*  questions well you know again yes and no is it necessary to get into quantum field theory the
*  quantum field theory is a version of quantum mechanics okay it's not a separate thing it's
*  not like the successor to quantum mechanics it's a successor to non-relativistic quantum mechanics
*  quantum relativistic quantum field theory in particular there's also non-relativistic
*  field theories but usually we take a shortcut and and refer to non-relativistic quantum mechanics
*  versus relativistic quantum field theory and anyway you know if there are foundational issues
*  with quantum theory in general those foundational questions matter just as much for quantum field
*  theory and just as much for non-relativistic quantum mechanics so if you take the idea that
*  non-relativistic quantum mechanics has a lot less sort of mathematical baggage that it carries
*  around with it then you can focus in on the foundational questions better by thinking about
*  that context than you would in quantum field theory quantum field theory has its own special
*  problems there's extra infinities as you may have heard so you have to renormalize and whatever
*  and when you get to the axiomatic level it's harder to make sense of those theories
*  but those are separate theories than what we normally think of as like the measurement
*  problem or the ontology problems of quantum theory in general now as you say there are
*  questions about locality and nature of space and time that are common to the foundations
*  of quantum mechanics and to relativity so maybe people are making a mistake by focusing on
*  non-relativistic quantum mechanics i think that they are making a mistake in it but in a subtle
*  and sort of sideways way it's not that it's a mistake per se to think about non-relativistic
*  quantum mechanics but non-relativistic quantum mechanics is formulated in a fixed space-time
*  background the newtonian space-time background in particular and so i think it's just easy too easy
*  to sort of take for granted the structure of space-time that that set of assumptions gives you
*  rather than really thinking about what life would be like without that set of foundations to lean
*  on right and so i think that you know when people talk about locality i mean let's put it this way
*  there's a lot of people in the world of the foundations of quantum mechanics who say you
*  know make a big deal out of bell's inequality and say like this is evidence for non-locality
*  and say this is the most profound result we ever have in the history of physics etc etc
*  because it's violating locality and einstein cared about locality a lot and and my attitude
*  is if you have quantum gravity you certainly don't have locality you shouldn't have locality you
*  can't you're if you think about a path integral you're summing over many different space-time
*  geometries there's no way to pinpoint a single point in space uniquely in all those different
*  geometries at the same time so the question is not from from my point of view as someone who cares
*  about gravity and space-time the question we should be asking is not oh my goodness physics is
*  non-local what are we going to do about it the question we should ask is why in the world does
*  physics look local as much as it does since gravity quantum gravity anyway clearly should
*  not be local so that's a good question i don't think we give enough attention to that so in
*  that sense i think you're completely right uh people are missing something by focusing on
*  non-relativistic qm okay the last question for today's ama for this month's ama bogdan
*  vina tuaru says russia has never given up in the last 30 years since the collapse of the ussr in
*  the hope that europe should remain divided even against its will it seems to me more than a war
*  against ukraine it is a war against the free world perhaps the most difficult test for democracy
*  is it possible for people to understand what a valuable gift democracy is and to make us truly
*  appreciate and protect it as never before so look i'm not an expert on russian history or european
*  history or asian history or international relations or any of those things so anything
*  i say as usual and for a question like this take with a grain of salt but but let me let me
*  distinguish between two things going on here russia is a lot of democracy you know we live
*  in a world where democracy has such good resonance in people's minds that even countries that are
*  clearly not democracies pretend to be democracies ukraine really is a democracy there's little
*  there's a little meme going around that drives this home you know who was the leader of russia
*  and ukraine and i think it was bellow russia also you know 20 years ago 15 years ago 10 years ago
*  five years ago now for the ukraine it's different in every single segment and for russia it's the
*  same in every single segment that's the sign of not being a democracy the opposition party never
*  wins that's what means you're not really in a democracy okay in some very real sense it is a
*  threat to democracy that a non-democracy like russia can invade and conquer or attempt to a
*  democracy like the ukraine and that is bad and we should fight against it but the long-term way
*  to fight against it is not to you know erect barriers to autocratic regimes invading democracies
*  but to not have any autocratic regimes to spread democracy worldwide so as much as it is in some
*  sense of threat to democracy when russia invades the ukraine and as much as a tragedy it is in a
*  lot of real ways the things that worry me about democracy are not being invaded by autocracies
*  but internal collapses right there are plenty of countries that have been democracies and stopped
*  being democracies and there's no guarantee whatsoever that the united states or canada
*  or iceland or uk or france or whatever could not be one of those countries down the line
*  and part of it is that there are powerful populist forces that want to use rhetoric
*  and technology and misinformation and resentment and alienation among people who are not doing
*  well in different countries to gain power in ways that have zero respect for democracy
*  you know there's no question for any fair-minded observer that the republican party here in the
*  united states is much less interested in the trappings of democracy than it used to be it
*  used to be that as much as you know you might have disagreed and i did disagree with with
*  republicans on various political issues we still stuck with the institutions of democracy fairly
*  straightforwardly you know they they would try to suppress votes by all means but there was still
*  some feeling that you know if the election went one way you had to stick with it right and that's
*  gone away and to a very large degree you know some large number of republicans still don't think that
*  joe biden won the election in the united states that's the danger and the real danger is that
*  it's not just rhetoric that the people who think this way tried to overthrow the election they
*  sent in fake authorizations of electoral ballots right to the national archives to try to get on
*  the record that trump won the election in different states even though he didn't and they are now
*  trying to take over state houses and and judges and local election boards so that if it happens
*  again they can get away with it that's the worry that i would have about democracy okay i mean the
*  democracy is falling and this is just the one i'm familiar with the united states obviously other
*  countries have their own problems but democracies can very easily collapse from within side and
*  furthermore just to be fair i don't think this is a both sides issue it's not like both sides do it
*  equally badly but both sides have their problems and to be in favor of democracy means to give up
*  some of what you want right because if you're in favor of democracy you're saying that there's
*  going to be a majority vote and you're going to stick with it even if you don't like it
*  now there has to be protection from minority rights etc and that's important but to enter
*  into democracy is to enter in the possibility that you will not get what you want and there's
*  just an increasing number of people of all political persuasions who just don't think that way
*  anymore they're not willing to make the effort to gain power by trying to persuade people who
*  don't agree with them to go along with their policies they want to use some other mechanism
*  democracy is hard it's hard to make it work and you know again you can be like cynical and say
*  well it's never worked blah blah blah fine but it can work to different degrees it can work more or
*  less and it's is a lot less that we could have democracy here in the united states than we do
*  right now and i'm very i'm very worried that that might actually happen what i am cheered by
*  is among other things in the world i am just cheered by those ukrainians you know i feel very
*  bad for them but those people are fighting for their country and for democracy and for their
*  sovereignty and they are doing so with enormous courage and in a way that just has garnered
*  respect of the whole world there's another footnote here which is of course that we in the west tend
*  to pay a lot more attention when white people are being attacked than when people of color are being
*  attacked so we do not give fair media coverage to these kinds of tragedies going on worldwide and
*  there are plenty of others other than in the ukraine but that does not take away from the
*  tragedy that is going on in the ukraine and the fact that their story has been very inspirational
*  and they brought together people around the world against the authoritarian regime that is trying
*  to take them over so you know hopefully people start taking seriously yeah some people obviously
*  have for a long time but more people start taking seriously the fact that democracy is not guaranteed
*  the fact that it's hard work the fact that it requires persuasion and cooperation and compromise
*  and coalition building and you can't just stamp your foot and get what you want that's what
*  democracy is all about and to take seriously the fact that the combination of democracy and
*  capitalism can leave some people in the lurch can leave some people not prospering even though the
*  gdp goes up a lot of people are not participating in that wealth that's a problem and a good
*  functioning long-term healthy democracy will be good for everybody and and that's a that again
*  doesn't happen automatically you got to work at it i do think it's possible i am optimistic about
*  the prospects in the sense of i do think it is possible to imagine functioning flourishing
*  democratic institutions in places like europe in the united states and everywhere else in the world
*  that not only give people a vote but give people economic opportunity and give people the rights
*  that they should all have as human beings and with that slightly optimistic note let's call it an end
*  for this month my voice is giving out but thanks again for supporting the mindscape podcast
*  hope next month won't be late but you know you never know it's in the future very hard to make
*  predictions about the future take care bye
*  you
