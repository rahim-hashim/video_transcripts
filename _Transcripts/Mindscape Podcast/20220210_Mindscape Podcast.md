Welcome to the February 2022 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

In the intro I mention The Biggest Ideas in the Universe: Space, Time, and Motion, my new book coming out in September 2022. Feel free to pre-order now. https://www.amazon.com/Biggest-Ideas-Universe-Space-Motion/dp/0593186583/

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | February 2022
**Mindscape Podcast:** [February 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKaTVWMHJHI)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the February 2022 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll. It's been a while since we've done an AMA, since I do them every
*  month except for January. So the last one we did was the beginning of December. And things have
*  happened, right? I was in Boston last time we were doing an AMA, and now I'm back in Los Angeles.
*  I have handed in the draft manuscript for my next book, which will be volume one of the biggest
*  ideas in the universe series. Volume one is going to be called Space, Time, and Motion,
*  and that's basically classical physics, broadly construed. So for those of you who don't know,
*  the biggest ideas gimmick is I'm going to be teaching what I consider to be the biggest ideas
*  in physics, even though I say it's in the universe, it's mostly physics we're talking about,
*  a little bit of math in there. And the gimmick is that you aren't supposed to know any math or
*  physics coming in, it is for a very broad audience, but I will teach you the math. So this is going to
*  be a textbook that, not a textbook, sorry, certainly not a textbook, a book, a trade book, a popular book
*  that is not afraid of doing the equations. And the trick there is that I'm not trying to teach
*  you how to be a physicist. I'm not teaching you how to solve the equations like a working physicist
*  or mathematician would have to do. I just want you to understand what the equations are saying,
*  and that's actually enormously easier as it turns out. So I will teach you what a derivative is and
*  what an integral is and what vectors are and what tensors are. And with that, we'll go pretty far.
*  We go through Newtonian mechanics, of course, but also Hamiltonian mechanics, Lagrangian mechanics,
*  and the principle of least action, special relativity, general relativity, Einstein's
*  equation, black holes, the Schwarzschild solution, with the equations there. So you have to be a
*  little bit interested, a little bit motivated to do it, but I've been trying really, really hard to
*  make it as understandable as I can. It certainly requires some effort on the part of the reader,
*  but I think that if you're willing to put in the effort, almost anyone should be able to grasp this
*  stuff at a real quantitative level. I mean, there's two obvious comparison books out there
*  already. One is Leonard Susskind's series on the theoretical minimum. The difference between my
*  approach and Susskind's is that he is kind of doing a more or less standard physics curriculum
*  kind of thing. Here is Newtonian mechanics, and there is electromagnetism, there's special
*  relativity, and quantum mechanics, and so forth. So the topics are a little bit different because
*  I can go faster because I don't need to worry about teaching you to be a working physicist,
*  right? So it's not just physics 101, physics 102, et cetera. I can be a little bit more
*  philosophical, talk about big picture ideas, about space and time and what have you, but I can also
*  get up to black holes pretty easily, which never happens. General relativity, as far as I know,
*  is not part of the theoretical minimum series. And certainly in this is only volume one of my
*  series, volume two, et cetera, will have quantum field theory and other things like that that are
*  not in Susskind's books. As awesome as they are, I love those books, but it's a different kind of
*  thing. The other obvious comparison is with Roger Penrose's book, The Road to Reality,
*  which does do a lot of things. I would say it does it in a slightly quirky way. What can I tell you?
*  Again, a brilliant, wonderful book. I think it'd be hard for most people who didn't really know
*  the math ahead of time to start from the beginning and go through that. So I'm both trying to be
*  super duper pedagogical and understandable, and also trying to get to modern physics. I want you
*  to know the basic ideas that a second year graduate student in theoretical physics would know. You're
*  not as facile, not as deep as a graduate student who's doing problem sets all the time, but you
*  will hear the words and understand them and know what they mean and be able to look at the equations
*  that bring those words to rigorous life and understand those as well. That's the idea.
*  Anyway, so it is scheduled to come out in September of this year. There's already an Amazon page.
*  If you want to go check it out, the cover is not available yet, but the book is there. You
*  could pre-order it. We encourage people to pre-order the books. That always gets people excited,
*  bookstores, et cetera. So anyway, what I was saying was I handed in the manuscript early
*  December. My editor read it, got comments back to me late December. I've made revisions on it
*  and handed those in, and I handed those in just a couple days ago. That's why this AMA is getting
*  to you a little bit later than I would like, because I've been working on edits for the book.
*  And it's very exciting. Sometimes when you're explaining something and you think you got it
*  right and it's understandable, it's a really, really good feeling. Other times I'm like,
*  are they really going to understand raising and lowering indices? This is weird. This is a little
*  bit of abstraction that you don't usually get in typical physics books. But I think that just
*  knowing what derivatives are, what partial derivatives are, which you need to get to
*  Hamiltonian mechanics, it really changes your views on life. And I want to share it more widely.
*  So even if the physics in this series of books is hit or miss, hopefully you will appreciate
*  the mathematical language and concepts that are used there, especially if you're not a professional
*  physicist. Hopefully it will be useful. That's the idea. Anyway, I just wanted to get that
*  off my chest to explain to you why this AMA is a couple days late. And I think that's all I wanted
*  to say about that. So for those of you who don't know, for those of you who are new to this whole
*  process, these Ask Me Anything episodes happen 11 times a year every month other than January.
*  And the questions are asked by Patreon supporters of Mindscape. So you can go to patreon.com
*  Sean M. Carroll, if you want to become a Patreon supporter. If you do become a Patreon supporter,
*  you get ad free versions of the regular podcasts. Plus you get to ask questions here at the AMA.
*  I don't get to answer everyone's question. Sorry about that. They're all usually good,
*  but sometimes I just don't have anything interesting to say. That's usually why I leave
*  the question out. I'm just not inspired to say anything interesting about that. And who wants,
*  I don't want to waste people's time by reading a question and saying, no, I don't have anything
*  interesting to say about it or insult the question or I'd rather just skip that question entirely.
*  Feel free to try again the next month. I'm not guaranteeing that I will do it next month,
*  but you can keep trying. There's no rule about trying again and again. Since it's been a couple
*  of months since you've done it, I will try to go a little bit longer this time. I know I already go
*  pretty long. I do have a tendency to do that, but we got to get some more questions in there.
*  So let's stop wasting our time. Let's go. Rodrigo Nader says, I always tend to understand
*  the emergence phenomenon as a consequence of pattern recognition. The cream coffee example
*  shows that after mixing many different combinations of particles look the same.
*  A pattern emerges to us. Maybe an alien life form who recognizes completely different sorts
*  of patterns would see different macroscopic states after mixing. Is emergence really a property of
*  nature? Could you give some other examples to clarify that? So I think it's a very important
*  question because I think a lot of people do have exactly the impression that you have,
*  Rodrigo, but I think it's not correct. I would have to disagree with this.
*  That is why Dan Dennett calls emergence real patterns. Is the word real there that really
*  matters? It's not an observer dependent phenomenon for a couple of reasons. One reason is that there
*  aren't any aliens or any robots or anything like that that will see radically different things
*  when they look at the cream and the coffee mixing together than we human beings do. It could be a
*  little bit different if they're subject or if they're sensitive to different wavelengths of
*  light or something like that, but it will always be the case that only some tiny number of photons,
*  relatively speaking, are carrying information from the cream and coffee to your eyeball.
*  Way, way insufficient to give you access to the specific locations and velocities of all the
*  molecules of cream and coffee. So there's a physical fact about what is observably accessible
*  to you that points us in the direction of coarse graining the system in a certain way. The other
*  thing, which is even way more important, I would say, or also very important, is that the information
*  you do get is useful. It's the information you need, even though it is coarse grained, to say
*  something about what will happen next. So in other words, the best example ever of emergence
*  is the relationship between kinetic theory of atoms and molecules and fluid mechanics or the
*  gas mechanics, if you want. You can take a box of gas, you can describe it in terms of atoms,
*  or you can describe it in terms of a fluid, and that's an emergence phenomenon. The fluid description
*  is completely different. Its ontology is different. It says there's a fluid in the box as opposed to
*  the atomic description that says there's a collection of particles in the box, and that
*  there is a perfectly well-known map from the set of configurations in the atomic description
*  to a set of configurations in the fluid description. You can coarse grain very,
*  very literally. That's not always possible, but in the box of gas it is. And finally,
*  the information that you're left with by that coarse graining, namely, let's say you pick some
*  coarse graining size, you know, cubic millimeter or whatever, in every cubic millimeter of the box
*  you have a temperature, a density, pressure, things like that, and that information is enough
*  to predict how the gas will behave to very, very good accuracy. That's what you do when you model
*  the climate or the atmosphere, right, or when you're modeling jet exhaust or anything like that.
*  You're doing fluid mechanics even though you know it's really atoms underneath. And that is an
*  objectively true fact that even though you have a tiny, tiny fraction of all the microscopic
*  information in the system, it is still enough to make interesting predictions. If you took random
*  subsets of the information, you would not be able to use that to make interesting predictions, but
*  the particular information you get from that coarse graining operation does give you enough
*  information to make predictions. That's a crucial aspect of emergence. I don't think we have
*  the once and for all theory of everything as far as emergence is concerned, a theory of
*  emergence everything, but I think these two aspects are both crucial and there and non-generic. You
*  wouldn't expect necessarily that you could observe a certain subset of the information of the system
*  and have that information be enough to predict what's going to happen next in general. If you
*  just had random things you could observe, but in the real world, we see it again and again. So that's
*  a very deep feature of the real world that I think calls out for some kind of explanation.
*  Rob Gryber says, I've been listening to early episodes of the podcast and really enjoyed your
*  conversation with Cornell West. My question for you relates to one of Professor West's closing
*  comments. You ask him, what is it that unsettles you? I won't quote his answer entirely, but he
*  starts with, well, it's what hangs in my closet and is one of the themes of my writings really
*  for the last 30 years, which is nihilism. And it comes in different forms. There's secular forms
*  of it. There's religious forms. He goes on to link the idea of nihilism today to the disconnectedness
*  of the late modern world. It's all about posing, posturing, spectacle image,
*  trying to manipulate in order to pursue our careers, our next opportunity. I'd be curious
*  to hear what you thought of that exchange, but more I'd like to put that question to you. In
*  these strange pre-post pandemic times, as politics and social media pull apart, even as science and
*  innovation blows forward, what unsettles you and what gives you hope? Yeah, no, this is a great
*  question. It's a very thoughtful question. I'm sure I'm not going to be able to do justice to it.
*  It's not something I've really thought carefully about, but I can give you my immediate
*  impressions. I get the fretting about nihilism, nihilism just being a conviction that everything
*  is meaningless, nothing really matters, etc. This is part of why I wrote the big picture to
*  establish you don't need to be nihilist even if you're a naturalist. I guess I would worry a
*  little bit, or I would wonder, let's put it that way, how accurate the worry is that nihilism is
*  something connected to the modern world specifically. There's more nihilism now than there was before.
*  I guess it depends on what you mean by nihilism. There is a sort of disenchantment in our view of
*  the world. We used to have a picture of the world that was much more convinced that there were
*  spirits and purposes and natures out there in the world, and those have gone away.
*  There never were such spirits or purposes. That was wrong, and I'm glad to be correct.
*  I'm glad to have improved our understanding of the world. I don't consider that to be a loss.
*  I consider that the real purposes and meanings that are there in the world come from human beings,
*  just as they always did. I would have to see a careful scholarly investigation into this
*  question of has nihilism become more of a problem in the modern world than it was, or
*  if it is more of a problem, is it a worse problem than what it has replaced? Let's put it that way.
*  Your harder question is what is it that unsettles me? That's what I was hoping no one would ask.
*  But look, I'm not going to say anything original or new. I talk about the things that
*  unsettle me all the time. I guess if I have to pick one, it's the gradual disintegration of our
*  ability to act like a democracy. I know that people are going to say that we never really worry
*  democracy, etc. Fine. Okay. I mean, democracy in the United States and elsewhere in the world has
*  always been sub-ideal. It's always fallen short of what you might want it to be. It's still better,
*  in my mind, than any of the alternatives. I'm extraordinarily worried that it's not going to
*  last much longer. We know it doesn't always last. Democracy appears and disappears historically,
*  and there's no reason to think that we should necessarily be different.
*  I also think it's perfectly obvious that here in the United States, if you have Republicans and
*  Democrats, one side is far and away more responsible for the threats to democracy,
*  namely the Republicans, in case you're wondering, than the Democrats are. But I absolutely think
*  that all sides are falling short in worrisome ways, in the following sense, that if you think
*  that democracy is good, if you want it to work, if you want it to be a success, you have to be
*  committed to the ideal of working with people with whom you disagree. That's the ideal that I think
*  is just disappearing on both sides. It will always be true that some people with whom you disagree,
*  you disagree with them so strongly that they're not, in any sense, partners. They are just the enemy.
*  You can only fight them. You're not trying to work with them. But if that's most other people,
*  or if that's half the country, then you don't have a functioning democracy, and you won't.
*  If you consider half the country to be your enemy, then there's no way for democracy to work under
*  those circumstances. And I'm worried that more and more people think that way on both sides.
*  If you're pro-democracy, the question you should be asking yourself is,
*  how far can someone go to be on the other side, be on the side I disagree with, and yet I will still
*  work with them? And this is not an easy question. I'm not trying to simplify it. We can always
*  remember the podcast with Tien Nguyen, where he warns you against oversimplifying, looking for
*  false clarity in these complicated social situations. It's not simple to say these people
*  are not worth engaging with, and these people are. But the point I'm making is, you have to be able
*  to engage with people who you don't like, who you don't agree with. But nevertheless, they're your
*  fellow citizens, and you have to work with them somehow. And that's becoming increasingly harder.
*  You don't make peace treaties with your friends. You make peace treaties with your enemies.
*  That's my biggest worry. That's what unsettles me. In many ways, people don't want to
*  talk to each other. They don't want to understand each other. They don't want to agree to disagree.
*  They just want to fight, and they just want to have a quote unquote democracy by assuming that
*  their views should be the ones everyone votes for. Now, of course, it's also okay in the context of
*  democracy to work to change people's minds. That's crucially important. That's a very high
*  priority thing to do. So it's not only that you have to work with people you disagree with, but
*  you have to try to convince them to agree with you. But that second thing, convincing them to agree
*  with you, won't always work. There are people with fundamentally different values, and we have to be
*  devoted to finding a way to live together. I'm not so sure we are devoted that way. I'm not even
*  so sure that we try to attain that goal anymore. That kind of unsettles me. You also ask what gives
*  me hope. Let me give you a very silly answer and self-serving answer. What gives me hope is that
*  so many people listen to podcasts like this. And not just because it's my podcast. What gives me
*  hope is that I do find empirically that when you give people good ideas, good information,
*  thoughtful things to chew over, they are surprisingly interested in tackling big ideas.
*  I think that people like to say that other people are just stupid and they just want to watch reality
*  shows or whatever. And sometimes they do. I don't even mind watching a reality show in the right
*  place, right time. What is it? MasterChef Jr. Come on. This is genius. I would always watch
*  MasterChef Jr. But it can't be everything that you do. And I think that we underestimate the public
*  sometimes in terms of intellectual engagement. That's one of the reasons why I'm writing the
*  book. The biggest ideas books I'm trying to provide, it's not going to be number one bestseller
*  given what is inside the book. But I think that there are more people than we usually think who
*  are willing to dig into equations and learn some physics. Likewise, I think there are more people
*  than we usually think who are willing to think hard about philosophy or politics or economics
*  or the climate or whatever. That's what gives me hope is that when we give people the chance to
*  engage with ideas in thoughtful ways, more than you might guess, they leap at the chance.
*  All right. Bruno Teixeira says, I don't understand what you mean by maybe dark energy is just the
*  cosmological constant, especially when opposed to other hypotheses related to quantum fields.
*  Isn't GR a classical emergent description of a fundamentally quantum phenomenon?
*  When we figure out quantum gravity, won't dark energy be something in that model?
*  Well, I mean, maybe. Sure. I don't know what quantum gravity is yet. So that's hard to predict
*  exactly what's going to happen. But that is completely compatible with dark energy being
*  the cosmological constant. Like you just said, GR is a classical emergent description of a
*  fundamentally quantum phenomenon. But emergent descriptions can be correct. General relativity
*  is a very, very good fit for what happens in cosmology. So when I say dark energy is just
*  the cosmological constant, I mean, at the level of emergent description where we're describing
*  the universe as a curved space-time obeying the rules of general relativity, I think the
*  vacuum energy, the dark energy is going to be a cosmological constant rather than
*  a modification of Einstein's equation or some dynamical thing or something like that.
*  What the question you're asking is, how do we explain that value of the emergent cosmological
*  constant at some deeper quantum level? That I don't know. I would love to know that. If I knew
*  that, I'd be writing a paper on that. Don't have any good ideas right now. Paul Torek says,
*  Joshua Green claimed that when we use slow, careful moral thought processes rather than
*  quick-gut reactions, we'll get utilitarian conclusions. Thus, ethics get simplified to
*  a single dimension of happiness. But does that preference for simple theories only make sense
*  in one view's morality as a platonic realm out there independent of human concerns? How plausible
*  is it to you as a moral constructivist that morality would be so vastly simpler than the
*  human beings who construct it? Well, I think there's a couple of parts of that question that
*  I would worry that are not quite an accurate description. I don't think that if you ask Josh
*  Green what he meant by utilitarianism, he would say ethics get simplified to a single dimension
*  of happiness. I think he would say it's much more nuanced than that. Now, it is true that
*  utilitarianism is based on the idea there is something called utility that we try to maximize.
*  But by itself, that statement, there's a number called utility we try to maximize, is almost
*  content-free. Because if you have any rules for any process of making a decision,
*  right? Should I go left or right? Should I save this person from drowning or save myself? Whatever.
*  Should I push the lever on the trolley problem? Any decision-making algorithm can always mathematically
*  be cast as maximizing some number, and then you can call that utility, right? So it's almost an
*  empty statement to say you should maximize some number called utility until you tell people what
*  the utility is. And it's true that back in the early days of utilitarianism, it was thought to be
*  happiness or something like that. But more modern sophisticated approaches to utilitarianism, or
*  even going back to John Stuart Mill, they had more sophisticated approaches for what was meant
*  by utility. Now, one of the reasons why I'm skeptical of utilitarianism myself is because
*  even though you can be more sophisticated in defining utility, you're still imagining in
*  practice, in utilitarian practice, you're still imagining that there is some quantity that you can
*  add up over different people, right? So this person has a certain utility, that person has
*  a certain utility, etc. This action has a certain utility, you just add them up and maximize that.
*  So it's a little bit more specific than just saying you're maximizing something. There's
*  some procedure finding this thing that you're maximizing. That's what I'm a little bit skeptical
*  about, whether there's some quantity that I can compare one person's utility to another person's
*  utility in a way that I could add them together in some linear fashion. That worries me about that
*  particular step. But one of the points that Josh made, which I thought was an interesting and
*  important one, is that in these more sophisticated versions of utilitarianism, it can almost seem like
*  virtue ethics or deontology or something like that, depending on where you get your utility from.
*  Maybe you get your utility from following rules. If you literally said that all of my utility comes
*  from following these rules and not breaking them, then you're both a utilitarian and a
*  deontological moral person at the same time. That sense is that utilitarianism is pretty flexible
*  and you can imagine versions, a lot of different versions of it. On the one hand, that makes me
*  more sympathetic to the idea that it might work. On the other hand, it makes it much more loosey
*  goosey and maybe less useful because we don't necessarily have pinned down exactly what we mean
*  by utility. So anyway, my answer to your question is I don't think it's necessarily true
*  that utilitarian morality is so vastly simple as you make it out to be. That's not to say that I
*  think it's a useful way of thinking about things, but it's potentially useful. Let's put it that way.
*  I think that I would grant them that. Paul Briddick says, the determinist approach proposes that all
*  behavior has a cause and is thus predictable and therefore free will is an illusion. A theoretical
*  supercomputer is programmed to account for all particle behavior in the vein of Laplace's demon
*  and predict the future of all behaviors going forward in the universe. If this computer predicts
*  you will drink coffee for breakfast tomorrow, are you powerless to switch to tea? So there's a whole
*  bunch of things going on here, packed into a small package, so let me unpack a little bit.
*  Determinism is probably not right as an operational question for our universe. First off,
*  there is quantum mechanics. We have no clue whatsoever. In fact, we have very strong
*  evidence that it's not possible to have a complete quantum state description of the universe and
*  deterministically predict what will happen next, what will be observed next. All of the indications
*  that you can't do that. There's some intrinsic randomness there. Now, some of us, like myself,
*  believe that there is a deeper explanation that involves not just the world we observe,
*  but other worlds also. And the quantum state of the whole picture is deterministic,
*  but that doesn't help you make predictions for what's going to happen next. And it's still
*  implausible in practice. Other people who I don't agree with, but they're out there, some of my best
*  friends think there's only one world, but there's some hidden way that there is information that
*  does determinously predict what will happen next. But even those people will be very quick to say,
*  you don't know and will never will know what that information is. So to grant you the question,
*  we have to imagine that there is a version of quantum mechanics that really is deterministic
*  and that you're telling your theoretical supercomputer information about the universe
*  that no human being will ever be able to know. Okay, so let's say that. And furthermore,
*  we have to imagine that your theoretical supercomputer is not within the universe.
*  There are problems with self-reference. Janine Ismail just wrote a very interesting article
*  Eon online that you can read about this. There are problems in principle with imagining a perfect
*  predictor within the universe that tries to predict the universe that it's within, because
*  it has to predict itself. And there are loops and paradoxes that it gets into. So again,
*  to make sense of your question, we have to imagine that not only are there deterministic laws that
*  are known to the computer, but the computer itself is outside our universe for whatever reason.
*  But if we grant you all that, then yes, I am powerless to switch to T. That would be my answer.
*  Thank you for your illuminating conversation with David Reich. You touched upon Indo-European
*  history and my question is about that. Are lay people in America and elsewhere aware of the
*  current cultural movement of Hindu nationalism? It is advertised as a revival of bygone glory,
*  but in reality, I find it to be rife with Jingoism exclusionism and a flagrant historical
*  revisionism that flies in the face of the academic consensus on archaeology, genetics, etc. I worry
*  for India, and I believe the entire civilized world should worry about such a counterproductive
*  phenomenon taking hold of a globally important democracy. It's a good question. I'm not really
*  familiar at a data-driven evidence-based level with how familiar Americans are with these
*  different questions. My suspicion is that they've heard of Hindu nationalism in India and they don't
*  like it. We have our own nationalism here. People wear these red hats saying, make America great
*  again and keep the immigrants out. Some of us think that our nationalism is terrible. Others
*  are all for it. But it's much easier to be horrified at other countries' nationalism, even if you think
*  your own country's nationalism is pretty awesome. I don't think that many Americans are in favor of
*  a resurgence of Hindu nationalism in India. We think that other countries should be open and
*  cosmopolitan and get along with all different sorts of cultures within their societies, even if we
*  have trouble living up to that. I agree. I don't have anything wise to say about this. I think
*  that India is a crucially important country for the world. I think that it has a mixed history
*  with democracy. It is a democracy, but not always a perfect one. Again, you could say the same thing
*  about the US. It is not as wealthy as the US or some European countries. There's every reason to
*  think that it should be in some global sense. You can imagine there's very understandable frustration
*  for why it's not. When you're in situations like that, where you don't think that your economy or
*  living conditions or your global power is as elevated as it should be, you take out your
*  frustrations in the wrong direction. Nationalism and populism are very common bad places for that
*  to go. I don't have any wisdom specific to India, but I can absolutely see the similarities between
*  what's happening there and what's happening to other places in the world. Preston Justice says,
*  I've just finished Stephen Pinker's new book, Rationality, What It Is, Why It Seems Scarce,
*  and Why It Matters. What are your thoughts on the arduous task of being more rational
*  amidst the constant storm of cognitive biases with which we each must contend? More precisely,
*  how can the average Josephine pragmatically increase their rationality points to avoid
*  the illogical and sometimes deadly acceptance of quackery and flapdoodle that perpetually surrounds
*  us? These are all good questions. These are constant questions. They're not going away.
*  We can all strive to be better at this. I know I work to try to be better at this. We have had
*  discussions here on Mindscape about precisely these questions, maybe most recently with Julia
*  Gallif who wrote a book on it on the Scout mindset. I like Julia's book in particular because
*  it is exactly addressed this question of how I can be more rational rather than why aren't other
*  people more rational? That's a very common book that people write a lot of the time.
*  But where I get off the train a little bit here is near the end of your question
*  where you're talking about quackery and flapdoodle. Flopdoodle. I don't know if
*  I've heard that one. I think it's flapdoodle. Anyway, nobody intentionally
*  accepts quackery and flapdoodle. They all think that they're being rational. There's a level of
*  irrationality that we usually associate with words like quackery and flapdoodle that is so irrational
*  that if you're spending your time worrying about your cognitive biases, you're probably not
*  susceptible to that particular brand of quackery and flapdoodle. But there are other kinds of
*  irrationality that you can be susceptible to even though you know that astrology is not correct or
*  Bigfoot doesn't exist or whatever. There are ways of justifying your choices, your attitude
*  towards other people that are deep down just as irrational but don't have the big shining neon
*  light saying this is quackery on them. I have no short and simple rules for doing that. One warning
*  sign is if people say, you know, cognitive biases sure are bad. I'm glad I don't have any.
*  Then you know that person is not being rational. If you think that you have no biases, that you're
*  completely objective, that you have no tribal affiliations or identities, you're not being
*  honest with yourself, right? Even if you think that you shouldn't, even if you think that you
*  should work to minimize those aspects of how you think, you have to admit that they're there and
*  stand up to them and recognize them rather than just deny their existence.
*  Recognizing what our biases are is certainly one of the biggest steps. One very obvious thing is
*  what beliefs are in your best interests, right? What are the things that you believe are true
*  which just happen to flatter your own view of yourself or make yourself look good, right?
*  Those are always the danger points. I don't want to get into specifics because every case is different
*  but read Julie's book or listen to that podcast. Herbert Berkowitz says, is CERN tourist friendly?
*  I think pretty much it is actually. CERN, the Giant Particle Accelerator Laboratory in outside
*  Geneva. In Geneva? Yeah, maybe part of it is in Geneva. I've visited several times CERN but of
*  course I've visited there as a physicist so I have not visited as a tourist so I'm not quite sure
*  how much there is to do. I know there are exhibits and things like that. They're absolutely
*  public available places but two things to note. Number one, you're not going to get to see a
*  particle detector. They're not going to take you down beneath the ground to see Atlas or CMS or
*  something like that because they're all sealed up or the physicists are working on them. Actually,
*  if you happen to be there while things are being renovated, while it's downtime and the machine is
*  opened up, then maybe you could but I still don't think that's a kind of public available thing.
*  There are exhibits, almost like museum kinds of exhibits. The other thing is that to the working
*  physicist, CERN is a bunch of offices, right? When I'm at CERN visiting the theory group,
*  it's not a place that any tourist would want to see. It doesn't look any different than visiting
*  Caltech or whatever. But again, there are public-facing sides of it so if you happen to
*  be in the area, I wouldn't visit Geneva just to visit CERN but if you're in Geneva, in between
*  looking at the watch factories and the banks and so forth and the lake, a visit to CERN would be
*  a lot of fun. Okay, I'm going to group two questions together here, which we sometimes do.
*  One is from Kathy Seeger who says, what actually happens during entanglement? As it is no classical
*  interaction of any kind, how can it best be described? Is it the same kind of process for
*  particles slash massless particles and local slash non-local or are there different types of
*  entanglement? And then George Robinson asks, what principle determines how and when quantum states
*  become entangled? I read sometimes particles get entangled, sometimes they don't, but what is the
*  theory of wave functions that says when and why the entanglement necessarily happens?
*  I worry that for both these questions, which are both basically asking how does entanglement happen,
*  I'm not going to give a very satisfying question or answer here because I don't know, there's
*  nothing, entanglement is kind of the natural state, right? So the point of quantum mechanics is that
*  unlike classical mechanics where you say I have a bunch of particles, every particle has a position,
*  every particle has a momentum. In quantum mechanics you say I have a bunch of particles,
*  every particle has a possible position that it could have, right? It could have a position that I
*  could possibly measure it to be in and the wave function assigns a number, a complex number,
*  to every possible configuration of all the particles. So nowhere in quantum mechanics is
*  there the idea that an individual particle should have its own separate wave function, right? There's
*  just a wave function for the whole collection. It's a very, very special case where you have
*  one particle where the wave function for all the particles takes the form, the wave function for
*  one particle times the wave function for all the others. Sometimes that happens, but that's kind of
*  very special. If you think about all the different ways that the big wave function could depend on
*  all the variables, that's a very specific, special way and that's the case where that first particle
*  is unentangled with the rest of the particles. So entanglement is by all means the generic case
*  in the space of all possible quantum goings on. That's hidden from us, that feature of quantum
*  mechanics is hidden from us in some sense because we live in a world which is big and macroscopic
*  and the things that we can observe are sort of deep into the classical regime where for all
*  intents and purposes the entanglement is negligible, okay? We don't see things carefully enough to
*  notice that they're entangled with other things. You wouldn't notice by looking at one, but you
*  could do complicated experiments looking at many and after the fact infer that there was some
*  entanglement there. So having said all that, when do things become entangled? Most of the time
*  is the answer. At the quantum level, most of the time if I have two electrons and I scatter them,
*  right? So two electrons will repel each other by the electromagnetic force. If they were classical
*  point particles, you would find out exactly what their positions were, exactly what their velocities
*  were and predict exactly how they would scatter. Since they're not, there is a wave function for
*  both the particles, a function of both their positions, okay? Let's say and I can start them
*  off as little wave packets. I can't localize the individual electrons perfectly, but they can be
*  almost localized. They can be like a bump in one area of space and the two bumps are heading toward
*  each other. But then what you predict when they scatter is not some definite angle at which they
*  scatter, but the wave function for the two of them becomes entangled. And there is sort of a
*  probability that one particle goes off in one direction and the other goes off the other and
*  the same thing is true for all the other directions. So instantly just from two charged particles
*  bumping into each other, entanglement has occurred. Or if one particle all by itself, like the Higgs
*  boson, let's say the Higgs or for that matter a pion, a Higgs boson or a neutral pion are both
*  cases of single particles. So there's no entanglement that you're talking about. You just
*  have one particle, nothing for it to entangle with, but it decays, okay? Both a photon, a pion and a
*  Higgs boson can decay into two photons moving off back to back. What direction are you moving off in?
*  I mean there's no way to pick a special direction because they're just single spinless particles
*  sitting there. The answer is they move off in every possible direction, the two photons that
*  are created, and they're entangled with each other. So you don't know which direction either
*  one photon is moving off in, but you know that if one photon is moving in one direction, the other
*  is moving in the opposite direction because the overall momentum is conserved. So the short answer
*  is entanglement happens all the time. The more difficult question, which I'm glad you didn't ask,
*  is why do things look unentangled to wee big macroscopic observers? But that has to do with
*  the classical limit and so forth and so on. I hope that's shedding some light on the question.
*  Fredrik Axlorn says, enough with the physics already. Good, I'm with you Fredrik. Me and my
*  friends are coming over from Sweden this summer to stay at the Aria in Vegas for two weeks. We'd love
*  to hear your general thoughts on playing poker in Vegas, dining, and general entertainment.
*  Well I have many thoughts, most of which are be willing to spend money. It makes your visit to
*  Vegas a lot more fun if you're willing to spend money. Don't expect to make money. Maybe you'll
*  make money, I don't know. I mean I don't make money going to Vegas. Maybe Liv Bury, our previous
*  guest, or Maria Konikova could make money in Vegas, but I tend to lose it. I think that like once or
*  twice I've had a trip to Vegas and I've made enough money playing poker to pay for the hotel room
*  there. I don't think I've ever made enough to pay for the hotel room and for the dinners.
*  With Jennifer and I going to Vegas, eating out is a huge reason why we go. We can sort of kick back
*  during the day, relax, you can go to the pool, or sit and read a book or whatever, or just kick around
*  and then have some of the world's best food at night. The Aria is a great place for food,
*  but explore all the different possibilities. The MGM Grand across the street has a bunch of good
*  places. It has the Atelier Jean-Roger Bouchon, which is a wonderful semi-casual version of
*  haute cuisine there. The Bellagio and Caesar's Palace have amazing high-end restaurants like
*  Picasso and Guy Savoy, but there's also a lot more non-high-end restaurants that are really excellent.
*  Roy Choi, who is the chef who is in charge of the Koji BBQ taco truck here in LA, opened a Vegas
*  restaurant called Best Friend, which I highly recommend. It's in the Park MGM, a weird, wonderful
*  collection of Korean slash Italian slash barbecue food that will leave you smiling for sure.
*  The Cosmopolitan also has a lot of fun little restaurants. There's a José Andrés
*  Spanish restaurant that is really, really good. It just goes on. There's just so many good places to
*  eat. Also, window shopping or real shopping if you're into that. Aria has some shops. It's not
*  great. Aria, I think, made a terrible mistake. That whole city center complex that Aria is part of,
*  rather than having interesting shopping, they just built a high-end mall, the Crystal's Mall,
*  right in the middle of the complex. It has Prada and Gucci and whatever, if that's what you're into.
*  You can get those other places. Places like the Forum shops at Caesar's Palace have quirky little
*  shops that are not located anywhere else. I would give that a look if you want. For playing poker,
*  I haven't played poker in Vegas in quite a long time because there's been a pandemic.
*  The Aria has a great poker room. It's a little bit high-end, so be ready for that. MGM Grand is a
*  slightly lower-end, so a little bit cheaper, a little bit weaker competition if you want to try
*  that. Also, it's still a very luxurious environment overall. Then, the Bellagio is always fun to go
*  to, just so you can say you went to the Bellagio. I actually tend to do way better in the tournaments.
*  They have daily tournaments at almost every poker room in Vegas. 100 bucks, 150 bucks, you enter.
*  Maybe 30 or 40 people have entered, that kind of thing. You start in the morning, end in the
*  evening, one day. You can also just play ongoing ring games at a table anytime. It's a lot of fun.
*  You meet crazy people. You meet a whole wide variety of people. You're playing poker,
*  and the person on one side of you is wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and the other one is wearing a
*  tuxedo on the other side of you. Great stories bouncing back and forth between all these people
*  coming in from all over the world to play poker in Vegas. I hope you have a good time.
*  Emmett Francis says,
*  Do you have any advice for a PhD student, me, working on putting together some disparate pieces
*  of work into a dissertation? My temptation is to spend time working on telling a coherent story
*  through the dissertation, but my impression is that not many folks read the dissertation itself,
*  and I should perhaps focus more on getting at least some of my unpublished research submitted
*  to a journal before I graduate. Thoughts? I think that this might be one of those things that depends
*  wildly on what exact subfield you're in. In theoretical high energy physics, it's a very
*  simple thing. No, don't spend any time whatsoever telling a coherent story. Most places, like at
*  Caltech, for example, or at Harvard where I was, you just staple together your papers,
*  write an introduction, and whether or not you want to spend a lot of time with the introduction,
*  that's up to you. It doesn't matter if your papers are co-authored with other people,
*  as long as you just are honest about who the co-authors were and give them credit,
*  and as long as a substantial amount of the work was done by you, they are totally acceptable
*  for chapters in a thesis. I've had students who've collaborated with me on papers,
*  more than one student, and a single paper appeared in more than one PhD thesis defense as a chapter.
*  Again, as long as you're honest about what you did there and really contributed to it.
*  I know I get where you're coming from because a lot of people... The PhD thesis is a big thing.
*  I think a lot of people make the mistake of, by the time they're defending their thesis or whatever,
*  it's anticlimactic because there's a lot of pressure to get a postdoc job, to figure out
*  the rest of your life and things like that. If your advisor is even halfway competent,
*  you should not get to the point of defending your thesis without it being a foregone conclusion that
*  you will pass. It should not be a stressful thing. It is. It can be stressful, but it shouldn't be.
*  Therefore, for a lot of people, they're like, okay, they're ready to move on. They're like,
*  just give me the degree and I move on. Whereas I think it's a big deal. You worked hard for years
*  to get to this point. I'm a big believer in pomp and ceremony about these things. That's why
*  I recently posted on Twitter the updated collection of champagne bottles in my office,
*  one for each successful PhD thesis defense. Whenever one of my students defends a PhD thesis,
*  I buy two bottles of champagne. One goes to me, one goes to them to do with what we want. We drink it,
*  but then we store the bottle or not as we choose. I'm a big believer in caring about the PhD thesis
*  and its defense, but as a text, as a collection of words and thoughts, almost no one's going to read
*  it. Especially if it's like in theoretical high energy theory, it's a collection of papers.
*  You could write an introduction that is pedagogical and has some value added,
*  but rewriting the chapters so that they fit together to tell a story for something that no
*  one will ever read is probably not the best use of your time. If you could get some of the unpublished
*  research submitted to a journal, that would be much more useful. Yes, I agree on that.
*  On the other hand, there are other subfields that think about it very differently in different ways.
*  When I was at Chicago, they had what I thought was a very weird rule, which is that PhD students,
*  you acted like a regular PhD student. You wrote a bunch of papers, collaborated with your advisor,
*  with other students, with whoever, but then your thesis was one hefty single author paper.
*  You had to write a paper and it had to be submitted to a journal and either
*  published or on the road to being published. That was your PhD thesis. I thought it was a dumb rule.
*  I get it. I get why they want to do it because you're supposed to show that you can do it all
*  by yourself. Good. It's just not natural. I think that a lot of things at Chicago were
*  rules or even grad schools more broadly. There are a lot of rules that people come up with.
*  There are hurdles you have to leap to successfully get through this process that are not necessarily
*  aimed at making you the best researcher you can be. A real researcher will write a single author
*  paper when they have a good idea by themselves and have the wherewithal to write it up themselves.
*  That's fine, but sometimes that doesn't happen. If I have a good idea and I need someone to do
*  some 3D numerical simulation, I'm not going to either not do it or try to teach myself 3D
*  numerical simulations. I'm going to go to a friend who can do 3D numerical simulations and we're
*  going to collaborate. That's the natural thing to do. I think it's weird to penalize that in some way.
*  That's a different way of doing it. My point is just that different places, different subfields
*  have different ways of doing it. You should really ask this question of people who are exactly within
*  your subspecialty, just so I'm not leading you the wrong way.
*  Jan Smith says, how do you keep yourself in good physical shape?
*  A question is being begged here, whether or not I do keep myself in good physical shape. To be honest,
*  I actually for the past few years have been a member of a gym and signed up for personal training
*  classes at the gym. The reason I do that is because otherwise I just don't work out. I'm a big believer
*  in working out, exercising, trying to stay relatively fit, not like athlete level tone or
*  anything like that, but moving. I have a job that basically involves sitting in front of a
*  computer screen all day or sitting in front of a piece of paper. Although these days I use my iPad,
*  so sitting in front of an iPad, which is not any much better. A lot of sitting is involved in my
*  job. Even right now when I'm podcasting, I'm still sitting talking to you. Getting out and moving
*  around is something I think is crucially important. Even though the personal trainer is good because
*  they make sure I'm doing exercises correctly and the right collection of them, the single biggest
*  thing is that it's an appointment and I got to go. I can't just say, I don't feel like it today.
*  I completely understand this is only because I'm at a point in my life now where I can afford
*  something like that. It gets me out of the house. It's worth the money, I think.
*  Right. It definitely does make a difference since I've started doing it. Jennifer, who is a
*  workout demon, she's naturally like she works out every day and has for many years, she has a black
*  belt in jujitsu and bless her heart. She never nudged me to do it even though when she first
*  met me, I was not working out very much at all. When I was a student, when I was in grad school
*  or postdoc, I would play basketball all the time and run around and do things. Then you kind of
*  get a little sluggy after that. Even though she was completely silent about the matter, her good
*  example nudged me to doing something about it and getting out there and going to the gym.
*  That's what I try to do. Okay, I'm going to group two questions together. One is from Andre Deneu,
*  who says, you mentioned in the past that Hilbert space, for those non-experts out there, the space
*  full of possible quantum mechanical wave functions, Hilbert space could be either infinite
*  dimensional or could have a finite number of dimensions. In the latter case, the number of
*  dimensions could be at least 10 to the 10 to the 120. How was this number estimated? Is it
*  approximately three times n, where n is the number of elementary particles in the visible universe?
*  Something like that. The other question is Qubit, who says, I often think about what kind of
*  mathematical object the wave function of the universe really is. To keep things simple,
*  I like to think about it in the position representation. My first guess is that the
*  wave function is then a function of n location vectors, where n is the number of elementary
*  particles in the universe. However, I'm not sure how this picture can handle the creation and
*  annihilation of elementary particles. Should I think about this like the wave function gets or
*  loses some of its arguments during the time evolution? Not sure how the Hamiltonian universe
*  could achieve such changes to the wave function. So these are not exactly the same question,
*  certainly not the same question, but they're related to this issue of Hilbert space and the
*  number of dimensions of Hilbert space and what the wave function really is. Let me say one thing,
*  which I usually resist trying to say, but it still remains true, which is that I wrote a book about
*  this, something deeply hidden. And if you're really interested, if you're interested enough to ask
*  these kinds of questions, you should read the book because I do answer these questions in the book.
*  Now, admittedly, I own books and have even read books and nevertheless do not understand or
*  remember everything in them. So if you've read the book and still have questions, that's completely
*  cool. But you'll get a much clearer picture, not just of the answer to an individual question,
*  but of how everything fits together. If you check out the book, okay, more than I can say in an AMA
*  answer. So the point is, when you start with a quantum mechanical system thought about as some
*  collection of particles, as soon as you just say, well, I have a particle in space, okay, so the
*  particle can take on any location in ordinary classical mechanics, space is continuous, the
*  particle can be anywhere. The Hilbert space that you get from that, even from one particle,
*  is infinite dimensional, because you can the dimensions out that the dimensionality of Hilbert
*  space is the number of possible observational outcomes when you measure something about the
*  particle. So if you measure the position of the particle, and you could get an infinite number
*  of different answers, that's an infinite dimensional Hilbert space right there. So when you say that the
*  universe might have a finite dimensional Hilbert space, you've already said there is something that
*  is not just taking a bunch of particles and quantizing it, you're doing something more
*  elaborate. Now let me skip ahead a little bit to Qubit's question about how particles could be
*  created or destroyed. Yeah, if you have a theory of n particles in quantum mechanics, or for that
*  matter in classical mechanics, and that's what your theory is of, then in classical mechanics,
*  you would have a phase space and quantum mechanics, you have a Hilbert space, and there's no way
*  for the number of particles to change. This is why you invent field theory. This is exactly the
*  reason you could start with field theory and find out that it looks like particles. You can also
*  start with particles and say rather than having n particles, my configuration quantum mechanically
*  is a superposition of zero particles, one particle, two particle, three particles, and there can be
*  transitions between them. Okay, but they're all there. They're all there in the possible places
*  in Hilbert space. So you have to add up all those things. And what you find mathematically is that
*  it's completely equivalent to a quantum field theory. Even if you just start with particles,
*  a many body quantum system, as they call it, is equivalent to a quantum field theory. And it's the
*  quantum field theory that lets you talk about transitions between different numbers of particles,
*  creation and annihilation, the wave, the quantum field is waving or it's not. So it's very easy to
*  understand creation and annihilation of particles in the field theory perspective. The Hilbert space
*  never changes size. In fact, it's always infinite dimensional, so it becomes a little bit less
*  puzzling, but it doesn't even sort of get a bigger infinity or a smaller infinity. It just always
*  includes the possibility of zero particles, one particle, two particle, up to billions of particles
*  baked in from the start into Hilbert space. Parenthetically, by the way, the number of
*  observable particles in the observable universe is something like 10 to the 88th. So it is not
*  10 to the 120. It's certainly not 10 to the 10 to the 120. So back to Andre's question then,
*  where does this finite but big number come from if it has nothing to do with the number of particles
*  in the universe? The answer is gravity. Remember that Stephen Hawking gave us a formula for the
*  entropy of a black hole. Namely, the entropy is the area of its event horizon divided by four
*  in Planck units. And we think that not only is that entropy a reflection of the entanglement
*  between things inside degrees of freedom inside the black hole and outside, but we also think
*  that the black hole is a maximum entropy state for a fixed volume of space time. There's no
*  configuration that is higher entropy than a black hole. And what that means is the fact that the
*  entanglement entropy of the black hole is finite indicates there's a finite dimensional Hilbert space
*  of things that can go on inside the black hole. And if you go through the math, it turns out to be
*  E to the entropy or 10 to the entropy. The entropy is so big, it doesn't matter whether
*  you're raising it to the power of E or 10, honestly. And something very similar to that,
*  you say, well, we don't live in a black hole in the universe. That's true. But we live in a
*  universe that is approaching De Sitter space. De Sitter space is an accelerating universe with
*  the cosmological constant, as we've already talked about. And De Sitter space is surrounded
*  by a horizon and it has an entropy. And the formula is the same. The formula is the area of
*  the event horizon divided by four in Planck units. So it just turns out that if you run the numbers
*  for our actual universe, our actual universe with a cosmological constant, if that's the
*  thing that is causing the universe to accelerate, we'll approach a De Sitter phase with a horizon
*  surrounding us. The horizon is the place past which once a galaxy or something like that leaves,
*  we can never communicate it with it ever again. Space is expanding too fast for us to ever catch
*  up to it. So there's a horizon around us and its area is roughly 10 to 120. So the entropy
*  associated with that is 10 to 120. The Hilbert space is 10 to the 10 to the 120 dimensional.
*  It's a big number. But notice it has nothing to do with the number of particles. It's just a
*  feature of space-time itself, which kind of makes sense. In the future, all the particles will
*  more or less scatter to the four winds, right? That's what happens as the universe expands.
*  In fact, I've told the story before, but for years, I was convinced or at least speculated
*  that there was a family resemblance between the expansion of the universe and something called
*  the cosmic no hair theorem, which Bob Wald proved in the 80s, a theorem that says if you have a
*  positive cosmological constant, you not only does the universe expand forever, but it always smooths
*  out to become De Sitter space. That always reminded me of the second law of thermodynamics,
*  or of the process of equilibration in thermodynamics, where entropy increases
*  until you get to the equilibrium point and then you just stay there forever. It's equilibrated.
*  So finally, Aidan Chatwin Davis and I proved a theorem under certain assumptions, which is
*  necessary to do theorems. We proved a theorem that says literally that the second law of
*  thermodynamics is the cosmic no hair theorem. That if you assume you have a gravitational system
*  whose entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon, has a finite upper bound,
*  you will evolve to De Sitter space, even without using Einstein's equation. So that was a very
*  cool little result. Linus Larabee asks a priority question. Remember, for those of you who are new
*  to priority questions, if you're a Patreon supporter and ask an AMA question, I can't always
*  answer all of them. So the loophole is that every user, every supporter gets once in their life
*  the ability to ask a priority question, which I will answer. I don't necessarily guarantee I
*  will answer it to your satisfaction, but I will answer it up here. So Linus asks, on a one to five
*  scale, how annoying are patrons who can't seem to follow simple directions regarding questions on
*  AMAs? I know where you're coming from, because I do have every single time I post the AMA,
*  there are instructions, directions on yeses and things to do and things not to do.
*  Yeses and nos for asking AMA questions and every time people ignore them, but actually,
*  you know, not that much. Most people follow them. And there are a lot of directions, there are a lot
*  of little rules, because we've been doing this for a while now, we know our way around, we know what
*  the failure modes are. So honestly, it doesn't bother me that much. It's easy enough for me
*  to ignore the people who do not follow the directions. Most common directions are,
*  keep your questions short, most common directions that are ignored, or keep your questions short,
*  don't ask me to read papers or videos or anything like that. I don't like special
*  relativity puzzles. And everyone only gets one question per AMA. Those are the main as far as
*  I can recall right now, those are the main instructions, every one of them gets violated
*  every month. That's okay. I'm more annoyed by other things in the world, honestly, right now.
*  Lothian 53 says, a many worlds question. This is probably too basic for this group. But how does
*  many worlds explain the interference pattern observed with the double slit experiment?
*  It would seem that the particles are interfering with the other worlds, but I thought that once
*  split, there was no way that one world would affect any others. Well, I mean, yes and no.
*  I would not say that the particles are interfering with other worlds. But other people would say
*  differently. I think I'm not 100% sure about this. But I think that David Deutsch would say,
*  Oh, yeah, they're definitely interacting, interfering with other worlds. But the point is that
*  there is a set of worlds. Well, what can I say, there's a wave function and evolves according to
*  Schrodinger's equation. That's what really happens. Okay. Everything else is commentary,
*  but the commentary is important. And in the commentary, we can talk about the world having
*  branched by decoherence or not yet having branched. If the world has not yet branched,
*  then you can talk about it either as just one world. And that's what I would honestly prefer
*  to do. And in that world, there are wave functions for the different particles and things like that,
*  or even better, there's one wave function in that world for all the particles, all the stuff.
*  Or you could sort of look into the future and say, you know, there's going to be branching.
*  So it's almost like there's a whole bunch of worlds that are already here, but they're all
*  exactly the same. They're all identical. So it's as if there's just one world. And in that latter
*  description, you would say that the particles passing through the double slits are interacting
*  or interfering with particles from other worlds, but all the worlds are exactly the same. Okay. So
*  it's not, it's a weird way of talking in my perspective. I would just like to say,
*  before there's any branching, before there's decoherence and the wave function is split,
*  there's one world and there's a wave function and the wave function is a wave and interferes.
*  And that's it. That's all you need to say. Don't think about particles. Think about the fact that
*  it's a wave. It's the wave function that is the real thing. Okay. I'm going to group two questions
*  together. Vladimir Belik says, imagine it's the last day of your well-deserved vacation.
*  And after a fun and relaxing afternoon, it would soon be time to enjoy a special dinner with your
*  wife. For this occasion, a magical personal chef is at your service. He can prepare any meal from
*  your memory, but not only that, he can pick any location on earth for this dinner and he'll
*  teleport both of you there, set the table and shield you from any environmental effects if need
*  be. What location do you choose and what do you order? And then Trevor Britnell says,
*  you recently mentioned that your favorite restaurant is Alinea. Have you been to any
*  other three Michelin star restaurants or restaurants on the world's 50 best restaurants lists?
*  And how do they compare? See, let me answer the second one first because it will illuminate the
*  first one. Alinea is my favorite restaurant. Alinea is a three Michelin star restaurant in
*  Chicago that I've been to a few times. And I have been actually to other three Michelin star
*  restaurants. I'm not even going to be able to remember. I know I've been there, but I can't
*  remember which ones are one star and two star and three star or whatever. But some fancy restaurants
*  I've been to are the French Laundry, the famous one in Northern California. Vegas has several I've
*  already mentioned earlier, Guy Savoie and Jean Robuchon and Picasso all have multiple Michelin
*  stars. Dinner in London is one of our favorite restaurants. Dinner is the second best restaurant
*  by Chef Heston Blumenthal. His best restaurant is the Fat Duck, which I have not been to. Fat Duck
*  is up there in your list of possibly best restaurants in the world. Several restaurants in New York,
*  Daniel and Eleven Madison Park and a couple of restaurants in Paris, Pierre Garnier,
*  another Jean Robuchon, a couple in Copenhagen. I think Kong Hans Kilder was a maybe three Michelin
*  stars. Anyway, a bunch. I'm old. I've been around. I travel a lot and I like eating. So I would rather
*  spend my money on these restaurants than many other ways that I could spend money. Save your
*  pennies. Actually, I've never made this point. But people think about spending a huge amount of
*  money for a fancy dinner. Probably the upper limit would be at one of these restaurants.
*  There's no upper limit because you can spend it on wine. You can get a bottle of wine for $10,000
*  and there you go. But if you just get a reasonable bottle of wine, but otherwise do the full tasting
*  menu extravaganza, you should probably plan that per person you're spending a few hundred dollars,
*  maybe up to $500 at a restaurant like this. That seems like just a crazy amount of money,
*  $500 per person for a meal. But the way I think about it is it's a lot cheaper than
*  going to Disneyland for several days. The comparison I use, maybe I have said this
*  out loud before, but I'm never going to stay overnight in the world's fanciest hotel room
*  or drive the world's fanciest car or live in the world's fanciest house or whatever. But these
*  meals at fancy restaurants are as good, arguably, the best meals you can get in the world. No matter
*  how rich you are, it's just as good as a meal that Jeff Bezos could possibly eat. It's $500,
*  which is again, a vacation. For me, that's well worth that particular way of budgeting
*  your pleasure dollars. I'm a foodie in that sense. Anyway, to answer your question, Trevor,
*  I think Linnea is at the top of that list. Some of the meals I've had there have been better than
*  others, but there's never been a dud. They've all been amazing. It's a Linnea, for those of you who
*  don't know, is one of these. They use the phrase molecular gastronomy, although I think that the
*  chef Grant Akets isn't a big fan of the term. By the way, I made an effort to get Grant Akets on
*  the podcast. I think I came close. We were tweeting back and forth, but it never turned out. Chef
*  Akets, if you're listening to this, we'd love to have you on Mindscape Podcast. It's many small
*  courses. It's not like a three-course meal, like a 20-course meal or a 15-course meal, but the courses
*  are very small and they're spread over three hours or whatever. In every course, the reason why Linnea
*  is great is because I've been to bad molecular gastronomy restaurants where they're trying too
*  hard to be weird. There was one restaurant where they bring a plate covered to your table,
*  and then with a flourish, they open the plate and there's a cell phone on the plate. Then the cell
*  phone rings and says, come downstairs. You go downstairs and you pick up your dish for that
*  particular course. I'm like, oh, this is kind of annoying. There's foams and things like that.
*  Sometimes, why is it like this? But Linnea managed to hit that sweet spot where every meal, every
*  course is endlessly inventive and different, but just tastes really, really good. That's the thing.
*  They have this real expertise at getting tastes together in ways that you wouldn't have guessed,
*  and textures and timings and odors and sounds and the whole bit. It's the full experience that I
*  really, really enjoy very, very well there. That's still my favorite restaurant compared to all those.
*  I was a little bit disappointed with the French Laundry, to be honest. I think the French Laundry
*  is phoning it in a little bit because I know that Grant Eckertz has said that if he gets a last meal,
*  he would like it to be the French Laundry. I really wanted to go there to see what the fuss
*  was about. I would say Linnea is way better. To Vladimir's question, that's what I would want.
*  I want Grant Eckertz to be my magical chef who prepares me a meal. The point is that when you go
*  one of these really good restaurants, not only is it really good, but you could never guess ahead of
*  time what's coming next. The things they do with food are endlessly inventive. I totally sympathize
*  if someone says, I want a good medium rare steak or I want a good vegetarian soufflé or whatever
*  it is you want. If you have a favorite thing and you want to get that, I get that. I would put myself
*  in the hands of someone who is much more creative and knowledgeable about food than I am and let
*  them do it. As to where, I thought about that. I really don't know. That's a good question.
*  Could be somewhere weird, the top of Mount Everest, because you specified that there's a
*  shield from any environmental effects or under the sea would also be a lot of fun,
*  but I haven't really scouted these locations so I couldn't tell you for sure.
*  Ted Anderson says, physicists assume that fundamental particles of the same type are
*  identical. How well do we know that? For example, how much variation in the mass of the electron
*  would there have to be before it would upset current theories where we could detect it with
*  measurements? If you accept the basic framework of current theories, the theory itself is pretty
*  clear that all electrons have exactly the same mass. It is not an assumption. It's always a
*  little bit wrong when you say physicists assume this. That's just not quite getting your finger
*  on the way physicists work. Physicists hypothesize things. They invent a theory and according to
*  theory something is true, but they're open to the possibility that it's not true.
*  Physicists assume Lorentz invariance, but my first ever published paper was on violating
*  the Lorentz invariance and it became very popular. If you can figure out a way to test
*  deviations from those hypotheses, people are very happy. That's what they'd like to do.
*  Variations of masses of particles certainly have been tested. I really don't know how accurately,
*  to be honest, but what I wanted to emphasize was, as I just said a little bit ago,
*  in modern physics it's a field. There's an electron field that vibrates and that we see it
*  as electron particles. This is why the masses of all electrons are exactly the same because
*  they're vibrations in exactly the same field. There's this story that John Wheeler was puzzled
*  why electrons all have the same charge and the same mass and he had this theory, oh, when he
*  realizes that an electron could be thought of going backward in time as a positron, that maybe
*  there's only one electron. People are very excited by this, but that's not correct. He was not right.
*  You have to understand. We've made progress since then. We know why all the electrons have the same
*  mass and charge because they're vibrations in the same field. We could definitely try to test it and
*  I'm sure we have, but I have no idea what the actual numerical limits are.
*  Michael Schillingford asks a priority question. In the episode with Jody Azuni, it said that
*  his object projectivism, which is tantamount to ontological nihilism, is bumping up against
*  your work in quantum mechanics, but how so? The Danetian ontology you contrasted with is obviously
*  much more permissive. Is your physics research pulling toward the two poles of either eliminativism
*  or permissivism? I'll apologize. I forget exactly what was said. What I can think of that I might
*  have been getting at is the overall question of nominalism is something that has come up
*  in my recent thinking about the foundations of quantum mechanics. This is in part, again,
*  I forget if I've mentioned this, who knows what I've done and what I've not done on the podcast,
*  but Justin Clark-Done, who is one of our previous guests, who writes about the philosophy of math,
*  as well as the moral philosophy, he and I had a podcast conversation and we were also talking
*  about mathematical realism, et cetera. He has a set of arguments for mathematical realism and in
*  his mind, a good physicist is just going to be forced to be a mathematical realist because you
*  need a lot of math to do physics. That's the simple naive way of saying it, but also because
*  once you have enough math, once you have sufficiently powerful mathematical formalisms,
*  mathematical axiomatic systems, then as Gödel showed us, those systems can make statements
*  about their own consistency. If you want your physical theory to be consistent, which presumably
*  you do, presumably you want the physical world to be consistent with itself, I'm not even sure how
*  you could not have that, then he says you sort of need to believe in the realism of those
*  mathematical results. You can't prove the consistency of the theory within itself,
*  you just have to assume it and that's tantamount to mathematical realism.
*  I'm open to that possibility, I'm not an expert in these mathematical logic, foundations of
*  mathematics questions, but it rubs me the wrong way a little bit. I want to think that the reality
*  is the physical world and mathematics is not part of that reality, it's a separate thing, it's a way
*  we talk about the physical world. That has led me to ask myself, is it possible to invent or to
*  contemplate theories of physics that don't need sufficiently strong mathematics, that they can
*  even talk about their own consistency, they can just be consistent or even better, just the right
*  amount of power that they can prove their own consistency. There are versions of mathematical
*  axiomatic systems that can do that. That's what I'm thinking about now. I think the answer is yes,
*  but again I'm not an expert on it so I'm not very good at it so I can't tell you quite the answers.
*  I'm supposed to be writing a paper for a symposium that Justin is organizing,
*  so we'll see how that goes and I will let you know. It would be compatible with a kind of
*  nominalism about math, nominalism about abstract objects, you don't need to
*  imagine that numbers are just as real as electrons are under that construal. Now I think that's a
*  little bit separate in my view from the question of levels of reality and emergent reality.
*  I differ from Jody about the reality of Microsoft for example. I think that Microsoft is real. I
*  think it is part of a level of description of the world. It is not the most fundamental level,
*  but it's as real as consciousness and tables and chairs are. Again, not an expert in this,
*  but that's how I would put it. I think you can be a realist about higher levels of reality,
*  which is this Danettian kind of sense of real patterns and nevertheless not necessarily
*  realistic about abstract mathematical objects. Chris Shotard says, I'm struggling with two
*  different interpretations of the CMB anisotropy. The first one says that temperature fluctuations
*  reflect the quantum fluctuations of the matter in its very early form. The second one says they
*  are due to the gravitational lensing of all the matter the radiation has met during its
*  journey to us. Could it be both? So no, it cannot be the second one. The CMB fluctuations are
*  absolutely not due to gravitational lensing. There is an effect of gravitational lensing that
*  contributes to the anisotropies of the CMB, but it's generally a very small amount and it only
*  shows up on relatively small angular scales. The vast majority of what you see when you look at
*  CMB anisotropies is not from gravitational lensing. What it's from is density fluctuations of the
*  primordial plasma just before recombination, just before the electrons and the protons teamed up to
*  make hydrogen. Now we speculate that those density fluctuations might be due to quantum fluctuations
*  in the very, very, very early universe, but that's just a speculation. We don't know that. What we
*  know with a high degree of confidence is that the temperature fluctuations 380,000 years after
*  the Big Bang that we see in the CMB are from density fluctuations in the plasma at that time,
*  not because of gravitational lensing since then. Francis Day asks a priority question. Often I hear
*  you and your guest scientists use a phrase something like, I've thought a lot about this.
*  In terms of thinking about a physics problem, what is your process? I would guess it involves
*  talking to colleagues, reading papers, maybe sitting and thinking. Yeah, you have guessed
*  exactly correctly. It involves all of those things. In fact, sitting and thinking is the most important
*  one. I mean, talking to colleagues and reading papers is important, but if you're making progress
*  on something that is new and interesting at a research level, you're doing a lot of lonely
*  sitting and thinking. Then hopefully it works and you get to excitedly talk to your colleagues later.
*  I'm always reluctant to label anything that I do as a process in any formal sense because I just do
*  whatever works in the moment and it's not necessarily very formalized. Different ideas,
*  different things you've thought a lot about come in different ways, come from different places.
*  Some of them are kind of programmatic. You say, hmm, I would like to understand this.
*  I think I see how to do it. Let's sit and do it. In other words, sometimes you come up with a topic
*  for a research project where just as soon as you come up with a topic, it's pretty clear what you
*  got to do to turn that idea into a paper. Let me give you an example. Just randomly off the top of
*  my head, I wrote a paper about dark matter several years ago. Here was the puzzle. There are some
*  weak astrophysical hints. We talked a little bit about this in the podcast with Priya Natarajan
*  that there's some weak astrophysical hints that non-interacting dark matter isn't quite up to the
*  task. Ordinary cold dark matter models, the dark matter doesn't interact with itself at all. It
*  just sort of moves under the force of gravity. It's weakly interacting, and that's so weak that
*  it doesn't matter. Some people have said, well, what if it's strongly interacting, then we can
*  explain some of these astrophysical anomalies. That may or may not be true. Honestly, I don't know.
*  That's a hard astrophysics problem, but it's intriguing from the particle physics point of
*  view because here's the problem with that. You can make the particles interact. You can just say,
*  well, yeah, they bump into each other or they annihilate or whatever, but there's a relationship
*  between the interaction strength and the abundance of the particles. When the particles interact
*  strongly, they tend to annihilate away in the early universe. That's why weakly interacting
*  particles are so interesting as dark matter candidates because the weak interactions of
*  particle physics give you roughly the right annihilation rate to give you the right abundance
*  of dark matter to explain the observations. If you just say, well, I want the dark matter to be
*  strongly interacting, you have an extra puzzle about why there is the right amount of dark matter
*  in the current universe. I had an idea, which is we have the Higgs mechanism in ordinary standard
*  model particle physics where there's a phase transition. Before the phase transition, particles
*  like the electron and the quarks were massless. Afterward, they're massive because the Higgs
*  field changes its value and that changes the masses of these particles. What if you did
*  something like that, but did it with the interaction strength of the particles rather than their mass?
*  Have a phase transition to change the interaction strength of the particles. They were weakly
*  interacting in the early universe. They give you the right relic abundance. Phase transition
*  happens and now they're strongly interacting in some way and that has astrophysically interesting
*  results. That was the idea. That's something you can come up with, walking to work, feeding the cats,
*  taking a shower, whatever. The work that you need to do to turn that into a paper in that case
*  is pretty straightforward. You just start writing down models. Here is an action, a Lagrangian.
*  Let's figure out what the particles could be, how they interact with each other, calculate some
*  interaction rates, the relic abundance, blah, blah, blah. Figure out how big the effects can be without
*  running into other limits from all these other experiments we've done. It's a pretty straightforward
*  set of things to do and you set about doing it. Other projects, all you start with really is a
*  vague hope. You say like, okay, we've already said that the Hilbert space of the universe is about 10
*  to the 120 dimensional, right? That we said that earlier in the podcast, but the quantum field
*  theory, Hilbert space, is infinite dimensional. How do you reconcile that? Where do the extra
*  dimensions of Hilbert space that you thought you had in quantum field theory, where do they go?
*  That's a very open-ended question. I bring this up because some students and I spent a year thinking
*  about it and didn't get anywhere. We did not publish anything about it. Other people have talked about
*  similar things, but the structure of Hilbert space in a quantum gravity model or something like that
*  is a vague enough question that you don't exactly know what to do. You do exactly what you said. You
*  talk to colleagues, you read papers, you sit and you think and you scribble down some equations,
*  whatever gets you in the right direction. Okay, I'm going to group together two questions. One
*  is from Josh Powers. Suppose I look into the sky and see the light from Alpha Centauri showing that
*  it existed four years in my past. Then I wait five years and see it again indicating that it still
*  exists. This implies that it, like me, has existed continuously for those five years and it stands to
*  reason that at any point in my subjective time something was also happening at Alpha Centauri.
*  Therefore, it seems like we do share a common present even if we can't communicate to determine
*  what events are simultaneous. This seems to contradict the idea that there is no universal
*  present. What am I missing? And then David McBurney says, in the biggest ideas video on entanglement,
*  you wrote the wave function for the universe with n particles as psi of x1, x2, xn, n time.
*  We often hear from relativity that statements like what is happening right now in Alpha Centauri
*  are not sensible because time is relative and there's no such thing as now. If some of the n
*  particles are on earth and some are in Alpha Centauri and the location of the particles evolves
*  per the Schrodinger equation, that seems like there is some preferred time. Is this another
*  incompatibility of quantum mechanics and relativity? So in both cases, you know, everything is fine,
*  don't worry. There's no universal present and there's no necessary incompatibility with quantum
*  mechanics and relativity. I guess to get David's second question first once again,
*  when you write the wave function universe for particles, right, x1, x2, x3, probably you're
*  working in the non-relativistic approximation for one thing, right? Because if you were relativistic,
*  you probably should be doing quantum field theory. But that's just a little aside. The more
*  important thing is what you've done in either case is chosen a frame, chosen a set of coordinates
*  to extend across the universe. Relativity doesn't say you're not allowed to extend coordinates over
*  the universe. It says that there are many ways of extending coordinates over the universe and
*  they're all equally good. So when I pick a reference frame, let's say I'm going to pick
*  my reference frame, the one that is at rest with respect to what I'm doing right now,
*  as long as space-time is not very curved, if it's almost special relativity, I can extend
*  a reference frame. So I can just go, you know, in my mind in a thought experiment, I can extend
*  lines in a space-like direction at the moment I am right now and call that the same time as I am
*  right now. Different observers moving at different rates would do that differently. So they would
*  define now differently, but any one of them could write down a wave function psi of x1, x2, xn,
*  and their time coordinate and there would be a Schrodinger equation that told you how it evolved.
*  And the Schrodinger equations would look a little bit different because they would be Lorentz
*  transformations of each other. They'd be transformations from one term, from one time
*  coordinate to another, but they're all equally good. They're all allowed. So it's not that there's
*  some preferred times. There's many allowed times and that's one of them. To Josh's question, it's
*  sort of the same thing, but kind of from the opposite point of view. When you say, I see the
*  light from Alpha Centauri showing that it existed four years in my past, that's already not quite
*  right. It's four years in your past in a certain reference frame, namely the reference frame in
*  which you and Alpha Centauri are more or less stationary. You and Alpha Centauri are essentially
*  moving at the same speed compared to the speed of light. Your relative velocity is very small. So
*  there is a reference frame that has both you and that other star more or less at rest. It's in that
*  reference frame that the light you're seeing from Alpha Centauri is four years in your past.
*  If you were moving right past the same point in space, so still four light years away from Alpha
*  Centauri, but you were moving, sorry, I shouldn't say that. You're moving the same point in space,
*  but you're moving at 0.99999 the speed of light in the direction of Alpha Centauri, then the
*  light you receive now from Alpha Centauri wasn't four years in the past. It was much less than four
*  years in the past because you're going to get there. From your point of view, it will take you
*  much less than four years to get there. The limit as you go at the speed of light, it takes you
*  zero years to get there from your point of view. When you say that you make a series of observations
*  and you see that Alpha Centauri is there now and it's there five years from now and for all that
*  matter you can see it the whole time, you're still making an arbitrary choice of reference frame in
*  which to do that. So that reference frame is perfectly usable. You're allowed to talk about
*  what happens in that reference frame. You're just not allowed to treat it as somehow special or
*  universal. Okay, Jimmy Summer has a priority question. I've listened to your colloquia on
*  quantum space time, at least the one that's available on YouTube. I absolutely love the
*  idea of your program. I was just curious though, where are we with immersion space time in general?
*  What are the most recent advancements and what still needs to be worked out? If it all works out,
*  will this essentially resolve the general relativity quantum mechanics reconciliation problem?
*  For example, what do you think happens to black hole singularities in these emergent space time
*  theories? I know we're still a ways from getting there but do you have any personal conjectures?
*  Yeah, I think that the specific ideas that I've been working on with my friends and colleagues
*  are very, very young and primitive compared to other more advanced research programs.
*  So I think it's very promising. I think that we start from a very simple set of assumptions about
*  how quantum gravity works, the number of dimensions in Hilbert space, things like that.
*  But we give ourselves very little to work with. We don't even give ourselves space,
*  which everyone else does. So we have to build up a lot of things. And honestly,
*  we haven't even built up light cones yet. It's kind of easy to see how they might arise, but
*  we need to have a more dynamical understanding. We have kinematics more than dynamics right now
*  at the level that we're working at. And also all the really tangible quantitative results that
*  we have are in the weak field limit where gravity is not that strong. So we're not thinking about
*  black holes or horizons or anything like that. So there's plenty to be done establishing the
*  Dean-Gil Lorenz invariance. And for that matter, it's been fun to be thinking about gravity,
*  but you also have to think about the rest of particle physics, the rest of the fields that
*  we know and love, the gauge theories and the fermions and the Higgs boson and all that stuff.
*  And I would like to get a better handle on how best to describe those things from a purely
*  starting with nothing but a quantum wave function point of view from a vector in Hilbert space.
*  So there's lots to do. I would be... I don't even want to guess about what it's going to have to
*  say about singularities or anything like that. Honestly, the thing about singularities I think
*  is a low priority. I would rather understand black hole information and holography and things
*  like that from this point of view, which I don't. So there you go. But I think that it can be done.
*  We'll just have to see. James Nancarrow says, I read somewhere that if dark matter is a new
*  subatomic particle, it might be its own antiparticle. And there are experiments looking
*  for the annihilation of pairs of dark matter particles in the center of galaxies. How can a
*  particle be its own antiparticle? What does it mean to be an antiparticle? Good. So you've put
*  your finger on something that is a little sloppy in how particle physicists talk to each other,
*  as well as to the general public, which is they claim there's this thing called particles and
*  this thing called antiparticles, which is a bit of a cheat. The reality is some kinds of particles
*  have antiparticles and some don't. Like there's no anti photon, for example, there's no anti Higgs
*  boson. There's just the particles. Some particles, if a particle carries a conserved charge other
*  than mass, that that's a separate thing. But if it carries spin or no spin does not count. Sorry,
*  I shouldn't count spin because you can always convert that into other kinds of angular momentum.
*  If it carries baryon number or electric charge or something like that, then it will generally
*  have an antiparticle that has the opposite amount of that conserved quantity. So charge particles
*  are the most clear cut case where you have an electron, it has a negative charge. By the rules
*  of quantum field theory and relativity, there has to be a positron carrying a positive charge.
*  Dark matter particles are neutral. If they were charged, they'd be visible. They would be like
*  matter particles, visible matter particles. So already there's at least the possibility that
*  they do not have antiparticles. What matters, as it were, is not particles and antiparticles. This
*  rule that particles and antiparticles can annihilate, etc. is just a kind of sloppy rule of thumb.
*  What matters are what interactions can happen. The point is that there are interactions in
*  theory of many kinds of different dark matter particles where two dark matter particles can
*  collide and convert into photons, for example. You don't need to use the phraseology of particle
*  antiparticle. You just say that the two dark matter particles come together and annihilate
*  into photons. That's all you need. From that perspective, it just makes perfect sense. There's
*  mass and energy in them. There's no other conserved quantities. They can convert. That's
*  the general quantum mechanical kind of thing. Matt from Sweden says, priority question,
*  if for the sake of clarity, we define global catastrophic risk as causing the unexpected
*  loss of at least 100 million human lives within a 12-month period, what would in your estimation be
*  the top five global catastrophic risks within the next 50 years? It's a perfectly good question.
*  I can give you an answer. It's a priority question. I will do my best. I have no expertise
*  in this. We do have an upcoming podcast where we'll talk about these questions a little bit
*  in more detail, but I have not sat down and studied the relative rate of different global
*  catastrophic risks. There's certainly a risk from a huge asteroid hitting the earth,
*  but I think that the numbers there are very, very tiny. I would say the two most obvious choices
*  are nuclear war one way or the other. We still have a lot of operational nuclear weapons on this
*  planet. I know that we, depending on how old you are, but when I was a kid growing up, we were
*  worried about nuclear war. I was in Ronald Reagan's America and nuclear war was something
*  that was on the agenda, but the weapons are still there. We've cut down the stockpiles,
*  but the number of countries that have them only goes up with time and almost never goes down.
*  That risk has not gone away. That's a real one that we should worry about more than we do,
*  to be honest. Likewise, the other obvious one is bioterrorism. We're suffering through a pandemic
*  right now. I recently saw that it is plausible that if you don't just count the number of people
*  who died in hospitals and had their deaths attributed to COVID, but if instead you just
*  count the number of excess deaths that we're going through now compared to what we had before the
*  pandemic, you get a number over 20 million excess deaths because of the COVID pandemic.
*  It's not that far. It's not an order of magnitude away from 100 million. The thing about COVID is
*  it's especially nasty because you can get it and not know and yet be able to transmit it. You can
*  be infectious before you're symptomatic. The good thing about COVID is it's not that deadly. You can
*  get it and you cannot die. It's easy to imagine a pandemic where you get the virus, you're not
*  symptomatic. You can transmit it to others and it kills you once you do get the symptoms. That
*  would be absolutely devastating, much more devastating than COVID is. That's another
*  possibility if we don't get better at this whole vaccine thing, both inventing them and convincing
*  people to take them. If you want a top three, I will always throw out my favorite, which is
*  solar flares. I don't really necessarily think it's in the top three, but I don't think we think
*  about it enough because if there's one chance per thousand per year of a gigantic solar flare that
*  would completely wipe out all the electronics on earth, we have no data on that because a thousand
*  years ago we had no electronics. This is a plausible thing. It doesn't seem to be very
*  likely to me, but it's completely conceivable that either solar flares or some other kind of
*  occasional electronic huge event could cause huge devastation here on earth. I don't know if 100
*  million people would die, but if you just imagine no electricity anywhere on earth for let's say a
*  few months, I can certainly imagine a lot of people dying. Anyway, that's something to not
*  keep you up at night, I hope. We'll see. I'm going to group these next two together. Chris A says,
*  I'm in conversation with a Christian who, unlike me, believes miracles are intrinsically possible
*  and who demands less stringent supporting evidence than I would for such claims. She's
*  inclined to believe that a very unusual event is miraculous, whereas I see it as surprising but not
*  supernatural at all. I realize that one is supposed to update one's priors based on evidence, but in
*  her case, poor evidence is more admissible than it would be with atheist priors. Can you suggest ways
*  of discussing this product productively in the context of Bayesian reasoning? Paul Cousin says,
*  imagine that you someday witness God performing miracles. As a physicist, you know better than
*  anyone why you should not expect the laws of physics to be violated. Moreover, you know that
*  the human brain is sometimes subject to very weird failures. Should Bayesian thinking lead you to put
*  higher credence on a brain issue in this situation? If so, how can you trust your reasoning? Both
*  questions have to do with how Bayesians should be thinking about the apparent appearance of miracles
*  in the world. The first is someone thinks that miracles are happening all the time. How do we
*  use Bayes against them? The second is what if the miracle actually does happen? How do we make sure
*  that Bayes doesn't mislead us? So one question is your priors. This is always the question with
*  Bayesian reasoning. You come in to any particular experiment or situation with some prior credences,
*  with some set of beliefs about how likely different things are. I think, you know,
*  for the first question, for Chris's question, if you have someone who's already Christian
*  and believes the miracles happen all the time, then you're in a difficult position. It's true
*  because, you know, anything that happens, you go, look, they're a miracle. It's very easy to see
*  things like that. I think that it's going to depend at a practical level on how honest your friend is
*  about their reasoning abilities here or the way that they reason into it. If you want to use your
*  belief in miracles as the license to believe whatever you want, no one's going to reason you
*  out of that. You're just not being a very good Bayesian. But if you are committed to being a
*  good Bayesian, but just someone who at the moment believes in miracles, what they should be asking
*  themselves is if there weren't any miracles, how often would we be seeing these things that we're
*  seeing, whether it's, I don't know, people coming back from being dead for a little while or the
*  Virgin Mary on a tortilla or whatever it is, right? Whatever the claim miracles is, someone gets healed.
*  Would you expect these things to be seen just as frequently or as frequently as you do actually see
*  them, even if there were no actual miracles in the world? That's what you have to establish,
*  because if that's true, if what you're seeing are things that you would expect to see in a
*  miracle-free world, then seeing the miracles is not evidence, that seeing the paramiracles is not
*  evidence or violation of the laws of physics. And if that's not true, if you actually think that
*  the rate at which you would purportedly see these things is lower in your theory,
*  purely physicalist theory than it is in your experience, then that legitimately is evidence
*  against the purely physicalist theory and then you have to cope with that. Of course, in practice,
*  it's very, very hard to do these calculations. That's why Bayesian reasoning is a good aspiration
*  sometimes, but you have to, in putting it in practice, we cut corners. There's nothing else
*  that we can do. What is the frequency at which you should expect to see the Virgin Mary on a tortilla
*  or someone who has cancer suddenly go into remission? I don't know. I don't know. In the
*  absence of God's intervention, it's bound to happen sometimes, but it's very hard to calculate
*  an actual number. But that's what you would try to tell your friend. Of course, then the other
*  question is their priors. Do they think that it is more likely in the absence of any data that
*  miracles are happening all the time or more likely that the laws of physics are being obeyed? Some of
*  us would say, look, a world that just obeys the laws of physics all the time is just simpler. Is
*  this easier to comprehend than a world in which the laws of physics are usually obeyed but then
*  occasionally miraculously violated and therefore you should put a higher prior on the physicalist
*  world than the miracle world. But if they don't want to accept that, everyone is entitled to
*  their own priors. Likewise, for Paul's question, if you are a good physicalist as well as a good
*  Bayesian, what kind of miracles would it take to convince you otherwise? Because I am a big believer
*  that a good Bayesian should not rule out supernatural possibilities a priori. I never
*  bought into this very common claim of methodological naturalism as part of science,
*  that science has to assume naturalism from the start. I think that science concludes naturalism
*  because it's the best fit to the data. It doesn't assume it from the start. It's methodologically
*  empiricist. It judges how to develop these theories on the basis of data, on the basis of
*  observations of the world rather than on the basis of pure thought. Therefore, if there are
*  things that are better explained by miracles than by the laws of physics, then that should move your
*  credences toward the belief in miracles. Now, as Paul says, it could also be a brain issue or
*  something like that. I think you should just be honest. I don't have numbers to give you,
*  but you shouldn't. It is possible that it is a brain issue. People do hallucinate,
*  or people misremember, or whatever. Those are all absolutely possible. In my current state of belief
*  about the world, if I saw something that looked purportedly miraculous, I would put a very high
*  credence on it being a mistake on my part, either a brain issue or a hallucination or an optical
*  illusion or whatever. But if it kept happening, and if it was reproducible or there's good evidence
*  for it, then that would move my credences in the other direction. There's no hard and fast cutoff.
*  That's the great thing about Bayesian reasoning. You just accumulate evidence and keep going where
*  the evidence is pointing you. Peter Solfest says, what do you feel is the most effective way for
*  someone in your position to interact with our democracy in order to promote the policies you
*  are in favor of, e.g. voting, political conversations on your podcast, talking directly
*  with representatives, donating to interest groups, etc.? Yeah, I think that it's going to be different
*  for different people. I think voting is true for everybody who can vote. I'm a big believer in
*  voting. It's not an obvious thing, as we discussed with Herb Gintis on the podcast. The rational
*  case for voting is a little tricky, but I think it's makeable depending on what your goals are.
*  But then, yeah, beyond that, you need to do a little bit more. You can do a little bit more.
*  I don't mind people who don't do a little bit more. I would like it if people voted.
*  I don't think talking directly with representatives is usually helpful compared to other things,
*  because we're in such a polarized situation these days where the real question is who are
*  the representatives? Are they in one party or the other party? Once you have that,
*  mostly the representatives will be doing pretty predictable things.
*  There are obvious counterexamples. Fans of American politics will know that in the US Senate right now,
*  which is nominally 50-50, but we have a Democratic president and vice president,
*  so Democrats get to win on the tiebreakers. Democrats should have a majority in the Senate,
*  but we have two senators who like to be ornery and contrarian and not go along with the rest of the
*  Democratic agenda. Effectively, you don't have a majority in the Senate. It's very hard to get
*  things done. If I lived in states where those senators were representing me, then I might try
*  my best to interact with them directly. Otherwise, yeah, doing things that can make people think or
*  move people in the direction you think are moving them, whether it's having
*  conversations on the podcast or donating to interest groups. As many people know,
*  I don't know depending on how long you've been listening, but I am happy on the podcast to talk
*  about the ideas associated with politics. I am not happy to talk about political campaigns or
*  things like that. I'm not stumping for individual candidates and so forth. I think that even having
*  politicians on the show, which I would do under the right circumstances, but it's not my first
*  choice because they have a different agenda. They have an agenda in the cynical view,
*  getting elected, but even in the most idealistic view, they have the agenda of getting their
*  agenda passed in Congress or whatever, which is different than my agenda, which is understanding
*  how the world works. If I'm talking about politics on the podcast, it'll be talking about political
*  ideas with professors more often than it is talking with actual politicians. Also, if I'm
*  influencing people by talking on the podcast, what I hope to be influencing them to do is to
*  think for themselves in ways that I think are good ways to think. The conclusions people reach,
*  we'll see. People should reach their own conclusions, but they should do it in ways
*  that are rational and hopefully exhibit some compassion and empathy for other people in
*  society. That's what I would like to influence people to do. Ingrid Gorman says, priority
*  question. I don't understand how to reconcile a theory of all time existing at once, like a
*  loaf of bread, and how we can also understand emergence, evolution, for example, and other
*  things that took time to evolve. One sub footnote here in this question, because I think this comes
*  up elsewhere and other questions we'll get to, the word emergence, which I love using, I use it all
*  the time, is it's not the perfect word for what I'm describing when I talk about emergence,
*  because the emergence I'm talking about is not a process happening over time. It's the simultaneous
*  existence of different descriptions of some system and what it's doing. Like we already said,
*  you could talk about the gas in a box as a set of atoms or as a fluid, right? That's emergence,
*  even though it's not like the set of atoms are turning into a fluid or anything like that.
*  Okay, that was a footnote. To actually answer your question, the trick here is that presumably what
*  you're talking about is the doctrine of eternalism, the block universe view of reality, which I happen
*  to subscribe to, but the way that you phrase it is a theory of all time existing at once.
*  And the worrisome part there is the phrase at once, because I would never say that,
*  because that phrase at once indicates a particular time, right? That's what at once means, once,
*  one time. But it kind of doesn't make sense to imagine that all time exists at one time,
*  because all time is a bunch of different times. The thing that an eternalist would say is all
*  time exists. All moments are equally real. The current moment you're in is real,
*  but future moments are also real. Past moments are also real. They're not all real at the same time,
*  or at once. That would make no sense, but they're all real. And if it ever seems weird to be thinking
*  about that, just switch in your brain the question from time to space, right? Because in relativity,
*  we're taught the time and space are very, very similar to each other. They're not exactly the
*  same, but very similar. And so no one has a problem thinking that all points in space exist,
*  right? You're located to only one. I mean, if you course grain so that you count as one point in
*  space and other places count as other points, okay, you're located somewhere in space. That
*  doesn't lead you to doubt the existence of other points of space far away. They just all exist,
*  but you happen to be located at one of them and you count your position relative to others.
*  That's how time works for an eternalist. Just like all the points in space are real, all the
*  moments in time are real, you at one moment happen to exist in that moment and count your location in
*  time relative to other moments. It all works in more or less the same way. That's, I think,
*  the best I can say. Benjamin Barbrell says, poetic naturalism recognizes the ability to
*  tell different kinds of true stories about the world. These stories use different concepts
*  applying different domains of validity, but need to be consistent with each other.
*  The only way I can imagine to ensure this consistency would be a tree-like hierarchical
*  structure, where the domain of validity of stories closer to the trunk would encompass those of
*  emerging levels higher in the branches. The existence of the structure is what I always
*  assumed reductionism was. Each level can in principle reduce to a lower, wider level.
*  Reading the big picture, I understand that what I describe is not quite what you have in mind. You
*  don't appeal to reductionism. It seems to me the various discourses on the world need not be
*  organized in this fashion in poetic naturalism. Yes, I think that you got it. That's exactly
*  right. Part of it is because I'm just trying to be careful not to confuse what actually happens
*  with what must necessarily happen. In this picture of different ways of talking about the world,
*  what I say is there are domains of validity, domains of applicability. I was told not to
*  say validity because philosophers use validity to refer to the validity of a logical deductive
*  argument. Domains of applicability, although validity sounds better to me. In the space of
*  all possible things that can happen in the world, different theories might accurately describe what's
*  going on in some circumstances, but not in others. For example, once again, if you go to the gas in
*  a box, since there are usually so many atoms and molecules of gas in the box, the fluid description
*  also works to describe what happens in that box. If you only had one molecule in the box,
*  then there's no fluid description that would work. The atomic description still works perfectly well.
*  The atomic description is a little bit more comprehensive. It has a domain of applicability
*  that is a little bit broader than the fluid description does. If you imagine plotting
*  some Venn diagram, you would have the domain of applicability of the atomic description. Then
*  a subset of that would be the domain of applicability of the fluid description.
*  It happens to be the case that in many, many known and understood and familiar examples of emergence,
*  all of the theories are entirely subsets of other theories. In other words, there is a hierarchy.
*  There's some big comprehensive theory, and there's some emergent theory that is a subset of that,
*  and in a subsequent emergent theory, it is a subset of that, and so forth. The usual story
*  is something like physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, sociology, or whatever. Those are all
*  individual theories that work under different circumstances that are supposed to be consistent
*  with each other, but something like sociology has a much smaller domain of applicability than
*  particle physics does. Domain of applicability doesn't mean it's the best way to look at it.
*  It makes no sense to describe human beings using particle physics, but you don't want your human
*  beings to be incompatible with particle physics either. You want them to obey those rules.
*  Okay. Having said all that, and I think that's what Benjamin's guess or original thought was,
*  but having said all that, this fact that higher-level theories or what we call higher-level
*  theories fit inside the domains of applicability of lower-level theories is in no sense necessary.
*  In the space of how we could possibly imagine knowledge being organized, it's very easy to
*  imagine two completely non-intersecting domains of applicability or two domains of applicability
*  of different theories that intersect without one being a subset of the other, some overlap,
*  but incomplete overlap. I think that those kinds of possibilities might even be relevant for
*  questions of things like strong emergence and downward causation and things like that.
*  So you're exactly right, Benjamin, that I do not use reductionism in this picture. Reductionism is
*  a specific kind of emergence where you say not only is my higher-level theory a subset of the
*  lower-level theory, but the lower-level theory is made of small pieces, collections of which are the
*  ontological elements of the higher-level theory in a very straightforward way that does make sense
*  in a lot of circumstances, like with the atoms in the gas. The little cubic millimeter of gas
*  in a fluid is a whole bunch of molecules. It's literally a collection of those little smaller
*  pieces, but there's other cases where that doesn't work, and partly why I'm so sensitive to this
*  is there's something called quantum mechanics, and in quantum mechanics you can say the classical
*  world emerges from it, but not because one big classical thing is made of little tiny wave
*  functions. There's still only one wave function for the whole world, right? The way that the
*  classical world emerges from the quantum world is much more subtle than a naive reductionistic
*  picture, so I'm trying to separate out all the different ways things could possibly happen
*  from the specific ways they happen in the real world. That was the point of that discussion in
*  the book. Stuart Haynes says, how do you find living with an electric vehicle? Has the range
*  ever been an issue? What do you like most about it, and what do you miss the most from your prior
*  vehicle? Yeah, so as some of you know, I have a BMW i3. If you've seen one of these on the streets,
*  you'll recognize it. It's a tiny little car. It's about the size of a Mini. It's kind of space-age
*  looking. We call it the space buggy, and one of the fun things about it is that it's available,
*  or was available. I think they're canceling it. It has been available with different interior
*  packages made of different materials, so the interior of our space buggy is like a mixture
*  of fabric and leather and carbon fiber and wood. Oh yeah, wood is the steering wheel,
*  so it's like a kind of postmodern pastiche of different kinds of things. It's electric,
*  and it's not at all popular, this particular car. The reason why is they didn't even try
*  to give it a long range. The range is like 100 miles, purely electric, maybe 120. Then there is
*  a range extender, which is like a little tiny putt-putt engine that is gas driven. It took me
*  a while to figure this out. The gas driven putt-putt engine never drives the car. I call it a
*  putt-putt engine. It's literally from a moped, originally, I believe. If you're running low on
*  the electrical charge, you can run the range extender, and it will recharge your battery.
*  Then you're still running on electric. The actual powertrain of the car is purely electric,
*  but there's sort of like a backup source of electricity, which I've never used. We've never
*  used the range extender. Many people, for very good reasons, get very uncomfortable if their range
*  is less than 300 miles. Something that I think is not said out loud enough, the reason why that's
*  a problem is because it takes time to charge your car. The range on an internal combustion engine
*  car isn't much more than 300 miles, but you can go to the gas station, and a minute later, you're
*  full up, and then you can keep going, whereas it takes time to charge your car. That's why things
*  like fuel cell cars are interesting ideas, but they haven't really become practical yet.
*  Anyway, the whole point of the i3 is you wouldn't want it as your only car, and you wouldn't want it
*  as a car at all if you led the kind of lifestyle where you're driving 100 miles every day or more.
*  But if you live in a big city or even in a reasonable size suburb, and it's your second car,
*  if you're a two-car household as we are, then it's perfect. I love it. I love that car to death.
*  We have a gas car now for road trips, et cetera, and we have the space buggy, the i3, and almost
*  all the time we're driving the i3 when there's a choice because it's quiet, you get this pleasurable
*  experience of driving by the gas station and never stopping. It's very, very zippy,
*  even though it's tiny. The acceleration, it doesn't go very fast. Its top end speed is not competitive
*  with a Tesla or anything like that, but its handling and initial burst of speed are very,
*  very good. So you really feel like you're totally in control of what the car is doing on the road.
*  And the aesthetics are cool, and it's just kind of like a very fun car to drive. You just are
*  smiling when you're driving the i3. So we've been very, very happy with that, but I totally get that
*  it wouldn't work if it was your only car, if you had a big family, or for many other things. It's
*  a very niche kind of vehicle. Gillis15 says, I read yesterday the NFL team who won the coin toss
*  since the introduction of the current NFL overtime rules has only lost once. Should the NFL change
*  its overtime rules to match those of college football where each team gets at least one
*  possession from the 25 yard line? I have no idea whether it should or not, but I strongly suspect
*  it should. So I'm not a football fan anymore. I used to be a football fan as a kid. For various
*  reasons, I've stopped following football. So I've not followed these recent controversies about the
*  overtime rules. The only reason I'm answering this question, I have nothing interesting to say about
*  it, but I have this feeling that sports leagues are way too conservative about changing obviously
*  bad rules. Even though I don't know the details of this situation, my strong suspicion is that
*  they should change the rule. There have been so many complaints. That's one of those things where
*  apparently this year the rule has been coming into being very relevant in the playoff games
*  over and over again, but you should have known years ago that this was a silly rule. It's some
*  kind of sudden death overtime where the first team to score wins, which might make sense in
*  soccer, regular football, but not in American football. That makes no sense at all. So yeah,
*  they should change it. That's my thought. Johann Lüfgren says, one of Weinberg's three conditions
*  for when a physical system can be described as an effective field theory is something called cluster
*  decomposition, which is typically called a type of locality constraint. But we also know that quantum
*  gravity will need to have some non-local aspects. Does that mean that treating the core theory as
*  an effective field theory is actually mistaken? Or can the core theory manage to preserve
*  cluster decomposition while still being non-local? This is a good technical, but very good question.
*  The point is that the core theory is not supposed to account for gravity in those regimes where the
*  non-local aspects would be relevant. So it's true, you're correct, that there are reasons to believe
*  that quantum gravity has some non-local aspects. But what are those reasons? Those reasons have to
*  do with black hole information laws or something like that, or very, very unlikely phase transition,
*  bubble nucleation kind of things. Nothing that is in the everyday life regime. The whole point
*  of the core theory is that it correctly describes everything that we know about, including gravity
*  in the everyday life regime, in the solar system, on the earth, the sun. And there,
*  there's no non-locality that you're expecting from quantum gravity. So the core theory is
*  resolutely an effective field theory and does obey cluster decomposition. And it has a domain of
*  applicability, as we were just talking about. And that domain of applicability does not include
*  black holes or the Big Bang or any other places where non-locality is expected to become important.
*  Mark Greger Pierce, I don't know how to pronounce his name, sorry, Mark, says,
*  I've heard many physicists express disappointment when experiments designed to find problems with
*  Einstein's general theory of relativity fail. They say that finding problems with general
*  relativity would open doors to new physics. From my perspective, experiments that once again support
*  general relativity simply show Einstein's enduring brilliance. I wonder where you stand on this topic?
*  Well, look, many things. So I guess the big picture answer is all physicists are always
*  going to be disappointed when a theory that somebody else came up with passes an experimental
*  test, roughly speaking. Because if you're doing the test, and there's two possibilities,
*  you're confirming an existing theory or finding an anomaly, finding an experimental difference
*  between what the real world is doing and what the theory is doing, it's much more interesting to
*  find an anomaly, right? Because that means that there's a better theory out there that maybe you
*  don't have yet, but you can start looking for it. Whereas if you're just reconfirming an existing
*  theory, that's very, very good work, it could be very, very valuable, but it's not going to lead
*  to a breakthrough in inventing a better theory. So that's why people are disappointed by that.
*  If you're Professor Einstein, you can take personal pleasure in having your theory pass all these
*  tests. That's great. So that's roughly, I think, the perspective that working physicists have.
*  They want useful new input into their task, into their program of building new theories.
*  But also, I wanted to comment because you said the experiments that support general relativity
*  show Einstein's enduring brilliance. And I don't think that's right. I think that's there's a
*  little bit of a misunderstanding there. I mean, if Einstein would not be any less brilliant,
*  if an experiment showed a deviation from general relativity, Einstein invented general relativity,
*  that was his brilliance. That's already shown. It's a wonderful theory for all sorts of reasons.
*  And the fact that it works in the easy cases is more than enough to establish Einstein's
*  enduring brilliance. What these experiments are establishing is not the brilliance of some human
*  being, but the particular way that nature works, that some theories have certain domains of
*  applicability that are quite broad. The amazing thing about general relativity, I mean, it's
*  amazing from one perspective and perfectly natural from another perspective, is that you
*  invent it by thinking about the solar system. Like Einstein in 1915, he didn't know about cosmology
*  or black holes, right? So he knows about Newtonian gravity, he knows about relativity, special
*  relativity. On the basis of that, he says, you know, okay, what's the simplest way to reconcile
*  these? And he invents this brilliant idea of curved space-time. And he says, okay, what's the
*  equation that curved space-time should obey? Buy my book for why the right equation pops out in the
*  way it does. But the point is the equation he comes up with is more or less unique. Given the one
*  of relatively simple equation that relates the curvature of space-time to matter and energy,
*  you're going to come up with Einstein's equation. Einstein did it first, but you're going to do it.
*  It's not as if there weren't many choices. And the amazing thing is it also works for pulsars
*  and black holes and the expansion of the universe and the microwave background and a million other
*  things, right? We understand why on the basis of how field theory works. General relativity is a
*  field theory. It's a classical field theory, but still in the general realm of field theories,
*  you would expect field theories to work on long length scales and to break down at some shorter
*  length scale. So if general relativity works in the solar system, you'd expect it to keep working
*  cosmologically. Not necessarily that with 100% certainty, but that's the way to bet. So I'm all
*  in favor of people looking for deviations from general relativity and cosmology, but I don't
*  expect them to find any. Ken Wolf says, in the Mindscape podcast episode quantifying the shape
*  of stories, Peter Dodds talked about some of the potential dark sides of storytelling.
*  Is there any particular popular story, be it a novel, movie or television series that you think
*  has an underlying message or moral which you regard as being fundamentally wrong or misguided
*  and why? So I debated about this question because I don't have a good actual answer. I mean, I could
*  say that, I don't know, some of the Ayn Rand's novels have a bad moral message about selfishness
*  or Lenny Riefenstahl's movies that were propaganda for Hitler, those are bad, or the pro-slavery
*  movies from D.W. Griffith, bad. Okay, but those are not currently popular TV properties or something
*  like that. And I'm sure the answer is yes. I'm sure that there are shows on TV right now whose
*  message or moral I disagree with, but I can't think of any honestly off the top of my head right now.
*  So I was originally thinking that it's not worth answering since I have no good answers to give you,
*  but there's an underlying issue here that is at least worth, again, not answering, so I don't know
*  the answer to it, but worth bringing up which is what does it mean to say that a story has a message
*  or moral, right? I mean, we all know it does. I'm not arguing that stories don't have messages or
*  morals, but in some sense, I mean, think about this potential point of view. A story is just
*  recounting of things that happen and they don't happen in the real world. It's a fictional story,
*  but it's a set of things that happen in this imaginary world, right? Okay, but we know you
*  can't derive ought from is. So what does it mean to say that this particular recounting of events
*  has a moral or a message? And presumably what it means is that there is some kind of justice that
*  occurs that people who make the right choices are rewarded, people who make the bad choices are
*  punished, and most of the time, I think that that's actually true, but sometimes it's not. I mean,
*  sometimes we know of stories where the clearly heroic character doesn't win in the end, right?
*  The character does all the right things and nevertheless comes out worse for wear. And so
*  I can't quite condense what that means into a simple statement. How do we know what the moral
*  is if they fail? I think that there's some complicated kind of subtle subtextual thing about
*  the way characters are portrayed as either heroic or despicable or whatever, but I'm not exactly
*  sure how you could objectively classify those things. So I think that the morality or message
*  of a story has to do with which actions are treated as heroic or admirable, but I couldn't
*  tell you what the rules are for saying, oh yes, this story is treating these actions as heroic
*  or admirable. I'm just not sure. So I don't know what the answers are, but I thought that was an
*  interesting thing to think about. So I'm glad that you asked the question. Jonathan Sorocco says,
*  I want to know your thoughts about one common criticism of string theory, namely the falsifiability
*  of the theory. And then there's more to the question you can read in the comments on Patreon,
*  but that's basically the question. You know, what is the issue with falsifiability and string
*  theory? So there's a couple issues. I mean, one is the whole idea of falsifiability is a little bit
*  overblown. As I've written about in blog posts and papers, Popper, when he was talking about
*  falsifiability was gesturing toward two very important features of a good physical theory.
*  One is that it should be definite. There are some things that the theory says are potentially
*  allowed to happen and some things that are not. Okay. It cannot literally account for everything.
*  Right. And the other aspect that he was gesturing toward is that there should be some empirical
*  way of judging the success of the theory. That's what really matters. It's really those two things
*  that really matter. And he, you know, attempted to sort of sum them up in this single criterion of
*  falsifiability, but it didn't really work. Philosophers of science these days don't buy
*  falsifiability as the right way of demarcating science from non-science. Physicists love
*  falsifiability because it's a one phrase, right? You don't have to think that hard. Like they talk
*  to real philosophers of science and it sounds like you keep talking and it's hard and it hurts
*  your brain. You don't want to bother. Whereas falsifiability is just a little model you can put
*  on a bumper sticker. That doesn't make it any more accurate. So there's issues with using
*  falsifiability in a too simplistic a way. That's one thing. But the other is, you know, think about
*  let me before directly addressing string theory, let me give you an example of a failure mode of
*  thinking of falsifiability is the most important thing in the world. One way that a theory might
*  not be falsifiable is if there are free parameters in the theory, right? Like Newtonian gravity has
*  a free parameter, Newton's constant of gravitation. And you measure it, you know, because you know the
*  theory is accurate in a certain regime, you go just measure the parameter. But if you don't know
*  your theory is right in a certain regime, you might have a parameter with the feature that as
*  that parameter gets smaller and smaller, it becomes harder and harder to see any effect of
*  the theory whatsoever. Right? Like strings are very tiny, so it's hard to see them.
*  Dark matter interacts very weakly in the limit as dark matter doesn't interact at all, you will
*  never see it in an experiment in a lab here on earth. Okay. So does that mean that the theory is
*  not falsifiable? Because there are values of the parameters that would make the direct implications
*  of the theory unmeasurable. And I say this because many people talk as if it would that that counts
*  as not being falsifiable if there are free parameters that would basically hide the theory
*  from your view. So here's the problem with that. What if you find the theories right?
*  So an example is cosmic strings. Okay, cosmic strings are different than string theory,
*  cosmic strings are big cosmic things, left over from the early universe, not little tiny things
*  that are supposed to be elementary particles. But there's this idea that there are leftover
*  cosmic strings from the early universe that you know, could have a role in current astrophysical
*  dynamics. But there's a free parameter, what we call the tension of the string, basically the
*  energy density along the string. And if there are lots of strings, and there are very dense,
*  high tension, it would be easy to see them. And in the limit, as the tension of the string gets
*  smaller and smaller and smaller, then you would never see them, right? If the tension is arbitrarily
*  small, there'd be zero observable effects. So this perspective would say, okay, that's not a
*  falsifiable theory, we should not count it. The problem is, what if you measure it? What if you
*  do detect it? What if you measure a specific value of the theory of the of the tension of
*  the strings, because you've seen some gravitational lensing event or something like that. Now you've
*  you've tied yourself in a philosophical knot where you have to say, well, I can't believe the result
*  of that observation, because I've decided this is not a scientific theory. And that's just silly,
*  right? Because falsifiability is not the right way to demarcate scientific theories from non
*  scientific theories. So that's an analogous to the string theory situation, because string theory,
*  like other approaches to quantum gravity, like loop quantum gravity, etc.
*  has, you know, hand wavy ways that maybe it could someday lead to experimentally testable results,
*  large extra dimensions, supersymmetry, things like that. It's a tenuous set of connections
*  between the predictions of string theory and potentially observable things, but they're there.
*  And we could easily imagine a situation where over the next few years or whatever, we suddenly
*  make a series of experimental discoveries that convinces us that string theory is on the right
*  track. But it's also very plausible, in fact, way more likely that even if string theory is true,
*  it continues to hide from our direct experimental probes, roughly because gravity is weak and
*  quantum gravity is hard to experimentally test, nothing specific with string theory, just gravity
*  is the problematic thing here. So people have pointed out that in string theory, there are
*  extra dimensions, there are many ways to hide those extra dimensions, and every way leads to
*  a different low energy version of physics. By low energy version of physics, I mean for us,
*  the core theory, the standard model particle physics with its specific forces and matter
*  particles, etc. And there are different ways that could have turned out if we lived in a world with
*  a different compactification of the extra dimensions. There are so many possible ways
*  to compactify the extra dimensions that you can get almost any specific version of low energy
*  particle physics. So people make the criticism that therefore string theory predicts every possible
*  thing, therefore predicts nothing, therefore it's not a theory at all. And I don't believe that
*  either. I mean, I think that's just sloppy reasoning on the basis of people who don't like string
*  theory, because as I said, that's the low energy physics of string theory. String theory comes into
*  its own at high energies near the Planck scale, where it makes definite predictions for what would
*  happen if you scattered two strings off of each other. Now even there, there are subtleties because
*  of dualities and so forth, but it's very much in the realm of things where there are thought
*  experiments we could do that clearly show that things are behaving in a stringy fashion or not
*  behaving in a stringy fashion. There's no guarantee we'll ever be able to do that. But in in sort of
*  the underlying story of what Popper had in mind when he invented falsifiability, the fact that
*  string theory says that certain things would happen and certain things would not is what matters,
*  not whether or not you and I can ever actually do those experiments. Okay. Felix Dare asks a priority
*  question. And it's a long one. Buckle up. So say if we take the cat out of the thought experiment,
*  Schrodinger's cat, and focus instead on what is going on with the atom, we have a machine which
*  randomly selects a single atom from a sealed box containing many identical radioactive atoms.
*  The machine takes a reading at the exact point of the atom's half life. If it is decayed, then a
*  macroscopic event A is triggered like a bell is rung. If it is not decayed, then macroscopic event
*  B is triggered, a firework rocket goes off, let's say. I would argue, says Felix, that the atom which
*  is selected from the container is special in some very particular way. It alone among all the atoms
*  in the room is able to impact the wider world around it. Each of the macroscopic events in
*  question could have occurred spontaneously without any intervention from the machine,
*  but the chances of that so happening are extraordinarily unlikely. If I can apply a
*  version of what I understand to be your explanation of the multiverse theory, the rules have been rigged
*  so that the universe can split into only one of two outcomes, each of which was always possible,
*  but neither of which would have otherwise been expected to occur. The laws of physics described
*  to the atom are exactly the same as for those left behind in the container, but the selected atom is
*  special in a very remarkable way. It has been given in effect agency to choose which event will
*  occur. This agency comes not from anything particular about that atom, but rather from
*  the structure of all the other atoms around it, the machine, the bell, the firework, etc. If we are
*  prepared to make this leap, then the same agency could equally be ascribed to the structure of the
*  atoms inside the human brain, albeit on a much more complicated level. I may perhaps be restating the
*  problem of consciousness, but it seems to me that the above perspective provides a route by which
*  the purely quantum properties of a particular atom or other subatomic particles can reach out
*  to influence and perhaps even be said to communicate with the wider macroscopic world. Okay,
*  so I forget whether I edited your question. Sorry about that, but there's not a question mark that
*  is lying at the end of that. I will try to comment on what you're getting at because there are a
*  couple of comments here. One is I think the basic picture is perfectly plausible. The basic picture
*  that individual quantum events at the atomic or subatomic level will usually be unnoticeable to us,
*  right? The decay of a single atom is not something that happens all the time in our bodies and we
*  don't notice, but in exactly the right circumstances, you can amplify those quantum events. This is a
*  well-known thing. You can take a quantum event and if it interacts with the surrounding materials
*  in exactly the right way, that amplification can become macroscopic. No problems with that whatsoever,
*  completely on the right track there. Now, the question is, there's two questions. One is,
*  does it make any sense to assign the word agency to this? I don't think there is. That's not what
*  I mean by agency anyway. Agency, in my mind, specifically makes sense as a description of a
*  situation where there is some immensely complex situation where you can't actually model all of
*  the moving pieces that are doing their thing and therefore it becomes useful as an emergent higher
*  level description to ascribe an agent making choices or to use that language, that ontology,
*  to describe what is going on. A single atom just obeying the Schrodinger equation is not in that
*  situation of enormous complexity where I have no better way of describing it than as an agent
*  making choices. I would not want to use that word, but what you're getting at with the human brain
*  is in some sense, I think, perfectly reasonable. The thing that happens in the human brain is,
*  I think, the collective behavior of a whole bunch of things governed by the laws of physics.
*  It's absolutely the case that whatever is happening in the human brain is a bunch of atoms doing their
*  thing. Now there's a specific question about whether or not the quantumness of the individual
*  atoms matters. When you hit a baseball and you follow its trajectory, that baseball is made of
*  atoms and atoms obey the rules of quantum mechanics, but who cares? The baseball is going
*  to obey the classical equations of motion. The question is, in the particular configuration of
*  the human brain, where we think that the human brain is much more complex than a baseball,
*  there are a lot of moving parts and the moving parts matter in interesting ways. Individual
*  neurons talk to each other, signals get fired back and forth in a pattern that is hard to predict
*  exactly what's going on. Those things that happen are generally thought of as neurochemical.
*  They're generally conceived at the level of neurons doing things under certain circumstances.
*  You can talk about the action potential and what signals the neurons are receiving and what ones
*  are giving out and so forth, but you could go down to the level of individual atoms. Neurons are small,
*  but they're much bigger than atoms. There's a lot of atoms in a neuron. Usually the description we
*  use at the neuron level. The question is, I'm finally getting to it, is it easy or at least
*  plausible to imagine circumstances under which a 50-50 quantum measurement possibility in an
*  individual atom can lead to different behaviors in a neuron that would lead to different behaviors
*  in a macroscopic person. That I honestly don't know the answer. It is completely plausible to
*  me that that could happen. I suspect it is rare. I suspect that because the brain has a lot of
*  particles in it, many, many, many particles, even though it has a lot of neurons, again,
*  those neurons have a lot of atoms in them and these signals, these electrochemical signals are
*  still involving a lot of atoms. I suspect individual quantum choices or measurement outcomes
*  usually wash out, but if you're right there on the precipice halfway between one possibility and
*  another, maybe a single quantum measurement event really does matter. I don't think that has anything
*  to do with, well, it's not a necessary part of talking about consciousness. Let's put it that
*  way. I believe that you could do everything that is necessary to explain consciousness using
*  classical physics or using just the higher level neuron description, but I don't know about that.
*  I'm being open-minded about that. Maybe someday we really do need to take into account these
*  quantum events to really think about what is happening in the brain and becoming amplified up
*  to human actions. That's an open possibility. Noble Gas says, as Bayesians, we can never assign
*  zero percent probability to anything. Some scenarios have vanishingly small chance of being true,
*  but in expected value calculation, the badness of them is so great that it overwhelms even the
*  smallest probability. These things cause me a great amount of psychological distress, even though
*  I assign a very low likelihood to them. For example, I lose sleep over simulation arguments
*  with dystopian outcomes and quantum immortality. I know you've written about these topics, but you
*  don't seem distressed by them. What advice can you give to people who know these things are unlikely
*  but still worry about them? Well, I think there's at least two things going on. You're right in the
*  basic setup. If you believe in both quantum mechanics and Bayesian reasoning, then there are
*  very unlikely but very bad events. The two things that I would emphasize are, number one,
*  they're typically very unlikely. Even if they're very bad, there's no guarantee that even if the
*  badness is large, the product of the badness times the likelihood is large. You would have to do a
*  very, very careful analysis of that. Back when the Large Hadron Collider was firing up and people
*  asked scientists, is there a chance it destroys the earth? The honest scientists had to say,
*  well, there's a chance. There's always a chance. They eventually gave up saying that. John Ellis,
*  when he was interviewed on the Tonight Show, no, John Stewart's show,
*  you know what the show is. He just was asked about whether the LHC could destroy the world. He said,
*  no, that was it. That was his answer. No, it won't because he knew that careful parsing of
*  tiny probabilities was not useful in that particular atmosphere. But the point is that
*  the scientists did very, very carefully think about the probabilities, wrote papers about them,
*  did calculations. The probability is never zero, but it's so very, very, very tiny that they judged
*  it not worth thinking about. I think that's generally the case with these kinds of situations.
*  The other one, which was pointed out by Martin Rees on the podcast episode that I did with him
*  way back when, was if you're going to focus on these very, very unlikely bad events, you have
*  to admit the possibility of very, very likely good events. The LHC will give us free energy,
*  violating the conservation of energy and providing free power for all of human eternity.
*  There you go. It's possible. Maybe the LHC will allow us to cure all diseases.
*  You talk about simulation arguments with dystopian outcomes. Yes, but there's also simulation
*  arguments with utopian or heavenly outcomes. I think you should just ignore all of them.
*  I think if they're truly very, very low probability, the real thing is not a conviction.
*  The probability is so low that when you multiply it by the badness, it's still small,
*  but a humble recognition that the probability is so low that you don't know what the probability is.
*  That's the threshold in my mind that makes it not worth worrying about. Once we're
*  talking about things that are so unlikely that it is just moonshine for me to pretend that I know
*  what the probability is, I'm not going to worry about those things. There's enough real world
*  things out there to worry about and to be happy about. Gregory Kusnik says,
*  the hard problem of consciousness is usually framed in terms of explaining how subjective
*  experience can emerge from the purely physical interaction of particles. But no one seems to
*  wonder how, say, natural selection emerges from fundamental physics. Indeed, 50 years before the
*  formulation of quantum physics and a century before Watson and Crick, natural selection was
*  understood as a logical consequence of imperfectly replicating information. Its explanation is
*  completely disconnected from the underlying physics of the molecules that carry that information.
*  Do you think consciousness could be like that and its explanation will be found not by mapping the
*  brain down to a level of particles, but by developments in cybernetics and information
*  theory that shed light on the nature of complex systems without reference to the underlying
*  physics? Yeah, I think that's more or less completely obviously true. I would be absolutely
*  shocked if anything about fundamental physics was useful in explaining consciousness. The only
*  point that I have to offer in debates about consciousness is that we have very, very little
*  reason to imagine altering fundamental physics to help explain consciousness. So in fact, this is
*  exactly my point of view that we should think of it as an emergent higher level phenomenon.
*  I would be very surprised if you couldn't even think about... Well, I mean, you mentioned
*  information theory in cybernetics. Those will undoubtedly be useful. I think that understanding
*  the brain is going to be the most useful thing, right? I know that people don't agree with this.
*  The argument against this is that you can understand everything that the brain does and still
*  don't have a handle on subjective experience. But I believe that if we truly understood everything
*  the brain does, that when you feel sad, something is going on in your brain, when you experience the
*  color of red, something else is going on in your brain, we would eventually be done. We would just
*  say that's it. This is what is happening. And then the phrase, I'm experiencing the color of red,
*  is a way of expressing something going on at the level of neurons, which is also something going
*  on at the level of atoms and particles, right? But we don't need to know what that is to have
*  an explanation, just as with natural selection. Jay says, I appreciate it if you could discuss
*  the physical interpretation of fields. I more or less understand the mathematical definition,
*  but for example, I don't understand where the fields come from physically. Were they created
*  at the Big Bang or already present? Are they expanding and lockstep with the universe or is
*  the universe expanding via fields that already exist? So I'm worried, Jay, that you have a
*  intuition about fields that is not quite accurate. Fields are properties of the universe that are
*  located at every point in space-time. So they are coexistent with space-time itself. They're
*  not created or destroyed, the fields themselves. The field could have a value of zero at some point,
*  so the particles that are excitations of the fields can be created or destroyed, but the fields are
*  just there. They come along with the ride once you have space-time. You can have different theories
*  where different fields come along with the ride, but in any given theory with certain sets of
*  fields, there they are. So what that means is that at every point in space, there is a set of
*  field values for the different fields, for the electron field, for the electromagnetic field,
*  and so forth. As space gets bigger, number one, you have to ask what you mean by that. Space getting
*  bigger. In cosmology, we have a perfectly good understanding of what we mean by that. We mean
*  the distance in between galaxies is increasing, but at the fundamental physics level, we're less
*  sure that we know what we mean by that. In classical general relativity, there are an
*  infinite number of points between any two locations in space. So when we say space expands,
*  there are still an infinite number of points. There's no mathematically rigorous sense in
*  which there are more of them, even if they doubled in number, if you know what I mean.
*  But anyway, the usual conventional picture is space gets bigger and at every point in space,
*  the fields are there. They're not causing the universe to expand or anything like that,
*  but they have energy and that energy does affect the expansion of the universe.
*  Jim Watson says, in the expanding universe, do we think the Planck constant is really constant,
*  or is it that the Planck constant is changing with the expansion of space-time?
*  Well, we certainly think it's constant. You can try to do measurements, asking yourself how it
*  would change, how observable things would change if Planck's constant were different, but that's
*  exactly like the speed of light in the sense that there's a very real sense in which the Planck
*  constant is just equal to one. You can always choose units in which that's true. It's not so much
*  a constant of nature as it is a conversion factor between different things going on. In particular,
*  it's the conversion factor that relates quantum effects to classical ones. And so if you think
*  about what it would mean to change the speed of light, the speed of light is an easier example,
*  so let me talk about that. We can relate it then to Planck's constant. If you talk about changing
*  the speed of light, you think that makes sense. There's a certain number of meters per second,
*  right? 300,000 kilometers per second. How hard would it be to change that number? But what you're
*  really doing is changing the definition of the meter or the second. You can always define the
*  speed of light to be one light second per second. And in particle physics, what it works out to be
*  is that the definition of, I forget which way it goes, I think that it's a definition of a
*  meter is given in a certain, in terms of a certain number. No, the definition of a second is a certain
*  number of cycles of something, some atomic transition, and then the definition of a meter
*  is the distance light travels in a certain fraction of a second. So to change the speed of light,
*  effectively, I mean, you can't in some sense, but you could trick yourself into thinking that it
*  happened if you changed all the other constants of nature in such a way that things seemed the
*  same except for these relationships between the number of cycles of some atomic transition and
*  the size of an atom or something like that. Okay. So likewise, you could imagine some conspiratorial
*  change in all of the real constants of nature, the fine structure constant, the mass of the electron
*  and so forth, that we would call it a change in the Planck constant. There's no reason to expect
*  that that happens. So I don't think it's a hot topic in theoretical physics. And there's also
*  no reason to expect that any of those things change either we are looking for the individual changes in
*  mass of the electron charge of electron things like that, but the limits on them already are pretty
*  good. Casey Mahone says, How important do you think it is to push yourself out of your comfort zone?
*  Pardon me wants to relax and enjoy my simple life. But another part says I'm supposed to aim for
*  something bigger. I feel like a hobbit in the Shire wondering whether it's a quest I meant to
*  embark on. For context, I'm in my late 20s. So I wondered if you may have felt similarly at my age.
*  For the last part of the question, I was very lucky in some sense in that I knew what I wanted
*  to do from a very, very young age, right? I wanted to get a PhD in theoretical physics, think about
*  the universe. And that's what I'm doing now many, many years later. So I didn't really worry too
*  much about that sort of thing. I knew that I was in the middle of a journey and there's nowhere near
*  the end of it yet. But more generally speaking, you know, many people are not that lucky. And I'm
*  not even sure that I would recommend that you should try to be that lucky because many people
*  don't discover what it is they really want to do until later. And that's completely fine.
*  There's a balance I think between pushing yourself out of your comfort zone and just enjoying the
*  simple life that you have. Neither one of those two are bad things. Enjoying your simple life is
*  good. Pushing out of your comfort zone also good. I think it's a very highly personal decision how
*  to balance those two things. The only non-trivial thing I can say is, of course, that there's a
*  default of enjoying your simple life and relaxing, right? Pushing yourself out of your comfort zone
*  is something where the rewards to that can be a little bit less tangible, a little bit less obvious
*  and immediate. So it's something where you might have to push yourself to do it and then find that
*  you're very, very happy you did it, right? Speaking of, we were talking about working out at the gym
*  earlier. Same exact kind of thing. Like, you know, I might be sitting here going, I don't want to do
*  that. But then once I actually did it, I'm like, I'm very glad I did that, right? So it's a competition
*  between your present self and your future self. I'm in favor of pushing yourself out of your
*  comfort zone. I enjoy it. But I don't insist that other people enjoy it to the same extent. So you
*  have to pick and choose. You know, that's not a choice that other people can make for you, but
*  you got to keep your options open. Amanda Bradford says, which disciplines or area of study do you
*  not find very interesting? It's a tough one, actually. You know, I thought about it because
*  there's certainly plenty of things I don't find interesting. But as I thought about it,
*  it's more like specific subsets of areas I find uninteresting. Like in most areas I can think of,
*  at least academic areas, I can find some aspect of those areas, you know, history or literature
*  or whatever that I find really, really interesting. Now, of course, there are non academic areas,
*  you know, there are sports or leisure time activities that I have zero interest in.
*  But that thing, that's not what you're asking. You're asking about disciplines or areas of study.
*  So yeah, I mean, that's, that's tough for me. I mean, I don't want to see sound like I'm
*  interested in everything. I'm not even interested in parts of theoretical physics.
*  But you know, I honestly kind of feel like I don't want to make up a couple of them,
*  just as examples, because people will inevitably say, I think that these are intrinsically not
*  interesting, rather than me saying that my personal interest does not lie there. So I would say that
*  for evidence for what I think is interesting, you know, look for how I act and how I talk,
*  look at the things I do talk about, those are things I do think are interesting. And the other
*  things I think are less interesting. That's the way you can collect evidence for those hypotheses.
*  Jeff B says, Can you give a brief description of the differences between string theory and loop
*  quantum gravity? And you do you subscribe more or less to either one? I think they're quite
*  different. I mean, loop quantum gravity is, you know, in some sense, is a very conservative
*  program. It starts with Einstein's classical general relativity theory for space time,
*  it rewrites it in a certain set of variables, and then it tries to quantize the resulting
*  theory using techniques of quantization that have been around for a long time. And you of course
*  immediately run into problems with that. So you try to be clever about getting around them.
*  I would say, honestly, I don't think loop quantum gravity has gotten very far, to be very, very
*  honest, it's a very obvious thing to try. I'm glad that some people are trying to do it, you never
*  know when they might have a breakthrough around the corner. But I would say that things we've
*  learned from not even necessarily string theory, but but string theorists, let's put it that way,
*  because string theory is a very different approach, where they didn't try to quantize
*  gravity, they're originally trying to understand the strong interactions of particle physics,
*  and they stumbled upon gravity being predicted by this idea that there were strings, quantum
*  strings propagating through a pre existing space time, predicted the existence of gravity. So that's
*  already more promising, right? Like, if the theory hands you gravity, when you weren't even looking
*  for it, that's a promising kind of sign. And they've gone very far. Now, part of why they've
*  gone very far is because a huge amount of brain power has been devoted to thinking about string
*  theory. And they've also hit obstacles. But so far, mostly, they've been able to overcome the
*  obstacles, you know, their extra dimensions of space time, they figured out ways to compactify
*  them, and so forth. And through all this effort to finish the sentence I started a minute ago,
*  we've discovered some amazing things. It's all thought experiment things. It's not things we
*  discovered in a lab, but things like holography and complementarity are two of the most obvious
*  things, which I think are profound features that will probably be part of quantum gravity,
*  even if string theory is not correct. And you know, the loop quantum gravity people did not
*  discover those things. They can try x post facto to match them. But you know, we got to be fair
*  about what happened historically that those things came out of people who were doing mostly string
*  theory. And so I'm not sure if either one is right. I think that string theory has given us a whole
*  bunch of fascinating results that are very promising to be part of the ultimate theory,
*  whether or not the ultimate theory looks like string theory or not, I don't know. You know,
*  I think that we it pays to be humble a little bit here, you know, we're trying to do something in
*  quantum gravity, that we have no right to expect should be easy. You know, when I when I started
*  in this game late 80s early 90s, it was after the first superstring revolution, but before the second
*  superstring revolution. So honestly, a lot of academics, a lot of high powered physicists were
*  still very skeptical of string theory, you know, they were waiting for really unmistakable
*  experimental prediction. And that's not what happened. But instead, what happened was his
*  revolution and understanding non perturbative effects and dualities and holography and string
*  theory, that was the content of the second superstring revolution. And that was enough
*  to convince a lot of physicists that it was worth doing worth hiring people, right? I mean,
*  that was really was in the 90s, that really all of your major big shot universities hired all the
*  string theorists that they could find. There's never been an event that made all the big shot
*  universities hire all the loop quantum gravity people they can find. But we'll see, you know,
*  I think that what I was trying to say was, back in the 80s, the reason why people started thinking
*  about string theory was not because it was the obvious next thing to think about. It was because
*  two things happened at the same time. Number one, we more or less finished the standard model,
*  right? We discovered the W and Z bosons, we hadn't discovered the top quark or the Higgs boson yet,
*  but everyone expected that we would. So we had a model that fit all the data in terms of
*  experiments. And number two, the first superstring revolution convinced people that maybe this was
*  a kind of a peer into a regime of physics that we had no right to think that we would be able
*  to solve so easily. That was the thought in the 1980s. You know, I mean, Ed Witten said it was a
*  piece of 21st century mathematics dropped into the 20th century. Now, it turns out that it's hard to
*  actually connect it to the real world. And I think in retrospect, we should be completely unsurprised
*  by that. If I needed to pick one, I would pick string theory. But as many of you know, I'm sort
*  of I'm not really a bandwagon follower and that there's very, very large numbers of extremely
*  smart people trying to work out string theory and good for them. I'm glad they're doing it.
*  I'm trying my own little quirky minority point of view on these questions. And I'm happy to be in
*  a much smaller field than that. Joseph Dundee says, How do you know that something which has
*  never been observed is merely very, very improbable rather than impossible? For example, milk and
*  coffee spontaneously unmixing or a brain spontaneously forming an avoid? Could there be
*  an upper limit to the improbability of an event? I don't know if there could be an upper limit to
*  the improbability of an event. I mean, maybe there could be if there are literally a finite
*  number of events in the history of the universe, then one over that number is an upper limit to
*  the improbability of it. But I don't know if that's true. And we have no way of knowing right now.
*  My general feeling about these kinds of questions is, you know, we'll never know and it doesn't
*  matter if there's a difference between very, very improbable and impossible. If the very varies are
*  powerful enough, you know, if the chances that in the entire history of the universe past, present
*  and future, a certain kind of event happens with probability 10 to the minus a billion, then what's
*  the difference between that and being impossible? We don't need to know the difference between those
*  two things. It's for all intents and purposes not going to happen. For milk and coffee spontaneously
*  unmixing or brain spontaneously forming an avoid. Our current best understanding is those
*  are very, very improbable. They're not impossible. No one says that those are impossible. They're
*  just very, very unlikely. But if they're unlikely enough, you get on with your life.
*  Europe says, What is a degree of freedom for physicists? It seems to me that it indicates
*  different things in different subfields. Degree of freedom is just a way of saying something that
*  can happen something that can change a quantity that can change. That's what a degree of freedom
*  is. So literally, if you have a single particle in three dimensions, it has six degrees of freedom,
*  because there are three numbers that tell you where it is, and three additional numbers that
*  can tell you how it can move. So the state of the particle is given by those six different numbers,
*  that's six degrees of freedom. Now, to be fair, we'd like you say, like you imply, we don't use it
*  very consistently. So if we have a field theory, like let's say you have a scalar field theory,
*  so that's just one field, one number at every point in space, people will often call that one
*  degree of freedom, even though really, it's an infinite number of degrees of freedom, because
*  it's a different value of the field at every point in space. But the infinity from the number of
*  points in space is taken for granted. You say it's one degree of freedom, you're supposed to
*  figure out that means per point of space. That's why you do have to keep your wits about you a
*  little bit. But that's what it means something that can change as opposed to if you have something
*  like Newtonian gravity, okay, in Newtonian gravity, there's no gravitational waves, if you wave the
*  earth, if you move the earth, its gravitational field changes, but it changes instantly throughout
*  space, it doesn't propagate out at a speed. So in Newtonian gravity, if you know what the mass is
*  doing of different objects in the universe, you automatically instantly know the gravitational
*  field. That's not true in general relativity. In general relativity, there's a separate thing
*  that can happen, space time can oscillate all by itself. So in general relativity, there are degrees
*  of freedom of gravity in empty space. In Newtonian gravity, they're not, there's gravity in empty
*  space, but it is entirely tied to the matter. Therefore, it's not a degree of freedom, it's
*  not a separate thing that can change independently of everything else. Alexandra Bates says, what is
*  the most difficult physics problem you have solved? What made it so difficult? Yeah, I thought about
*  this question. And it's a difficult question to answer. Because it turns me mean by difficult,
*  you know, on the one hand, like, what is the most sharp insight that one ever had? What is the aha
*  moment? And honestly, you know, for better or for worse, my most obvious aha moment was back in
*  graduate school. This often happens. But I was working with Eddie Farhi and Alan Guth on, can you
*  make time machines in three dimensions? Can you build closed time like curves in gravity in a world
*  of point particles in two dimensions of space and one dimension of time, which are is equivalent to
*  a world with cosmic strings that are perfectly in three dimensions that are perfectly straight and
*  parallel to each other. So a cosmic string has a direction in which it's moving. And if it's
*  perfectly straight, then you can ignore that direction. And so three dimensions just become
*  two. The reason why you would care about this weird physical setup is you can solve all the
*  equations exactly. It's a much easier system to look at than real three dimensional gravity with
*  black holes or whatever. So we were thinking about that inspired by work by Richard Gott,
*  who had claimed that you could imagine time machines in these systems. And what we argued
*  is that you could write down what Gott did was he wrote down a cosmological solution in some sense,
*  a solution to the entire space time of the universe that did indeed contain closed time like curves.
*  But what we asked was, could you start in the universe that did not have closed time like
*  curves in the past and then create them by some dynamical process? And so we wrote one paper where
*  we just worked hard and banged our heads against it and said, here's some small evidence that you
*  can't. But then we wanted to go further and like dot all the i's cross all the t's and really make
*  a proof. And we really struggled with making this proof. And Alan in particular did a numerical
*  simulation showing that there's no region of parameter space where it would work, but we still
*  couldn't find a reason why it didn't work. And then I happened to be giving a seminar at the
*  University of Alberta and I was talking to Don Page. And he mentioned a fact that I didn't know,
*  or maybe I had heard but forgotten about the Lorentz group in two plus one dimensions,
*  the Lorentz group, the space of all Lorentz transformations. Namely, that it has a geometry
*  and the geometry looks like that of a space time and the space time is anti-dissider space.
*  These days anti-dissider space is a big deal, but back then almost no one was familiar with it.
*  So I took that fact, that was it, just a fact and that was very provocative to me. I was in my
*  stage of my life when geometry and topology were very, very fascinating to me and I was trying to
*  learn all I could. So I thought about what it meant that the set of Lorentz transformations in
*  two plus one dimensions looks like anti-dissider space. And what I realized on the plane ride home
*  by sketching things is that this answers all of our questions. That if you think about the space of
*  all Lorentz transformations in three dimensions as anti-dissider space, then you can instantly
*  prove you can't build a time machine without starting with one from simple geometric arguments
*  drawing lines on pieces of paper. And that was just wonderful. That was one of those events,
*  like literally riding the plane back from your seminar, you have the aha moment that solves this
*  problem and we used that in our follow-up paper. On the other hand, sometimes what do you mean by
*  the most difficult problem is the one you just got to grind through, the one where there are no
*  aha moments available and you just have your equations in front of you and it's going to be
*  pages and that's what it's going to be like. And I've had a couple of papers like that also
*  about the microwave background, about supergravity. I did a bunch of things as a post-doc on
*  dynamically triangulated two-dimensional gravity that required many pages of algebra and calculus,
*  many little numerical simulations. It was an enormous amount of work, right?
*  And again, you get the answer at the end of the day. It's a little bit less intellectually
*  satisfying than the aha moment, but there is honor in honest work and I put that in as well. But
*  none of these are really fascinating problems. To just be more specific, the microwave background
*  thing that we did, this is with my friend Ted Pine who also, trivia, Ted and I wrote this paper
*  on the cosmic microwave background, but Ted is also the musician responsible for the music in the
*  Mindscape podcast at the beginning and the end. His band, Euphonic, is the band that is playing.
*  So he's the one who lent me the music for the podcast. But he was an expert on perturbation
*  theory in general relativity back when we were both grad students. And so, while I was a post-doc,
*  we wrote this paper on second order gravitational perturbations of the cosmic microwave background.
*  So people had just discovered the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, the COBE
*  satellite, et cetera. So they'd worked out the predictions going back to Peebles and other
*  people. That's why he won the Nobel Prize for what those were supposed to be. And we asked the
*  question, okay, what is the next order of effect? What is the higher order in perturbation theory?
*  Now, in fact, the important higher order in perturbation theory terms are not gravitational.
*  Primordial plasma is sloshing around in complicated ways. And that's really what you
*  want to study. But that sounds complicated. So Ted and I just looked at gravity, just looked at the
*  propagation of light from the microwave background surface to today being buffeted about by
*  gravitational perturbations, the gravitational lensing we were referring to earlier. And we
*  worked it all out systematically. And we found that there were some terms that people had guessed at
*  and there were some extra terms that people had not guessed at. And we were completely of the
*  opinion that, look, the microwave background was discovered in the 60s, it took 30 years,
*  25 or 30 years to discover the anisotropies, probably be another 25 years before this is
*  relevant. Sadly, that was more than 25 years ago. So now it's very relevant. And people cite that
*  paper is not the most systematic or useful paper, but it was first to point to certain things. It
*  was a tremendous amount of algebra, I gotta say, once you get into second order perturbation theory
*  in general relativity, even if your sites are relatively modest, it's going to be a lot of
*  algebra. There you go. Igor Parshkin says, while doing my undergrad in physics, how much should
*  I allow myself not to understand fully? What I mean is, it often happens that we're learning
*  something as I can learn how to do, but not really sure what I'm doing. But as soon as I start digging,
*  we're off to the next chapter, how much should I let myself go unlearned while moving forward?
*  There's another question of, you know, taste and personal preference here, because certainly,
*  to some extent, you should let yourself go unlearned while moving forward, you don't need to
*  master every step before going on to the next one. In fact, it's very often the case that you
*  don't master earlier steps until later you realize, oh, that's why that was important.
*  So you know, it's very important to kind of remember what the ideas are, and where they
*  might be applicable. You know, I had this, I sometimes tell the joke that the real reason to own
*  to take undergraduate physics courses is so that you know where the answers are in the books,
*  so that you go through the textbook and you know where the formula is for the
*  Laplace transform of something or something like that, right? Like you've heard there was an idea
*  and you don't remember, but you sort of remember where it is in the book. That's like the most
*  important thing that you learn in undergraduate physics classes. So it's great to master things,
*  of course, I don't want to say don't do that, but it is not necessarily a disaster if you don't
*  master everything along the way. Now we can accumulate right if you continue not mastery
*  anything, you're going to get in trouble. That's why I can't really give you very specific advice
*  here. But don't panic just because everything is not crystal clear the first time around.
*  Bob Thomason says, Among your scientifically oriented podcasting peers, you are much more
*  sympathetic with the current racial justice movement. For example, I can't imagine I can't
*  imagine them having Cornell West on their podcasts. Can you sum up your take on the state of
*  racial justice in America today? So that's asking a lot my take on the state of racial justice in
*  America. Probably I can't do justice to that one as it were. But you know, I don't think it's good
*  the state of racial justice in America. I don't think it's going out on a limb to say that, you
*  know, look, I think there's a lot of racism out there. And I think that a lot of the modern
*  realization is that racism can be kind of hidden, but still really impactful, you know, doesn't need
*  to be blacks cannot drink this water fountain, right? There are quieter, less obvious ways
*  that policies and personal opinions and personal actions can have devastatingly powerful,
*  differential effects on people because of their skin color. I think that's a bad thing. And we
*  should try to fix it. The other thing, of course, is that there are many people who seem to think
*  that the real tragedy is not racism, but being accused of racism. And I don't agree with that.
*  I think that, you know, if racism exists, and we're trying to fix it, then certain things are going
*  to be accused as racist. And sometimes they'll go too far, right? Sometimes there there will be
*  accusations of racism that are not completely accurate, that you can't make an omelet without
*  breaking some eggs. That doesn't mean it's right. That doesn't mean you shouldn't fix it when that
*  happens or argue against it, etc. But I don't think that the existence of the occasional
*  overreach when fighting racism is really the problem. I think the problem is racism.
*  Racism is bad. We should get rid of racism. That is my take on the state of racial justice in
*  America today. I'm going to group a couple questions together here. Tyler Whitmer says,
*  How excited are you about getting images and data from the James Webb Space Telescope? And is there
*  anything in particular you're looking forward to learning from it? Kyle Moore says, With the JWST
*  looking like it will get to L2 successfully and without any issues, what kinds of questions should
*  we be able to answer in the next 10 years with JWST's power? And Jay Affail says, What discoveries
*  are you most excited to see come from the James Webb Space Telescope? So clearly there's some
*  interest out there. I'll be very honest here. What the James Webb Space Telescope is going to do
*  is going to be amazing stuff that doesn't really intersect with my own personal research interests.
*  Cosmology and physics more generally are big fields. People do different kinds of things.
*  What JWST is really optimized for is mostly looking for galaxies very, very far away,
*  another phenomena in the medium term early universe. So long after the microwave background,
*  but earlier than nearby galaxies. The reason for that is because it's an infrared telescope. So if
*  you have a redshift, then if you have something object, some object that is giving off visible
*  light very far away, it'll be redshifted in the infrared and JWST can see it. So how galaxies
*  formed, what happened in those early days of the formation history of galaxies, is a crucially
*  important question that JWST is really going to go after. As a bonus, it'll be really, really good
*  for exoplanets, both finding them and then investigating them when they're there. So all
*  this stuff is really fascinating and interesting. None of it is what I do for a living. I'm not sure
*  what instrument one could even imagine building that would give great evidence that bears on the
*  questions that I personally am interested in at a research level, which is why I'm thinking about
*  the emergence of space time and the foundations of quantum mechanics rather than building specific
*  testable models that you can probe and experiment, because I don't know what those experiments would be.
*  So I'm a fan of the JWST as a fan, as everyone else in the world is, but I have no special
*  research level knowledge of what it's going to do. F sub H says, it seems to me that entropy is
*  something that emerges qualitatively on the macroscopic level, but how should we think about
*  it on the microscopic? For example, we can say that a castle made of sand is more ordered than a pile
*  of sand, but if we think about each individual grain of sand on the micro level, isn't the
*  configuration of the grains of sand that makes up a random pile just as ordered or disordered as the
*  configuration that creates a castle? Sure, yeah, 100%. There is no reason to think about the concept
*  of entropy on the micro level. Entropy is a macroscopic concept. It's a concept that gains
*  relevance from coarse graining, from thinking about systems from the point of view of incomplete
*  information that you know some certain features of the system but nowhere near the whole thing.
*  So I think that's exactly right. That's how entropy works. If you know all of the micro data,
*  there's no reason to ever talk about entropy. Niccolò Paratini says, do you think there's any
*  correlation between the expansion of the universe and the increase in entropy? I mean, there's a
*  correlation. Yes, entropy is increasing and the universe is expanding. That's what a correlation
*  means. Now probably what you're asking about is there any causal relationship between them?
*  And the answer there is yes and yes and no. It depends on exactly how you parse that question.
*  The fact that entropy is increasing and the fact that the universe is expanding have no
*  necessary relationship. You could very easily have a collapsing universe, a contracting universe in
*  which entropy was also increasing. However, it is a feature of our particular universe rather than
*  the space of all possible universes that when the universe was smaller, the scale factor was
*  smaller, things were closer together, the density was higher, the entropy was lower. So that single
*  fact, the initial conditions of the universe in which the universe was both dense and low entropy
*  set up simultaneously the fact that the universe is expanding and the fact that entropy is increasing.
*  So it's not that entropy increase drives the expansion or vice versa. They are both driven,
*  but it's particular initial conditions that we had near the Big Bang.
*  Rob F says, I've read that there is no arrow of time in fundamental equations of physics and that
*  the feature that provides the forward arrow of time we observe the universe is increasing entropy
*  per the second law. My question is in the extremely distant future when entropy is effectively reached
*  to maximum and can therefore increase no further, does this mean the time itself will cease or have
*  no meaning? No, it does not mean that. What it means is that time will not have an arrow anymore.
*  I've said this in different places in different ways, but you have to distinguish between time
*  as a coordinate on space time and the arrow of time, which is an important feature of it
*  in our real world, but not a necessary feature just with the concept of time. Again, think about
*  space. There is no arrow of space. If you're out there in the vacuum, all directions look the same.
*  That doesn't mean that space doesn't exist or ceases to have meaning. It just doesn't have an
*  arrow. Time could easily exist and things could change and evolve in a way that wasn't directed
*  overall and therefore time would have no arrow. So that will be the case when the universe is
*  closer to its equilibrium state. Bezad Mirhashim says, do you think that all the various forms of
*  fine-tuning from the very low entropy of the universe to the relative masses of the up and
*  down quark can be explained by one principle? Is that the principle that there are many universes
*  and we happen to live in one suitable for life, aka the anthropic principle? It's possible.
*  I think that there are some examples of fine-tuning. Let's put it this way. Fine-tuning can be thought
*  of as, from a physicist's perspective, some parameters are taking on some purportedly special
*  values that could be very different. Why are the values this particular number rather than a more
*  generic number? You notice that in those words, I never talked about life or complexity or anything
*  like that. That's what physicists mean by fine-tuning. When physicists say there is a
*  hierarchy problem, the mass of the Higgs boson is fine-tuned. It's much, much lower than its
*  natural value at the Planck scale. Nothing to do with life or anything like that. What you want to
*  ask for this question, for the anthropic principle, the anthropic principle, if it works, that is to
*  say if we are in a kind of universe where it applies, where there are many different conditions
*  in many different places and therefore there's a selection effect, you would only observe certain
*  kinds of conditions, those that are hospitable to the existence of life, then maybe you can explain
*  some of these apparent physicists fine-tunings by saying that if they weren't fine-tuned, life
*  wouldn't exist. Maybe the masses of the up and down quarks are an example of that. We think that
*  other fine-tunings exist that are not examples of that. The Higgs boson is an example. We think,
*  maybe this is not true, but according to our current best guesses, the mass of the Higgs boson
*  could have been way bigger and still life could exist. There's actually debate about this, to be
*  honest, but it is certainly something that is, I think, the conventional view. What that means is
*  that there's a fine-tuning that is not explained by the anthropic principle. An even better example
*  is the low entropy of the early universe that we just talked about. Now, you need some low entropy
*  for life to exist, but the entropy in the early universe was way, way, way, way, way lower than it
*  needs to be to account for the existence of life. You need more than simply an anthropic explanation.
*  Even if the anthropic principle works for some things, I think that there are other things which
*  it doesn't help for. I left out the best example. There's something called the strong CP problem.
*  There's a parameter called theta QCD in the strong interactions, which governs how much
*  violation of CP symmetry you have from the strong interactions. It's called theta because it's an
*  angle. The physical effects of this number are the same if you change theta by theta goes to theta
*  plus 2 pi radians. You would expect, naturally, it's a number between 0 and 2 pi, or maybe
*  between 0 and pi because the sign doesn't really matter. We have limits on it. I forget what the
*  current limits are, but it's less than 10 to the minus 9 or something like that. This number,
*  theta QCD, is much, much smaller than it needs to be, has zero connection to life. We need some
*  dynamical or other mechanism to explain that. That's why axions were invented to explain exactly
*  that problem. Brad Malt says, in the particle at the end of the universe, you explained how the
*  Higgs field gives mass to particles. Since mass must be conserved, does that mean that the Higgs
*  field doesn't change value when the LHC creates a new Higgs boson or when a Higgs boson decays?
*  Since the mass of an object is the same everywhere, does this mean the Higgs field
*  has the same value everywhere? Last question first. Yes, the Higgs field has the same value
*  everywhere except for when you make a Higgs boson. There's a background value that is more or less
*  very, very close to being fixed everywhere. If you start it vibrating, that counts as a Higgs boson,
*  so the value is changing by a little bit, but the Higgs boson decays away in a zepto second,
*  which is saying that the energy in those vibrations is being transferred to vibrations
*  in other quantum fields. That is to say the Higgs is decaying into photons or electrons or what have
*  you. When you make a Higgs boson in the LHC or whatever, you're making one of these localized
*  excitations. You're not changing the overall value of the Higgs boson everywhere, and you're
*  certainly not changing the mass of anything. You're making a Higgs boson, but electrons elsewhere,
*  other than where you've made the Higgs boson, are unaffected by what you just did.
*  Finally, what I need to say is that mass is not conserved. We've known that mass is not conserved
*  for a long time. Ever since Einstein explained to us E equals MC squared, this is how you can make
*  atomic weapons because you can turn mass into energy using E equals MC squared. It's energy
*  that is conserved, and even energy is not exactly conserved for various subtle reasons in GR and
*  quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking, energy is conserved. What happens is when the Higgs boson
*  changes its value from zero to some non-zero number at the electroweak phase transition,
*  it gives mass to a whole bunch of ambient particles. Those particles gain energy because
*  you're giving them mass, but there's a huge amount of energy locked up in the Higgs field as it's
*  evolving, and that energy is diminishing. Basically, you're just transferring energy from
*  the Higgs field to all the particles all around it, and that's part of the process you need to
*  take into consideration when you study the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition,
*  if that's something you ever want to do. Angelo Ferrari says, are virtual particles really popping
*  in and out of existence and being exchanged by real particles? There's another yes and no kind
*  of answer to the question. Not really is the short answer because really what's going on are quantum
*  fields. That's always the answer. Forget about something esoteric like black holes or Hawking
*  radiation. That's also true just when particles scatter off of each other. The picture of virtual
*  particles as invented by Feynman and others, when you draw Feynman diagrams, the virtual particles
*  are the particles that only are on the interior of the Feynman diagram, the particles that do not
*  either come in from the past or go out to the future, but just appear in the interior lines
*  and loops of the diagram. This is a way mathematically of characterizing the effects
*  of the vibrating quantum fields. That's really what's going on in some sense. However,
*  it's a really good picture. It's a really good way of both calculating and thinking about what
*  is going on. That's why I said the answer is sort of yes and no because it's fine to think about
*  virtual particles doing what we do in the Feynman diagrams. On the third hand, in the vacuum,
*  in empty space, it's kind of not fine to think about the virtual particles popping in and out
*  of existence because that gives you a bad impression of what's happening. The vacuum quantum state
*  is stationary. The state is the same at every moment of time. It is not evolving in any way.
*  In particular, particles are not there one moment and then there another moment because they've
*  popped in and out of existence. The language of virtual particles popping in and out of existence
*  is just supposed to be a way of giving you intuition for what the quantum state is doing.
*  In this case, the quantum state is not doing anything, so I wouldn't take that metaphor too
*  seriously in that case. Donald Hawke says, I went to Villanova from 1977 to 1981. While an atheist,
*  I did enjoy the required religion-related courses. Did you have similar experience while there?
*  Yes, I enjoyed all my religion courses. I think I took three. I think that was the number of
*  required courses I had to take. There was an intro course on something about the experience
*  of Christianity or something like that. I had a really good professor. I was uninterested in the
*  subject matter. Well, actually, that's not true even at that level. The subject matter is kind
*  of fascinating. I have to say, Christianity, especially early Christianity and all the
*  different texts and things like that, that when people were arguing about what was supposed to be
*  their doctrine, that stuff is fascinating. When we got to the later stuff, the 20th century stuff,
*  it was a little bit beyond my sphere of caring about, but still, it's always interesting to
*  hear smart people talk about difficult ideas. That was fun. I took another course on death and dying.
*  That was interesting intrinsically. There was another course like on hermeneutics in religion,
*  applying continental philosophy ideas to the ideas of religion. That was also very interesting,
*  just philosophically speaking. Douglas Albrecht says, could you explain why you were so confident
*  that the wave function is reality rather than just a great tool for explaining it?
*  I mean, confident is always a dangerous word. There's a technical sense of the word confident,
*  which means that I put a high credence on it. There's an informal sense, means that I'm sure
*  it's right, but I'm not sure that it's right. Like any good scientific theory, we do our best,
*  but we always have a chance that we're wrong. I do think it probably represents reality more or less
*  faithfully. Why do I think that? Well, because that's a theory that fits all the data and is
*  extraordinarily simple. It's really the simplest theory you can even imagine along these lines.
*  All other theories are more complicated, so I don't see the motivation for trying to do
*  something different. The only motivation I see for trying to do something different is,
*  we don't know yet. Let's keep an open mind, which is fine, and people can work on that.
*  In this particular corner of idea space, I just want to work on the thing I think is most likely
*  to be right. Liam McCarty says, Hilbert's sixth problem was to axiomatize physics. In his words,
*  to treat in the same manner by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which the mathematics
*  already plays an important part. As far as I'm aware, this has only been partly achieved as some
*  parts of physics like quantum field theory have no axiomatic formulation today. Do you think trying
*  to axiomatize physics is a worthwhile pursuit or is it merely a mathematical interest and irrelevant
*  to physics? I think the important thing to first note here is that we're not even going to succeed
*  in axiomatizing mathematics, which was another big thing that Hilbert cared about. But Kurt Gertel,
*  with Gertel's theorem and other people, showed that this is not going to happen. You're not going
*  to do it. There's always going to be two mathematical statements that you're not going
*  to be able to prove deduced from axioms. Axiomatizing things has lost some of its luster
*  since Hilbert had these ambitions. I think the better thing to say is you would like your physics
*  theories to be as comprehensive as possible in the sense that we talked about earlier with domains of
*  applicability and also completely well-formed. Whatever that well-formed formulation might be,
*  whether it's axioms or something else, you want the theories to be clear. You want them to apply
*  everywhere they can. You want them to be coherent, compatible with each other, etc. I mean, that basic
*  program is absolutely crucial whether or not it takes the form of explicit axioms or not.
*  Dan Inch says, can you give us an update on the cats? Are they both happy? Is Ariel getting a
*  nice drippy shower each morning? You're asking this at the wrong time, Dan. The cats lead a very,
*  very good life and they're almost always very happy. Ariel does get a shower and post shower
*  lap time every morning. They just have gone to the vets recently. We did something just for
*  scheduling purposes we usually don't do, which is that Ariel went one day and Caliban went on a
*  different day rather than bringing them together at the same time. As sometimes happens, Ariel's
*  the more high-strong one. Caliban, he's chill. He doesn't really care what's going on. He doesn't
*  want to go to the vet, but if you take him, he's like, okay, here I am at the vet. Here I am back.
*  Ariel gets really annoyed with us taking her to the vet. She got really annoyed when Caliban came
*  back because he smelled like the vet. He didn't smell like Caliban anymore. She was hissing at
*  him and she didn't want anything to do with him. It took a good 24 hours of coddling them and other
*  strategies to get them to snuggle up together at night as they usually do, but they're back to doing
*  that. I think that even though there's still some tiny frustrations on evidence, mostly they're
*  pretty happy right now. They're very healthy cats. They're just going to the vets for checkups.
*  There's nothing wrong with them. Steven asks, if democracy is the best method we have for addressing
*  the dissatisfactions of the working class, poorer people, why isn't it absolutely necessary when
*  democracy is seriously challenged to advocate for it until it is secure? Then we can turn our
*  advocacy hours to other multifaceted social problems like climate change, bigotries, technical
*  puzzles. All of these problems are hard. They're harder than physics as noted in the podcast,
*  but we agree that without democracy, they are much harder to solve. No? I get it and I think I'm
*  pretty much on board with this, which is why I spend a lot more time talking about democracy
*  on my podcast than I otherwise would, than I would have 10 years ago, let us say. Of course,
*  there's a question being begged here about whether or not democracy is the best method we have for
*  addressing the dissatisfactions of the working class. I think it is, but I don't think it's
*  obviously that, let's put it this way, democracy has failed to address the dissatisfactions of
*  the working class or more broadly, to really do as much for the less well-off members of society
*  than it could. I think it's a dramatic failure of our modern democratic system and that's part of
*  why it's in trouble. It's just not doing what it's supposed to do. Now, I'm completely on board,
*  I'm of the opinion that it can and should and might if we do it correctly. I'm not using this
*  as an argument against democracy, but as an argument against being complacent. Just because
*  you have democracy, everything should be fine. Okay, but with all that out of the way, what is
*  the amount of effort we should turn to preserving democracy? Should we prioritize it over climate
*  change and things like that? Here, I would say that we should have the ability to do more than
*  one thing at once. We should be able to both walk and chew gum at the same time. We should be able
*  to preserve our democracy and ameliorate climate change and think about the emergence of space-time
*  from quantum mechanics. The important question is how do you balance the different amounts of
*  effort you put into different things? There, there's a complicated thing at the individual level.
*  What are your personal skill sets? What are your personal interests, etc.? It's a hard question
*  because maybe I just like doing physics more. I want to think about physics, but it's not going
*  to help me if democracy collapses. I see an argument that I should work even much harder than
*  I am at preserving democracy. It's frustrating because it's not clear what that work would entail.
*  The other thing is, and maybe this is even a darker contemplation, the prospect that democracy
*  collapses and in some ways things don't change that much. If people just don't care about democracy,
*  you could easily imagine a system which for at least a couple decades, maybe longer than that,
*  power was concentrated in the hands of a small number of people or in some subset of our
*  population anyway. Still, life more or less went on. The trains run and you go to school
*  and teacher classes and whatever. Gradually, power and wealth and opportunities and dignity
*  become more and more concentrated until people get pissed off and have another revolution or
*  something like that. We can't imagine that if democracy falls, it will instantly be like 1984.
*  I think that's maybe the thing that I worry about the most is that we will lose our democracy and
*  not care, not really be outraged by it nearly as much as we should. Now I'm depressed. Yes,
*  we should fight harder for democracy. That's the lesson. That is absolutely what we should all be
*  thinking about. I agree with that spirit one way or the other. Paul Hess says, why is a wave so
*  concentrated in one specific place that we perceive it as a distinct tiny particle in one place
*  instead of the way being spread out much more widely through space? I don't know, Paul. How
*  is this question going to help us save democracy? This is now what's in my head. Actually, this is a
*  very good question because if you think about the Schrodinger equation or other equations of
*  fundamental physics for the waves that we have in quantum field theory, it is very natural that wave
*  like oscillations in a field want to spread out. If you poke your finger into the surface of a pond,
*  ripples move out in all directions. Why in the world do particles in the real world have something
*  like a location in space at all rather than just being spread out all over the place?
*  I think you could easily take years of quantum mechanics and no one truly answers this question
*  for you. The answer is implicit in many little pieces of things that you learn and you have to
*  put it together yourself. A huge part is played by the fact that most particles are in the form of
*  atoms. A free electron, the wave function of an electron all by itself out there in the world
*  would indeed spread out all over the place. Maybe you wouldn't notice because you don't notice
*  until you measure it or it gets measured or decohered somehow by interacting with other
*  particles around it, which might happen pretty quickly actually. It would in principle all by
*  itself if there's nothing else in the universe, it would just spread out. An electron that is
*  bound to a proton, its natural wave form are those orbitals that you learned about in high
*  school chemistry. They are localized near the proton or near the nucleus in whatever atom they
*  are in. It is the attraction of the proton that confines the wave function of the electron.
*  The proton or the nucleus or whatever is a lot heavier so it spreads out a lot more slowly.
*  That's the other piece of information you would get but it wouldn't be connected.
*  Heavy things spread out a lot more slowly in terms of the propagation of their wave functions. Once
*  you get to something like the earth, which is a big heavy thing, it has a wave function and the
*  center of mass of that wave function spreads out almost not at all. Not quite not at all but almost
*  not at all. So once you get to the big macroscopic world, the spreading is just so gradual that you
*  and I don't notice. Sid Huff says, in a graduate course on research methods, which emphasize
*  scientific principles and procedures such as hypothesis generation, data gathering and analysis
*  and hypothesis testing, occasionally a student would ask whether the curriculum would address
*  other ways of knowing, usually a student from a non-Western or Indigenous culture. In your view,
*  do any of these other ways of knowing, whatever that may mean, deserve time and attention in a
*  research methods course? How would you respond to such a questioning student? Well I'm not exactly
*  sure what course you're talking about but if the course is called research methods, presumably it's
*  a course on research methods in some particular discipline. I'm sure that there are courses on
*  research methods in economics or computer science or physics or what have you and those courses will
*  quite rightly focus on the research methods that are actually used in those disciplines, whatever
*  they are. So you know there might be other research methods or other ways of knowing. I don't know
*  where you want to draw the boundaries between those but there's no expectation that a course
*  called research methods in sociology should teach you every possible way of knowing. It should teach
*  you research methods in sociology. As a broader question, the value of other ways of knowing is
*  going to depend a lot on the way of knowing that you're talking about. Some of them are going to
*  be nonsense, some might be very useful. That's an empirical question, you know, tell me what you've
*  learned to show us what has actually been achieved by this way of knowing and then we can judge it
*  empirically. That's what I would suggest doing. Pavlos Papagiorgiou says, are you confident that
*  physics will find the theory or what if we bump into hard dualities? Suppose we end up with multiple
*  conceptually different models that each describe fully and perfectly what we can observe nature
*  doing. That'd be fine. I mean there's two possible things going on here and neither one bothers me at
*  all. One is you have multiple conceptually different models that are exactly like you said,
*  describing fully and perfectly what nature does. Then they're the same model. I mean there's the
*  same thing going on in different language, right? The Hamiltonian versus Lagrangian formulations of
*  classical mechanics are just different languages to describe the same thing and in that case,
*  who cares? I'm glad that there are multiple models. I think that they're just describing the same
*  stuff using different words. Another possibility which is more interesting but also doesn't bother
*  me is that we find that we have a set of models with overlapping but non-equivalent domains of
*  applicability. This is the case in the domains of applicability discussion we had earlier
*  where you have two domains of applicability that intersect in a Venn diagram sense. There's some
*  region where they both apply but there's also regions where one applies but the other doesn't.
*  Together, these models describe all of nature. That would also not bother me at all. I mean that
*  would just be okay. The way that we describe nature is through this set of overlapping models.
*  Who cares? I don't think there's any virtue in saying that I have a single vocabulary that
*  describes everything. What I want to do is describe nature accurately in as wide a domain of
*  applicability as I possibly can. We're nowhere near any of these becoming realistic questions
*  to worry about but that would be my feeling at the present moment. Andrew Goldstein says,
*  in the next two or three decades could artificial intelligence advance to the point where it explains
*  how living cells emerge from the information encoded in genes which I consider the quintessential
*  example of emergence. However long it takes I think it will be defined by the understanding
*  of synthesis and growth not by reduction and analysis. What do you think? First a little
*  gloss on emergence. You can hear Caliban in the background. He's meeping. I'm not sure if this is
*  a quintessential example of emergence because you are precisely doing what I warned against doing in
*  my notion of emergence. You're using emergence as a process that unfolds over time. How living cells
*  emerge from the information encoded in genes. In my way of thinking there is a level of talking
*  about genes and chemicals and proteins and another way of talking about cells and organs
*  and organisms and both of those simultaneously exist. It's not that one turns into the other.
*  They're both simultaneous ways of talking about the same stuff. Now your question, I mean there
*  still is a question about how living cells do emerge from the information encoded in genes in
*  that in the sort of more everyday notion of emergence. Honestly I don't think that's
*  that hard a problem. It's certainly hard. I don't want to denigrate the work being done by people
*  who think about these questions but there's no roadblocks there to figuring it out. I don't even
*  think, I don't see a reason to suspect that you would need artificial intelligence to do that.
*  It's a complicated problem because it's right there at the boundary where you have enough atoms
*  and in your molecules to make them complicated but not so many that you can ignore their
*  individual peculiarities. So it's a rich problem and there's a lot of subtleties and it's going
*  to require work but it's just good old science work and I think that it's proceeding at a great
*  pace and so I'm very optimistic that it will happen. That we'll really understand how you go
*  from chemicals to life. I can't tell you when. Sorry about the next two or three decades. I'm
*  very very bad at predicting time scales. That's just a hard thing to do.
*  Frank Layman says, so I am laughing at our cat just meowing in the background. Maybe he heard his
*  name being mentioned in the podcast. Frank Layman says, 15 years ago I listened to your teaching
*  company lectures on dark matter and dark energy and was amazed by how such a humongous portion
*  of the universe's makeup was a recently discovered and be so deeply mysterious. 15 years later have
*  physicists made much progress on either front in understanding the dark sector.
*  At the very least are there hypotheses for what make up dark matter and dark energy you mentioned
*  in 2007 that are now more or less popular or supported. So there hasn't been that much
*  progress. There hasn't been dramatic progress or you would know or we'd be talking about it. I mean
*  the rough picture that I sketched out 15 years ago where there's dark matter and dark energy.
*  Five percent of our universe by mass is ordinary matter. 25 dark matter. 70 dark energy.
*  We don't know what dark matter is but it's some particle probably it could be black holes but
*  probably particles that interact with each other very weakly and move slowly. We don't know what
*  the dark energy is but it's probably just vacuum energy cosmological constant. If it's not it's some
*  dynamical thing that evolves slowly. That's what we knew 15 years ago and that's still what we know
*  today. The only progress that's been made has been of a negative variety. We have been looking for
*  small changes in the density of dark energy over time but haven't found any. So our limits are
*  better now than they were before. We've been looking for dark matter particles either created
*  in the lab or bumping into particles here on earth. We haven't seen that either so our limits
*  are better than they were before. So there's still plenty of phase space out there for models or
*  ideas that we would not have yet noticed but the truth is we haven't noticed them yet. So and there's
*  also been more theoretical models for what dark matter and dark energy could be but you know in
*  the absence of experiment it's hard to really say that any of them is going to really stick its
*  neck up above the others in terms of popularity. Robert Rux and Dressu says I'm going through the
*  biggest ideas in the universe videos and I saw that you pause when you're writing something on
*  the virtual blackboard. This tells me that you represent your thoughts and ideas in spoken words
*  in your mental model but I'm not sure. My question is if this is true if you're a spoken mental model
*  type of person. There's a famous example by Richard Feynman where he could count in his head and read
*  but couldn't speak whereas a friend of his could count in his head and speak very well but couldn't
*  read at all. I'm wondering what kind of difference this makes in terms of math communication skills
*  and so on. Do you think that you'd be a better mathematician if you were a visual person?
*  I think this is a very good question but actually I don't know that much even about my own
*  where I lie on the spectra that you're indicating in this space of possibilities. It is true
*  I am very bad at talking and writing at the same time or even talking and drawing at the same time
*  and you know I discovered this every time I teach a course but certainly I discovered it new when I
*  did the biggest ideas in the universe videos so I learned just to mostly shut up while I'm writing
*  on the board. The part of my brain that is writing and the part of my brain that is supposed to be
*  supposed to be talking are certainly overlapping parts and they cannot do both at the same time.
*  Likewise, unlike some people, I cannot really listen if I'm writing. I don't want to be listening
*  to music with lyrics. I don't want to be hearing words anywhere else in the world if I'm writing.
*  I'm focusing on those words one at a time and I'm very happy to listen to instrumental music
*  for example. Now on the other hand, in the world of mathematics, there's a famous distinction
*  between algebraists and geometers, people who think more in terms of equations or more in terms
*  of figures. When it comes to math, I'm more in terms of figures kind of guy. I reason much more
*  geometrically than algebraically myself so I do not have any idea how these different features
*  fit together. I think this is interesting stuff but I haven't really thought about it that much.
*  Vu Chau says, as a theorist, are you personally excited when your work is confirmed or refuted?
*  I mean, we talked a little about this before with general relativity but obviously,
*  my own work, I am most excited when it's confirmed. As part of the scientific community,
*  if you have a theory that's refuted, it makes a big difference whether or not that theory has
*  previously been accepted or not. To have an idea that someone just
*  throws out there without any support yet and then to have it immediately refuted,
*  that's not exciting for anybody. What's exciting is if you have an accepted idea,
*  so you first have it confirmed and you realize, ah, this idea does have some usefulness and then
*  it's refuted so you realize, ah, there's a limit to its usefulness and both of those are teaching
*  you a tremendous amount. As an individual, I just want confirmation after confirmation. As a
*  scientist, I want a back and forth between confirmation and refutation. Rob Petro says,
*  you've explained on a number of occasions that ever-ready and branching happens either instantly
*  or at light speed. Specifically, one can choose how to interpret the branching since presumably
*  there will be equivalent, these will be equivalent from the perspective of the observers at the
*  source of the branch. My question relates to how this interpretation interacts with quantum
*  entanglement. If Alice and Bob have entangled particles and traveled to a great distance,
*  then Bob observes his particles. How does branching happen? Given that Bob will now know
*  the state of Alice's particle instantaneously and Alice, when she observes, will know what Bob had
*  observed. So this is exactly why I prefer to think of it in terms of instantaneous branching all over,
*  even though that is contrary to the spirit of special relativity, even though it's completely
*  compatible with the letter of the law, as it were, because it's a completely observable effect,
*  unobservable effect. If you say that when Bob observes his particle, the branching happens
*  instantly. If you're a many worlds person, then there are now two copies of Alice. There's Alice
*  in the spin up branch, and Alice in the spin down branch, but she doesn't know, she has no idea that
*  there are now two copies of her because they're exactly identical copies locally. So one of them
*  will be on the branch that later when they visit Bob will see spin up, the other will later visit
*  Bob and see spin down as everything is perfectly compatible. If you want to believe in the story
*  where the branching sort of spreads out at the speed of light, then you have to have rules
*  when that spreading out branches overlap how they reconcile with each other, right? So the branch
*  where Alice sees spin up, if the spins are initially counter aligned, has to have the property that when
*  it joins up with Bob's branches, it joins up with the one where Bob was spin down, etc. So that's
*  complicated, but you can do it, you can work it out. I just think it's a little bit of complication
*  we don't really need. Sandro Stucchi says, is Microsoft real? Back in this one, I liked the
*  broad stroke of Jody Azuni's account of what is real, but I was disappointed in the answer he gave
*  for his concrete example of Microsoft. Now I have to decide which I should trust his theory or my
*  intuition. How does one evaluate a philosophical theory like nominalism? So this is why I wanted
*  to get to this, this last question here. You know, you can have your own, I already discussed that I
*  think it's okay to say Microsoft exists in a certain sense. You know, I can sue it, right?
*  It must exist. I can interact with it causally, okay? But okay, I get that it's a slightly
*  different kind of existence. That's okay in my mind. But then this question, how does one evaluate
*  a philosophical theory like nominalism? That's a more interesting one, because on the one hand,
*  I do think it's important. I think it's not beside the point where you stand on these issues.
*  On the other hand, one could take a stance that says it just doesn't matter what I think about
*  things like this. And so I think the mattering, it does matter, but I think the mattering is indirect.
*  Simply having a stance about whether or not Microsoft is real or not real at a philosophical
*  level, I mean, if you act in exactly the same way, you might say that it doesn't matter. But I think
*  that the stance, that stance would affect how you act, ultimately, you know, how you think about
*  these things, and also the natural numbers, you know, or other mathematical concepts. That's really
*  where I think that that's where nominalism kicks in and has some oomph, where it says that
*  numbers don't have independent existence, other than a way of talking about the physical world.
*  I think that your attitude towards questions like that changes how you move forward,
*  changes how you develop further theories, right? You know, we're not static in our understanding
*  of how reality works, we're trying to improve it. And as you can tell from different scientists
*  talking to each other in different ways, different people have different ideas about the best way to
*  improve our current understanding. Why? Why do they have different ideas about the best way to
*  interpret our current to improve our current understanding? Why can't everyone just agree
*  with that? And part of it is because they have different intuitions about things like this, you
*  know, I'm thinking about, you know, how to build a completely finite quantum mechanical model,
*  because that would potentially have different ramifications for your idea about mathematical
*  Platonism. So it's literally the case that a stance towards mathematical realism is affecting
*  the research work that I do in that in that case. So that's why I think it's important, not because
*  you're going to make some different prediction for some scattering experiment at the LHC,
*  but it changes how you think about the universe and therefore how you go about being a theoretical
*  physicist. And even though some of us get paid to do it, we are all theoretical physicists at some
*  level, we are all developing theories about the world and using those theories to get through
*  the day. So it's something that matters for everybody. John Stout says forces are mediated
*  by W and Z bosons, gluons, possibly gravitons and photons mediate electromagnetism. But the
*  way we generate electrical power and magnetism is to move electrons. So it would seem that electrons
*  would mediate electromagnetism. Can you explain how photons, how photons do when we are talking,
*  I think you mean what photons do when we're talking about electricity and magnetism? Yes.
*  So electrical charge is carried by electrons, it is not carried by photons. So electricity and
*  electrical power come about because we move charges around and so electrons play a crucial
*  role in doing that. But the forces that accelerate those electrons, right, F equals ma forces mass
*  times acceleration. If the electron is accelerating to start go from being stationary to be moving in
*  a power wire, why is it doing that? The answer is because of photons or more broadly because of the
*  electromagnetic fields, right, that the photons are excitations of. So it really is the electromagnetic
*  field that provides what we call the force. Of course, you know, I can say this also that the whole
*  separation of things into, you know, particles and forces is a little bit old fashioned. As I've just
*  said a little while ago, it's all quantum fields interacting with each other. That's all that
*  matters at the end of the day. And whether you want to call one a force one a particle or whatever
*  is kind of up to you in some sense. Alex Siegel says, According to my understanding of the
*  holographic principle, the maximal entropy in a region scales with the radius squared or the
*  surface area of that region. In other words, the density or average of the maximal entropy scales
*  with two thirds of the power of the total. For extremely large volumes, this density would be
*  quite low. Could this explain the expansion of the universe, the entropy of the universe is ever
*  increasing, so the volume must go to make room for the entropy. I was with you there for a while,
*  like your statements about the holographic principle, etc. are completely correct. Could
*  it explain the expansion of the universe? No, it has nothing to do with the expansion of the universe
*  or with the increase of entropy of the universe. Because the expansion of the universe doesn't need
*  explaining, we know the explanation of it, we have Einstein's equation, we have cosmology, we have the
*  Friedman equation and cosmology. The universe expands because there's a relationship between
*  energy density and the curvature of spacetime. The expansion of the universe is one version of
*  the curvature of spacetime. If there is matter and energy in the universe, it must either expand or
*  contract or be very delicately balanced on a hilltop in between, but that's unstable, as we learned a
*  long time ago. We don't need an explanation for that. In fact, if you continue on, as we talked
*  a little bit earlier in this very long AMA podcast about the eventual equilibration of the universe
*  into a decider phase where there's no stars or galaxies hanging around, just empty space with a
*  positive cosmological constant, the horizon size around a point will asymptote to a fixed number.
*  It will not continue to grow. So the entropy inside the horizon size will stay fixed, but the
*  universe is still expanding in some very real sense overall. That's what decider space does.
*  So it's not really a connection there, as you might have guessed. Phil says, could you give a
*  rough explanation of how spin arises from unifying special relativity and quantum mechanics? Don't be
*  afraid to be a bit technical in your answer. Actually, I think it's easy to give an accurate
*  answer because it doesn't arise from unifying special relativity and quantum mechanics.
*  It's perfectly okay to have spin in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. In fact, usually when we first
*  encounter spin in quantum mechanics, it's in the context of a non-relativistic theory. A single
*  spin one-half particle, a single qubit is something we can easily talk about in non-relativistic
*  QM. I think what you're referring to is the fact that when we do relativistic quantum mechanics,
*  for reasons that we talked about already earlier in the podcast, we immediately go to field theory.
*  There, in the context of field theory, it is sensible to be a little bit more systematic
*  about how to implement the symmetries of Lorentz invariance, rotational invariance,
*  boosts and translations and all that, the whole Poincare group, as we call it, of symmetries.
*  So you look at all the different representations of these symmetry groups and you find they fall
*  into different classifications and the different classifications have different spins. So spin sort
*  of arises from this attempt to be systematic. But it also would have arisen from an attempt to be
*  systematic in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. If you had just had the Galilean symmetries that
*  included rotations, you would also have found representations that include spin one-half
*  particles and spin one particles and so forth. So I don't really think that there's any necessary
*  connection there. Christopher Matthews says, if we're going to finally achieve the theory
*  of everything in the foreseeable future, do you think the major breakthrough will come from the
*  theoretical side or from the experimental side? I mean, obviously the answer is I don't know. We
*  don't know, right? Predicting the future of major breakthroughs is a difficult thing to do.
*  It could come either way, honestly. I think that right now there are no experiments that are being
*  done which have the character that if they get a certain result, that will give us a huge clue
*  about what the theory of everything is. And if they get another result, we won't. If the LHC
*  somehow finds a whole bunch of supersymmetric particles or something like that, that would
*  count as evidence in a certain direction and still wouldn't be definitive. For example,
*  you can have supersymmetry even though string theory is wrong, right? So it's not like close
*  to homing in on a theory of everything, but it might point us in a certain kind of direction.
*  But we have already turned on the LHC and the easy chances for finding supersymmetry have not
*  panned out. So therefore, that doesn't seem like the best way to bet right now. I think back before
*  the LHC, I recently looked back at my predictions blog post for the LHC and I put a 60% chance
*  on finding supersymmetry. So yeah, that was sort of hedging my bets, right? 60% is almost 50%,
*  which almost means you have no idea. But I only put a 3% chance on finding the Higgs boson and
*  nothing else, which seems to be the way things are going so far. So I'm still hopeful they find
*  something. So I don't be put in the situation of having my 3% chance come out right. Depthi
*  Amasuriya says, when we talk about the cosmological events, we use time scales such as 10 to the minus
*  33 seconds after the Big Bang. What is the justification for using what appears to be a
*  universal time clock for such phenomena? Well, justification is twofold. Number one, the Big
*  Bang, even though it doesn't exist, the Big Bang is just a singularity in the equations indicating
*  that you need to do better. But in classical general relativity, there is something called the
*  Big Bang, which is a moment in time, right? So it is a starting moment. So it provides a beginning
*  for your clocks. And number two, cosmologically, there is a rest frame, right? I know in relativity,
*  there's no preferred rest frame in space time. But when you have space time plus matter and energy,
*  like you have here on Earth, there are rest frames that are kind of better or at least more
*  obvious to use, more natural than others. Here on Earth, it makes sense that we measure the speed
*  of moving vehicles with respect to the ground rather than respect to the sun or something like
*  that. Likewise, in the universe, there is a rest frame given by the rest energies and velocities
*  of particles in the universe. If you're standing at some point in the early universe, you will either
*  be at rest or at motion with respect to the surrounding plasma of particles. So in that
*  rest frame, there is a natural way to calculate time, calculate the time of a particle that is at
*  rest in that rest frame. And that's what you do. That's the today, the rest frame that is at rest
*  with respect to galaxies and stars and things like that. So there's a natural clock to use and
*  it's more or less universal. Wesley Claire says, when making personal decisions, do you actually
*  calculate your credence? For example, how to weigh different consumer products, how to spend leisure
*  time, etc. Not implicitly I do. I mean, I certainly do in scientific context, but in personal decision
*  context, I don't usually, it's not really a matter of comparing different expected values,
*  because there's not a lot of randomness in the calculation, right? If I'm saying like, do I
*  want to have pizza tonight or Chinese food? It's not like, well, there's a 50% chance that pizza
*  will make me happy or whatever. I know more or less, I can accurately predict how happy the pizza
*  will make me, how happy the Chinese food will make me. So credences don't usually come in to the
*  calculation, but in some cases, they're definitely there in the background. Alexander Rowe says,
*  how accurate can physics be described without using the equations? It's hard to say exactly,
*  because it depends on what you mean. You know, any equation can just be translated into words,
*  right? The Einstein tensor is proportional to the energy momentum tensor and the constant
*  proportionality is 8 pi g. There, that is a sentence, but it contains exactly the content
*  of Einstein's equation of general relativity. And I could even attach vocabulary words to express
*  what I mean by the Einstein tensor and the energy momentum tensor. So I think maybe what you mean is
*  how accurate an idea can you get about what physics is saying without referring to the specific
*  quantitative relations that we call the laws of physics, right? So the comparing Einstein's
*  equation, whether it's in symbolic form or verbal form, to a sentence of the form,
*  the curvature of space-time is caused by energy and momentum, something like that.
*  And you know, I think you can go pretty far understanding the principles of physics just
*  on the basis of those verbal descriptions, but you're always missing something, especially
*  because you, it's not because saying that the curvature of space-time is caused by energy is
*  not including the particular quantitative value of the coefficient, right? That's not the problem.
*  The problem is that if all you have are those words and you have no idea what the mathematical
*  concepts are, then you don't really know what is meant by the phrase the curvature of space-time.
*  Because in Einstein's equation, the curvature of space-time that matters is a particular
*  representation of it, a particular characterization of the curvature called the Einstein tensor.
*  There's other features of the curvature of space-time that are not included in the Einstein
*  tensor that are irrelevant to it, etc. There are other ways of thinking about the curvature of
*  space-time. So that verbal expression is just incomplete. It's not the whole story. It doesn't
*  tell you everything. So unless you really are going to put in the effort to understand the
*  concepts behind the equations, you can get a rough idea of what physics is saying, but not a very
*  accurate idea, I would say. So I think that's a big part of the motivation behind the biggest
*  ideas in the universe. Like I said, I'm not teaching you how to be a physicist in these books. I'm not
*  teaching you how to manipulate the equations, but I want you to understand the equations well enough
*  to really appreciate what it means to say the curvature of space-time is driven by matter and
*  energy. I think if you read the book, you really will be able to understand what that means even
*  if you're not a physicist yourself. Jeffrey Siegel says, Do you think the Republican Party
*  can survive the damage to their moral authority due to their bald-faced lies and attempts to
*  undermine the electoral process? Or conversely, do you think the country can survive if such a
*  Republican Party is successful in taking the House and Senate in the midterms of the presidency in
*  2024? You know, since you're phrasing the question in terms of can the Republican Party survive,
*  yeah, 100%. I have no doubt that it can survive. That's different than will it survive. You know,
*  these political questions should never be thought of as absolutes. Oh, this can't happen if this
*  goes this way. You can be surprised. Social systems, we can be surprised. I can be surprised. Social
*  systems are complex, multi-causal, and hard to predict. So I could easily see a future in which
*  the Republican Party devotes itself to lying and undermining the electoral process and fails,
*  and yet just keeps trying for a long time. Or maybe it keeps trying for a while, it fails,
*  and therefore it switches its strategy to something else. Or it succeeds, right? It succeeds and it
*  changes the rules of voting and representation so that it just keeps succeeding. It builds in its own
*  success strategies and then it just perpetuates for a very long time. And the country can survive
*  likewise. I mean, like I said before, there's sort of a nightmare scenario where we have a
*  failure of democracy and people are happy with that, right? And the Republicans are just ruling
*  for the next 100 years. These are all plausible scenarios for the future. You know, we can debate
*  the relative likelihood of them and we can debate how seriously to take them and what to do about
*  them. But there's no doubt that there are possibilities. I think it's just a huge mistake
*  whenever you're thinking about politics or future history to think that you know better than you
*  really do, that things are absolutely likely or impossible or what have you. I like to keep a very,
*  very open mind when it comes to planning for the future in these political questions.
*  Jordan Williams says, I often describe myself as a hardcore atheist and find religions, especially
*  the monotheistic deities, primitive relics. However, on another level, it seems coincidental that
*  quarks and electrons have somehow organized themselves into conscious beings, ultimately the
*  universe theorizing about itself. Does it seem possible or likely that there's some sort of mind
*  very loosely defined behind our comprehension at work? So first, I think it's very interesting that
*  you think that the monotheistic deities are especially primitive relics. So presumably the
*  pantheistic deities, polytheistic deities are, I should say, are less primitive. I don't know,
*  that's a different take. I'm not sure you wanted to say that, but it's a defensible take.
*  And secondly, no, I don't think it is likely in any sense that there is a mind behind
*  the ability of we human beings to be conscious and aware, even though we're just made out of
*  quarks and electrons. To me, that's just the lesson of what we've learned about emergence
*  and complexity, that you can have very, very simple underlying pieces organized themselves,
*  in some sense, just under the mindless, purposeless, working out of physical laws,
*  into very complicated information processing systems. There seems to be no difficulty in
*  having that happen. Of course, there's lots of difficulties in figuring out the specific
*  things that did happen in human history. So that's plenty of work to be done, but I see no obstacles
*  to make me say, well, this can't work. We've got to think outside the box and imagine that there's
*  some mind behind it all. Now you do say, does it seem possible or likely? Those are two very,
*  very different questions. Does it seem possible or likely? It's not likely, but I think it's
*  certainly possible. Sure, it's absolutely possible. You're welcome to contemplate that possibility.
*  Brian Tidmore says, in Good Will Hunting, assuming you've seen the movie, there's a scene in which
*  Matt Damon burns what could be a mathematical proof. As it burns, he says it's not his fault
*  that he was born with the ability to understand that level of math. Is there any truth to this
*  idea that some people have brains capable of higher computational understanding than others?
*  Are there any quantum theories that you yourself are unable to comprehend?
*  Taking the last question first, there's certainly quantum theories that I don't comprehend,
*  because there's a lot of quantum theories out there, a lot of models of different things in
*  field theory and condensed matter physics and in other areas of physics. I'm not trying to
*  comprehend them. It's not like I've tried and failed. Are there any that even if I really,
*  really tried and put my brain to it, I would fail to comprehend? Maybe. I don't know. I doubt it,
*  honestly, because these are made up by other human beings and they did the hard work in making them
*  up. Once they're made up, I can really sit down and try to comprehend them. I don't think that's
*  really a stumbling block there. About human brains, it seems pretty likely that some are more
*  powerful than others just very naturally. Some people are taller than others. Some people
*  have different hair color than others. People are different and their brains should be different
*  also. That makes perfect sense to me. I do think that we are often far too quick to jump from that
*  very anodyne statement, human beings are different from each other, to some determinism or some
*  almost magical power that, oh, well, some people do math and some people don't. Some people can
*  just see the math without really even trying very hard. Now, there are stories out there of savants
*  in mathematics that just see a math problem and solve it in their brains. But for the overwhelming
*  majority of cases, including super genius mathematicians, what you're actually seeing is
*  the result of a lot of hard work. Even the best mathematicians out there have to work really,
*  really hard to understand what's going on, to think about proving new theorems and so forth.
*  What you see is the final product and it can look miraculous. Therefore, when Hollywood portrays it,
*  they portray it as miraculous, but really, there's a lot of work going on that would not make good
*  cinema, but it is the bread and butter of making progress in these areas. Carlos Dunez says,
*  is there any movie that you've watched several times? Oh, yeah, I mean, sure. Look, I was what,
*  11 or 12 years old when Star Wars came out. I was the target audience for the first movie ever
*  where people just kept going back over and over again to see it. I was definitely among those
*  people. I saw it maybe like three times at the time, not 20 times, like some people did, but
*  that was definitely part of the experience. Raiders of the Lost Ark, likewise, etc.
*  More in my maturity, as it were, there are definitely movies that I think are favorites
*  and I'm happy to watch over and over again, whether it's old classics like Casablanca
*  or newer ones like Brazil that I can just enjoy many, many times. I don't mind this. I watch movies
*  on TV mostly now, right, especially because there's a pandemic, etc. So there's a movie.
*  I'm sure I've watched the Harry Potter movies several times just because sometimes they're on
*  TV in the background. I mentioned earlier in the podcast that I cannot write when there are spoken
*  words going on, whether it's music with lyrics or TV or talk shows or podcasts or whatever. I need
*  no words around me. My wife, Jennifer, is very different. She loves to have sort of things that
*  she's already seen on TV in the background while she is writing, whether it's Midsummer Murders or
*  Harry Potter movies or whatever. So just one way or the other, you're going to see a lot of movies
*  several times. Louis B says, Can you put cream into your coffee without thinking about the universe?
*  No, I cannot. Happily, number one, I don't put cream into my coffee. I drink coffee a lot,
*  but it's always black. And number two, I can never stop thinking about the universe. The universe is
*  all around us. You should be thinking about it all the time. At least I know I am. Napoleon's
*  Corporal says, On several past episodes, the subject of misinformation and how it spreads
*  has come up. Can opinion, when clearly identified as such, ever be deemed to be misinformation? And
*  can it ever be right to suppress or censor it? I think the simple answer is that no, opinions are
*  not misinformation and they generally should not be suppressed. The only hesitation I have here is
*  you're putting the word ever in there twice. And I don't think these are questions about which we
*  should be absolutist. I think it's a mistake. I think it's exactly that clarity of values trap
*  that Tien Nguyen warned us about. Don't think about what is happening here. The question is not,
*  let's invent some principle that is absolute and can never be violated. The question is,
*  what's the best thing to do in this complicated situation? I am overall, as my impulses are,
*  let people have whatever opinions they want and spread them however they want.
*  And hopefully better opinions will fight back against them. But I can imagine there are counter
*  examples. There are cases where doing that would be really bad. I don't have a complete theory of
*  that. That's why I'm a physicist, not a legislator. I think it's an interesting question, an important
*  question. But even if my inclination is let everyone say and think whatever they want,
*  I'm very open to the possibility that there can be circumstances under which that's not a good idea.
*  Murray Cantor says, I am a good Bayesian. However, this conundrum is a bit puzzling.
*  We are supposed to update our beliefs based on the evidence. Doesn't that assume we're 100%
*  confident in the evidence? If not, do we have to account for the uncertainty of the evidence and
*  look for evidence of the truth of the evidence? This seems to lead to some infinite applications
*  of Bayesian rule. Has this ever been addressed? Well, I'm sure it has been addressed, but I think
*  that it doesn't necessarily lead to an infinite application. I think you just have to be aware
*  that what you are perceiving does not necessarily map directly onto reality. And this is always good
*  advice. So if I think that I am seeing a picture of a duck in front of me, I should be aware maybe
*  I'm not seeing that. Maybe my brain is being tricked. Maybe I'm hallucinating. Maybe I'm just
*  making a mistake. Maybe it's an optical illusion. Those should be part of my credences. And so
*  your interpretation of the evidence you get as something is happening in the world should
*  always come with some error bars with some uncertainties attached to it. But once you attach
*  those uncertainties for some good reason, I don't think you need to attach uncertainties to the
*  uncertainties and uncertainties to the uncertainties of the uncertainties, etc. You can stop once you
*  have the uncertainties attached to your evidence and your likelihood functions and so forth.
*  DLP says, Do you think ethical arguments work the same way that mathematical proofs do just
*  starting from different axioms and concerning different entities? Or are there logical steps
*  that are valid in one but not the other? I think it's basically the same idea, you know,
*  in the sense that I think that mathematical proofs are just a subset of logical arguments, right?
*  Deductions of conclusions from starting points or from agreed upon things about the world.
*  There is, that's not the only kind of reasoning that we can do out there in the world. Science is
*  a little bit different, but it can still be put into the same broad category, right? In science,
*  we don't have axioms that we hold to be 100% reliable. We do our best to get the best explanation
*  of a set of complicated pieces of data that we can. And there's always some error bars,
*  some probability that we're wrong and so forth. But nevertheless, within science,
*  we use deductive reasoning logic in the same way we use it in mathematics. I'd say the same thing
*  about ethical arguments. You know, we might have starting points that we either agree on or don't.
*  Um, but once you agree on your principles, if that's how you're reasoning, if you have some
*  principles or you have some starting points, then you use the rules of logic to derive conclusions
*  from there. Yeah, I can hardly imagine another way to do it. I'm not sure. So in other words,
*  I think that if people think that they're doing something different, it's just a different sort
*  of presentation of the same thing. You know, logic is more or less logic. Now, again, as I'm saying
*  that out loud, all the footnotes are coming to my mind. There are different, different systems
*  of logic. I mean, at the very basic level, there's propositional logic, first order logic,
*  second order logic, but there's also subcategories within all of those. Um, and you can actually,
*  you know, there's modal logic, for example, and you can potentially either reach different
*  conclusions or be able to reach conclusions or not, depending on what system of logic you are using.
*  Those are fair enough, technical worries that I think don't usually matter for down to earth
*  ethical questions. So I think that roughly speaking, what I said originally is right,
*  you just use logic in the same way in ethics as everywhere else. Um, with a footnote that
*  using logic is not quite as simple as we might think if all we did was take a single, you know,
*  lecture in logic or something when we were in high school.
*  Hilbert spaceman says, given that two and three dimensional Euclidean spaces have very different
*  properties from each other, what do you see as the utility of physical theories and lower
*  dimensions? Well, you know, it depends on the physical theory. Um, sometimes it is the,
*  it's much easier to solve the equations in two or three dimensions, right? Uh, or two,
*  two spatial dimensions rather than three, or even one spatial dimensions, and even being able to
*  solve the equations in an unrealistic situation might give you some insight. Um, if you were
*  instead just forcing yourself to always look at the realistic situation, but one where you could
*  never solve the equations. So there's a classic example earlier in the podcast when I mentioned,
*  um, doing, looking at the creation of closed time, like curves, time machines in two plus
*  one dimensional gravity. So three space time dimensions, incredibly unrealistic. There are
*  different properties of gravity in three dimensions versus four dimensions, but you still
*  learn something. You still learn something that you might not have known because the answers that
*  we got from our theorizing were highly non-intuitive. You wouldn't have guessed them. You had to actually
*  go through the work to get there. And from that answer, from that non-intuitive answer,
*  you can be inspired to get some conjectures that might apply to the real three plus one
*  dimensional world. Uh, that happens over and over again. The other reason of course, is that there
*  plenty of physical real cases where for all intents and purposes, the problem that you're
*  looking at really is just two spatial dimensions or even one spatial dimensions. You know,
*  we talked earlier in the podcast about electricity going down wires for a very, very good level of
*  approximation. You can treat that as a one dimensional problem, the direction along the
*  wire. There are plenty of condensed matter systems that are two dimensional super conductors or,
*  you know, sheets of graphene or something like that. So even though there are three dimensions
*  of space around us, that doesn't mean that they're all being accessed by some physical system. In
*  that case, studying numbers of dimensions makes perfect sense. Josh Bauer says, in the field of
*  software engineering, there are several layers of abstraction at which you can think, at which you
*  can think while ignoring the details of the lower levels. For example, when thinking about writing
*  code, you can ignore what circuits will actually do when it's executing. This is by design. It
*  enables the creation of complex systems. This strikes me as designed emergence. Do you think
*  studies of emergence can learn anything from the engineered abstraction layers in software?
*  I mean, at that level of question, it's always possible. Sure, maybe. It is an example. I agree
*  that there's absolutely a close resemblance of what you're describing to what we've been talking
*  about earlier in the podcast about emergence. On the other hand, the reason I'm hesitating a
*  little bit is that one of the salient features of the emergence of complex systems or even just
*  higher level systems generally in the real world is that they are not designed. And there are
*  differences between designed things and non-designed things. There's just look at a car versus a cow.
*  They're about the same size, but very, very different things going on. They both move,
*  but they move using very different methods of locomotion. They're both powered by fuel,
*  but the fuel they use is very, very different. They can both be damaged, but what happens when
*  they're damaged is completely different and so forth for very good reasons because the car
*  has to be held in the mind of the engineer of the car or at least pieces of it do. And then the car
*  as a whole is held in the mind of some boss engineer. The cow doesn't, right? The cow can
*  be infinitely more complex than the car can really when you get down to the detailed level.
*  The other thing is that the cow is not designed for any purpose. The cow is just finding its niche
*  in the ecology, whereas there was a reason why the car was designed. So the design of a car
*  comes from somebody thinking about the future. They say, what will be the need that is served by me
*  building this? The design of the cow has nothing to do with planning for the future. It's always
*  what has served, just trying different things out randomly. That's what natural selection does.
*  And in the current moment, asking what works. And if it works, you reproduce and send that on to the
*  future generations. So a biological organism will generally be much more flexible and multi-purpose
*  than a technological designed organism will be because it wasn't designed for any purpose.
*  So it will typically be much more robust. Biological organisms are much better at
*  repairing themselves than most machines are. On the other hand, a purpose-built machine for
*  one purpose will generally be enormously better at that purpose than a biological organism will be.
*  Cheetahs go very fast, nowhere near as fast as the fastest car or the fastest rocket ship.
*  We're better at doing specific goals by engineering than biology ever is. So I think
*  that even though it's not a necessary fact, as a matter of practice, there are differences in the
*  styles of higher-level behavior you get and the relationship to lower levels that arise out of
*  intelligently designed emergent systems versus undesigned systems. Oleg Ruvinsky says,
*  can you please explain the idea of time reversal symmetry, how it relates to the arrow of time,
*  and how we should think about it? Yeah, time reversal symmetry is just the idea that given
*  some laws of physics, if the laws of physics are the following form, you give me the state of a
*  system at one moment of time, and the state includes in Newtonian mechanics both the positions
*  and the momenta of all the different parts of the system. In quantum mechanics, it would just be the
*  wave function of the system. And then the laws of physics tell you how to evolve it forward in time.
*  You can also evolve it backward in time. That's called reversibility. That's not time reversal
*  symmetry. Reversibility says that the amount of information you have in the state of the system
*  is the same from moment to moment. So there's a unique map from one moment of time to the next,
*  and you can go forward or backward using that map. That's reversibility. Time reversal invariance is
*  that given the state of the system, there's something I can do to that state, some way that
*  I can change it. In particular, in the case of Newtonian mechanics, that way would be reverse
*  all the momenta. And then once I've done that, I can run the system backward in time, and it would
*  undo the evolution it would have done forward in time. So if you like, time reversal symmetry says,
*  take the state now, evolve it forward in time a little bit, time reverse it, which means flip
*  all the momenta. And in quantum mechanics, you do other things, but classically, you would flip
*  all the momenta, then evolve that backward in time. And the claim is you would get to the same state
*  you started in. Sorry, you have to undo the time reversal, you have to undo the momentum flipping.
*  That's time reversal invariance. And so in quantum field theory, time reversal invariance is violated.
*  In the standard model of particle physics, you can do experiments that show that doesn't quite work.
*  Except there's a footnote here, that what do you mean by time reversal symmetry? So reversibility
*  was very clear, right? The information is conserved from moment to moment. The definition I gave of
*  time reversal symmetry was a little more loosey goosey, because I say, you know, evolve forward
*  in time and then do something to the state. In particular, change the direction of all the
*  motions of the particles, but in quantum mechanics, a little more subtle. And then you can go backward.
*  And so the question becomes, is there always something you can do to the state so that you
*  could reverse it in time and get back to where you started? Is that necessarily true? And the answer
*  is, and I don't think this is well appreciated, I started writing a paper about this at one point,
*  but then got distracted by other things. The answer is, it's an unsurprising answer,
*  which is why I'm not motivated to write the paper. But if your theory is reversible,
*  if it has the property that the information in the state deterministically is carried from moment to
*  moment in time, and can go either forward or backward, then there is always a set of things
*  you can do to the state that you can call time reversal, that will be a symmetry of the system.
*  So that's clearly true for Newtonian mechanics. How do you reconcile it with the claim that I
*  just made that in particle physics, time reversal symmetry is broken? Well, it's because particle
*  physicists have chosen to define time reversal symmetry badly. Or not badly, but they've chosen
*  a particular definition of what they mean, that turns out to not work for actually reversing the
*  system. Now, if you're worried that I'm making an overly strong claim, there is another symmetry
*  called CPT, which means charge conjugation parity reversal, end time reversal. Parity reversal is
*  changing directions of space rather than time, so that's not very hard. Charge conjugation is
*  basically exchanging particles for antiparticles. And CPT is conserved in the standard model of
*  particle physics. Indeed, it needs to be conserved in any local Lorentz invariant quantum field
*  theory. So what you could do, and this is all in my brain because I literally wrote about it in my
*  book that is going to be coming out in September in the Biggest Ideas book, you could just define
*  CPT to be what you meant by time reversal invariance. You could just define T prime equals CPT.
*  And that is a time reversal invariant symmetry that is absolutely conserved in the standard
*  model because it has to be something. There has to be such a symmetry because the underlying
*  dynamical equations are completely reversible. And therefore, to get to your actual question,
*  how does it relate to the arrow of time? It doesn't. It doesn't relate to it at all.
*  The arrow of time is a macroscopic phenomenon that comes about from the fact that entropy is
*  increasing in the universe. It has nothing to do with time reversal symmetry. It has a lot to do
*  with reversibility, and reversibility, if it's there, always implies time reversal symmetry.
*  But the real world has the feature that the microscopic equations seem to be reversible.
*  The macroscopic world doesn't. And that's where the arrow of time seems to come from in our real
*  world. So it's just unrelated to time reversal symmetry. Cooper says, are there a significant
*  number of physicists that enjoy visual astronomy as a hobby? For me, it's good for my soul to
*  directly see other galaxies with just my eyes and some mirrors in my backyard. I wouldn't say
*  significant numbers. Honestly, there's absolutely numbers. I was an astronomy major as an
*  undergraduate, so I definitely did quite a bit of stargazing through pretty good telescopes.
*  But as a kid, that was never my thing. I was a theoretically inclined guy, even as a youngster.
*  I've had my own graduate students or my own colleagues who are very, very interested in that.
*  But still, it's a minority, I think, of them. So visual astronomy is a wonderful thing. Being
*  able to see the sky with your eyeballs, even if you get a bit of a help from some telescope that
*  you're carrying on your back or carrying in your truck or whatever, it's still pretty amazing.
*  Because it's kind of interesting. There's an interesting feature of the world that our sky
*  is not that interesting. I mean, it's pretty interesting. The sky at the level of our
*  naked eye, if you're really out there in a dark place and you can see the Milky Way in all of
*  its glory and so forth, the Milky Way is pretty awesome. The Milky Way, not just as a
*  galaxy but as a visual sight, is pretty amazing. But stars are not that amazing. There's literally
*  points of light. I mean, we know that they're very, very interesting close up. You can see them.
*  There's planetary systems and nebulae and so forth. But you need telescopes to see all that stuff.
*  That's an interesting fact about the universe. There's a lot of interestingness out there,
*  but it's far enough away that we can't see it with our naked eye. But it's right on the edge,
*  so that if you bring a little telescope that's not that big, you can see some of that stuff.
*  I think that's just really amazing that that little bit of technological boost
*  gives us a qualitatively different view of the universe. I think there's a lot of joy
*  that one can get out of that. Having said that, I don't do it myself these days as part of my life.
*  On a similar note, the final question of today's AMA is from Matthew McKeever who says,
*  What are your guilty pleasures? And how would you even define guilt in this context? I'm thinking
*  about enjoying, following, devoting some amount of time and energy to something others would think
*  trivial. Perhaps mechanical watches or automobiles if you enjoy craftsmanship and mechanical
*  technology, for example. I would push back on the word guilty. I don't think that you should be
*  guilty about your pleasures. Just enjoy your pleasures as long as you're not hurting anybody
*  else. I'm not that guilty about my pleasures. I'm in favor of pleasures as a general rule.
*  People should have more of them. Presciently, you put your finger on one of my main pleasures,
*  guilty or not, which is mechanical watches. Ten years ago, I had no interest in mechanical watches.
*  I was happy to wear a cheap electronic watch. But then I wrote a book called From Eternity to
*  Here, The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time. It was mostly about the entropy in the era of
*  time and a little bit about space-time and time reversibility as we've been talking about stuff
*  like that. But it was my first trade book. I was very enthusiastic about writing absolutely
*  everything that could be thought of and said about this topic. So I did a little bit about
*  timekeeping in the book. I started reading up about escapements and things like that.
*  Somehow, I actually got started reading about the Swiss, the quartz crisis in Swiss mechanical
*  watches. For those of you who don't know, it used to be that mechanical watches were the only
*  watches. Those are what you had. Then in the late 60s and the 1970s, they invented quartz watches,
*  which are much cheaper and more accurate. So that's a win-win. To a large extent,
*  the Swiss mechanical watch industry cratered the quartz crisis, it's called, because why would you
*  spend more money on a watch that is not as accurate? Finally, they figured out a reason
*  to stay alive. The reason was that it's kind of nice to have an elegant mechanical machine on your
*  wrist that serves both as a technological marvel and as a work of art, as a little bit of jewelry.
*  Men don't get to wear jewelry. They don't get to adorn themselves with accessories that often.
*  But watches are one way that you can do it. So these days, there's a whole mechanical watch
*  industry and the price points go from $100 to a million dollars, more than a million dollars for
*  the super expensive watches. They really are technologically quite impressive.
*  Many of them, depending on how much you're willing to spend, they're mass produced,
*  but at the higher levels of paying, you're looking at things that get a lot of individual human
*  attention along the way. Some of them are very interesting in their designs and some of them
*  are beautiful and some of them are just kind of rugged and manly or elegant and artistic and
*  beautiful. It's a wonderful hobby to kind of get lost in. In fact, it's a very, very dangerous hobby
*  because however much money you want to spend, you can't. So you have to keep that under control.
*  Happily for me, I'm not really a spendthrift. I'm not really someone to spend more money than I have
*  or want to feel comfortable spending. So I'm not in danger of buying $100,000 watches,
*  even if I could. I don't think I ever could. Could you ever buy? I know people do, but could
*  you walk around with a $100,000 watch on your hand, worried that it might break? I don't know.
*  I don't think I could ever be rich enough to enjoy that. But I like the level of spending that I can
*  do on it. I try to restrain myself from buying too many watches. I went through a phase early
*  where you buy a lot of cheap watches because just one variety. And now I realize it's better to save
*  your money, get a nice watch whenever you want one. And completely, you know, completely guilty
*  pleasure in the sense that it's not practical. I can still check the time on my phone just as well,
*  but I like it. That's what a guilty pleasure is. I just like it. That's the point. But the real
*  answer to your question is, of course, as many people know, is basketball. Like if you folks knew
*  how many minutes of my average day was spent thinking about the Philadelphia 76ers, you'd
*  be embarrassed for me. You would feel bad. You would think that I'm wasting my time. You know,
*  I talk about lots of things on the internet and so forth. When I'm reading things on the internet,
*  a lot of the time it's about trade scenarios for the Sixers, etc. And, you know, at the end of a
*  long day, if there happens to be a Sixers game on, I'd be very happy to watch that, even though
*  they're very far away. Technology lets me watch the games now. It's kind of awesome. Again,
*  completely impractical, but pleasurable. I think that's good. I don't think that you should be,
*  you should feel guilty about it at all. So pleasures, let's just call them pleasures.
*  And let's say that pleasures are good things. And with that, I cannot think of a better place
*  to wind up this Ask Me Anything episode. As usual, thank you very much for supporting the
*  Mindscape podcast. It's a great ride. We're all on and we have in this new year,
*  some pretty awesome new podcasts coming up. So stay tuned. Bye bye.
