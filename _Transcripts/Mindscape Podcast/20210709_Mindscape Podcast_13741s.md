Welcome to the July 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | July 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udWCPEIivQk)
*  Hello everybody, welcome to the July 2021 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape
*  podcast where we take questions from Patreon supporters of Mindscape. So if
*  you're not a Patreon supporter, that's okay. You're permitted to not be a Patreon
*  supporter, but it's way more fun and fulfilling in your life if you are. You
*  can go to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll to sign up $1 per week or
*  whatever it is to support the podcast and you get to ask AMA questions and
*  then I answer them and eventually everyone gets to listen. Sadly, not so
*  sadly for me, but sadly for the AMA there are so many people and so many
*  good questions that I can't answer all of them, so it's ask me anything but
*  don't necessarily answer everything. Sorry about that. I do try to get a
*  representative sample, right? So if there are themes that keep appearing I'm going
*  to try to at least answer someone's question in that theme and I think, you
*  know, we've hit the point now where there's so many questions that I'm
*  probably answering less than half. So really don't feel bad if your question
*  is not being answered. It's not you, it's me. As I said before, I try to pick out
*  the questions where it's not only a good question but something where I in
*  particular have something interesting to say about it. I will say, you know, I like
*  to give advice to people who want to know how to get their questions answered.
*  You know, we say in the instructions shorter questions are preferred. I know
*  that some people seem to find that a difficult piece of advice to take
*  seriously but really if you want to get your question answered shorter questions
*  definitely do help you have that happen. It's not enough, you can ask short
*  questions, it doesn't get answered, but it definitely helps me say, oh yes, I could
*  answer this in a very brief period. Also shout out to the Patreon supporters who
*  suggested that we finally get a merch store here at Mindscape selling t-shirts
*  and mugs and things like that. So we've set up one on T-Public. You can find a
*  link to it on the Mindscape webpage which is preposterousuniverse.com
*  slash podcast. On the right hand side there's a little link to t-shirts, mugs
*  and more. Get some designs there, maybe more will be coming in the future, who
*  knows. But anyway, you want a sticker for your laptop that says Mindscape or you
*  know maybe you want your mask to have the core theory equation on it, there is
*  the place to go. So with that, let's go.
*  Eric Chen says, what's your take on Pascal's wager? Do you think there is a
*  simple explanation for why the argument fails and if so do you think you have a
*  satisfactory account of how to make decisions to ethics when infinities are
*  at stake? So for those of you who don't know, you know to be honest I'm not
*  gonna get this exactly right Pascal's wager, but the basic idea is look you
*  know if God exists and God wants you to worship him and promises you infinite
*  time, eternity of pleasure in heaven, right, then it's worth almost anything to
*  get that if it's a possible thing. Even if you think that God isn't very likely
*  in your prior, the benefits of believing him and worshiping him
*  apparently are so great that we should just do it. There's a 1% chance times
*  infinity reward, right, you should go for it. So I think that there's two reasons,
*  I'm probably butchering that by the way because I haven't looked it up recently,
*  but that's the basic gist of the idea. I think there's two things going on, one is
*  kind of trivial and one is a little bit more profound or difficult. The trivial
*  thing is you know you could say that kind of thing about all sorts of
*  different propositions with very very different outcomes, right, I mean there's
*  a chance that God exists and would be really annoyed if you believed in him in
*  him or worshiped him for the wrong reasons and those reasons might include
*  Pascal's wager and therefore God would send you to hell for eternal torment if
*  you believed him for that reason. So that would be an argument to not do it and
*  all these arguments are a little bit silly because you know how do you
*  actually decide what the entire set of things are? How do we decide which
*  religion to be if this is the kind of argument that we're trying to follow? So
*  just out of the gate I think that Pascal's wager is not a very good
*  argument at all. There is, as Eric you say in your question, a more interesting
*  sub question here which is the infinity question, right, if you believe that more
*  generally there's some kind of argument for maximizing something, utility or
*  reward or likelihood of success or whatever, and there's something that is
*  unlikely but it's then multiplied by infinity, how do you deal with that? I
*  mean it seems to sort of pin the needle to you should definitely take this
*  seriously even though a priori it's very unlikely and you know I think that
*  that's an argument for not taking these infinities seriously, you know, I think
*  is not what you're asking but this is one of the reasons why heaven and hell
*  are just kind of silly as concepts, right? I mean it's the human inability to
*  distinguish between infinity and a very big number, you know, we can imagine
*  being happy or being sad, being rewarded or being tortured for a brief period of
*  time, even for a relatively long period of time on human scales, so we just say
*  what if it were infinite, right, what if that went for eternity? We don't sit back
*  and ask whether that makes any sense, like could you really even be happy for
*  eternity, like is the idea of heaven a sensible concept to a human being? I
*  doubt it personally, I don't even think that is something that makes sense and
*  of course a real religious believer would be well yes you know your human
*  capabilities here on earth are not up to the task of comprehending the
*  magnificence of heaven and maybe that's true but then that means I can't
*  evaluate how seriously to take it here if that's the question I'm asking
*  myself. So I do think that in other contexts these questions of dealing with
*  infinity are subtle and I'm not an expert on how to do it, in this context I
*  just think that it's kind of a silly proposition you're being forced to
*  consider in Pascal's Wager. Daniel Westwater says, given that there's more
*  evidence for galaxies without dark matter do you think it would be
*  possible for the universe to exist without it and what would it look like
*  if so? So there's two things going on here also one is the straightforward
*  answer to your question which is sure the universe could exist without dark
*  matter I mean maybe you have something more specific in mind than the
*  existence of the universe like the existence of the universe doesn't care
*  if there's dark matter or not you could have a universe that had other stuff in
*  it or no stuff at all as far as we know at least it might look different I mean
*  maybe what you mean is that the universe would look sufficiently different
*  without dark matter that stars or galaxies wouldn't form and then maybe
*  you wouldn't have life and there'd be some anthropic argument against that
*  kind of universe I mean that's that's possible we can certainly imagine
*  arguments like that and people have made arguments like that in fact in the case
*  of dark matter it's a little weak you know I because I think what would
*  actually be the case if you didn't have dark matter I mean sorry to back up a
*  little bit the idea is that dark matter has no you know restorative force when
*  it becomes condensed into a region so dark matter falls into a region under
*  its gravitational pull and there's no heat or pressure pushing it back like
*  there is with ordinary matter whereas there's also no stickiness or
*  dissipation so if you had nothing but dark matter in the universe dark matter
*  would sort of clump together a little bit but not too much because the dark
*  matter particles just go right through each other when they begin to clump
*  together on the other hand ordinary matter also clumps together a little bit
*  but not too much because it clumps together but then it heats up and pushes
*  apart so in some sense it's helpful to have both dark matter and ordinary matter
*  working together so in the real world it might have helped the formation of
*  early stars that we have dark matter in our universe but that becomes a
*  quantitative question right how much did it help so you don't need that many
*  stars in the universe to have one available for life forming right so even
*  if you might say well maybe there would only be one one thousandth of the number
*  of stars in the universe if there weren't dark matter that's still plenty
*  to make life and things like that as far as I know anyway so I'm skeptical of
*  those anthropic arguments also but the real reason I wanted to answer this
*  question or to address this question is because I do think there's an interesting
*  point to be made here that people sometimes miss when we say as you said
*  there's been news lately if I'm getting it right about finding galaxies that
*  don't have dark matter in them and of course in certain circles whether or not
*  dark matter exists and the role it plays in cosmological model building is a
*  little bit sticky so what I wanted to emphasize is the counterintuitive fact
*  that finding evidence for galaxies without dark matter in them is evidence
*  for dark matter now why would that be true why would finding the absence of
*  dark matter be evidence for dark matter well the answer is the alternative to
*  dark matter is something going on with gravity right something some
*  misunderstanding that we have and how gravity works on large scales when you
*  get galaxy-sized things but the thing about that hypothesis that something is
*  going on with gravity is that it's pretty universal right if you're saying
*  that the stuff of the universe is just the stuff we see and know about the
*  ordinary matter the stars and gas and dust and we don't understand exactly how
*  its gravitational field arises but it arises from that stuff then you have no
*  matter what your theory of gravity is an immediate prediction that all
*  clusters of similar kinds of stuff similar amounts of stuff will have the
*  same gravitational field because it's that visible stuff that is creating the
*  gravitational field whereas if your theory is well there's both ordinary
*  matter and dark matter then the dynamics of galaxies and sub galaxies and
*  clusters and things like that can be such that you have two equal sized
*  collections of stars one of which has dark matter associated with it one of
*  which doesn't so that dark matter hypothesis even though usually the
*  amount of dark matter it tracks in some weak sense the amount of ordinary matter
*  it has that extra degree of freedom that lets you explain the existence of
*  galaxies without dark matter and therefore just ordinary gravitational
*  dynamics in a way that a theory that just modifies gravity wouldn't let you
*  do so the evidence for galaxies without dark matter is evidence that dark matter
*  is on the right track Andre Deneu says in your latest podcast with John Preskill
*  you touch upon the possibility that physical space and distances between
*  objects are emergent phenomena arising from quantum entanglement you say the
*  following it's not the entanglement between you and me that gives us the
*  distance it's the entanglement between invisible degrees of freedom in the
*  space between us which is a little bit hard to visualize can you expand on this
*  well I can try you know I did write a book something deeply hidden in which I
*  talk about not only many worlds quantum mechanics but also the emergence of
*  space-time part of the difficulty of this idea is that it is just the difficult
*  idea you know we're asking you to grasp some purely abstract things you know I'm
*  not saying that space-time is made of little pixels or atoms or anything
*  tangible like that it's just made of abstract quantum mechanical degrees of
*  freedom that has it have entangled between them it's hard to visualize it's
*  hard to wrap your brain around or to get your hands on it in some sense so the
*  idea is that there's a quantum mechanical wave function that can be
*  expressed as quantum mechanical degrees of freedom with different amounts of
*  entanglement between them and the different amounts of entanglement knit
*  together to form a more or less smooth three-dimensional space-time so the
*  amount of entanglement between these invisible space-time degrees of freedom
*  has a very specific geometric structure that fits nicely together to form a
*  smooth manifold now the huge question and there were some other questions in
*  the AMA that I cut out because that they were a little bit redundant with this
*  one so consider this an answer the huge question is even if the entanglement
*  between these degrees of freedom can be like distances in space or space-time
*  does that mean that they are distances in space or space-time well good
*  question you know I don't know that is one of the things that we're trying to
*  understand when you say there's a distance between objects in space or in
*  space-time for that matter you have some operational notion in mind about what
*  that means what you're saying is that it takes a certain amount of time to get
*  there if you go at a certain velocity or you know signals travel between this
*  place in this place in a certain way and so what you need is a dynamical theory
*  of traveling right distances don't mean anything really until you can travel
*  from one point to another and so what you have to say is that the entanglement
*  structure of these abstract degrees of freedom has an effect on the propagation
*  speed of signals in this emergent space-time and there's some hints that
*  something like that might actually be true and we're on the right track but I
*  would say we're very far from completely spelling it out so to add to the
*  difficulty that all this is very abstract and hard to visualize is the
*  difficulty that we're not there yet it's a very preliminary idea we don't have
*  the full picture in mind so I can't really tell you much more than that
*  sorry Richard Riley says you told listeners a couple months ago that you
*  won't be renewing your research professor contract at Caltech and will
*  focus instead on your podcast patreon YouTube work and your other writing plus
*  your Santa Fe Institute activity are you concerned that not being fully in the
*  mix of top research university will make you drift away from the center of the
*  physics cosmology world no matter what else you may be doing so there's two
*  things to say about that one is prior to there's a prior question here you know I
*  think either I am not clear or sometimes people jump ahead of what I say to to
*  extrapolate beyond what I say so it is not true that I am leaving Caltech to
*  focus instead on podcast patreon YouTube that's not true what I meant to say and
*  I may or may not have actually said this is the fact that I am doing well with
*  the podcast and with patreon and things like that gives me the freedom to
*  contemplate doing something like that I'm not at all devoted to doing it yeah
*  I don't know my my future options are quite up in the air and in fact you know
*  the the possibility that I am that I do land at a university as a professor is
*  pretty high there's plenty of universe not plenty there are universities who
*  you know are in touch let's put it that way and would like to have me there and
*  I need to think about how best to maximize the work I want to do and so I
*  don't know what that will be yet you know so to get into the actual that's
*  the preamble the actual question is a very good one right you know what is the
*  benefit versus disadvantage of sticking around top research university I mean
*  think there are clear benefits and then there are also disadvantages and so you
*  have to weigh them a clear benefit is that you're surrounded by other really
*  smart people doing interesting things right that's the single biggest benefit
*  there's sort of sub benefits to that you have graduate students or postdocs you
*  can teach and that can be inspiring all but the most important thing is that
*  you're in a network of people who can both give you ideas and also act as
*  reality checks on the ideas that you have I think that overall if your goal
*  was to be a productive scholar intellectual researcher having that
*  network of people to talk to is just super duper crucially important one way
*  or the other so being at a university is the most straightforward way to have
*  that there's another way I can imagine having that by sort of bouncing around
*  right be part-time at a place like Santa Fe visit other places I'm spending this
*  fall visiting Harvard for example so I could easily imagine you know being a
*  gentleman researcher scholar bouncing around from place to place visiting
*  places mixing it up with people and the freedom to do that would be provided by
*  the fact that I don't need to earn a living as a university professor if
*  that's the direction I go to also there's sort of more down-to-earth
*  benefits of having institutional affiliation having graduate students
*  being able to hire postdocs apply for grants is a much easier thing to do and
*  things like that that part would that really means that the Santa Fe part-time
*  faculty position that I have it would be very useful if that were the route
*  that I decided to take those sorts of things become much more possible and at
*  the same time then on the flip side I should say there are disadvantages to
*  having a university position it's work right you got to teach and you got to be
*  on committees and your you know my Caltech position in particular which was
*  a research professorship since my research interests have shifted a lot
*  and they don't really overlap with the people I'm affiliated with at Caltech
*  so much anymore to became less of a good fit you know again I what I said before
*  is I love Caltech nothing against Caltech it's just not as good a fit for
*  me as it once was so I think these are good concerns and you know I certainly
*  it's certainly easier now to imagine being completely independent because you
*  have the internet right you can listen in on talks you can like the other great
*  benefit that you used to have from being at a university is that you could
*  go to seminars right seminars and colloquia or workshops that were nearby
*  people would come through and you could talk to them some of that is ameliorated
*  by the fact that a lot of these things are online these days right so there's a
*  there's a kind of connection that doesn't require that physical closeness
*  but still you know as anyone who's actually participated in this knows
*  whether it's a workshop or conference or just your day-to-day job a lot of the
*  useful interactions with colleagues happen at lunch or at coffee or just
*  you know sitting around talking not necessarily in a formal context of
*  asking questions at a seminar or something like that so I'm a very big
*  believer in the benefits of being at an institution like that it's just a
*  complicated question how to you know exactly balance things in a particular
*  way especially you know for someone like me for a lot of people you know who are
*  who just fit very very naturally into a certain department doing a certain kind
*  of research and that's exactly where they're happiest it's not much of a
*  competition that's obviously the right thing to do for someone like me who
*  really values the interdisciplinary kinds of things the ability to say well
*  this month I'm doing physics next month I'm doing philosophy maybe someday I'll
*  do economics or biophysics or something like that the freedom is very very
*  helpful so it's a it's an important set of considerations to keep in mind okay
*  now I'm gonna group some questions together and you know I don't think I'm
*  gonna give a very profound answer to any of them but there were a few of them so
*  I think that you know that boosts the chances of me answering the question
*  when there are related questions and they're all about art so Anita Tomasic
*  says I wonder if there's any tendency among theoretical physicists who prefer
*  abstract art to figurative art Chris says what are your views on art what is
*  it what is its purpose how does it fit into the worldview is there anything
*  deep about it or is it just a pleasurable activity like eating a
*  tasty meal and Lana Salameh says who are your who are some of your favorite
*  artists out there whether it was in the fine arts music film literature even
*  comedy so I don't I don't think that I have in any sense a deeply thought-out
*  theory of art I'm a big fan of art and I take art in this case not to just be
*  painting or sculpture or what are traditionally called the fine arts but
*  artistic things so music film literature even comedy as Lana says all these count
*  I think in what we what we would what I'm classifying as art for purposes of
*  this discussion you know I think that art is important you know Chris says is
*  there anything deep about it or is it just a pleasurable activity like eating
*  a tasty meal you know I think that eating a tasty meal can be pretty deep
*  you know I think this is one of the pleasures of life I think that that's
*  all you did was eat tasty meals if that's the only pleasurable thing you did
*  that would end up being pretty shallow just because it's kind of one thing over
*  and over again and different kinds of artistic expressions do have different
*  amounts of depth to them right you know I love popular music but a three-minute
*  pop song can't quite have the level of depth and complexity that an opera can I
*  don't think that gives an opera any intrinsic objective superiority but it
*  gives it a different kind of experience and you know likewise tasty meals are
*  good but if that's your only artistic experience then you're missing out on the
*  literature and music and visual arts kinds of perspectives so I think that
*  there's no I'm not you know you shouldn't be surprised if you know that
*  I'm not a moral realist to learn that I'm not an aesthetic realist either I
*  don't believe in the objective superiority of different works of art I
*  think that the important thing about art is its relationship to the
*  experiencer of the art different kinds of people experience different works of
*  art in different ways and if one person whether it's me or someone else sees or
*  experiences a work of art and is deeply affected by it whether it's by getting
*  pleasure from it or being provoked to contemplate things in a new way or just
*  feeling some ineffable feeling of transcendence then that is completely
*  valid even if someone else doesn't feel the same thing at all so I try very hard
*  not to disparage works of art that I am individually not very much into even if
*  other people are you know I think that discussions yeah there's an interesting
*  philosophy problem here because we tend to we judge things and then when we
*  judge things we tend to attribute objective truth to our judgments but in
*  the case of art I truly think we shouldn't you know even if you're
*  reviewing if you're a restaurant critic or a music critic or an art critic or
*  whatever it's in my mind much more useful for someone like that to talk
*  about the experience in a non objectively judgmental way right you know
*  if you like this then you will like that like so many things I meant I made this
*  comment on Twitter a few months ago I guess about book reviews maybe it wasn't
*  book reviews in particular but reviews of anything book reviews movie reviews
*  etc there are so many reviews that say you know this thing this object this
*  action this cultural product was a good example of X but I wasn't in the mood
*  for X I wanted Y therefore one star and this is enormously frustrating you know
*  as someone who's written books and I can imagine it's just as frustrating for
*  someone who writes movies or produces movies right you know this movie is very
*  depressing I was in the mood for a comedy I didn't like it you know just
*  just say it's a comedy you know just or just say it's a it's depressing you know
*  and maybe someone's gonna be in the mood for that and I think that would be the
*  right kind of art criticism one that really illuminated the different
*  possible ways that a work of art could influence you and then let people react
*  to them in their individual ways is there any tendency among theoretical
*  physicists to prefer abstract art to figurative art I don't think so you know
*  I think that theoretical physicists have different attitudes towards art that
*  some physicists are pretty down to earth about it right they want a picture of
*  something on the wall others yet absolutely do prefer abstract art so I
*  think it's an interesting question I don't have any data that would lead me
*  to say or at least I haven't contemplated the question in a
*  sufficiently systematic way to actually say whether there's a preference one way
*  or the other that is more tilted for theoretical physicists than for other
*  people sorry about that who are some of my favorite artists out there you know
*  when it comes to the fine arts these days I'm I just can't name names some of
*  my best friends actually are fine artists you know here in LA some of our
*  very good friends are painters and I love it but I don't have any knowledge
*  of the field as a whole it's a whole huge world right I do like abstract art
*  I like 20th century art very very much but I also like you know the older art so
*  you know going to an art museum is generally a positive experience for me
*  no matter what kind of specialty it is I do like beauty in my art you know I
*  wanted to have some aesthetic sense you know I think one of the failure modes of
*  art usually although not always because not everything is the you can't make
*  these predictions objectively but for me whenever a painter starts including
*  words text into their art it always makes it worse for me because the visual
*  experience opens itself up into different kinds of thoughts in different
*  ways that might impact one differently depending on you know the time of day or
*  whatever the mood you're in whereas just putting a word there is just such a
*  blunt instrument as far as I am concerned you know I love words in their
*  own context in the case context of literature but you can only put a few
*  words onto a painting or whatever and usually it acts to constrict and narrow
*  the experience for me personally so I started saying that because I'm trying
*  to explain you know what kinds of artists I like when I go to museums or
*  something like that so look if it's Rembrandt or Michelangelo love them
*  they were amazing Raphael etc also you know Picasso Kandinsky I have a
*  Kandinsky t-shirt that I got when I was looking over things on a T public when
*  I was setting up my own t-shirt store brilliant Kandinsky t-shirt I love you
*  know the abstract expressionists Mark Rothko Jackson Pollock Louise Bourgeois
*  with these amazing sculptures so I like lots of different things and I can't
*  even pinpoint and many of these people are not alive because I'm not a hip on
*  the contemporary art scene sorry about that Manuel Bevand says in a 2014 World
*  Science Festival debate on quantum mechanics you said something akin to if
*  a GRW turned out to be true I would probably retire from physics you wrote
*  JRW but it's GRW, Girardi, Rimini and Weber this is a theory of quantum
*  mechanics in which wave functions collapse spontaneously all by themselves
*  and so sorry Manuel is asking do you still think that today if yes can you
*  elaborate on why a little more than you did at the time so to be clear that was
*  a joke I would not necessarily retire from physics in fact is it's almost a
*  private joke that I probably shouldn't have said out loud because it's a an
*  illusion to Joe Polchinsky telling me years ago like circa 1997 or six that if
*  they found the cosmogon constant to be non-zero he would retire from physics
*  because his reasoning was that the only good explanation for it is the
*  anthropic principle the anthropic but the anthropic principles very ugly and
*  dislikable so he would retire it was just a joke when he was saying it we did
*  find the cosmogon constant he didn't retire and we joked about that so the
*  point is just to emphasize the fact that you know we physicists want to find out
*  the truth we want to find out how the world really is right and then you're
*  gonna work to understand whatever that truth happens to be but we're also human
*  beings and we have preferences we have things that ahead of time we would
*  consider to be more elegant solutions to certain problems so I think that the
*  idea that wave functions just sort of randomly collapse with a with a strong
*  arrow of time they collapse in one direction of time but they don't
*  anti-collapse and it's exactly tuned to be frequent enough to explain our the
*  our experience of the macroscopic world but infrequent enough not to show up in
*  experiments that we've already done ah that just seems to be asking a lot of it
*  just seems to be very awkward okay so I don't like it and I think that there is a
*  much better explanation right there on the table but I'm not gonna retire from
*  physics even if it turns out to be true I would suspect this may or may not be
*  true but I would suspect that if it turns out to be true there's a more
*  elegant beautiful thing underlying that that will be remaining to be found
*  Michelard Sabo says I've recently come across an old Nautilus article that
*  contrasted Neil deGrasse Tyson and Sam Harris as representatives of two very
*  different but characteristic attitudes of public intellectuals one is the very
*  opinionated the edgier the better stands and the other could be called the
*  educator never taking sides or definite positions my question is what do you
*  think about the role and responsibilities of public thinkers in
*  our society and do you really think there is such a spectrum and if so where
*  would you actually where would you ideally want to be on it and where do
*  you think you actually are on this spectrum so I want to remove this an
*  excellent question and I mean it was so it's such a good question I want to
*  restrain what I want to say about it I could talk for a long time but I want to
*  remove Neil deGrasse Tyson and Sam Harris from the question because as soon as you
*  name individual names then you know they're fans or there are critics and
*  they talk about those people and I don't care about that I want to talk about the
*  underlying idea so because you know we all debate there's a long-going debate
*  about how to be a good public intellectual what that means whether
*  that you know every era says that the public intellectual is dying etc and
*  others will hold up their favorites okay so it's an important debate worth
*  having I do not think that this particular division into edgy and
*  educating captures what it means to be a public intellectual in fact I would say
*  that these neither one of these categories really is what I think of as
*  So let me explain what I mean by intellectual in this context you know
*  intellectual doesn't mean intelligent you can be intelligent but not an
*  intellectual or you mean an intellectual and not all that intelligent really and
*  an intellectual is someone who is characterized by in my mind and people
*  can disagree and it's a word who cares about the definition but what I mean by
*  it is someone who seeks truth as the highest value they want to find out what
*  things are true what how the world actually works and this can be
*  contrasted you know the obvious contrast is with people who just kind of get
*  along right like you know they don't work too hard to understand how the
*  world as it is but you know they have a pretty good view and they're gonna get
*  through the day right I mean that's most people in the world but there's another
*  very important category that I don't want to downgrade in importance which is
*  activists right an activist has a goal and that goal might not be the same as
*  the truth right I mean the goal might be a very good goal feed the hungry right
*  cure diseases you know fix the political system in some way these are very good
*  goals and when you have these goals if that's your highest goal that can get in
*  the way of the goal of figuring out the truth and telling it you would like to
*  think and it's probably often true that these goals are in linemen but not
*  always right like if you're if your view of how to make real change in the world
*  is to lead a movement whether it's being a politician running for office or just
*  you know being the head of some more informal coalition you might come to the
*  conclusion that talking certain ways saying certain things making certain
*  activities and so forth is more important than just telling the truth or
*  that there are some things that are true that you don't want to make public right
*  I mean because they get in the way of your goal so I'm not disparaging that
*  activists are important in the world but it's not me and it's not an intellectual
*  the intellectual is going to say look I'm gonna tell you what the truth is I'm
*  going to try to figure out the truth and no matter what the implications are for
*  what happens in the world which is why you know informally I have a policy here
*  on mindscape that I don't invite active politicians on to the show someone who
*  was a politician and is now retired maybe okay but once you're a politician
*  your goals are a little bit different than discovering the truth and I will
*  stand up for the importance of politics all the time and I'm pro politics but
*  it's a different thing than being intellectual so intellectuals are ones
*  who care about the truth and even maybe you could add to that people who sort of
*  have a process of finding out the truth right like not just they care about it
*  passively but they care about it actively they're you know taking steps
*  to understand the world better okay and a public intellectual is one who does
*  that in public you know who does that in full view of the world most
*  intellectuals are not public and again that's fine like I don't want most
*  intellectuals to be public frankly some of them are sort of a turn-off in the
*  ways that they would talk about things and there's no necessary connection
*  between finding the truth and talking about the truth out loud in front of an
*  audience I think both are important but I think they're different so I think
*  that there's room for people who are educators but that's different than
*  being a public intellectual you know an educator is someone who says okay here
*  are some things we figured out I'm going to explain them to you I'm going to teach
*  you I'm going to be pedagogical about it this is an incredibly important thing to
*  do right in some way this is journalism right all of journalism is okay there
*  are some true things I'm going to explain them to you right but to me
*  that's not quite being an intellectual because an intellectual saying you know
*  we don't know what the truth is yet we're trying to find it so we're working
*  in this process to learn about the truth to consider different hypotheses to make
*  arguments the real difference to me between an intellectual and an educator
*  is that an educator is basically hanging on to things we all more or less agree
*  are right at least you know the people are more or less in the mainstream agree
*  these things are right you know human beings are causing global warming the
*  earth is round right we evolved from other species these kinds of things not
*  everyone sadly agrees are right but there is pretty much a consensus whereas
*  an intellectual is working at you know we're not sure what is the right
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics I can't pretend just to be a disinterested
*  educator where I talk about the right interpretation of quantum mechanics I
*  need to say on the one hand we don't know yet there are people who disagree
*  and acknowledge that and put that front and center and on the other hand I want
*  to say but here's why I think this one is true right so an educator would say
*  here are what people say about the interpretations of quantum mechanics an
*  intellectual would add and here's why I think this one is true which means that
*  intellectuals can be wrong sometimes but it's a slight but I think crucially
*  important difference you know in your question or in this you're quoting from
*  the Staudilus article I guess you're you're glossing the idea being an
*  educator as saying never taking sides or definite positions I think it's a
*  slightly unfair way of saying it I mean educators are saying look there's a lot
*  of stuff we know about the world that's interesting and important and we're
*  gonna try to share it that's a very very valuable important thing to do it's just
*  a slightly different thing than the intellectual engaged in an argument
*  right intellectuals are out there on the boundary between what we know and what
*  we don't know trying to figure out what is going on and the thing is that this
*  activity of being intellectual being devoted to the truth and working out
*  what the truth is making arguments listening to other people's arguments
*  responding to them and so forth there's a tension there with the idea being
*  public right it's not completely opposed to it but it's not completely
*  aligned to it either because let's face it you're not that much of a public
*  intellectual if no one's listening to you right I mean you can call yourself
*  a public intellectual because you're out there talking but there's a difference
*  between talking in a crowd in a town square with a crowd gathered around you
*  versus talking the same talk in the middle of an empty field where no one's
*  listening right so to be a public intellectual implies that you want
*  people to listen to you and you have some success in getting them to listen
*  to you and there you get into the question of you know the strategies or
*  the issue of the strategies for engaging the public and getting them interested
*  and gathering a big audience might also not be aligned with the strategy of
*  telling the truth and this is where the edginess comes in the idea not just of
*  edginess but of contrarianism you know of being a heretic being radical to me all of these ideas
*  being a contrarian being edgy being radical these are anti-intellectual
*  ideas at a very fundamental level not because you should never be contrarian or
*  be a heretic or be radical or be edgy but to valorize those things is not to
*  valorize finding the truth right sometimes the truth is conventional
*  sometimes the truth is the middle of the road you have to be open to saying well
*  you know maybe people are right and when people are right explain why they're
*  right you know I was invited to write a short piece for one of these edited
*  volumes that John Brockman used to put together John Brockman is the purveyor
*  of the edge website and every year he would have a question center that he
*  would make into a book so the question was one year what have you changed your
*  mind about and I explained in my little short essay like two paragraphs
*  literally when I was younger let's say in college I did valorize being a
*  heretic you know going against the system fighting the man and so my little
*  changing mind essay was being a heretic is hard work because it's not good to
*  just be a heretic for the sake of being a heretic you have to be a heretic
*  because there is some individual case where you think it's worth going against
*  the conventional wisdom and so I did change my mind about that and I'm still
*  willing to go against the conventional wisdom but I'm much more reluctant to do
*  it because I understand that there is a sort of romance to it an attraction to
*  it for that reason both individually and for the purposes of gathering an
*  audience that is dangerous to the value of being intellectual which is what I
*  actually value if your first goal is being correct that's different than
*  having your first goal being edgy I remember when somewhere on the internet
*  someone mentioned that they had started listening my podcast but they stopped
*  listening and went to other podcasts because they were edgier and you know
*  with all due respect my immediate response was good riddance like you're
*  not the audience I'm looking for if what you're looking for is edginess my
*  audience I'm hoping is in it for the truth and we don't always know what the
*  truth is which is why I will on the podcast try to have people I disagree
*  with but it's all part of the journey to find to the truth and sometimes the
*  truth will be in the minority the radical view sometimes it will be in the
*  majority and just go along and getting that balance right is difficult so you
*  know and and anyway I think that public intellectuals are crucially important
*  because I think that it's more than just educating it's it's exhibiting the
*  process of trying to figure out the truth in the case of questions that can
*  be very very hard and that's messy you'll be wrong sometimes you'll talk
*  to people who you disagree with but you know I want to talk to people who I can
*  and I want to sort of set an example for constructive engagement between people
*  who disagree in different ways and you know some people are not gonna like
*  that it's not gonna be some people's thing and you know furthermore I have my
*  own idiosyncratic things that I care about you know I am willing to be a bit
*  more technical in the weeds etc than many other people who in science
*  communication anyway and so that limits the audience that I'm gonna get in some
*  ways but that's okay because it's still a pretty sizable audience right like
*  there are people I can reach with things like the biggest ideas in the universe
*  or many of the episodes of this podcast that I think want a little bit more than
*  they usually get in the discourse and you know they're not in it for the cheap
*  thrills they really want to hear the truth and the truth is thrilling enough
*  in my view so I can carve out a niche I'm never gonna be you know the super
*  duper famous public intellectual science communicator or whatever but I think my
*  people appreciate what I am trying to do and that's what is very rewarding for me
*  okay sorry if that was too long but you know you pressed a button there John
*  Perry says taking on board strands of various podcasts what chances do you
*  give to democracy winning out as the optimum model for national government
*  given the increasing economic dominance in military power of countries like
*  China and the level of digital monitoring of individuals etc they're
*  rapidly being able to achieve you know this is asking me in some sense to
*  predict the future right what chances do I give to democracy winning out and I'm
*  very bad at predicting the future that's one of the things I will acknowledge is
*  not my area not my expertise and furthermore I think it's probably
*  misguided to imagine there is such an idea as winning out when it comes to
*  being the optimal model optimum model for national government I think that
*  what we will see here I just said I'm bad at making predictions and I'm about
*  to make a prediction but it's kind of a miltoasty prediction my prediction is
*  that we'll continue to see many different models that the equilibrium
*  around the world is that there will be some democracies some authoritarian
*  things some socialist things some more radical different experiments in
*  different kinds of government and so on what we can hope is to change the
*  balance between these different kinds of things I do think that you know China in
*  some ways in many ways is that a very natural world-leading country right it's
*  a huge country technologically advanced speaks a common language and they have a
*  system of government that is very well adapted to rapidly doing things right
*  you know there's its central planning it's its ability to make choices and
*  have them implemented very very quickly but of course that same organization has
*  huge disadvantages as well you know we talked with Henry Farrell a little bit
*  about the fact that simply when it comes to solving social problems there's a
*  case to be made that democracy is a better solution finder than
*  authoritarian systems are but also you know there are a set of values that go
*  together that both go into progress whether it's technological or scientific
*  progress or social or moral progress and democracy right and Henry and I didn't
*  talk about this but I mean this is more like if democracy is a good problem
*  solving measure then that's a benefit yes as a bonus that's a spin-off as far
*  as I'm concerned what matters to me about democracy is that it gives it
*  puts power in the hand of individual people and that power helps unleash
*  their creativity right the even though science and politics are two very
*  different things the underlying values of allowing people to try different
*  things to be creative to go against the grain sometimes are very very important
*  both for democratic politics and for experimental theoretical sciences right
*  so there's a huge disadvantage that any authoritarian society puts themselves at
*  in a world where scientific and technological progress are important you
*  know China's a big economy they're very very good at making t-shirts and things
*  like that they're not as good as we are here in the United States or in Europe
*  at scientific progress at least not right now maybe they will be but I think
*  that part of it is the spirit of you know letting people be rebellious a
*  little bit goes goes hand-in-hand with the spirit of scientific advancement
*  right you know anyone who thinks that there is some lockstep scientific
*  establishment that is working behind the scenes to squelch their ideas has never
*  been to a physics seminar and listen to people asking questions people are not in lockstep
*  people like to disagree that's important that's you know part of the of the creativity so I mean
*  all I'm adding up to is I don't know I don't know what's going to win out it there's a lot
*  that goes in to these things and a lot of them are random a lot of them are unpredictable so
*  I like democracy I hope it wins more places than it loses but I can't be too sanguine about those
*  things John T says many podcasts often include scientists as guests to speak on controversial
*  topics but the term scientist is vague anyone can claim to be a scientist so as a lay person
*  listening to podcasts with scientists guests how can I distinguish their credibility to
*  speak with genuine authority what heuristics can we use to weight these opinions and protect
*  ourselves against the fallacy of appeals to authority well you know the appealing to authority
*  is a fallacy but it is not useless it's complicated and I think this is the most important first step
*  in answering this question which is very good question is that it's complicated so you use the
*  word heuristics things the right one to use rather than clear-cut algorithm you know when you have
*  people with different expertises and different credentials saying things that you yourself are
*  not an expert in who to believe who to trust whose opinions to weight in different ways is a very
*  hard question and I think that it is completely valid to weight people you know not a hundred
*  percent or not zero percent right to give medium-sized weights to a lot of different
*  things but there are things that matter more so I think I've said things like this before you know
*  Julia Gallif when she was on the podcast she and I talked about this if someone is an world
*  renowned expert in precisely the thing they're talking about count them more than someone who
*  is not that's kind of obvious that's not really very helpful but what does it mean to be a world
*  renowned expert it means more than just you know you got a degree look you know I went to grad
*  school I have a PhD I know other people who got PhDs not all of them are super sharp to be
*  honest some of them are brilliant some of them are not but it's a start you know someone with a
*  PhD in economics you should count more in their opinions about economics than someone without any
*  PhDs at all or any special expertise in economics that's pretty obvious to do but someone can claim
*  to be an expert and maybe even have a PhD but if you want to get more into the weeds what have they
*  accomplished what have they done have they written papers have they you know changed the field by
*  having some good ideas that later turned out to be valid what is their track record right this is
*  the sort of second-order questions you can be asking yourself I think you correctly maybe
*  allude to the idea that if you have a PhD in economics and are propounding on politics or
*  biology or the environment and who cares about your PhD in economics right I mean that's not
*  what what's really going to give you the expertise in this field so you have to care about where their
*  expertise comes from or where their credentials actually come from and finally you know people
*  can be absolutely insightful and correct about ideas where they are not credentialed experts so
*  don't discount people entirely just because they're not experts in the field but weigh their words
*  carefully that's why this is a hard thing to do again what is their track record in other areas
*  you know if you're not a PhD in physics but you're propounding on physics what's your track record
*  what have you gotten right in the past I'm completely willing to believe that there are
*  people out there who don't have PhDs in physics you'd have really interesting things to say about
*  it but I also know for a fact there are people with and without PhDs in physics who say lots of
*  spout lots of nonsense about it so it's just a matter of you know keeping your bearings and
*  not taking anyone too seriously if you don't know what their background and track record is and even
*  if their track record is great they could be messing up this time so you know and I know that's
*  a wishy-washy answer but that's the best you can do right if there's a bunch of people I guess
*  sorry there is one other thing which is crucially important which I which I take for granted
*  sometimes when people do proclaim things okay when they say you know I think X is true regardless
*  of their credentials or their track record the way they say it and the arguments they give in
*  favor of it can also be used as a measure of how seriously to take them in particular the short
*  version of this is what is there what is the evidence that they're giving you that they
*  appreciate why they might be wrong that they understand the counter arguments to it right if
*  they are just straw manning the counter arguments or if they're just sort of snarky and sarcastic
*  or if they show no sign that they even know what the counter arguments are then you should
*  discount what they're saying compared to people who go I know what you're thinking you're gonna
*  think it's not true because of this but here's why it's true anyway right and and this kind of
*  technique is just as true for research papers in the technical literature in the professional
*  literature as it is for people expounding on podcasts and things like that when people know
*  why they might be wrong it's much more worth listening to what they're trying to say because
*  you can you can think that those people have thought through what the different arguments
*  are rather than just falling in love with one point of view and stating it okay Alexander
*  Cordova says when discussing quantum mechanics the example that is always used is the electron
*  however it's also stated that everything is quantum in nature at a small enough scale do
*  protons neutrons have wave functions as well sure everything has wave functions that's the
*  easy part let me just explain a little bit about why the electron is always used as the example
*  it's sort of a combination of two things one is the electron is as far as we know elementary it
*  is not made of other particles so protons and neutrons are made of quarks and gluons right so
*  that just makes things a little bit fuzzier when you talk about protons and neutrons it's
*  actually perfectly okay to in some circumstances treat protons and neutrons as fundamental
*  particles in other circumstances it's not right you have to take into account that internal
*  structure so it becomes more complicated whereas electrons as far as we know just are fundamental
*  particles so that complication doesn't get in the way the other is electrons are the lightest
*  charged particles in nature they are the lightest particles that have electric charge electrons
*  and positrons which are the antiparticles so what that means is that since electromagnetism
*  is really the force of nature that makes everyday world go electrons are doing most of the work
*  right electrons are easy to manipulate electricity is mostly the motion of electrons because
*  electrons are lighter than protons and neutrons you know in principle electrons going left is
*  equivalent protons going right but it caused it create it requires a lot more energy to get
*  protons going right than electrons going left so in practice when you have electricity going
*  down a wire the electrons are doing almost all the work so that's why they're used as the example
*  in quantum mechanics it's easy to manipulate electrons compared to protons or neutrons but
*  everything has a wave function don't worry about that Paul cousin or cousin says Thibault Giraud
*  a French youtuber recently did an experiment on his philosophy channel Monsieur Phi or Phi I don't
*  know how French people pronounce the Greek letter Phi I don't know how Greeks pronounce the Greek
*  letter Phi for that matter he surveyed 12,000 of his viewers with carefully corrected thought
*  experiments about free will and morality as an example of an interesting and somewhat surprising
*  result around 80% were intuitive compatibilists what do you think about the idea of experimental
*  philosophy you know I don't think it's philosophy I think it's an interesting thing to do but it's
*  more like you're learning about psychology you're not learning about philosophy you know I like to
*  think that ideas in philosophy whether it's free will compatibilism or anything else stand and fall
*  on the reasons for them not on a poll not on a popularity contest I do think that anti free will
*  people sometimes fall into the trap of saying well you know this or that maybe pro compatibilist
*  free will people too I don't know but anyway people sometimes fall into the trap of saying
*  that's not what the people really have in mind when you say free will okay I don't know what
*  the people have in mind like that's not an important consideration for me I'm just trying
*  to get the most useful vocabulary to discuss the world I want to be right and I want to sort of
*  figure out how best to characterize the fact that human beings make decisions okay I find
*  talking about free will for that purpose is perfectly valid if you don't that's fine and
*  I honestly couldn't care less what the majority of people have in mind as long as we can be clear in
*  fact my strategy it is not it is completely failed so far but strategy I'm going to keep trying to
*  plug away at is whenever someone really wants to have a discussion about free will I'm gonna say
*  you know I tried this with Sam Harris it didn't work with him either I'm gonna say I'm happy to
*  do that as long as we never use the phrase free will because as soon as you use the phrase free
*  will you have this incredibly long tedious boring and completely pointless conversation about what
*  do you mean by free will so just don't use that phrase if you can't agree on what it means just
*  don't use it use what words would actually convey the meaning that you have and I'm perfectly happy
*  to do that all right Connor Scott says I know the Schrodinger equation doesn't predict wave
*  function collapse but it definitely predicts wave function branching sorry does it definitively
*  predict wave function branching in the case where there is no collapse is that something everyone
*  can agree on there are so few things that everyone can agree on in this game they can agree on what
*  the Schrodinger equation predicts in terms of given some wave function and given some Hamiltonian
*  what does the Schrodinger equation say that wave function evolves into but you use the word
*  branching in your question so for example if you have an electron that's in a superposition of
*  spin up and spin down and you run it through Stern-Gerlach experiment where there's a detector
*  and an environment and so forth everyone agrees that the wave function of the universe if all it
*  does is obey the Schrodinger equation would evolve into a part that says the electron was spin up it
*  was measured to be spin up and the environment noticed that plus a part that said the electron
*  was spin down the detector measured it to be spin down and the environment noticed that I can't
*  promise you that everyone is going to be happy to call those two parts of the wave function branches
*  there's an argument that goes into saying there's a reason why we should call this branches as to
*  with decoherence and the independence of the future evolution of these two parts of the wave
*  function the fact they won't interfere with each other etc but everyone agrees that the
*  Schrodinger equation predicts that that's what a wave function should looks like that's why
*  people who believe the Copenhagen interpretation or something like that don't accept the Schrodinger
*  equation to describe quantum measurements because they don't believe in those two parts of the wave
*  function still surviving that measurement event Julian Reif says Carlo Rovelli wrote in wrote
*  the following about many worlds interpretation in his new book Helgoland it is not enough to know
*  the wave function in Schrodinger's equation or to define and use quantum theory we need to specify
*  an algebra of observables otherwise we cannot calculate anything and there is no relation with
*  the phenomena of our experience the role of this algebra of observables which is extremely clear in
*  other interpretations is not at all clear in the many worlds interpretation what do you think about
*  this criticism yeah I think it's not a criticism I think it's just a statement you know as a many
*  worlds proponent so I would agree with the claim the algebra of observables the role the algebra
*  is a role of the algebra of observables is extremely clear in other interpretations not and it's less
*  clear in many worlds why because in all the other interpretations you put the algebra in there by
*  hand you know you add extra superstructure whereas many worlds is the simplest cleanest
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics so when it comes to things like observables just like things
*  like branching and probabilities and so forth you have to derive them they're emergent you don't
*  just put them in by hand so it's less clear in many worlds because it's more work and this is
*  something where I think any fair observer would say this kind of feature of many worlds is both
*  an advantage and a disadvantage of the theory it's an advantage because rather than just positing
*  something people who believe in many worlds are saying we can derive that thing it's a disadvantage
*  because maybe you can't derive that thing maybe you think you can and you're just fooling yourself
*  and it's more work to show it right so I mean I take the the worry very very seriously the paper
*  I wrote just last year with Ashmeet Singh on quantum mereology tackles exactly this problem
*  of showing how the algebra of observables arises in the many worlds interpretation of quantum
*  mechanics I think we have a pretty good explanation of why it does so I'm not that worried but I but
*  you know I want to agree with the problem and then I want to say yeah but we can solve it and
*  solving it is good right that's that's what we're here for so by all means criticize away
*  especially those criticisms that I have answers to that sounds good Richard McClay says I recently
*  listened to a somewhat frustrating podcast on postmodernism and post truth what are your thoughts
*  on the existence of objective truth so I don't know why your podcast you listen to is frustrating
*  so that I'm not sure what side it was frustrating on look I believe in objective truth in the
*  following sense I believe in objective reality I believe that there is a world that objectively
*  exists out there you know that we're part of okay and that there are certain statements we can imagine
*  making about the world which would be correct and certain ones that would be incorrect about the
*  physical behavior of that world okay on the other hand I'm more pro postmodernism than most other
*  scientists or physicists in particular and part of it is that you know physicists are not that
*  patient with a whole bunch of things you know physicists I think this is gonna come back later
*  in the AMA also maybe but we talked already about intellectuals and this idea being intellectual
*  being devoted to truth it is related to but not the same as being broad-ranging in the kinds of
*  truth you care about right so you can be very very devoted to finding the kind of truth in
*  your particular field and or your your subject of interest and just less interested in other
*  fields that's a perfectly valid thing to do again no one forces you to be wide-ranging in
*  those ways and in fact a lot of the yeah this will come back I should have grouped these two
*  questions together this will we will come back to this later in the AMA but a lot of the you know
*  attitudes of physicists towards other fields are because they're different than physics right they
*  they go by different standards they use different techniques and so forth and postmodernism in
*  particular you know pushes physicists buttons pushes scientists buttons in all sorts of bad
*  ways and also just a you know layer on more throat clearing here there's a lot of bad
*  postmodernism out there it's not hard to find people just saying very very silly things in
*  the name of postmodernism but I'm not interested in the bad postmodernism you know I want to ask
*  is there any good postmodernism is that any useful and I think that there is there's a point
*  there's an insight an essential insight in the postmodern project which is that even if the
*  world exists and is objective we don't know it clearly and objectively and in an unmediated way
*  right we are tiny finite biased beings and so even though we exist in the world the stories
*  that we tell about the world whether they're literally stories or whether they're highly
*  developed in the highly rigorous physics theories are partial attempts to capture a bit of the world
*  and we should be very they're very fallibleistic right we should be willing to change them when
*  new data comes in and when it comes to physics that insight is kind of trivial not very helpful
*  right you know sure well if new experiments come in that tell us to change our theories we should
*  do that right but we're pretty sure that you know apples will still fall from trees no matter
*  what we learn about gravity a hundred years in the future or a million years in the future when
*  you turn it to things that postmodernists more typically care about which is the social world
*  and supposed truths of ethics or morality or society or politics or literature or art as we
*  talked about art before then the fact that these truths are fallible and partial is much more
*  important to keep in mind because you can be fooled much more easily when you talk about these
*  harder areas than when you talk about physics physics is easy it's easy to do experiments to
*  find out whether you're right or wrong it is it is easier in other areas to fall into a trap that
*  you think you got things figured out that you have a way of talking about the world that is just
*  correct even though you're actually embedded in a web of presuppositions that should be questioned
*  right and I think that's the usefulness of postmodernism that that postmodernism gives
*  you a toolkit for questioning these presuppositions for saying that well you know I know that sounds
*  like some objective truth about the world but have you thought of this right that's that's the good
*  variety of postmodernism post truth I'm not even sure what that means I think that the phrase
*  post truth is almost always used as a slander against people you don't like right like I don't
*  see anyone really who is you know positively in favor of post truth I don't see anyone making
*  the case that truth is overrated and we should get rid of it you know not any sensible people
*  there's always crazy people out there but the idea that truth is an idea that has outlived its
*  usefulness is really not one that is gaining a lot of currency among smart people in the world
*  today usually the accusation of being post truth is made against your enemies to say that they are
*  distorting the truth in some way or another and again that absolutely happens especially when it
*  comes to politics and activism right when your first loyalty is to a political goal rather than
*  an intellectual goal then you will often end up distorting the truth and everything I just said
*  applies equally well no matter which side of the political spectrum you are on but but I think it's
*  a bit lazy and useless that particular accusation this post truth accusation because it misreads
*  what people are trying to do because I don't think that people describe themselves as post
*  truth usually so what they how they would describe themselves which is always what I think we should
*  be asking you know what is the people who really believe this what is their self-understanding they
*  might have different ways of finding the truth and judging the truth then you do they might count
*  different pieces of evidence and weigh them differently than you do and that doesn't mean
*  that they're not wrong in a real objective sense but if they're wrong confront them on why they're
*  wrong be honest about it you know what is the evidence where are they going wrong where are
*  they making the mistake to just sort of say well you're not even aiming for the truth I think is
*  just a kind of lazy criticism that is rhetorically beneficial to your side but again it's that
*  activist mindset rather than an intellectual mindset in my mind and again all of that everything
*  I just said is usually but of course there's plenty of exceptions out there Casey Mahone says given
*  that all branches of the wave function are equally real there would be presumably some bizarre
*  unexplainable things happening in some branches a car passing through a wall an elephant appearing
*  out of thin air etc given the enormous number of times the wave function branches every second is
*  it possible that some of these freaky events have occurred in the history of our own branch
*  thus accounting for some ghost stories or other bizarre phenomena so as I said before whenever
*  a question starts with is it possible the answer is usually gonna be yes it's possible but look you
*  have to just ask this question a little more careful you have to think it through yes in the
*  branches of the wave function in ever writing quantum mechanics some unlikely things will happen
*  and many things happen in the world and you want to say okay there's a number less than one the
*  probability of some unlikely event and then there's a number of times that we look at events okay so
*  you have some big number the number of times you look at events times some small number the likelihood
*  of each unlikely event and you want to say therefore when you multiply these two numbers
*  together is it likely that unlikely events happened okay but you haven't quantified what either one of
*  those are here and roughly the answer is that the unlikely events are really really unlikely so
*  unlikely that even if a lot of events happen you're not gonna see that many very very unlikely events
*  so in quantum mechanics there are events like I put the coffee cup on the table and in quantum
*  tunnels right through what is the likelihood of this happening and you can say like look there's
*  been a lot of coffee cups put on tables throughout human history surely it should have happened well
*  no if the probability of the number of coffee cups have been put on tables is I don't know 10 to the
*  20 that's way bigger than the actual number but okay that's a lot of coffee cups being put on
*  tables but the chances that the coffee cup tunnels through the table is 10 to the minus a million
*  which is a very which actually overestimates the probability for it happening so what this means is
*  that no you can't just go qualitatively from some unlikely things are gonna happen to probably they
*  explain things it's way easier to explain ghost stories by saying people mistook what they saw
*  late at night in the dark that's a way easier explanation than invoking the many-worlds
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics okay David Frank says if you were Darrell Maury former mindscape
*  guest and president of operations for the Philadelphia 76ers what would you do with Ben
*  Simmons this offseason I know not everyone here is a basketball fan but I thought this was an
*  interesting enough question to address because it you know the reason why I thought it's fun to
*  have Darrell on the podcast is because deciding what to do as a general manager in a basketball
*  situation is it completely analogous to a whole bunch of other very real-world decision problems
*  that we make the difference is that in basketball or in other professional sports just like in poker
*  which we've also talked about the results are very quantitative and very quick right so you can be a
*  little bit more careful about saying well you know should I make this decision or should I make that
*  decision in the real world when it's like should I get married or should I not get married it's
*  hard to know whether you made the right decision or not because it's hard to see what would have
*  happened in the other choice so Ben Simmons is the point guard all-star basketball player young
*  player still 24 years old for the Philadelphia 76ers he did not perform well in the playoffs
*  this year I think that is safe to say he is a very polarizing figure among NBA fans because you
*  know the basic thing in basketball all you need to know is you put the ball in the basket to score
*  points and the team that scores the most points wins so that sounds like there's only one thing
*  that happens as you put the ball in the basket but the other thing that happens is that you stop the
*  other team from putting the ball in the basket but the it's way easier to be quantitative and
*  judgmental about people's ability to score to shoot the basketball to put the ball in the basket
*  than it is other things playing defense passing rebounding and so forth and the reason why Ben
*  Simmons is so polarizing is because he's clearly super duper talented but he's he's absolutely super
*  world-class at everything but putting the ball in the basket the one skill set especially for the
*  point guard the guy who runs the offense the one skill set that is really really important and very
*  easy to see when it's on display is shooting the ball and Ben Simmons is not any good at that and
*  and some of it is who knows why I mean some of it is psychological some of it is just that he wants
*  to do other things and is actually quite smart about it some of it people claim that he shoots
*  with his left hand even though he's naturally right-handed which is true but you know can you
*  overcome that so there's a lot going on Simmons is very good at passing very good at running very
*  good at defending he's arguably the best defender in the NBA how do you value a player like that so
*  that's a good question yeah I really don't know you know I think that the the reason why sports
*  fans are sometimes very annoying to read online or even to talk to is that they ask questions like
*  this what would you do with Ben Simmons this offseason knowing perfectly well you know the
*  options are you keep him on the team but you try to like smooth over those rough edges get him to
*  shoot more get him better at shooting etc or you trade him but to trade him requires another team
*  to offer you something in return and in fact Ben Simmons is very valued around the league people
*  will offer you something in return but they know everyone else knows that he didn't do that great
*  in the playoffs that the fans are sort of grumbling about his playoff performance etc so maybe the
*  other general managers are not gonna offer fair value you just don't know you know I'm a as a
*  basketball fan I'm a fan I'm not the general manager I don't I don't have a say in what happens
*  so I tend to root for my players right like you know it might be true look I mean the short version
*  is if you could get a trade that you could get Damien Lillard on the Sixers in favor of Ben
*  Simmons I would do it I was sort of do it right away I don't know if that's a possible thing to
*  do if we don't trade Ben Simmons and keep him on the team then I would actually be perfectly happy
*  with that he's really really good player I don't want to trade him for worse players just for the
*  sake of saying that we did something so we'll see what happens you know I'm glad I'm not Darrell
*  Maury in this particular case but it'll be an interesting offseason Sixers fans I'm gonna group
*  a couple of questions together here they're all about expanding space so one is from nuzzle
*  Fuzzle Torson pill of the satanic temple I think some of you people are editing your names just to
*  get me to say them out loud in these AMAs question is it's my understanding that the
*  universe has a kind of resolution of plonk size as the universe expands is the plonk size ever
*  so slightly increasing to or is the universe increasing the amount of to put it in a cutesy
*  way plonkies William Garrett says since matter including ourselves is mostly empty space and
*  the universe seems to be expanding are we expanding with it is subatomic space expanding
*  similarly to outer space and then Paul Hardy says I read an article suggesting that inflation
*  theory might mean that space has been expanding forever I've also heard that space might not be
*  fundamental are these two ideas contradictory so there's a bunch of ideas that are similar in
*  these three questions even though they're different one thing that I do want to emphasize is that the
*  res the don't believe that the universe has a resolution of the plonk scale that is not the
*  right way to think about the plonk scale so the plonk scale is a measure of length there's also
*  the plonk time the plonk energy plonk mass etc that you get from combining Newton's constant of
*  gravity plonks constant of quantum mechanics and the speed of light I think that the correct way
*  to interpret that is if you have processes in physics that in some sense are happening at the
*  plonk scale so in other words things that are squeezed down into lengths smaller than the plonk
*  length or processes that happen faster than the plonk time or collisions that exchange more than
*  the plonk energy right in any one of these cases examples then you will have to take into account
*  gravity relativity and quantum mechanics because all those constants are in that formula for these
*  different length scales what does it mean to take into account gravity relativity and quantum
*  mechanics nobody knows really okay it does not mean that there's that little pixels of plonk
*  volume or anything like that maybe that's true but maybe that's not true we don't really know
*  enough about quantum gravity to actually say so the question about you know is the plonk size
*  increasing no it's not as far as we know that's a formula in terms of these constants of nature
*  and those constants don't seem to be changing over time there's a different version of this
*  question that is related to what Paul says you know I've also heard that space might not be
*  fundamental are these two ideas contradictory so if space emerges from quantum entanglement of
*  abstract degrees of freedom as we were talking about earlier then there's actually a really
*  nice way of thinking about the expansion of the universe namely that there's a certain number
*  of fundamental degrees of freedom that come together to form to describe any one region of
*  space and what happens as the universe expands is not that more space is created which would be
*  this sort of traditional classical way of thinking about it but rather more degrees of freedom are
*  becoming entangled so you imagine you know there's a collection of quantum mechanical degrees of
*  freedom they're all entangled with each other and making up space or space-time and there's
*  a separate bucket of degrees of freedom that are not entangled in some well-defined way there's
*  subtleties and there's math there that I'm glossing over but hopefully the image comes through and that
*  what you mean by the expansion of the universe is more and more of these unentangled degrees of
*  freedom are becoming entangled and space appears to expand I actually wrote about that in a paper
*  that I wrote with some other you know collaborators called quantum circuit cosmology it was a very vague
*  suggestion at the time so we don't have any you know tangible things to do with that picture but
*  it's very attractive to me in terms of understanding the relationship between entanglement and
*  expanding universes and then for Williams question about is the universe expanding are we expanding
*  or subatomic space expanding no that's easy no it's not because I think I said this elsewhere
*  but the fact that space is expanding is an exaggeration parts of space are expanding and
*  in fact when you go really deep into the math of it it's impossible to attach definite ideas
*  of where space is expanding and where it isn't what it is possible to say is that this particular
*  galaxy is further away from us now than it used to be it takes longer for light to get there and
*  to get back and but within a gravitationally bound system like a galaxy or a planet or a person
*  there's no expansion of space going on it's only the regions in between the galaxies that are
*  actually expanding okay then there's a bunch of questions about entropy and I think I'm gonna
*  group them into three groups entropy questions the first is these two questions one from Ken
*  Close who says you've demonstrated entropy by mixing cream and coffee there are interesting
*  swirls before we reach reach maximum entropy but I tried the experiment and about a day later the
*  cream had risen to the top the mixture had been unmixed I don't think you should leave out your
*  cream and coffee for over a day but I get I know I do know what you're talking about Ken and then
*  relatedly Richard Graff says my understanding from discussions on mindscape is that there are
*  two definitions of entropy one subjective that measures an observer's knowledge of a system and
*  one objective that measures the disorder of a system how are these two definitions related so
*  let me answer the second one first there there's actually many different definitions of entropy
*  more than just two but there are there is a fundamental distinction and I wouldn't put it
*  exactly the way that you did but I know why you're putting it that way so one way of thinking about
*  entropy is as you say characterizing our observers knowledge of a system so if you have a system that
*  could be given your knowledge in any one of several states right I mean you can think about
*  the cream and the coffee for example you're not knowing exactly where the individual atoms are of
*  water or molecules of cream or coffee etc. so you can rearrange them to get a system that looks the
*  same so you assign some probability distribution to all the specific microscopic arrangements of
*  the atoms and then from that there's a formula that Boltzmann and Gibbs and others developed to
*  calculate the entropy okay so that is manifestly a definition that is talking about your knowledge
*  there's another way which is also subjective in a very real sense but seems more objective which
*  is before you look at the cup of coffee decide ahead of time what you are able to see okay so
*  there's certain things you can observe about the system certain things that are macroscopically
*  accessible to us and chunk up the set of all microstates into macrostates saying that if two
*  macros to if two microstates are in the same macrostate then they must be observably
*  indistinguishable they look the same to you okay so that once you do that once you decide what your
*  observables are then you have a objective chunking of the space of all possible states into
*  macrostates and then what you can say is you can assign an entropy which is basically the size of
*  a macrostate it's actually the logarithm of the size of a macrostate given that you know that the
*  system is in a certain kind of macrostate you can assign an entropy to it no matter what you know
*  about it no matter what you know about the microstate okay so it's not that you don't even if
*  you know the microstate if it's in a big macrostate you can still assign a large entropy to it so
*  that's kind of quasi objective quasi subjective the the subjective step was you defined macrostates
*  the objective part is once you define that there's an entropy that you can associate with every
*  microstate how are they related in the obvious way and namely that if your subjective knowledge
*  of the system is precisely that it's in a certain macrostate and nothing more so then you put a
*  probability distribution on all the different microstates which is equal probability for every
*  possible microstate in that macrostate and zero probability for not being in that macrostate and
*  then the two entropy formulas coincide they give you the same answer so they're compatible in that
*  sense now Ken's asking about the cream and the coffee and that's because this is of course very
*  very possible you don't even need to use cream and coffee right try to mix oil and water do your best
*  they quickly unmix much less than a day it takes and that's just because you know we're being a
*  little sloppy about the detailed interactions of the different molecules in the system okay so for
*  cream and coffee it's even more subtle but oil and water work better oil molecules often have a
*  hydrophilic component and a hydrophobic component so given all the different ways given a certain
*  energy in the system it will often happen that secretly the highest entropy states have the cream
*  and the oil in the water separated from each other likewise for the cream and coffee when you're in a
*  gravitational field and so forth and the molecules have different weights it can be the case that the
*  highest entropy states at a certain temperature and so forth are with the cream and the coffee
*  are separate from each other because they're different kinds of things so a better example
*  would be if you had you know red balls and blue balls in a big box of gas with their masses and
*  their interaction properties exactly the same but just different colors then they would really want
*  to mix together so all of these typical things are just supposed to be ways of getting you to
*  get your brain around the idea of things mixing together but when you use as is often true in the
*  real world actual substances the real physics can be more complicated than that okay the next group
*  of questions about entropy Travis Hink says PBS space-time did a video explaining how the growth
*  of quantum entanglement drives the inexorable increase of entropy we see in the macroscopic
*  world my question is why was there an initial state where the particles were not maximally
*  entangled Nicholas Weiberg says is there a close relationship between quantum coherence and the
*  increase of entropy both seem to be related to the arrow of time and both seem to involve
*  statistical system descriptions Michelle Vincenzi says did the Big Bang create the universe the
*  multiverse or was it already going if it was already going would it be right to assume that
*  we got different Big Bangs in each universe or even universes with no big bang at all or some
*  completely different process and Kathy Seeger says in your conversation on the podcast with
*  Max Tecmark you both agreed on giving more credence to an ever-ready in multiverse than to a cosmological
*  multiverse to exist I wondered if when the Big Bang started off the universal wave function also
*  kicked in right from the start wouldn't it be likely that branching already affected very very
*  early states of the evolving universe and therefore in the process creating multiverses in the
*  cosmological sense so hopefully the connection there is clear those are four questions sorry
*  about the length there the first two were explicitly about quantum entanglement and entropy
*  the second two were about the initial conditions of the universe and those that's very related to
*  this question of entropy so very quickly you know Travis you say that PBS space-time did a video
*  explaining how the growth of quantum entanglement drives the inexorable increase of entropy we see
*  in the macro world I don't think that's true actually it you know as I said just for the
*  previous question there's more than one or more than two definitions of entropy and indeed one
*  of the other definitions of entropy is a strictly quantum definition that John von Neumann invented
*  a fourth definition is from Claude Shannon in the process in the context of information theory but
*  quantum entropy sometimes called von Neumann entropy or entanglement entropy has to do with
*  the entanglement between different quantum systems and the formula for that entropy turns out to be
*  the same as the formula that Boltzmann invented in the completely different classical context but
*  the point is that quantum entropy exists it's important for things like decoherence this is
*  Nicholas's question quantum entropy of one system increases when that system becomes entangled with
*  the outside world and of course the most famous example that is decoherence when you become
*  entangled with the environment your total entanglement goes up so your total entropy goes up so to
*  Nicholas's question is there a close relationship between quantum decoherence and the increase of
*  entropy yes that's it quantum decoherence necessarily increases the entropy of a system as
*  long as you don't like collapse the wave function and reset that that can lower the entropy but to
*  Travis's question that quantum entropy is a form of entry but it's a different form of entropy than
*  the classical entropy when you're mixing cream into coffee and you say entropy goes up or when
*  you shuffle a deck of playing cards and you say entropy goes up that has nothing to do with quantum
*  entanglement right there okay that's just a classical notion of entropy so these are different
*  notions of entropy both very important and then your question about the initial state you know
*  why did everything start out unentangled this is related to the later two questions and the
*  answer is I don't know no one knows that is a big big question in fact we're gonna have a podcast
*  coming up about this soon but the point being that that's a major unanswered question in
*  cosmology why did the early universe have a special state which can be described as low entropy or
*  maximally entangled I would like no I have theories you know I proposed a model with Jennifer Chen
*  16 years ago now or something like that where baby universes help understand it but I don't
*  know if that's true or not that it's it's one of my favorite ideas but it's a it's an open question
*  so to Michelle or Bichelle sorry I don't know question would it be right to assume that we
*  got different big bangs in each universe and you know and then Cathy's question is related to that
*  you know is there branching that gives you different parts of the multiverse so these
*  are questions about the fact that the early universe had a special initial state that's
*  an empirical fact mostly an empirical fact there's some subtleties there sorry about that but it's
*  a fact it's a true thing the initial state of our observable universe seems to be special let's
*  put it that way and the cosmological multiverse is a different conceptual idea than the ever ready
*  in many worlds ever any many worlds are caused by branching of the wave function and they're
*  literally full copies of the whole universe that can happen right in this room right away right
*  when I measure a spin or something like that whereas the cosmological multiverse is an
*  essentially classical concept that says that far away there are regions of space where conditions
*  look very different so different that you might as well call it another universe but you're right
*  you're both right in this implication here which is that these two notions can be connected imagine
*  that you have a wave function that branches so you're creating an ever ready in many worlds kind
*  of situation but different branches have different local laws of physics now normally that's not what
*  happens right that is not inherent in the many worlds interpretation at all but it could happen
*  if the events that are causing branching are the kinds of events that lead to the cosmological
*  multiverse namely bouncing around from one vacuum state in a landscape of possible vacuum states in
*  a more modern theory like string theory or extra dimensions or something like that so this is an
*  idea and you can look up I don't remember what it was called but I did a blog post about it years
*  ago this idea was actually pursued in two different papers that came out near the same time one by
*  and one by Leonard's huskin and Raphael Busso and both of them pointed out that you could sort of
*  combine the many worlds idea with the cosmological multiverse and say that in different branches you
*  had effectively different parts of the cosmological multiverse I think that's right that sounds right
*  to me it didn't you know take the world by storm because it's not clear what to do with it exactly
*  it's not clear that you solved any problems by pointing this out it seems to be a true feature
*  but it doesn't help you explain why the early universe had low entropy or why our universe
*  looks the way it does but maybe it's you know something to keep in mind when you're thinking
*  about cosmology and entropy and the Big Bang and the multiverse and all that stuff okay I have one
*  more group the third group of entropy questions one it's from Nick G who says where does entropy
*  and the second law of thermodynamics fit into the fundamentalness hierarchy is it just an emergent
*  phenomenon that isn't exactly written into the source code of the universe or is it something
*  deeper and more fundamental and Paul Torek says Nick G's question about where entropy fits into
*  the fundamentalness hierarchy inspires my question do we even need a fundamentalness hierarchy or is
*  it just a matter of which order of presentation of facts we find explanatory and or which statements
*  of laws and boundary conditions are simpler or is the latter all that is meant by fundamental so
*  let me talk a little bit about my view of this fundamentalness hierarchy and then hopefully that
*  will illuminate both questions the idea of a fundamentalist hierarchy is an old one I mean at
*  least Auguste Comte who I think was mostly interested in sociology talked about this over a
*  hundred years ago and it's also very natural we sort of take it for granted all the time you know
*  you're a human being you're an individual an organism all by yourself you're a part of bigger
*  structures you're a part of a society you're part of the whole earth and you're also made of smaller
*  structures you're made of organs your organs are made of cells the cells are made of molecules made
*  of particles etc so there's kind of an obvious hierarchy and I do think it's more or less
*  objective in that big things are made of little things in the universe as we see it now I don't
*  think that that's necessary if we if we sit back and think about all the different possible laws
*  of physics that we could imagine ways the universe could be put together is it necessary that no
*  matter what kind of source code we started with would we always end up with some kind of
*  fundamentalness hierarchy no I don't think that's necessarily true it's a feature of there's a
*  couple of ingredients that go into it the most important of which is locality right that there
*  is something called space that there are objects located in space and they tend to bump into each
*  other when they're nearby and not when they're far away that's the fundamental feature of the
*  world that didn't have to be there there are other ways of thinking about worlds which wouldn't have
*  that feature but that enables this feature of conglomeration of small things into bigger things
*  but there's an additional feature over and above that which is that there is something real about
*  treating collections of many small things as things in and of themselves right so in other words we
*  take the world and we divide it up into things and that's sort of a not an innocent move there's you
*  can question why do you divide it up into this set of things so I forget exactly the example that
*  I've heard but the collection of atoms in your body come together to form you and it makes sense
*  to talk about you why well because it has some causal role in the world I can make statements
*  like you went there you did this if I tell you this you will act in a certain way there's a
*  higher level theory of where you fit into things right whereas if I make some collective object
*  consisting of your left foot and this cup of coffee and that oak tree out there that's an object I can
*  define right but it doesn't have any role in the world there's no theory in which that collection
*  of things has an autonomous existence or useful way of talking about it so there is something real
*  even though it's convenient for us to talk about these higher level emergent phenomena there are
*  right and wrong ways of doing it right there are there are better and worse ways of dividing the
*  world into objects and that goes back into Nick's question the second law of thermodynamics is not
*  fundamental if you were Laplace's demon or the quantum mechanical equivalent thereof if you knew
*  exactly the microstate of the universe you wouldn't have to do any of this coarse graining or thinking
*  about our ignorance you wouldn't have any ignorance so you wouldn't have any entropy to deal with but
*  the fact that there is a useful concept called entropy that has causal explanatory power right
*  we can explain things going on in the universe by talking about entropy increasing etc. means that
*  there is some reality to that concept so it's not fundamental but it is real right that's that's
*  what I that's my point of view on emergent phenomena more generally so hopefully that helps
*  with those questions okay enough about entropy there Allison says could Krasnikov tubes permanent
*  superluminal tunnels in principle be used to construct galaxy-sized telescopes I don't know
*  I guess maybe I presume I had something in mind to say about this question when I when I kept it
*  in the list of things I'm trying to answer but you know this is the kind of thing I mean maybe
*  this is what I wanted to say the space of speculative ideas that naturally suggest themselves
*  to human beings is very different and potentially unconnected to the space of speculative ideas that
*  could be true in other words you know the way I think of it is you know think about old science
*  fiction right hundred-year-old science fiction they got some things right space travel is true
*  right we all now have portable communication devices but they missed other things right they
*  missed the fact that we don't have faster-than-light travel they didn't miss that but you know many of
*  them just let themselves helped themselves to faster-than-light travel whereas no one really
*  invented the internet or something like that and very few went into sort of modern synthetic
*  biology or things like that so the our ability to predict real-world scientific advances is
*  uneven why well one of the reasons why is because the kinds of advances that it's easy to predict
*  are taking things we already do and imagine we can do them better we already a hundred years ago
*  we could fly we had cars we even had airplanes right we could make you know small things that
*  go through the air so it's just easy to extrapolate them to faster things and things that go further
*  away etc whereas a conceptually new category like the internet is harder to imagine so when
*  you say you know permanent superluminal tunnels they're not gonna exist honestly like in the real
*  world that's just not going to happen if you did but but they're the kinds of things that we are
*  tempted to imagine because we can already go pretty fast and it's easy to imagine going
*  arbitrarily fast I don't exactly see you might be getting at some issue with the telescope question
*  I'm not quite sure why a superluminal tunnel would help us build a telescope but I just did want to
*  say that's not the way that I would spend my money honestly if I were thinking or even spend
*  my time thinking about possible future technologies okay Michael Lesniak says I first became familiar
*  with you on science channel shows like through the wormhole and I'm curious how did the interview
*  process for shows like that go who contacted who and how come I haven't seen you on any more recent
*  shows like that well for the recent shows question I think that maybe this actually goes to the first
*  part of the question the process is very informal about being contacted like someone looks you up
*  in fact yeah let me let me back up and explain how these shows are very often made different shows
*  are made in different ways like a PBS show a Nova show will very often be based on a book or something
*  like that when Brian Greene does his elegant universe books or something like that then turns
*  them into a Nova series he's very involved in what is going on but for history channel shows or science
*  channel shows or discovery channel shows the process is different and often it's not a very
*  good process through the wormhole was one of the better examples but here is the basic process the
*  TV network hires a production company to make a show through the wormhole or the universe or
*  mysteries of the universe or whatever the production company hires a director or producer
*  sort of be in charge of the particular show and that director producer hires writers what does
*  that mean you hire some people who are TV writers they work for the production company and their job
*  is to come up with an episode and maybe there is some brainstorming among some people about what
*  the topic of the episode should be let's say the black hole information loss puzzle okay and then
*  this writer or you know production assistant or some other sets of people the producer themselves
*  goes on the internet googles around looks for experts especially looks for experts nearby this
*  is why living in Los Angeles is very helpful if you want to be on these TV shows and says you know
*  who can I talk to about this and so they will sketch out you know from Wikipedia and other
*  things you know other videos they see on YouTube they'll sketch out their idea of what the good
*  things to talk about are and get some ideas of who they might want to talk to and then they might
*  call you up and interview you and decide whether they want to have you on camera or not but the
*  point is that none of the people involved in that are scientists right they interview the
*  scientist once they get on camera but the writing and the organizing the deciding what to do on the
*  show is rarely guided by people who are knowledgeable about science and so the individual segments are
*  often perfectly respectable but the overall vision of where to go is not there because there's no
*  one really scientifically informed guiding it they don't hire a scientist to do that kind of thing
*  so and that sometimes leads to embarrassing things like I was once doing a demonstration
*  for one of these TV shows about dark matter and I think I've told this story before but I was asked
*  to you know spin a light bulb above my head and they were gonna put special effects in there so
*  light bulb would light up etc and this was supposed to be dark matter and so I asked am I representing
*  the dark matter and the thing zooming around me is supposed to be like a star or something that is
*  feeling my gravitational field and the people filming me honestly didn't know there have been
*  so many steps in between when someone came up with the idea for this analogy and when we got
*  to filming it that the meaning of it had been lost right and that can happen sometimes but in
*  other times the shows turn out really well I'm if you get the impression I think it would be
*  better if a lot of these shows took the scientific side more seriously and actually let scientists
*  be involved but that would involve money and things like that so who knows whether that will
*  ever happen why haven't I been on any more recent shows like that I have been on a couple but not
*  that many partly you know it's just a small number of statistics about when you get invited
*  partly there's a pandemic partly I've been busy so sometimes I've had to say no when I get invited
*  to do these things it's a weird thing you know you reach a lot of people but you don't have a
*  lot of control over what's being said as I get older and grumpier I like to have more control
*  over what's being said Paul Hess says is a nation of millions of people conscious
*  uh rough answer is no I don't think so uh but it's an interesting question and you can ask it
*  at different levels of precision you know I think that you know if you look into things like
*  into uh what is it called integrated information theory IIT uh this idea of Giulio Tononi and
*  collaborators where they try to actually answer this question precisely they they propose a measure
*  that is quantitative uh they can sort of pinpoint the level of emergence at which you would call
*  something conscious the idea of being they say you have a mob of people if they're just acting
*  randomly and differently than each individual person is conscious but sometimes you get mob
*  behavior where in some sense it makes more sense to attach the locus of consciousness to the mob
*  rather than to any individual inside it I don't think that that's very helpful in the case of a
*  nation of millions of people we do it all the time we do the equivalent thing because we attach
*  beliefs desires attitudes uh psychologies to countries of people um but it's it's often just
*  a shorthand for what should be a more nuanced way of talking about things we don't have the once
*  and for all definition of consciousness so I'm not quite sure um if we can carefully answer this
*  question at all but I think that roughly speaking my answer is tentatively no okay Jeff B asks a
*  priority question remember the priority questions are once in your life you get to answer a priority
*  question I promise to answer it to the best of my ability uh sometimes my ability is not very good
*  so be careful about how you ask your priority question so Jeff's question is the question
*  boils down to how a waving field ends up getting detected as a dot on a detector screen your
*  previous answer was basically local interactions plus decoherence this makes sense to me but only
*  under the assumption that the dots are somehow given special treatment during wave function
*  branching otherwise I could imagine the wave function branching so that each branch saw
*  something other than a dot appear on the screen a circle triangle whatever my understanding is
*  that these dots are special because they are pointer states that are stable under decoherence
*  so my question becomes a bit meta why are these pointer states why are these the pointer states
*  and not something else our world would probably look very different if the wave function branched
*  differently but it seems that there has got to be some underlying ontological reason for why it
*  branches in this particular way so I think the answer is I mean it is because of locality
*  plus decoherence but you're right that there's more steps to that story a little bit you know
*  you have a gun shooting electrons or something like that at a screen in principle the wave
*  function is spread out over different points but in fact when you see the screen light up it's at
*  one point it's not at either the whole smeared wave function nor is that some weird shaped
*  subsystem like a circle or triangle or whatever why is that basically the reason is that what
*  pointer states are are are parts of the wave function which have the property that once
*  they're there once you're in them they don't keep getting extra entanglement with the rest of the
*  world remember entanglement is a special kind of quantum mechanical interaction like if you if you
*  take a basketball and bounce it on the floor the basketball does not become entangled with the floor
*  because the whole basketball interacts with the floor in exactly the same way if you had a
*  basketball that was in a superposition of let's say spinning and not spinning okay and then you
*  bounced that on the floor then the spinning part of the basketball wave function would bounce in
*  one direction and the non-spinning part would bounce in another direction so those two parts
*  of the wave function would separate they would decohere because they would become entangled with
*  the rest of the world that would be an interaction that entangles them so the point about the
*  electron or whatever hitting a detector screen is that think about the ways that that part of the
*  wave function interact with the rest of the world the electron interacts with the detector screen
*  and then it leaves a dot or it leaves an impression that you can see by looking at it right there's
*  some change in the color or the brightness or whatever of the screen so you can imagine tracing
*  out a circular pattern on the screen but in fact all of those parts of the circle interact differently
*  with the world they all give out what is amounts to a photon but photons moving in different
*  directions because they're coming from different angles on the screen all of the parts of the wave
*  function where the electron hits in the same point interact in the same way with the rest of the world
*  that's why it is a pointer state a much more vivid example is something like Schrodinger's cat right
*  where it's alive plus dead or awake plus asleep if you want to buy t-shirts from the merch store
*  at mindscape you can get an awake plus an asleep cat on your t-shirt the awake and asleep part of
*  the cat's wave functions interact differently with the rest of the world because they're in
*  different macroscopic positions so it's that position that comes in in all the cases whether
*  it's the basketball or the cat or the electron hitting part of the screen different positions
*  where the interaction happens lead to different kinds of entanglement with the rest of the world
*  and that's why pointer states tend to be the subsets of the wave function that are sort of
*  macroscopically coherent that describe something definite in space and in the case of an electron
*  hitting a screen that's going to be hitting at a point in space hitting at a point on the screen
*  Claudio Slamovitz says I read a biography of Fred Hoyle and he strikes me as a fascinating figure
*  he seems to have made important contributions especially on nucleosynthesis he also had
*  controversial later debunked views such as the steady state universe how is Hoyle perceived in
*  the physics world an underrated genius or a crackpot I think he's perceived as a rated genius
*  you know his his insistence for the steady state universe was quirky and you know lost him some
*  favor but look there were other people who hung on to that steady state universe long after Hoyle
*  went away and they definitely should have known better if you're if you're sort of the originator
*  of an idea then I think a lot of people will cut you some slack for hanging on to that idea
*  a little bit longer but you they would prefer it if you change your mind that would be better
*  but I do think that everyone agrees that Fred Hoyle did a lot of great things in theoretical
*  physics and astrophysics especially nucleosynthesis and the origin of the elements you know it's um
*  there is a book that just came out by Paul Halpern contrasting Fred Hoyle and George Gamov
*  so George Gamov in some sense was the champion of the big bang version of the story and Hoyle
*  was the champion of the steady state version they all had collaborators and the collaborators
*  are important so I don't want to brush them apart but these are the two big personalities in this
*  game and you know they were both part right and part wrong you know ultimately on the big bang
*  story Gamov was right but then you want to explain where the elements come from the big bang didn't
*  help that much with that it gets you helium but it's not enough and then stars and supernovae are
*  necessary to get the heavier elements and some people you know rightfully hesitated to say well
*  the real story involves a little bit of this and a little bit of that if you remember the podcast
*  we with Simon Dedeo talking about why certain kinds of explanations are favored over others
*  the ability of one thing to explain many things is rightfully thought of as a good feature for an
*  explanation to have and this makes people a little bit leery wary I should say a little bit wary
*  when the right explanation seems to involve disconnected unrelated things but that's really
*  very often true in the real world that you need to invoke disconnected unrelated things to explain
*  everything you see in the world and for the formation of elements in the universe that is
*  very very much the case so but people appreciate I think these days the contributions of Fred Hoyle
*  as well as Gamov and others Peter Soulfest says after rereading the big picture I was wondering
*  about strong emergence and quantum field theory is it theoretically possible or mathematically
*  consistent to construct a quantum field which only interacts with other fields if they are
*  sufficiently complex so I'm glad you're asking that because I'm literally writing a paper about
*  it right now you know to be honest not going into much details but I'm finishing up a paper it'll
*  appear soon on consciousness and the laws of physics and it's always dangerous when physicists
*  are talking about consciousness I get that but I'm not saying that much actually about consciousness
*  what I'm all I'm saying is something I've said before but I'm saying a little bit more detail
*  namely whatever is going on in consciousness don't try to explain it by changing the laws of physics
*  that's not the way to look the laws of physics are pretty well established and we know a lot
*  about them don't add things to it to change the laws of physics just because you want to understand
*  consciousness there's other strategies that are much more promising and in particular there's
*  this question of you know locality and strong emergence and basically let's say it this way
*  you know we know that even if you think there are other things in the universe there are atoms in
*  your head okay there are electrons and protons and neutrons in your brain and what happens to
*  those particles in your brain is certainly somehow related to consciousness okay maybe it's the whole
*  thing maybe it's only a part of it maybe it's epiphenomenal but it's somehow related and so
*  one attitude is sure you have a theory the core theory which tells me if I have an electron
*  surrounded by certain other fields how it behaves but maybe that works at CERN or maybe it works you
*  know at your laboratory table but who's to say that's the correct set of rules for describing
*  what an electron does if it's in a human brain if it's embedded in that very complex system
*  well the answer is everything we know about the rules of effective quantum field theory says
*  the electron could not possibly care less whether it's embedded in a human brain
*  electrons interact locally the only thing that affects what an electron does is the values and
*  the derivatives of other fields at the same exact location as the electron you know and in fact the
*  other atoms you know the human brain seems like very complicated and dense but the particles in
*  the human brain are kind of far apart from each other by particle physics standards so we would
*  expect and it's just an expectation it's not it's not a law of nature but our expectation is
*  that the behavior of those electrons is perfectly local so if you want to come up with a model
*  where somehow the dynamics of individual electrons change because it is in a complex system like a
*  human brain you're welcome to try i've tried not because i think it's true but because you know
*  sort of try to shoot it down and i was not able to either come up with a model where it worked or
*  to come up with a proof that you couldn't come up with a model where it worked i can say with
*  confidence there's zero expectation of anything like that happening except for your desire to
*  make the human brain be somehow special so i wouldn't worry about it too much but i can't
*  tell you that it's absolutely impossible andrew j says laplace's demon has perfect knowledge of
*  all microstates for a single instant of time as well as the full understanding of the true laws
*  of physics and can therefore predict the future and retrodict the past is the demon then limited
*  to predictions computations only for microstates if that's the state if that's the case then isn't
*  the demon essentially clueless about predicting any future that might be meaningful to people
*  i mean this is a slightly deflationary answer but i don't know what laplace's demon can do or cannot
*  right the demon knows all the he knows the exact microstate of the universe and the laws of physics
*  and has the computational power to both predict and retrodict is that all the demon knows i don't
*  know i don't see what limits the demon you know presumably if the demon has that much computational
*  power which is a lot maybe they're also able to figure out what the emergent properties are
*  you know there's no obstacle to that in principle so you know i the demon was made up it was a
*  thought experiment you could make up a version of the demon that's able to do that or a version that
*  isn't maybe the substantive part of the question is could you imagine knowing the whole microstate
*  could you imagine in principle knowing the whole microstate and not knowing the sort of ways to
*  chunk it up into emergent higher level things if that's the question then the answer is yes
*  absolutely it's like if someone gives you well if someone takes i don't know mac os right an
*  operating system or linux or something like that and translate it translates it into binary the
*  assembly code into binary and then prints it out as a set of ones and zeros and hands it to you
*  without telling you what it is could you figure out what it is i'm predicting the answer is no
*  even though all the information is there you don't have the ability to know oh yes that's mac os
*  2018 version or something like that there's a whole nother layer of conceptual insight that
*  it takes to do that so if that's what you mean then we can at least imagine a microstate version
*  of lapos's demon without implying a macrostate version orin harris says in your last ama you
*  invoked david lewis's possible worlds to explain your position on the principle of sufficient reason
*  saying that the fact that we live in one world rather than the other has got to come down to a
*  brute fact i found your response surprising because lewis's modal realism provides a reason
*  for apparent proof facts and that reason self-locating uncertainty is the very same invoked
*  by yourself in answers to why do we find ourselves in this branch rather than the other in ever
*  reading quantum mechanics the anthropics that provide the reason for apparent brute facts in
*  the mwi are the very same mechanism by which brute facts can be explained in lewis's model
*  which is an example of a metaphysics that at bottom satisfies the principle of sufficient
*  reason by being maximally symmetric not reifying one brute fact over any other can you expand on
*  why you don't accept brute fact explanations of chancy outcomes in quantum mechanics but do it
*  accept them in a seemingly similar situation so there's a lot going on here and i kind of i'd
*  like the question more than i think i have a great answer to give i want other people to think about
*  the question if it if it makes sense you know the i am very fond of self-locating uncertainty and
*  also of david lewis's idea i think it's his idea i'm not even sure it's his idea that well his way
*  you know he is the one he's the person from which i got the idea of thinking about uncertainty about
*  the laws of physics as self-locating uncertainty in the space of all possible worlds right there's
*  just a way of thinking about the fact that we don't know what the laws of physics are we can
*  imagine different worlds with different laws and then saying we don't know what the laws are is the
*  same as saying we don't know which of those possible worlds we live in but there is an
*  important difference so i think that you know if i get into the nitty-gritty of your question
*  i don't understand the claim that lewis's model satisfies the principle of sufficient reason i
*  think it depends on what you mean by a reason what can i say even in the quantum mechanics case where
*  i think i do understand things there is a version of me that sees the electron spin up a version
*  of me that sees the electron spin down the one that's of me that sees the electron spin up do
*  i get to say there is a reason why i see it spin up and the reason is well because there's another
*  one that sees it spin down and they're symmetric i don't know if that really qualifies as a reason
*  you know maybe it does and maybe that's an ambiguous question to which there's no perfectly good
*  answer so maybe that's part of the set of assumptions we would have to dig into here to
*  give you a satisfying answer but the other thing is that i'm not a modal realist i am an everett
*  and i do believe in the different branches of the wave function but i don't believe in the reality
*  of all the possible worlds i'm happy to believe to use the set of all possible worlds as a way
*  of thinking through our uncertainty about laws of physics and about questions of causality and
*  things like that but i don't therefore attach to them reality okay so to me it seems most likely
*  there is a universe even if it's a big everettian multiverse it's still one universe in some sense
*  with laws of physics and the question about why those are the laws of physics rather than others
*  does not come down to self-locating uncertainty in a set of real actually existing worlds it's
*  a different kind of thing so i don't have the similarity the the analogy there the parallelism
*  between modal realism and everettian quantum mechanics for those of you who are interested
*  alistair wilson who is a philosopher has tried to develop that parallelism he tries to claim that
*  we can think of everettian branches of the wave function as lewisian possible worlds i don't
*  really get on that train but it's an interesting way to think about the question
*  saraz rajan says the universe is amoral and the prospect of a no consequence after death could
*  either be liberating or disappointing liberating as in this is the one life we get to live so live it
*  as you please satisfy your brains whims and fancies disappointing as in no matter what legacy
*  or goodness i leave after my death it is not going to be of any use to me to me i'll be
*  non-existent do you have a different take on this matter so i think neither one of those is
*  exactly how i would put it you know the fact that life stops at death and there is no afterlife
*  is going to be disappointing to those who place the value that they have in their lives on something
*  that happens or continues on after their death right you're not here anymore so as far as you're
*  concerned there's no enjoyment or disappointment to be gained in what happens after you die so
*  having a legacy and things like that there is a well i was going to say it's irrelevant but
*  there's a crucially important exception to that which is that you might very well now
*  care a lot about the prospect of doing something that even lasts after your death and that's
*  perfectly valid right so to take pleasure in establishing something now that will only pay
*  off after you're dead there's nothing wrong with that even though you won't be around to appreciate
*  it you're appreciating it now that's a perfectly 100 okay but if you really thought that somehow
*  you needed your life after death to care about what happened after you died then i got some
*  bad news for you that's not going to happen now on the other side you say this is the one life we
*  get to live so live it as you please and satisfy your brains whims and fancies that's just an
*  unsequitur in my mind there's only one life we get to live therefore live it as you please it just
*  does not logically follow you need some extra premises that you've smuggled in there i think
*  you only get one life to live and therefore what you experience in this life and the impact you
*  have on other people's lives are the things that matter right the things that matter are not
*  the experiences you will have after death because there are no such experiences
*  but the experiences you have here on earth matter they go far beyond your brains whims and fancies
*  i mean that's a sort of an intentionally belittling way to put it you know everything
*  good that you do in the world and experience in the world are things that are happening here in
*  the world right now and so that's okay right i mean my attitude is just that is what matters
*  the stuff that you see the stuff that you experience this is a perfectly legitimate
*  basis for caring and mattering in the world and it is in fact what actually exists which is good
*  it's not one of the world's most famous science fiction books but i like it so i do sometimes
*  recommend it the question is have modern field theories ruled out the complex ultrafast nucleonic
*  interactions that give rise to the neutron stars chemistry so in the book it says that if memory
*  serves i was introduced to robert forward's dragon's egg novel by a recommendation on some form or
*  another if so thanks i love this book probably that's true i've definitely recommended that it's
*  chemistry so in the book there are living beings that live on the surface of the neutron star
*  that live in a sort of organic life that is not based on chemistry but more nuclear physics
*  so i don't know is the short answer to this question i haven't read the book in a long time
*  and i haven't thought about life on a neutron star in any careful way my my simple guess would be it
*  is completely incompatible with what we know about nuclear physics and the basic reason is
*  there's not a lot that can happen in nuclear physics you know the reason why chemistry is
*  interesting is that you can make atoms but you can hook atoms together in arbitrarily complicated
*  ways right the center piece of life is dna and the great thing about dna is it's an a periodic
*  crystal as erwin schrodinger predicted even before it was discovered which means it can be as long as
*  you want without ever repeating itself right information can be contained and uh passed down
*  from generation to generation in the form of this quasi stable molecule um and there's no limit on
*  how complicated in principle it could be whereas if you're just making things out of neutrons or
*  even neutrons and protons good luck with that there's not arbitrary complexity that you can
*  get there as far as anyone knows as far as i know as far as anyone that i know knows uh so my guess
*  is that's just not possible that's just not how nuclei work um but i haven't thought about it very
*  carefully jim murphy says you've said before that you were convinced space is not fundamental but
*  less convinced about time how can this be the case if space and time are just two aspects of the same
*  thing um well maybe they're not that that's how uh but so the reason why that's a short uh not very
*  clever answer but the reason why i wanted to talk about this question is it raises an interesting
*  issue for people who want to develop theories beyond the currently existing theories and this
*  is part of what we talked about with lise mullen in the podcast you know there are things we know
*  things we don't how do we choose what kinds of directions to move in so something that is
*  major triumph of 20th century physics is space and time are just two aspects of the same thing
*  space time and what i'm proposing uh not just me but what is being proposed is that
*  we can think about emergent space time in a way that treats space and time differently just like
*  newton would have treated them differently so in some very real sense it's a step backwards
*  and you can ask is that you know a strike against this approach and i think the answer is yes i
*  think that if there were no other strikes uh that argument you know you're losing some progress
*  that had been made by physics is a perfectly good reason to be skeptical of this approach
*  so if this approach is right not that's not just my approach to emergent space time but if the
*  specific version of it in which time is fundamental but space is not if that's true then time and
*  space are fundamentally different in some way and the fact that they seem to be two aspects of the
*  same thing is kind of an accident that emerges in the big macroscopic low energy universe is that
*  kind of a robust natural thing to happen or is it a special weird thing that i don't know okay
*  but it is part of the challenge of this approach that you would have to explain why it emerges
*  in that way alex borland says i have a question about the simulation hypothesis
*  imagine that humanity managed to simulate a universe complex enough to contain intelligent
*  life if that intelligent life started to study their universe and try to discover its physics
*  at what point would you give them credit and say they had cracked its fundamental laws would it be
*  once they had figured out all the equations our supercomputer was running or would they have to
*  discover a deeper level of reality such that the programming language they were written in
*  or the hardware they were running on etc and actually now that i think about it i'm going to
*  group this question together with another one from krather luca who says last month in your ama you
*  mentioned that eventually our knowledge will bottom out i interpreted this as saying that you
*  eventually that eventually progress stops because we reach some cold hard facts i agree there
*  probably is a place where things bottom out namely reality however how can we ever hope to know that
*  we've reached such a place so alex's question is if you're in a simulation how do you know that
*  you've reached the bottom level krather luca's question is how do we know if we've ever reached
*  the bottom level uh yeah we don't we'll never know that that kind of question um you know i
*  think that this is a no one ever promised you a rose garden when it comes to science so i do think
*  that given that i'm not a modal realist given that i think that not all possible universes really
*  exist there are some fundamental features of our world and by the way when i say that all these
*  things are very tentative like i'm not absolutely wedded to these things i'm willing to change my
*  mind about them but i'm just saying where i am right now um there are some facts about the
*  universe that are explained by nothing deeper than that's how that's the way it is brute fact
*  okay cold hard fact but we don't know which features are like that and which are not you
*  know the mass of the electron actually the mass of the electron is is dimension dependent so
*  the ratio of masses of the muon and the electron that's a dimensionless number okay is that an
*  accident or is there some deep explanation for it for example why are the fundamental laws of
*  physics quantum mechanical is there a deep reason for that or is it just a thing that we just have
*  to accept i don't know so and i don't think that there's anything wrong with not knowing or even
*  knowing whether you will ever know so the attitude that i would advocate taking is it's perfectly
*  okay to try to answer those questions to try to say okay why quantum mechanics why relativity why
*  the mass of the electron things like that why does the universe exist at all what's not okay
*  is to insist that there must be an answer that would make you happy in terms of some other
*  features of the universe right rather than saying one of the possible options is that's just the
*  way it is so i would i would advocate keeping the cold hard fact option as an option while not
*  necessarily ruling out the search for other possible answers at the same time and that you
*  know there's no point at which you say okay now i know for sure but that's just science you know
*  that's just how science works there's never a point you reach in which you can say i'm completely
*  sure all right now grouping together a few more questions because these are all in a very different
*  now for something completely different questions about the podcast so jesse rimmler says i'm
*  continually impressed by the variety and quality of your guests could you tell us a little bit
*  about your methods of discovery as an author do you receive advanced copies of books russell wolf
*  says in a recent ama you talked about how you always take recommendations for podcast guests
*  but don't like to make any promise about whether they will appear i was wondering if you could say
*  anything in aggregate about how often a listener recommendation results in a guest that you
*  otherwise weren't considering and finally seth says would you ever consider a podcast where you
*  go into detail about your day-to-day process for producing a podcast i really love how accessible
*  you seem and how you don't make it seem like what you do is magic yeah what i what i do is certainly
*  not magic and in fact seth i don't think it's that worthy to go into a podcast to talk about
*  my day-to-day process because it wouldn't take that long i will tell you what my day-to-day
*  process is and in in as much detail as anyone would ever want to hear you know i do have to find
*  guests so this goes to the questions asked by jesse and russell the way i find guests is a
*  wide variety of different things you know sometimes people patreons or people on twitter
*  or comments on preposterous universe dot com slash podcast or on the reddit there's a subreddit
*  sean m carroll subreddit they make suggestions and i take them all seriously like if i don't
*  never heard of the person i'll google them or whatever i get a lot of suggestions so if your
*  suggestion is not followed up on don't feel bad i can't possibly do everyone sometimes i get a
*  suggestion i do ask invite that person and they say no right and so i don't i don't ever want to
*  this is the biggest single reason why i don't want to say who i'm considering because i totally
*  respect people's decisions not to appear on the podcast i don't want to sort of shame them
*  publicly for not appearing on my podcast that's not that's not going to happen they have every
*  right and anyone if i ever invite you to be on the podcast feel free to say no i get it i say no
*  all the time when i'm invited to be on other people's podcasts especially since i have my
*  own podcast now there's only so many so so large a fraction of my time that i'm willing to spend
*  talking on podcasts and 98 percent of it is talking on my podcast these days but there are
*  other places where the guest suggestions come from yeah i mean you're asking about do i get books
*  so many books both because i'm an author and i have the podcast and i had the blog and my
*  wife jennifer is a science writer we get a lot of free books and this makes me feel very bad to say
*  it because when i was in college or grad school you know i would just spend hours in the bookstores
*  lovingly looking over all these books that i will never own and now books just appear at my house
*  and i have to actually give many of them away without ever reading them because there's too
*  many and i didn't ask for them right they just appear and so that's a terrible position to be in
*  but you know so be it so very often so i don't know why people send me unsolicited copies of
*  books you can just email me and say would you like a copy of the book that's a much more cost
*  effective measure many times if a book is coming out now that i have a podcast the pr person either
*  for the individual author or for the publishing house will email and say would you like to consider
*  this person for the podcast or the author themselves will email me saying would you like to
*  could i appear on your podcast and i love it both cases whether they themselves or someone in their
*  orbit suggests someone for a podcast i like being suggested people for the podcast as long as they
*  do not mind if i say no again i get way more suggestions than i can possibly take up so people
*  who want to argue with me when i say sorry it's not fitting into my schedule right now and they
*  say no but did you consider this that gets annoying but usually that very rarely happens actually most
*  people get it that there's a there's a limit on how much you can possibly do and in fact you know
*  this is not too surprising in the case of a long the long existing podcast we've actually now that
*  i realize it we're almost at exactly at the three year mark for mindscape so we've existed for three
*  years yes birthday i have invited people to be on the podcast and they've said no and then a year
*  later their publicity person says would you have my author on your podcast and usually i will say
*  yes but you know i get it you know life circumstances change sometimes people say well
*  you know i ordinarily would like to but right now it's not a good time all that is fine you know i
*  totally get it and other times i just want to have a topic you know i there's some a person or a topic
*  that i'm interested in so no one suggested them and i go out and find them and you know have them
*  on the podcast so all of these work as i've said before you know i want people who have something
*  interesting to say something that is worth listening to i'm not in the debunking business
*  i don't want to debate or argue with people even if i disagree with them i want to hear what they
*  have to say and learn from it and the audience also but within that very very broad category i
*  want diversity i want all sorts of different people i want people in different topic areas i
*  don't even want to have two of the same field in a row if i can avoid it right sometimes you can't
*  avoid it and sometimes it works out okay but i want a diversity of fields a diversity of perspectives
*  i want some old people some young people some famous people some not so famous people
*  the other thing is you know you do want people who can be good on a podcast and that's a whole
*  another skill set you know like i said in another context you can be really good at the intellectual
*  side of things and not the public side of things so i want people who can articulate what they're
*  doing and so usually it's easy to it's possible anyway to suss out that criterion but not always
*  you know and so i think you look overall i've been very very happy with the total set of people that
*  i've had on the podcast i look back at the list of people we've had and you know some have been
*  more successful than others but i'm like wow look at all these people who appear on this podcast
*  that's pretty good so happy with that um okay then to continue on with Seth's question about the
*  producing the podcast we set up a time i do try to make sure that they have a microphone right and
*  annoyingly there's this thing where the programs i use to actually do the recording which is usually
*  zen caster but there's some other programs this is like a website that i send the guest to and i
*  also go on then we can talk and record they keep fiddling with it and like removing browsers that
*  work so it used to be that zen caster worked on all browsers now it's only on chrome which is very
*  annoying anyway once we can all set that up set a date send them the zen caster link we both appear
*  and we talk and i record it and then you know i record it into audacity which is so i well i
*  record it that's not exactly true i download the audio files from zen caster and then i up i import
*  them into audacity and edit them so audacity is a free audio editing program and i don't do much
*  editing like i try to clean up you know i know that not all the audio is equally good and usually
*  that's just because the person on the other end is in a very echoey room or you know very noisy
*  microphone or something like that and it's it's you try to clean it up but you can't really as it's
*  very very difficult um but i do a little bit of that and then you know i remove the coughs and
*  whatever to the extent that i can and then i record an intro and i upload it and it goes on
*  the internet and the whole thing you know it doesn't take that long to be honest you know
*  it's not npr as i tell my guests i don't put a lot of incidental music in there i don't do a lot of
*  editing of like cutting and pasting to put the conversation in a better order or anything like
*  that what we say is 99 percent of what you hear roughly speaking um so because you know as i know
*  as i've said it's not it's not uh what i want to mostly do uh from an hour an hour basis the uh
*  other than sorry i guess the other thing the other major aspect here is that for some guests i really
*  have to catch up a little bit on what they're doing right i have to read their stuff or you know
*  listen and give a talk or something like that do research and that's a different amount you know
*  obviously if i'm doing john preskill talking about quantum computing i know enough i don't need to
*  do a lot of research ahead of time but for other people you know i need to do uh some
*  that is that does take time but that's part of the reason i'm doing the podcast that was part of my
*  self-motivation to nudge me into reading some of these books and learning some of these ideas that
*  i wanted to for a long time so other than that research aspect the whole recording organizing
*  editing publishing takes a day roughly speaking so one day a week uh not including the ama which is
*  a whole other thing but uh one day a week i can get the podcast out which is about the maximum to
*  be honest that i would want to devote to this unless i became like a full-time podcaster but
*  uh given that that there's other things i want to do writing books and doing science right um
*  one day a week is is a pretty big commitment actually but it's not overwhelming and that's
*  why i'm usually doing these amas on weekends and so forth um so i think that that is almost
*  everything there is to say about how the podcast gets done gregory mendel says a priority question
*  consider that you measure an electron spin along an axis a in st louis spin up you go to los angeles
*  spin down you go to new york your spouse subsequently measures the spin of the same electron
*  along axis b and goes to minneapolis if the spin up and to new orleans if the spin is down
*  so if a equals b i think you and your spouse are in the state which is a superposition of
*  i went to la my spouse went to minneapolis plus i went to new york my spouse went to new orleans
*  because they're measuring the same spin as i am along the same axis right so they're always going
*  to get the same answer it's just a single electron not two entangled electrons now the question
*  continues your best friend calls you and observes your location your spouse's best friend calls and
*  observes your spouse's location the friends correlate their results and they repeat for
*  axes combinations yours and your spouse's of a b ac and bc so these are different axes along
*  which we could measure the spins question is bell's inequality and then he writes up bells
*  inequality violated as per quantum mechanics proving that you and your spouse were in two
*  places at the same time or not so gravey i feel bad because i know this is a priority question
*  but i don't understand what it is you're asking in the original formulation you said that a was
*  equal to b but then later in the question you seem to be leaving them as independent variables
*  where we have a b and c be different axes so let me say things that i think are true and hopefully
*  they will provide an answer to your question even if it's not exactly matching on to the setup that
*  you gave to the question if you do this kind of experiment so i mean i presume you're saying
*  that that you're asking this question in the context of many worlds you know
*  otherwise if it's not if it's just a copenhagen question then quantum mechanics is quantum
*  mechanics and you're going to get the predictions of quantum mechanics coming out true now the short
*  answer is in many worlds quantum mechanics is still quantum mechanics and you're going to get
*  the predictions of quantum mechanics namely you will violate bells inequality yes but just to
*  be clear about what happens if my spouse and i measure electrons along different axes
*  then in general there will be four branches to the wave function so in the in your original setup
*  there's just two branches one of which i go to la and she goes to minneapolis the other one of
*  which i go to new york and she goes to new orleans if they're not the same axis there's going to be
*  four branches me la and her either minneapolis or new orleans me new york and her likewise right
*  so the total and you have to do this many times to actually measure a probability right to even
*  define what you mean by the measured outcome of the probability in axis a axis b etc but given that
*  understanding of what actually happens in many worlds all the ordinary predictions of quantum
*  mechanics are completely true including the violation of bells inequality and there's never
*  true that we were in two places at the same time we were in two different places on different
*  branches of the wave function okay but that's just the the wonderfulness of many worlds you can get
*  all the quantum mechanical predictions out of this situation perfectly well so maybe i'm missing
*  something subtle that you're asking that question but i hope that set of true things i just said
*  helps answer it
*  again i'm going to apologize who's the priority question but i don't have a great answer i want
*  to know what the laws of physics are okay can i answer see that's the problem with these all
*  knowing entity questions like are they a generous charitable entity who would interpret my question
*  in a useful way if so i would ask what the actual laws of physics are right and hopefully
*  that would include a knowledge of the ontology of the universe what the universe is in addition to
*  how it behaves right the actual laws of physics then i might ask a cosmological question about
*  you know well actually my second question would be are there objective moral truths because i'm
*  pretty sure the answer is no but if the answer is yes which would surprise me but i'm open-minded
*  then my third question would be well and what are those but if not i would probably default to a
*  third question of something like what happened at the big bang or what happened what is the
*  history of the universe like i mean how long can the answer be right like tell me everything that
*  happened in the history of the universe would be a question you'd be tempted to answer but to ask
*  but then they might go on for too long so you would want some algorithmically compressed version
*  of that question to be asked greg fife says at this time what is your bayesian assessment of
*  the possibility that the firmy lab g-2 result actually demonstrates new physics if it does turn
*  out to be new physics do you have any view on what that will most likely turn out to be so remember
*  we talked about the g-2 result in my solo podcast from a few weeks ago the muon magnetic moment
*  experiment at firmy lab you know i think that right now i'm in a place that says it is less
*  likely to be new physics than not and that has nothing to do with the actual experiment or the
*  experimenters and more to do with we've been down this road before right there's been a lot of claimed
*  anomalies in the standard model particle physics none of them have really panned out
*  remember if i'm if i'm remembering correctly and hopefully you also do the situation with the
*  firmy lab result is that the experiment is pretty clean like they really have measured the magnetic
*  moment of the electron of the muon rather the difficult thing is the theoretical prediction
*  because in that calculation there are contributions from strongly interacting particles
*  right quarks and gluons and those are hard to get right and it turns out there are two different
*  theoretical predictions for those contributions one of them the one that is the one that was used
*  in the analysis gives you that discrepancy that they claim between theory and experiment but
*  there's another calculation done with lattice qcd which actually kind of agrees with the
*  experimental result so if you're looking for a way that the result might actually not be new physics
*  it's pretty obvious what it would be that the theory prediction is just a little bit off
*  for what it might could be if it is new physics i don't know i don't have a favorite example of
*  what it might turn out to be i think that there'll be an embarrassment of riches so i don't even have
*  a strong candidate for what the most likely thing is to be the next two questions i'm grouping
*  together and they're kind of related to that one because they're about virtual particles and
*  quantum fields so cooper says quantum magazine ran an article about the results of a recent muon
*  g-2 experiment which included this quote the particle you thought was a bare muon is actually
*  a muon plus a cloud of other things that appear spontaneously i've always imagined that quantum
*  foam is something that exists everywhere regardless of the local presence of any real
*  particles this quote however makes it sound like virtual particles only exist in clouds around real
*  particles is the quantum foam something that particles travel through or is it something
*  is created by the local presence of a particle so it's both is the short answer the longer but
*  more accurate answer is that the whole picture of the quantum vacuum as consisting of these
*  particles popping in and out of existence is deeply misleading still a remnant of our
*  insistence on thinking of the world as something visualizable and classical rather than quantum
*  states of fields which it really is but to get to the essence of your question in quantum field
*  theory oh i'm sorry i forgot to ask the other question the the next question by peter waley
*  is it's my understanding the particles like photons are perturbations in the electromagnetic
*  field my question is what makes the disturbance in the field if it's particles what came first
*  the chicken or the field okay so uh that i'm going to answer that implicitly while i'm answering
*  cooper's question the world is made of fields in the quantum field theory limit anyway gravity is
*  probably a different story but uh what we're talking about here in particle physics there
*  are fields that you quantize and there's a quantum state called the vacuum which is the lowest energy
*  state of your quantum field theory and particles are excitations into higher energy states of that
*  of the fields in that quantum field theory and when you ask what what is the quantum vacuum i
*  mean there's a simple dumb but correct answer which is it's the lowest energy state of your quantum
*  field theory but in fact there's another way of thinking about the vacuum state which makes it
*  much more complicated and interesting which is to think about it in terms of what the fields are
*  doing so what that really means is if i probed the field if i poked at it and said what happens
*  or if i measured the value of the different fields at different points in space and time with
*  different resolutions etc there's a very complicated structure to what's going on even in the vacuum
*  even in what you and i call empty space and you can think about you're not forced to but you can
*  think about that structure as arising from virtual particles popping in and out of existence okay
*  again all that is just in empty space but now let's go to a non-vacuum state a state with a
*  little bit of an excitation a particle traveling through the vacuum there are already all of these
*  virtual particles in the vacuum in this picture but now there's also a real particle and the real
*  particle interacts with the virtual particles so you can think about it either way you can think
*  about it as the real particle is traveling through a pre-existing cloud of virtual particles and
*  interacting with them and being affected by them or the real particle traveling is just spitting
*  out and then reabsorbing virtual particles and then being affected by those those are two perfectly
*  good ways of thinking about it either way right so you will often hear physicists who know the
*  math underlying this they'll talk about it either way depending on what is most convenient for the
*  purposes they're talking about at the time and you know this is something you should always keep in
*  the back of your mind physicists who do quantum field theory etc blah blah blah are constantly
*  translating math into words and the language is never perfect the translation is never exact so
*  it's much of the time not all the time but much of the time when you hear two things that sound a
*  little bit incompatible it's just that the words that are being used for the translation are
*  slightly different in the two different cases okay a person who has named themselves anti-de-shitter
*  space is asking a priority question in your podcast with max tegmark he proposes the mathematical
*  multiverse in which our universe is just one of many mathematical structures all of which are
*  equally real as a non-physicist i often wonder how ideas like this arise when a physicist proposes
*  an idea like this does it originate from some physical intuition and attempt to be original
*  or something else what credence should we or can we assign to theories that are not testable
*  you know i think the the general question of where new hypotheses in science arise is a good
*  one and a hard one it's a combination of psychology and sociology and science right you know where does
*  creativity come from for that matter i don't think you know when you say an attempt to be original
*  that's sort of there's a positive valence to that and negative valence you're not going to propose
*  a theory that's not original because someone already proposed it right it's not that it's not
*  a good idea but they've already proposed that one so it's not that you're attempting to be original
*  but you're attempting to get to the truth and maybe the ideas that currently exist maybe none
*  of them is the truth so you want to be original in the sense that you're proposing a new idea
*  that has some non-zero chance of being true that's a perfectly valid motivation to have when you're
*  doing these as to why you pick the specific hypotheses to look at yeah physical intuition has
*  to come into it and again it goes back to what lee smolin and i discussed and i just talked about
*  right now different and simon deo and i discussed different people bring different intuitions to
*  the table or different commitments to different precious principles right one of the great things
*  about lee smolin is he's more upfront about what his most important principles are i don't agree
*  with his principles but they're his principles and he's clear about them which i think is a good thing
*  to be in terms of assigning credence to theories that are not testable i don't know i mean i don't
*  think that's a very good philosophy of science attitude to have you know we're we should be
*  basians we should say we assign priors to different hypotheses about the universe based on whatever
*  criteria it is that we use to assign priors and priors need not be universally shared you're
*  entitled to your own priors but not to your own likelihoods different people value different
*  things differently simplicity fruitfulness comprehensiveness and those will affect their
*  priors but then we all agree on how the priors are updated when we get new evidence we try our best
*  to say where the likelihood of that evidence would be under the different theories assigned to the
*  priors and we move forward from there but the evidence can take on different forms sometimes
*  it will be experimental data sometimes it will be new theoretical insights sometimes it will be
*  realizing that oh this theory is actually more complicated or more vague than i thought right
*  that counts as new evidence that you can use to update your priors so that's the way i'd like to
*  think about thinking about evaluating theories rather than just saying this very very crude idea
*  this is testable this is not it's more complicated than that elai graham says priority question
*  it seems to me that quantum physics and the philosophical movement of phenomenology
*  husserl heidegger merlot ponte etc appeared and developed at about the same time in the same
*  intellectual climate do you think quantum physics and phenomenology influenced each other so when i
*  first read the question my answer that i was tempted to give was nope they did not at least
*  in the direction of phenomenology in this sense of continental philosophy phenomenology
*  influencing quantum mechanics what influenced quantum mechanics was black body radiation and
*  you know the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and things like that but that would have been bad i'm
*  glad i didn't just give that answer because the true answer is i don't know and in fact it's
*  perfectly possible that there was influence in in either direction and i just don't know the history
*  of it well enough but you know i did realize i didn't i forget whether i've said this on the
*  podcast but i did amusingly i think i tweeted it i was for some weird reason reading about daoism
*  and one of the one of the web pages i was reading about it mentioned that niels bohr
*  uh was knighted or got you got some sort of honor in denmark and as a result he got to design his
*  own coat of arms and he decided to in his coat of arms include the yin yang symbol because he was
*  thinking about complementarity in quantum mechanics right particles versus waves or position versus
*  momenta two things that cannot be simultaneously described at the same time but are both different
*  aspects of the same underlying thing the point of all that is that um these people were highly
*  educated right this is this is back when the center of physics was still in europe not in the united
*  states and these people all had philosophy educations different levels of sophistication
*  but nevertheless it would not be at all impossible to imagine that ideas being put forward by the
*  philosophers of the time did seep into the space of possibilities that were being considered
*  to explain the data by physicists so i don't know what the answer actually is but i'm willing to
*  imagine that there was a connection there anonymous says are you optimistic or pessimistic that the
*  usa and the world will meet the required greenhouse gas reduction targets in time
*  if pessimistic do you sometimes think about whether you as a smart person with a large
*  network and a large audience could do more to steer it in the right direction e.g. with your
*  choice of guests or the question you ask etc so i'm pessimistic that we're going to reach our
*  required greenhouse gas reduction targets you know it it's very the the the track record is
*  not encouraging right i mean some governments are into it some are not those governments change with
*  times you can never predict 10 years from now what different countries are going to be doing
*  um however then you ask you know could i do more to steer it in the right direction
*  well it's hard like if i really thought that there was something i could do fairly straightforwardly
*  that would have a noticeable effect on the direction of the world and climate change
*  then i would do it and we've had people talking on the podcast about climate change naiomi oreskes
*  michael mann ramez nam but i suspect that in terms of the question we should do something or we
*  shouldn't i suspect i'm mostly preaching to the converted here right i suspect that most people
*  not all but most people listening to this podcast appreciate the importance of the dangers of climate
*  change and the importance of doing something about it i mean it it makes me think about authors with
*  twitter accounts and i know that i'm one of them but you know when an author has a new book out
*  they can't help but on their twitter account just talking about their book all the time
*  and i get it they're trying to reach new people and make them buy the book the problem is they're
*  reaching the same people over and over again they're not reaching a new people new set of
*  people with every tweet likewise with me in the podcast you know i had my audience but it's the
*  same audience every time i say this thing saying it more and more often reaches a point of diminishing
*  returns very strongly and honestly what is it that people can do to help with climate change like
*  i've said this before in here in the united states which is the conditions i know best
*  the single most effective thing you can do to help fight climate change is get democrats
*  elected into office we have strong political part polarization in this country where if party a
*  takes a position party b reflexively takes the opposite position and democrats roughly speaking
*  are on the side of trying to do something about climate change and republicans roughly speaking
*  are not that's much more and you know any individual person can't do that much on those
*  directions either but it's more than you know recycling or turning off your light bulbs or
*  even driving electric car is likely to do i think that these are problems that require
*  systematic solutions not valorous individual choices and the way that the systematic solutions
*  are going to be implemented is through governments get a government in place that wants to solve the
*  problem and then you know once that's done then you can tweak it right like even if a government
*  is more even if a political party is more devoted than the opposition party it still doesn't mean
*  they're as devoted as they should be so you can still try to pressure them once they're in office
*  okay charles hertz says priority question one of the touted benefits of the concept of inflation
*  cosmological inflation not economic inflation is that it solves the horizon problem i know some
*  people like roger penrose don't believe in inflation and i think that you've said in the
*  past you're 50 50 on it suppose that evidence empirical or theoretical is found that clearly to
*  your satisfaction completely discredits the concept of inflation can you speculate on what
*  other kinds of processes or events might then need to be brought into play to solve the horizon
*  problem that's a very good question and the short answer is no i don't have any good second option
*  right and you know i don't like the horizon or flatness problem that's something maybe you can
*  talk about on the podcast i have blogged about it before i don't the early universe is in a
*  finely tuned state compared to our natural expectations of what it might be that is a
*  statement that i agree with but how to characterize what the fine tuning is i don't think that either
*  the horizon or the flatness problems are very good ways of doing that as i've written about before
*  but it is fine tuned and the universe is smooth at early times that's really the problem why is it
*  smooth inflation would make it smooth if it began and my problem with inflation is i don't know why
*  it ever began in the first place but whatever thing caused inflation maybe to begin whether
*  it's some feature of the wave function of the universe some quantum gravity thing or some other
*  dynamical mechanism maybe it could have skipped the step of leading to inflation and just given
*  us a big smooth universe that and when i say big i mean like a centimeter across when you take our
*  observable universe and you extrapolate it back in time it reaches the the expansion rate was the
*  plank scale if there's no inflation the expansion rate was the plank scale or let me say it this way
*  when the expansion rate was the plank scale the size of our currently observable universe was
*  about a centimeter across or a millimeter or something like that and the problem is even
*  though that seems small for our whole observable universe it's an enormously big size compared to
*  any particle physics length scale like the plank scale or the proton mass or whatever so that's
*  why i say make a big universe that is smooth i mean a centimeter sized universe that's one of
*  the wonderful things about inflation is that you could plausibly begin the universe a plank size
*  across and then inflate it up to be a centimeter across and make our universe that way but we
*  don't know if it's true or not so and i don't even have any second favorite option sandro stuckey
*  says my question is about mox principle i've heard it stated as something like the large scale
*  distribution of mass influences your rotation flame rotation reference frame or mass out there
*  influences inertia here these don't make sense to me it seems to me that even if there were no
*  stars and planets out there i could still feel the difference between myself spinning and remaining
*  at rest so sandro i'm here to help you because i know the answer to this one mox principle is wrong
*  that's the answer mox principle and you know you're not at fault for having heard it stated in
*  different ways because mox never was very clear about it and other people tried to make up
*  statements that would be a principle that more or less corresponded to his ideas and they were
*  never completely in agreement but it was an inspiration for einstein when he was inventing
*  general relativity the whole idea that there was a relationship between matter and energy in the
*  universe and space time in the universe okay that was the very general idea that helped him
*  go all the way to general relativity in which the curvature of space time is influenced by
*  matter and energy but the actual idea that the reference frame that counts as rotating versus
*  non-rotating for example is somehow set by matter far away is just not part of general relativity
*  once you're at general relativity you don't need mox principle anymore like you like you're intuiting
*  here or implying there are solutions in general relativity without matter in them at all and yet
*  there's still a difference between rotating and not rotating so forget about mox principle it was
*  historically interesting it's no longer relevant to modern physics okay i have two questions
*  about free will and the block universe siddhartha says are libertarian free will and a block universe
*  mutually exclusive we can have we can only have libertarian free will if the future is yet to be
*  determined while in a block universe the future is already set in stone are these ideas compatible
*  red beard says what distinguishes the block universe from someone at the end of time with
*  a knowledge of history i ask because one has nothing to say about fate or free will and the
*  other has been interpreted to preclude free will is there a philosophical difference between me
*  knowing my history at the end of my life and the block universe view of my life so of course
*  i'm going to interpret both of these questions as asking about libertarian free will which is the
*  idea that we human beings are not completely subject to the law of physics to the laws of
*  physics somewhat we are our centers of mass are subject to laws of physics but our choices made
*  in our brains are not and i think it's a silly idea i think that we are subject to laws of physics
*  and in fact i'm not at all sure what the idea even means as i've said before in other contexts
*  if a human being was found to be behaving in some way that was clearly in violation of laws of physics
*  what i would do is change my idea what the laws of physics were and then i would come up with some
*  better laws of physics that included that human behavior i wouldn't just say oh there are no laws
*  that can explain this laws might involve probabilities or whatever but i'm honestly not
*  sure how to even define what might be meant by libertarian free will in a way that would make
*  it a sensible notion that you could oppose to laws of physics based universes okay having said
*  all that i think that most conceptions of free will are mutually exclusive with the block universe
*  the block universe comes about well you know okay it's going to depend on what you mean by a block
*  universe um well yeah it is going to depend on what you mean by a block universe at all i mean
*  the original idea of the block universe was in a deterministic context okay so it was really where
*  you thought that you could be laplace's demon know everything about the universe now and from that
*  extrapolate what would be in the future so siddhartha you as you said in the in the i might
*  not have read this correctly but you said in the question the future is already set in probabilistic
*  stone you can't say that it's set in stone means it's deterministic you can't be set in probabilistic
*  stone okay so usually the block universe idea goes hand in hand with being truly deterministic
*  there are there's subtleties there like if you're a many worlds person the wave function of the
*  universe evolves deterministically but the apparent evolution that is actually observed by individual
*  observers is not deterministic so you have to finesse it a little bit it's not a block universe
*  with a single space time it's a block wave function it's a single wave function that is
*  that is determined there um but anyway if there are laws of physics probabilistic or not
*  then there's not libertarian free will libertarian free will is the ability to violate the laws of
*  physics so those ideas are mutually incompatible um to redbeard's question someone at the end of
*  time with knowledge of history i'm not quite sure what the relevance of a person at the end of time
*  with knowledge has anything to do with it um the idea of the block universe really uh it matters
*  that the future of the block is in some sense inherent implicit in what is going on right now
*  so the block universe is more than thus just the idea that you wait infinitely long and then you
*  get a universe okay like everyone agrees with that like even if you're not a block universe person
*  if you're a presentist you can believe that you know you wait until the end of time if that's a
*  sensible concept and then you say what happened you you write a history book um the block universe
*  idea is really like i said it goes hand in hand with the idea that the future is implicit in the
*  present and in in that case you don't need to know about what the future is going to be um and it's
*  a case that is distinguished from cases where either you have indeterministic laws of physics
*  or you don't have laws of physics at all because you have libertarian free will in those cases the
*  future is not fixed in terms of the present and so the block universe idea doesn't quite fit as well
*  even if a person at the end of time would have all the knowledge of it
*  okay not quite sure i did a very good job explaining those things but hopefully the
*  the essence came through alas poor yorick says the connections between physics and philosophy
*  are fascinating yet it feels to me fairly crucial to a scientific temperament sorry and it feels to
*  me fairly crucial to a scientific temperament yet my physicist colleagues seem to relish a wholesale
*  rejection of the entire broad tradition of philosophy i'm often trying to get these friends
*  to take philosophy beyond a vague impression of carl popper and politics other than naive
*  technocracy seriously i was wondering if you had any thoughts on where this antagonism comes from
*  and how to counter it as it seems quite pervasive and popular among famous scientists who should
*  know better yeah you know i think this is a good question especially because it doesn't seem so
*  number one i agree that there is broadly speaking some hostility in physics circles to philosophy
*  in some that's a very overly simplistic statement but there's some truth to it
*  but it doesn't seem to be constant over time right as i just said a hundred years ago
*  the people who you would identify as the leading physicists of their generation were deeply in
*  interested in philosophy and philosophy questions and they they would have thought it bizarre
*  to think otherwise certainly in the past if you go to boltzmann or maxwell much less newton and
*  Galileo and laplace these people could barely see the difference between physics and philosophy
*  right so it's a somewhat recent phenomenon and it's not entirely wrong to co-locate the phenomenon
*  with the transition of the center of the world of physics from europe to the united states
*  so there is a cheap but maybe somewhat uh relevant fact that americans have a different attitude
*  about these things than europeans did americans are more direct pragmatic gung-ho get it done
*  don't ask too many questions um and and that is an attitude that actually fits very comfortably
*  into modern physics right um which is kind of ironic the idea because you know physicists think
*  about weird things uh wave functions of the universe superstrings the multiverse whatever
*  but given that subject matter physicists tend to be pretty down to earth about it you know they
*  want to know what is the payoff what do you know if you're familiar with pragmatism right this
*  american philosophical tradition of pragmatism which not exactly accurately but but to give you
*  some of the flavor of it is sometimes acquainted with the notion of the cash value of ideas the
*  pragmatist vision of truth of an idea was what usefulness does it have in the bigger picture
*  purpose that i have so if your bigger picture purpose is predicting the outcomes of physics
*  experiments and your view of truth is essentially pragmatic uh what is the cash value of these ideas
*  then you can see how you would be uh pointed in the direction of ignoring philosophical questions
*  to the extent those philosophical questions didn't help you predict the outcomes of physics
*  experiments now i don't know if this is actually historically accurate i don't know how valid this
*  is as an explanation for the hostility of modern physics to philosophy but maybe it has part to do
*  with it um how to counter it you know part of it is there's not there's a whole other thing going
*  on which goes back to our discussion of intellectualism which is that there is a
*  difference between being devoted to a particular field of intellectual inquiry and being devoted
*  to intellectual inquiry for its own sake right just like there's a difference in politics or
*  in society between be there's a difference between being devoted to making sure that your group
*  gets the rights and privileges that it should be afforded versus being devoted to the idea that
*  all groups should get the rights and privileges that they should be afforded right um and in the
*  case of intellectual effort again it's perfectly valid either way you know you can get a lot of
*  progress just by being narrow-minded and sticking or at least narrowly focused let me put it that
*  way and sticking to the interests of your sub-discipline and so the other thing to keep in
*  mind is not America versus Europe and physics and philosophy but just the hyper specialization of
*  the academy right as knowledge has grown to be influential and productive as a knowledge producer
*  requires increasing specialization and so being appreciative of the perspectives and values and
*  techniques of other fields is generally becoming devalued right and it's not just physics and
*  philosophy you pick out other subfields just as well so you know and I say this and by the way
*  you should take everything I say in these in these discussions with a grain of salt because I have a
*  dog in the fight I am very very devoted to interdisciplinary discussions I am very very
*  frustrated by the fact that the rest of the academy does not share my interest in these things all the
*  time many administrators or whatever talk a good game when it comes to interdisciplinary engagement
*  but the way that we do the organization of universities in the modern world is department
*  by department and departments are self-perpetuating you know the promotion the hiring and promotion of
*  new professors is at the 98 percent level done by the professors in a department that already exists
*  so you can say oh wouldn't it be nice to hire someone who crossed over departments but it's
*  really hard to do in practice and this leads to the increasing silo ization of the academy and so
*  that's a whole nother thing that probably feeds into this but look everything I'm just saying
*  right now is vague anecdotal speculation these kinds of questions are hard and to do them seriously
*  you have to do some real work in I don't know history sociology of academia and
*  that is not my area of expertise I'm afraid sorry the other part of the question was
*  how to persuade them to think otherwise you know there's two angles to take you know
*  one sorry point zero is is it worth trying to persuade them that philosophy is interesting
*  or useful just like people on the other side of a political divide or any other highly polarized
*  divide you first have to decide whether the person you're talking to is open-minded if they're just
*  devoted to their position then don't waste your time right but there I think there are a lot of
*  people who are dismissive of philosophy or other areas of intellectual inquiry more generally who
*  just don't know anything about them but might be open-minded if they did so then the two points I
*  wanted to make about that are number one point out that there are some tiny parts of physics
*  where philosophy is important but point two most of physics and most of philosophy are separate
*  but nevertheless valid so in other words it is simultaneously true that if you're doing something
*  like thinking about the measurement problem in quantum mechanics thinking about the role of
*  probability in cosmology thinking about the origin of the arrow of time these are very very valid
*  obviously interesting physics problems for which philosophy has a lot to say and philosophy really
*  is useful at the same time there are plenty of physics problems for which philosophy is not
*  useful that's just obvious and so there's like no necessary connection between physics and
*  philosophy if you want to calculate a Feynman diagram you don't call a philosopher and at the
*  same time there's a lot of philosophy questions that have no impact on physics morality ethics
*  aesthetics right they're intrinsically interesting in their own right so even though I want to stand
*  up for the usefulness of philosophy to certain circumscribed parts of physics that's not why I
*  think philosophy is interesting philosophy is interesting because philosophy is interesting
*  just like physics is interesting because physics is interesting that's the attitude that I would
*  mostly push on but there are other people who are going to be more persuaded by the fact that oh if
*  you want to understand the nature of entropy in the arrow of time you better talk to some philosophers
*  because they have been more clear-headed about those questions than physicists have traditionally
*  and recently. Frederick Klok-Loritz says I've heard you mention that many worlds doesn't have
*  any philosophical implications I think what you mean is moral or ethical implications but I get it
*  how about a case where a person is given the choice to sacrifice themselves to save humanity
*  if the person believes that this universe is all there is they would be inclined to sacrifice
*  themselves because the alternative is the end of humanity in a final and absolute sense but if they
*  knew that there was a near-infant amount of other worlds where humanity would continue on then the
*  person wouldn't have to worry as much about destroying humanity because this is just one
*  world out of many well so I think it doesn't work there is as I said in something deeply hidden and
*  elsewhere there is a version of morality in which many worlds does matter it's basically sort of a
*  non-linear version of morality if you don't care about the average value of things but you put in
*  an absolute value on things like if you put an absolute value just on if you were a utilitarian
*  for example sorry no utilitarianism doesn't work what works if you think that there are some things
*  that could happen that would be sort of absolute evils so evil that it didn't matter if no matter
*  how many other good things happen so it's the opposite of being utilitarian if there are certain
*  things that you never ever ever ever want to occur then you would try in the many worlds
*  interpretation not just to make them unlikely but to make them sort of impossible in any world
*  right am I getting that right I don't think I'm saying this very very correctly but the point is
*  I can imagine cooking up very sort of artificial sounding versions of moral codes that would
*  that would in fact be influenced by many worlds oh yes I remember okay yes sorry I'm getting the
*  example wrong here's the example that I came up with in in something deeply hidden imagine that
*  your highest value was equality in other words you don't care how rich people are and we're just
*  going to use money as a proxy for value in this case you don't care how rich people are what you
*  care about is that they're all equally rich right and then someone comes up to you and
*  proposes a thought experiment no propose a real experiment they're a multi-trillionaire very very
*  wealthy and they say we'll measure a spin of a particle and if it's spin up I will give every
*  human being a dollar and if it's been down I will give every human being two dollars okay now in
*  ordinary quantum mechanics you would say sure take that I would I would I would let you do that I get
*  either a dollar or two dollars and so does everyone else everyone benefits if you were
*  utilitarian and you believed in many worlds then you would also say yeah sure you know in one world
*  everyone gets a dollar and everyone in the other world everyone gets two dollars all good but if
*  for some reason you had this cockamamie moral theory that says that inequality is intrinsically
*  bad even across the multiverse then you would say it's bad that in some part of the multiverse
*  people get one dollar and in the other part they get two dollars and therefore I will not let you
*  do this experiment at all and everyone gets zero dollars that keeps them equal right okay that's a
*  very very silly moral code I think but it is an example of how in principle many worlds could
*  matter now I don't think that works for the example that you're giving in this sort of given the
*  choice to sacrifice themselves to save humanity so I mean you didn't phrase the way the the the
*  thought experiment a way the quantum mechanics has anything to do with it so if you're just given if
*  someone holds a gun to your head and says you know I have a trigger that will destroy the universe
*  and either you let me kill you or I do the trigger and everyone dies you know by the way if everyone
*  dies why not just sacrifice yourself if I don't see the you know you're not getting advantage out
*  of this for not sacrificing yourselves but okay let's say that you were sort of cowardly and
*  didn't want to do that there's no quantum in there there's no branches of the wave function in there
*  there's one branch and in that branch you will either save the humanity or not okay so what you
*  need to imagine is that there's some probability that some quantum probability that the universe is
*  sacrificed right so would you sacrifice yourself to give the population of the earth a 50 chance
*  of dying or being saved versus not sacrificing sorry yeah I think the right way to do it is
*  if you sacrifice yourself there's a hundred percent chance that no one dies if you don't sacrifice
*  yourself there's a 50 chance that everyone dies right and a 50 chance they don't because then
*  you can actually have something to weigh against the different occurrences in different branches
*  of the wave function so but in that case I would argue you know just as I argued in the book it's
*  the analysis is exactly like a single world in which there's just a probability of it right so
*  for me and maybe not for other people depending on your moral code but for me there is no difference
*  between a scenario in which there's a branch of the wave function in which everyone lives and an
*  equally sizable branch in which everyone dies and a 50-50 chance in a single world of everyone
*  living and anyone dying so that's a vivid difference conceptually but I think it doesn't
*  make any difference to me actually in you know the actions I would take to save the world because
*  for exactly the reason that if you're going to be if you're going to believe in many worlds
*  then you believe that for people living in that universe their experiences are exactly the same
*  as people who live in a single universe where these things happen with a certain probability
*  okay so it's it's very much like the quantum suicide experiment where you say well you know
*  if I die in a certain branch I don't know I only experience life in the branches where I'm alive
*  that's not valid analysis in my mind because as we said before in a different context right now
*  before the experiment is carried out I care whether I'm going to survive or not if there
*  were a classical world and someone says you know would you mind if some if you were killed
*  instantly and painlessly I'd say yes and the fact that I won't be around to regret it is
*  completely beside the point I would regret right now the the prospect of no longer existing and
*  that's just as true in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics now others might disagree
*  okay so again this is stuff where it requires thought because the metaphysics of ever writing
*  quantum mechanics is very different than our usual way of thinking so by all means
*  think hard about this I'm not going to say that I've given you the final answer but that is how I
*  think about it Hilbert spaceman says what would constitute experimental evidence that Schrodinger's
*  equation does not always hold for example why isn't every measurement of a spin evidence of this
*  well the answer why every spin measurement is not evidence of that is that in many worlds
*  Schrodinger's equation does always hold and yet it predicts exactly what we see in spin measurements
*  right so clearly by itself that is not evidence what it's evidence for is that in our branch of
*  the wave function we cannot explain what happens by assuming the the we see the whole result of
*  the Schrodinger equation holding we're only seeing part of the result but what you would need for
*  evidence that Schrodinger's equation doesn't hold is to see wave functions violate the Schrodinger
*  equation without being observed right without being measured without being decohered without
*  becoming entangled with the rest of the world when we in the real world do a measurement
*  we entangle things with the rest of the world you can do experiments where you wait for things to
*  violate the Schrodinger equation even though they're not being observed and you know if a
*  wave function spontaneously localizes that would have experimental impacts energy would not be
*  conserved in a very obvious way for example so you know you need to be careful that you're not
*  secretly disturbing the system but that's always going to be the case when you're trying to do a
*  careful physics experiment you need to be careful Fred Alexander says would you consider allowing
*  one of your patreon members to interview you for a mindscape episode um i would consider it i'm
*  not sure you know uh what i what i what makes me pause about that is not that it's not an
*  interesting idea but i'm not sure if it distinguishes itself from what we're doing right now with the
*  amas right like in the amas in some sense you're getting an interview of me from a hundred different
*  patreon members each asking one question each so i'm not sure there's that a lot of value added
*  to that plus there would be setup involved but again like many other things i have enormous
*  appreciation for the patreon supporters here if there is a huge well of support for an idea like
*  it seriously let's put it that way dmi says doesn't the re-schlider theorem resolve the black hole
*  information paradox and there's a longer if you want to go to the website and and go to patreon
*  and look at the um question being asked there's a much longer explanation of what he means by that
*  the re-schlider theorem is basically just the idea that well it's stated in a particularly
*  fantastical sounding way but what it comes down to is the fact that in a quantum field theory
*  every little bit of a quantum field in one location of space shares some amount of
*  entanglement even if it's very tiny amount with a bit of the quantum field in the vacuum state
*  this is all for the vacuum state at any other point in space so you pick two points in space
*  take a small region around them a cubic centimeter or whatever there are fields inside them and it
*  is a feature of the quantum vacuum state that they are entangled they maybe only a little
*  bit of entanglement but there's some entanglement between those quantum fields and as a result of
*  that the re-schlider theorem says if i project onto the field in one region of space in exactly
*  the right way i can turn the rest of the wave function of the universe and do essentially
*  whatever i want okay now that's a little bit misleading because of the verbs in there don't
*  actually correspond to things you're actually allowed to do so if i have to make things simpler
*  just take a single particle right which is spin up plus spin down an electron that is in a super
*  position of spin up and spin down and i measure the spin what happens when i measure the spin is
*  there's a probability i will see it spin up and a probability i will see it spin down and after i
*  can describe that by saying i projected onto the spin up part or the spin down part the problem is
*  that you can't ahead of time decide which thing to do in other words if your electron is in a
*  superposition of spin up and spin down you can't say ahead of time i'm gonna measure it and get
*  spin up if you could then you could do superluminal communication between alice and bob having
*  entangled particles right i mean i think this is the thing that people implicitly suspect you can
*  do when they think that entanglement leads to superluminal communication if alice and bob have
*  two particles and they're entangled in opposite directions so they're anti-parallel then the
*  correct thing to say is alice measures her spin it's either up or down bob measures his spin it's
*  either up or down they're correlated if one is up the other is down but they don't know neither one
*  of them know the answer that the other one got right if alice was able to measure her spin in a
*  way that guaranteed that she could get spin up then bob could measure his spin and he would always
*  get spin down and if he did that with 100 spins he would go aha they're all spin down alice is
*  sending me a message right but alice can't do that so typically they'll get 50 50 on both of them
*  so likewise in the reichleider theorem there is something that can happen in the cubic
*  centimeter of space that you look at that in principle if that thing happened would cause
*  the rest of the state of the universe to change in an incredibly dramatic way
*  it the the example that's often given is you could make the Taj Mahal appear on the moon
*  okay but you can't force it to happen you can't choose to make that happen there is a thing that
*  could make that happen but it's incredibly extraordinarily super duper unlikely that's
*  why these things don't ever happen in the real world okay so the question about resolving the
*  black hole information paradox if i i tried dmi to understand the your longer version of the
*  question but maybe like everyone else i'm misunderstanding it the reichleider theorem
*  implies that there is entanglement between degrees of freedom inside the black hole and degrees of
*  freedom outside the black hole that's true but that doesn't help you get information out right
*  that's the point the point is you want to get the information about the quantum state of systems
*  out of the black hole and if you just believe the most naive version of what happens in space time
*  the part of the quantum state that is inside the black hole hits the singularity and disappears
*  and what you're left with outside is a mixed quantum state that has just had the information
*  about what fell in erased right it's the equivalent of you know alice falls into the black hole
*  bob has a spin and after alice falls in in the black hole evaporates bob's spin is 50 up and 50
*  down but the exact entanglement with alice's spin is just lost forever so that's the information
*  loss puzzle so reichleider relies on the fact that there's entanglement but that's not nearly
*  enough to help you get the information out roughly speaking rebecca lashua says on the internal
*  inflation wikipedia page it says the inflationary phase of the universe's expansion lasts forever
*  throughout most of the universe does that mean that some finite distance from the earth there's
*  a patch of space time undergoing exponentially fast expansion or the parts of the universe
*  undergoing inflation disconnected from our universe in some way uh yeah usually you know
*  eternal inflation is not perfectly well understood so there's details and different versions of the
*  scenario but roughly speaking the idea is that yes some finite distance away from the earth
*  there should be a patch of space time undergoing exponentially fast expansion in fact in most
*  versions of this most of the volume of the universe is undergoing exponentially fast expansion
*  in eternal inflation if eternal inflation is happening at all they are usually outside our
*  causal horizon so it's not that they're disconnected physically but we can never get there you know we
*  could never get there even if we started the speed of light and move right now gillis 15 says although
*  the events were detected by ligo and virgo in 2020 a new paper just released confirms for the first
*  time a black hole neutron star merger would the black hole be able to tear apart the neutron star
*  as the star spiraled in or would the neutron star cross the event horizon hole so this is an
*  interesting astrophysical question and i'm i'm i'm addressing it not because i know the answer
*  not this is a little bit too down to earth uh for me but i think that part of the excitement of this
*  my impression from reading the popular articles about this particular event is that we learned
*  something about this particular question you know it's complicated neutron stars are messy
*  black holes are non-linear and there's a lot going on and einstein's equations are hard
*  so you might guess that it's plausible either way that the neutron star is mostly swallowed whole
*  or that it is gradually torn apart if you are really good at doing simulations you should be
*  able to make a prediction ahead of time but i don't know what the state of the art of those
*  simulations is it seems from what i understand the fact that we didn't see an electromagnetic
*  counterpart of these particular events implies that to a very good approximation the neutron star
*  was swallowed whole and if you see little pictures little animations that they made
*  that's basically what happens the neutron star comes very close to the black hole and then
*  disappears very quickly so i think that's what happens but i don't know if that's always what's
*  going to happen or if this was particular to the cases of these particular in spirals again i'm
*  not enough of an expert to know naive bayesian says how would a good bayesian reconcile the
*  following hypotheses number one reality is real number two reality appears real because
*  day cards demon is tricking you three reality appears real because you're a boltzmann brain
*  four reality appears real because you're in a brain simulation five reality appears real because
*  of literally any other ad hoc tomfoolery example so you can't you can't really reconcile those
*  but you have to deal with them in some way so i think that i mean there is a strategy that more
*  or less works but i'm not going to pretend that this is a situation where all the i's are dotted
*  in the t's are crossed that i understand exactly what's going on or at least have a good set of
*  advice to give you so for those of you who are not you know familiar with all these different
*  phrases here this is the idea that either the reality you see around us is basically real
*  there really is a desk in front of me a microphone a computer and so forth
*  or that somehow we're in what we call a skeptical scenario somehow that there is a kind of reality
*  that is very different than the apparent reality around us but you are being fed an illusion okay
*  so this is different so there's a subtle difference i want to emphasize the difference between
*  something like the difference between the manifest image of the world and the scientific image of the
*  world so the fact that there's a table in front of me and a microphone etc none of this none of
*  these words table microphone appear in the standard model of particle physics this the whole classical
*  world i see around me is a very tiny slice of the real world if you believe in the many worlds
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics so those are both senses in which there's a difference between
*  reality and what you see but in both cases that's just because you're seeing a small part of reality
*  and you're still seeing part of reality what you're seeing is part of reality even though
*  it's not all of it okay that's not what's being talked about here what's being talked about here
*  is the idea that there's reality and there's what you see and they're very different because
*  you're being misled or tricked in some way and so it's not that hard going back to Descartes
*  who is a master of this it's not that hard to imagine skeptical scenarios that are so convincing
*  that no experiment you could do would reveal that what you're experiencing was not reality right
*  maybe a very good demon is tricking you or you're in a simulation or brain in a vat or whatever
*  i think that's possible i think that is a something that is on the table maybe we are being tricked
*  but as a good Bayesian this is the question you're asking what does a good Bayesian do in this case
*  um you have to discount it i mean i think a good Bayesian says look if i can take what i do observe
*  and explain it in a variety of different ways and some of those are simple and coherent and
*  self-contained and others are awkward and artificial and complicated and weird i'm going to pick the
*  simple ones i mean there's just no x nothing added by imagining that we are a Boltzmann brain or a
*  simulation or being tricked by an evil demon so i think that's the way to go in the real world
*  you want to make sense of the world and so the ways i talked about it in my paper on why Boltzmann
*  brains are bad is that the to to exclude the Boltzmann brain possibility by just setting the
*  prior credence on it to a very very very low number keeps us in a cognitively stable situation
*  if you say i'm not a Boltzmann brain then you can make sense of the world if you say well maybe i
*  am a Boltzmann brain then you can't make sense of the world because you have no reason to trust any
*  of your experiences of the world so it's like it's not a useful hypothesis on which to put a lot of
*  credence that would be my argument now having said that the the little niggling problem that should
*  worry you is as a good Bayesian you should never set your credences in any physically possible
*  scenario to exactly zero because if you did then no future evidence would enable you to find that
*  hypothesis you've set it to zero and you multiply by zero every time you update right so i do think
*  good Bayesians should keep some non-zero credence even for these skeptical hypotheses what if the
*  demon reveals themselves and says huh i was the demon who was tricking you right then you want to
*  be able to update and go ah a demon was tricking me all along so at the same time i think you want
*  to set these credences to very tiny numbers but not to zero and how do you do that what do you mean
*  do you mean one in a million one in 10 to the million i don't know i don't know what those
*  those those things are fortunately i don't think there's a lot of credence for any of these
*  scenarios so i don't need to worry about it that much but i appreciate the importance of this kind
*  of question in principle fabian ross dollin says regarding regarding vegetarianism you're the only
*  person i've heard making a reasonable argument for the justification of eating animals namely
*  their lack of ability to anticipate their future their mortality and so on the philosopher who got
*  me convinced of veganism morally put forth the name the trait argumentation style of reasoning
*  about these issues namely that if this trait if a certain trait or lack thereof is sufficient for
*  killing a reading another being it should be so regardless of the species of that being example
*  it's okay to eat animals because they're not as intelligent as humans should then also conclude in
*  therefore it is also okay to eat humans with equal intelligence to an animal do you agree
*  with this reasoning if or if not why so i don't really agree with this reasoning but let me
*  give a little stage setting here first you know i am a moral constructivist i think that what we
*  call morality is sort of a systemization and codification of our moral inclinations of our
*  deep-seated feelings that certain things feel right certain things feel wrong plus our rationality
*  the idea that we would like to take these feelings and systematize them
*  into a set of consistent principles right and sometimes our inclinations might be inconsistent
*  incoherent and we have to do some work like what do i really care about and we might also want to
*  talk to other people and get more insight into possible ways to be good and bad and that would
*  also change our minds so i don't think that there is a simple and direct road from our moral
*  feelings to morality as in moral philosophy but that is the starting point and because of that
*  morality is not objective or cut and dried or rigorous or universal different people might
*  come up with different kinds of morality so all of that is to say that the answers to these kinds of
*  questions might be different from person to person rather than me giving you the once and for all
*  final answer even in my own mind okay having said that so in my mind when we come up with rules like
*  you shouldn't eat humans or whatever the rules are you're coming up with rules so you're inventing
*  rules to fit the inclinations you have and to me it makes a hundred percent perfect sense to apply
*  those rules on a species by species basis rather than on an individual by individual basis
*  you could decide to apply them on an individual by individual basis that's a different set of
*  morality and then you and i could sit down and talk about the implications of that choice
*  but it's not my choice and i don't think it's the choice that most people would have and which you
*  know part of this is why even though i'm not vegan or vegetarian myself i have a hundred percent
*  respect for people who are as a moral constructivist it would it would be very it would be a little bit
*  hypocritical to me if i said well you're just wrong you vegans right if you think it's wrong
*  to kill animals and eat them i get it you know you're totally valid in that if you think it's
*  wrong that i kill animals and eat them you know what i even get that because i'm not a moral
*  relativist i don't think that everyone or every society gets to make up their morality i think
*  it's perfectly valid to do your best to come up with moral rules and then apply them to other
*  people right i think that because that's the perfectly even if they're not going to come up
*  with the same rules the rules that you come up with have you know are what you think is moral
*  and not moral so it's okay if you judge me badly i get that i'm going to try to uh well both of
*  course think through my own moral reasoning and then also sit down and reason together about what
*  our collective rules should be about whether eating animals should be legal or illegal and so
*  forth and hopefully we can have reasonable conversations about that but i think that this
*  particular issue of you know this assumption that or maybe not assumption but claim that it is
*  somehow incoherent or inconsistent to apply rules to species rather than individuals is completely
*  arbitrary and ad hoc you know i'm applying my rules i'm telling you what my rules are i apply
*  them species by species and that seems perfectly sensible as a thing for me to do okay i'm grouping
*  we're reaching the end here but i'm grouping together a couple of questions this is about
*  faster than light travel so moshah fader says the two largest and most popular science fiction
*  franchises involving space travel star trek and star wars share as part of their basic premise
*  the common science fiction assumption that their methods of near light speed and faster light travel
*  somehow exempt them from relativistic time dilation so that got me worrying wondering about
*  wormholes if they could be made traversable and you could use one to cross the galaxy and return
*  would the temporal effect of relativity still apply even though you had never moved to relativistic
*  speeds and then damon winston bird says i have to go to alpha centauri and i don't want to spend
*  years getting there i hop in my al cubierre drive which is a kind of warp drive solution to the
*  equations of general relativity invented by miguel le cubierre and get there in only one year
*  after taking care of business there i hop into my faster than light al cubierre drive and i'm home
*  again after another year of travel time did two years pass on earth as i traveled so these are
*  slightly different scenarios wormholes versus warp drive in the wormhole case is actually a
*  little bit more straightforward but the more visualizable or conceptualizable let me say it
*  that way but the answers are the same in both cases in both cases you're effectively moving
*  faster than the speed of light why do i say effectively because locally you're not right in
*  both the warp drive case the al cubierre warp drive case and in the wormhole case what you're
*  really doing is stretching space time warping space time in such a way actually interestingly
*  what you're doing in the al cubierre sport warp drive is literally warping space time around you
*  even though the idea far post dates the phrase warp drive so i wonder i have no idea why warp
*  drive is called warp drive i think just because it sounds cool and fast but the idea that you
*  get it by actually warping space time is is probably not what they had in mind but it actually
*  fits very well anyway in both cases you're looking at a space time curvature setup okay a geometry
*  of space time that is different than just flat space time that you get in special relativity
*  and this lets you and and you've done it in a specific way that you can compare two different
*  ways of traveling between two points in space one way is by just going in what you might think of
*  as a conventional path right not being in the warp drive not being in the wormhole and then it
*  takes you a certain number of years to get where you're going certain number of years to get back
*  from the point of view the people who stayed home or you can get there to the same point
*  by traveling through this tunnel in space time either in the warp drive or in the wormhole
*  so then the question is forget about time dilation that's not really quite the right way to think
*  about it the question is how much time elapses in your reference frame according to your clock
*  as you're traveling between this point and this other point either in the wormhole or in the warp
*  drive and the answer is i don't know the answer is it depends on the details of the wormhole or
*  the warp drive so it is completely plausible that they're synchronized in such a way plausible
*  might be an exaggeration conceivable is a better word maybe so in the warp drive is a little bit
*  fuzzier again but the wormhole is a pretty direct thing there's a distance you travel through the
*  wormhole okay there's a distance you travel back and there's also a time that it takes to go in
*  the wormhole and a time it takes to come back and i could easily imagine setting up my completely
*  fictitious wormhole system such that the time that elapsed on my watch as i travel through the
*  wormhole and travel back is the same amount of time as elapsed to the people back home okay
*  and presumably i could do the same thing with the warp drive although i haven't actually gone
*  through the equations in that case so in other words i think it is completely conceivable to
*  set up a system of effective faster than light travel that works like star trek and star wars
*  do that that actually in the back of everyone's minds they haven't quite graduated from newtonian
*  absolute space time to relativity and they think that there is something called the simultaneous
*  things going on on alderaan and tatooine or whatever and that's the narrative frame of reference
*  of the movie okay you could imagine something like that it's not what would naturally pop out
*  of a realistic space-time geometry but you could imagine it so you know you want to make movies go
*  ahead all of these are really cowboy movies at the end of the day you know when you say you're in a
*  starship really you're in a covered wagon going far away and and that's how they really think
*  about things that's the right way to conceptualize why they have the adventures that they do
*  okay anonymous asks in episode number 62 with cape jeffrey you both talked about how physicists
*  are essentially certain that the universe won't last forever and about how some of the processes
*  that will cause the universe to wind down you also talked in general about how ironic it is when
*  knowledge about physics stays stuck in ivory towers when the explicit purpose of studying physics is
*  to discover new knowledge for society i'm curious about how the knowledge that the universe will
*  definitely permanently end has impacted society and culture or whether that's an example of
*  something the public really ought to know more about so just to be super clear the sense in which
*  i think it's pretty clear it's never definitive never 100 so i don't want to say that but it's
*  overwhelmingly likely that the universe will end is not the time will end it's that the ability of
*  the universe to increase in entropy will end right there's a sort of limit about what we can
*  do as we travel from low entropy to high entropy there's only so far we can go as you can illustrate
*  by the way in a mindscape t-shirt we have a t-shirt showing the curve of entropy versus time as well as
*  complexity versus time it's not the most physically accurate graph i just drew it in the
*  little program but it gets the idea across anyway so it's not the time will end but the arrow of time
*  will end we'll use up the fuel that we have to keep the universe going that's what i was talking
*  about with kate in that episode and with another kate with katie mack we talked about different
*  physical ways the actual universe might end which is a slightly different concept but it's an
*  interesting question you ask about whether or not this idea of the heat death of the universe
*  that's really what kate jeffrey and i were talking about the running out of entropy
*  does that have an impact on society well you know because it did when it came about right when people
*  first started talking about this in the late 19th century early 20th century it did leak into the
*  popular imagination and i'm i'm gonna get it wrong i want to say henry adams talked about it
*  and other people who are not physicists you know they caught on to this i mean arguably
*  nicha in his idea of eternal recurrence was at least indirectly affected by this discussion
*  going on in physics before they knew about the big bang and things like that
*  and thomas pinchin more recently has absolutely written about related concepts but okay
*  it's still not there in the everyday life of popular culture we don't talk about it too much
*  and maybe it's just because people don't care i mean we're talking a very very long time scale
*  and you know zach wienersmith the cartoonist was talking on twitter just today because he's writing
*  a book on future space travel and he says one of the things that is frustrating about talking to
*  the real gung-ho space geeks is that the time scales of interest to ordinary people and to the
*  space geeks are very different so when zach will say look all this talk about terraforming planets
*  it's just unrealistic we shouldn't worry about that this is not on the horizon and the space
*  geeks are like no no it's completely plausible we'll absolutely do it implicitly zach is thinking
*  within the next century or two and the space geeks are thinking within the next million years
*  or two right and so that difference in implicit time scale matters a lot real people have difficulty
*  thinking even a hundred years in the future so when you say that the sun will burn out in five
*  billion years and the last star will burn out in a quadrillion years and the last black hole will
*  evaporate in the google years they're not their lives are not affected by that very much they
*  they are amused for a minute and they go back to their everyday lives and you know what they're
*  not wrong i think it's an interesting thing to think about but i'm not really sure that has a
*  huge impact on how we should live our lives here on earth lineo lineo misiara says what would
*  physics look like today if feinman hadn't invented his diagrams um well there's two answers to that
*  one is uh it would look the same because uh someone else would have invented them i mean
*  feinman diagrams are great but like most other inventions in theoretical physics someone gets
*  there first but other people would have gotten there eventually so i think it's overwhelmingly
*  likely that someone would have invented diagrams feinman diagrams are just too too juicy too useful
*  too helpful and and physicists like drawing diagrams uh so they someone would have invented them
*  eventually maybe we'd be calling them weinberg diagrams or etoft diagrams or something like that
*  witten diagrams but the other answer the other version of the answer is maybe this is the
*  implicit thing what if nobody had invented feinman diagrams i think that somebody would have but what
*  if they hadn't um you know julian schwinger who shared the noble prize with feinman and tobanaga
*  basically did the same calculations that feinman did without the diagrams and famously you know the
*  joke was that because they were kind of rivals schwinger refused to use feinman diagrams uh for
*  the rest of his career i think that's not true i think he did actually use diagrams uh but he had
*  a way of doing the same calculations purely algebraically purely with equations right so you
*  can imagine a world in which we did the same calculations but it took longer they were harder
*  to do because there were a lot more difficult math and the conceptual clarity wasn't there
*  maybe there's a different kind of conceptual clarity that would have been there since we
*  wouldn't be as stuck with visualizing particles literally moving on lines which is what we're
*  invited to do when we think about things in terms of feinman diagrams even though it's really the
*  quantum fields that are going on so i don't know if there would have been very big differences in
*  how physicists think about the world um but anyway i do think the diagrams we're going to come at one
*  point or another richard kajdan says suppose i ask a priority question today and then during the next
*  month i run the universe splitter app a bigly number of times to pretty much guarantee that i
*  end up on a different timeline can i submit another priority question next month uh no
*  you cannot because i don't know what do you mean end up on a different timeline you know if you ask
*  a priority question today then all the future versions of you are ones that descended from
*  someone who asked a priority question today you can't undo the past by making measurements
*  with the universe splitter or any other quantum mechanical uh measurement process sorry about that
*  if you could i'd be writing papers about that that'd be a very important thing okay the very
*  last question this has been a long one today lewis b says how sure are we that things like
*  hawking radiation are literally true are likely true my understanding is that the prediction of
*  hawking radiation rests on both quantum mechanics and general relativity being useful approximations
*  in the vicinity of a black hole's event horizon but isn't the entire problem those theories don't
*  play well together in particular in regimes precisely like a black hole where if anywhere
*  would you no longer trust these theories to be useful so again there's sort of a narrow version
*  of this question and a broader one the narrow version is do we have good reasons to trust
*  general relativity and quantum field theory in the event horizon of a black hole and the answer is
*  yes so you're saying you know aren't black holes exactly where we should not trust quantum field
*  theory or general relativity but that's not quite true um the singularity near up in the in the future
*  when you get into a black hole that's where you shouldn't trust general relativity the general
*  relativity says all the equations are blowing up the curvature is infinite i have no reason to trust
*  things anymore but near the event horizon the curvature of space time can be small especially
*  for a big black hole so that's precisely a regime in which you should trust general relativity
*  perfectly and in fact here's the here's the um the quite you know the tiny reason why you might be
*  skeptical of that argument i just gave so the argument i just gave was based on the idea
*  that general relativity becomes untrustworthy when the curvature of space time becomes large
*  and that's actually not true near the event horizon of a black hole the curvature of space time can be
*  small um in quantum field theory there's an analogous statement when do you trust quantum
*  field theory well when it's close to the vacuum state locally and you only have a few a small
*  number of particles and again near the event horizon of a black hole you should be able to
*  trust quantum field theory it's nearly the vacuum if you fell into the black hole you wouldn't even
*  notice unless there are firewalls or something like that in which case all bets are off but
*  let's assume that there are not the problem with what i just said is exactly the black hole
*  information loss puzzle namely that both general relativity and quantum field theory by all rights
*  should be trustworthy near the event horizon of a black hole but taken together they lead to the
*  information loss puzzle and so that leads many people to say that somehow in a subtle way
*  one of them is wrong near the event horizon of a black hole probably quantum field theory in some
*  subtle way right there's some kind of non-locality that allows information to be transferred out of
*  the outgoing event horizon but so even if that's true we think that if you looked at a black hole
*  the even if you think that information gets out in the radiation you wouldn't be able to tell
*  whether radiation is getting out just by looking at it what you'd be doing is saying that the black
*  hole is really analogous to classically setting a book on fire right if you classically just set a
*  book on fire let it burn in principle all of the information in the book is contained in the outgoing
*  heat and light and ash and dust and so forth but you can't tell by looking at it right you can't
*  recover what was in the book once it's burning that would be the case if you could actually look
*  at a evaporating black hole you would see the Hawking radiation in principle all the information
*  is there but in practice it just looks like a black body you can't get it out okay so that's
*  what we expect to have happen now the other aspect of your question that i wanted to raise here is
*  in principle in general in other circumstances how much confidence should we have in our theories
*  when they're being extrapolated into regimes far beyond where we've actually tested them
*  this is a very good question and a very hard one and i don't have a good answer for you
*  um if it weren't for black hole information loss we'd be really pretty confident in quantum field
*  theory in a wide variety of circumstances and we think that black hole information loss is special
*  because gravity is so important in that case so in practice we are pretty confident in quantum
*  field theory in cases where gravity is not nearly black hole strength okay that's why i can say that
*  the laws of physics underlying everyday life are very well understood right now because we live in
*  an environment which there are no black holes nearby so the usual reasons why we trust quantum
*  field theory are likely to be valid but maybe not and this is again something that we need to be
*  cognizant of i think personally that the extrapolations we do of known laws of physics
*  are extremely likely to work when we get to black holes because
*  you know there's nothing that breaks down the things that seem to break down are things that we
*  see exactly what is breaking down the information getting out right in other cases in other
*  uh contexts other questions you want to ask about it it seems perfectly benign but then there are
*  other cases where we're extrapolating like into the early universe and there people are a little
*  bit sanguine i think about talking about ideas like inflation um or bariogenesis or other things
*  that rely on extrapolations far beyond what we've tested in the laboratory because they're often
*  not simply relying on robust features of quantum field theory but they're relying on specific
*  features of specific quantum field theories and those i don't have much faith in at all
*  when we're extrapolating them to the very very early universe so i think that in general you
*  know the physics that we currently established is so good that we do become a little complacent
*  about extrapolating it into regimes that we haven't explicitly tested yet and we should be a little
*  bit more humble about that that doesn't mean we all things go and anything can go and we shouldn't
*  have any faith at all we should have a credence that we should keep under control and the credence
*  might be large but it's not 100 so this issue of where in general we should think our current
*  favorite theories are valid there or they're applicable the domain of applicability of a
*  theory that's a good one that i think both physicists and philosophers should think harder
*  about we haven't really nailed that one down which makes it the perfect question to end on
*  something we don't know the answer to there you go okay that was a lot of words thank you for
*  sticking with me here thanks for asking the questions thank you for supporting the mindscape
*  podcast i really do appreciate it come back with more questions next month bye
