Welcome to the June 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | June 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [June 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zh1wJnvpp8)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the June 2021 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape Podcast.
*  I'm your host Sean Carroll. So this is the coming out of pandemic time period that we're in right
*  now. Hope people are getting vaccinated, being able to resume their lives again a little bit.
*  Jennifer and I both fully vaccinated, slowly starting to do things that we weren't doing
*  before. You know, before you could go to some restaurants, at least here in LA, I don't know
*  what it was like different parts of the world. Some restaurants, if they had open outside seating,
*  then there was a little bit where you could go. But now we're able to go to some of our old
*  favorite restaurants that are reopening again. We even went to a movie in a movie theater.
*  We have not yet gotten on a plane. I know that some people were getting on planes, of course,
*  all along trying to take precautions, but we didn't have any strong needs to go anywhere. So
*  we haven't been on a plane in over a year. I don't have a plane trip planned until I think July or
*  something like that, maybe August. So that'll be something. I hope I can remember everything.
*  I did notice that my passport had expired. So I got to get that fixed. All of the crap that is
*  involved with coming back to the real world. Overall, it's very much worth it. But whoof,
*  there's a lot of stuff you got to get done. Other than that, yeah, no news from around here, really.
*  I am looking forward to answering these questions. We got a lot of questions. As you know,
*  if you're veterans, then we get questions from people on Patreon who support the Mindscape
*  podcast with a pittance each week. They're the ones who are allowed to ask questions.
*  In the old days, when we were a small elite group, I would answer every single question,
*  but it became too big for that. So we have a new system now where I pick questions to answer and
*  group ones together if they're similar thematically. Once again, this month, there were far too many
*  good questions for me to answer. So if I don't answer your question, it's because I don't have
*  anything interesting to say about that. You're very welcome to ask questions of the form,
*  did you read this book and what did you think about it? But if I didn't read the book,
*  I'm not going to answer the question. I'm just going to leave that out,
*  delete it. So it's not you, it's me, if I'm not answering your question. But if you're listening
*  to these questions being answered and you're burning up with jealousy saying, boy, I wish I
*  could ask a question and have that be answered, you can support Mindscape on Patreon. Go to
*  patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll, dollar a week, something like that would be more than enough to
*  let you be part of this community. You get ad free versions of the podcast. Plus you can ask
*  AMA questions. Let's get to answering them. Let's go.
*  Rainer Glögg asks a priority question. So remember, the other rule for patreons asking
*  questions is if there's some question that is really important to you, you don't want it to
*  get left out because I don't pick it to answer the questions that month, then you just label it
*  priority question. And I promise to answer it, but you're only allowed to do that once in your life.
*  So make it good when you ask a priority question. So Rainer says, can you please explain what
*  happens to photons that don't arrive anywhere due to the cosmic expansion? I understand that
*  the light wave gets redshifted, but is there a limit? So no, there is no limit. The universe
*  keeps expanding. Photons keep getting redshifted. Now I do have to be a little bit careful,
*  depending on how technical you want to be here. What do you mean by redshifted? Okay. When you
*  emit a photon, it has a certain wavelength in the rest frame of whatever emitted it, right,
*  whatever atom or galaxy or whatever emitted the photon, you can talk about what the frequency was
*  or the wavelength with respect to that emitter, because that defines a rest frame. In another
*  rest frame, with respect to something that is moving rapidly with respect to the emitter,
*  the wavelength will look different, right? So keep that in mind. When you absorb the photon,
*  you also have to take into account the rest frame or whatever is doing the absorbing. Otherwise,
*  there'll be a blue shift or a red shift just from the Doppler effect. So cosmologically,
*  we can always talk in a somewhat sensible way about the redshift because there is a rest frame,
*  because there is basically a common rest frame of all the galaxies and all the stuff in the
*  universe. They move at a few hundred kilometers per second with respect to each other, but that's
*  nothing compared to the speed of light. So for all intents and purposes, it's a common rest frame.
*  So when you say the photon gets redshifted, you have to tell me what rest frame you're talking
*  about. Once the universe is empty and there's nothing in it anymore, who's to say what is the
*  right rest frame to use to measure it? But if you just insist on somehow continuing the rest frame
*  that we have now, defined by all the matter in the universe into the cosmological future,
*  with respect to that frame, a photon, according to all the equations that we know about now,
*  will just get redshifted forever. There's no limit at all. Oh, so now I have two questions.
*  Remember, I'm grouping questions together that I think are at least connected, not necessarily the
*  same, but there's a thematic similarity. So Perry Romanowski says, I posted this last month,
*  and while it was listed in the questions answered, it was not answered. So I posted again. So my
*  apologies for this, Perry. I clearly remember answering your question. I'm not quite sure what
*  happened. It must have been mistakenly cut out when I was editing or something like that. But
*  anyway, the irony being the question is about editing. And the question is, if you said something
*  on a previous podcast or video that you no longer agree with, discovered it was wrong or insensitive,
*  do you edit the old content or do you simply correct the record from now and going forward?
*  And the related question is from Pietrek Bzidl, who says, have you ever recorded a podcast episode
*  and decided not to publish it? Or maybe you were requested, asked by your guests to not publish it.
*  In what circumstances would you make such a decision? So both these questions clearly have
*  to do with, you know, ex post facto editing of podcasts. So I think I don't have a policy
*  about this. It hasn't really come up enough times for me to think through all the possible
*  ways this could happen. If I said something that was wrong, I wouldn't correct it. I might, you
*  know, leave a note in the comments or something like that. But I'm not going to go back and edit
*  the audio file. I mean, by the way, editing is very hard for audio podcasts, not just the physical
*  editing of going into Audacity, which is the program I use to do it. But then you have to
*  re-upload. I put all the podcasts on YouTube, even though they're audio only. Some people prefer
*  listening on YouTube. YouTube simply will not let you edit or replace a file at all. The main
*  podcast files can be replaced, but it's a little bit of a pain. So the default is just to keep it
*  there, maybe flag something if I think it was wrong. Certainly if I've changed my mind about
*  something, I'm not going to go back and edit the podcasts. That sounds like work. You know,
*  it's like writing a book. When you write a book and you change your mind afterward,
*  you write another book or you write an article or something like that. You don't go back and
*  correct all the books. Now, if something was insensitive, if something was, you know, truly
*  like out of bounds and insulting or offensive that either I said or a guest said, I don't know. I
*  never come across that particular problem before. I might in that case, because that reflects badly
*  on the rest of the world, not just me, if I'm hurting the feelings of other people, not just
*  making myself look dumb, then I might think about, you know, going back and editing and leaving a
*  flag up there. I mean, I wouldn't sneakily edit it. If I do ever edit or replace an old podcast,
*  I would certainly want to do so with full transparency. To the question of have I ever
*  not published a podcast? No, I have not ever done that. I mean, it would be hard. I was going to
*  say it'd be hard for me to imagine doing that, but I guess it's not hard to imagine if someone
*  came on who was truly obnoxious and, you know, violated the spirit of the podcast, then maybe
*  I just would not go ahead and not publish it. But I'm the one who is inviting people on. So I try
*  not to invite people like that. You know, many of the people I invite on I haven't really interacted
*  with before, so it's always possible. If people didn't want their conversation published after we
*  had recorded it, but before I had posted it, then I would not post it. I'm not going to force people
*  to, you know, put up something that they said, even if they don't want it said before. In fact,
*  you know, that's a very general rule. I'm not there's no gotchas here on the Mindscape podcast.
*  I want people to be happy with what they said. So some people said something and want to like,
*  correct it or just delete a little bit. That has happened. People have said, Oh, you know,
*  I said this thing, I realized now I was wrong. Could you edit that out before you post the
*  episode? And then I will do and I that I have done like literally only once or twice in 150 episodes,
*  but willing to do that. Yes. Okay, two more questions that are being grouped together.
*  They're about UFOs. Ben Turner asks actually they're about Bayesian analysis and UFOs. So
*  that's the best. Ben Turner asks a priority question. Can you please help me frame how to
*  be a good Bayesian with respect to the credences I assign to the possible explanations to the Navy's
*  UFO reports? And someone labeled naive Bayesian says, taking a Bayesian approach, how would you
*  decide between UFOs being aliens and UFOs not being aliens? What is the bare minimum evidence
*  you would require to change your mind a blog post grainy videos? What would it have to be?
*  So to the first question, the being a good Bayesian, you know, being a good Bayesian means
*  you have some priors, some prior credences before any new data comes in, and then you update them
*  when new data comes in. So a lot, a huge amount of the difference between perfectly sensible people
*  about the whole UFO issue comes into the priors. And Bayesian analysis does not tell you how to
*  make the right priors, even if there is such a thing. People have tried very hard to come up with
*  what it might mean to have the right priors in a very general sense, but no one agrees about that
*  as far as I can tell. So what is your prior that there are intelligent, technologically advanced
*  civilizations on other planets that send rockets to buzz us, right, send some sort of vehicles to
*  fly around in our atmospheres. You know, my my prior for that is very small. And that's where almost
*  all of the leverage comes from for me. The other part is the likelihood function. So given a certain
*  theory, how likely is it that you would see this data? And here all the Bayesians should agree it's
*  not like the priors. Everyone, as I said before, as I said in a book once, everyone is entitled to
*  their own likelihood, sorry, to their own priors, but not to their own likelihoods, the likelihood
*  of the data given the theory. So if your theory is not specifically there are aliens that are flying
*  around in UFOs, but your theory is just there are technologically advanced aliens, that's theory
*  number one. Theory number two is there are not. Okay, so those are the two theories we're trying
*  to compare. What is the probability that even if there were not super advanced aliens visiting us
*  here on Earth, that nevertheless there would be reports of fuzzy objects that we see with our
*  eyes or with our instruments and can't explain? To me, the probability of that is just about one. Of
*  course that's going to happen, you know, of course there's always things just at the edge of what we
*  can see, they're not very clear and our imaginations run wild. So the data that has another fuzzy
*  picture or another fuzzy video of something does not move me very much at all. Plus the fact that,
*  you know, that is, I think it's something that everyone should have. The difference in priors
*  comes from the fact that to me it is entirely implausible that if there were intelligent aliens
*  they would fly all the way here to visit us here on Earth. Okay, so number one, that's already a
*  lot, like how did they know that we were just becoming technologically advanced right now?
*  Number two, they would buzz us in the atmosphere in small spaceships that tried in some sense to
*  remain hidden from us but failed, right? So they have enough technology to fly interstellar
*  distances, to zoom around, stay mostly hidden from us, but not advanced technology enough to stay
*  completely hidden from us or not enough common sense to do that. That just makes absolutely no
*  sense to me, that is a completely crazy theory in my mind. So I don't give it zero credence but I
*  give it very very small credence, whereas people over interpreting grainy photographs and videos,
*  that I give very very high credence to. So to Naive Bayesian's questions, what would it take
*  to change my mind? You know, I mean let me sort of re-answer the previous question as a way of
*  answering this one. To me it's very much like evidence for the existence of God, right? There
*  are things that religious believers take as evidence for the existence of God. In my mind,
*  if I try to be a good Bayesian and say, what would the evidence be if God really exists?
*  If there existed an omnipotent being that really cared about us, omnibenevolent, loving human
*  beings, that would be very very very obvious in my mind. God would not be hiding, God would not be
*  difficult to discern, God would not allow people to fight and kill in his name and misunderstand
*  what he said. It'd be absolutely trivial for God to make himself perfectly 100 manifest, right?
*  You can always after the fact come up with justifications for why God doesn't do that,
*  but that's not what a good Bayesian does. The good Bayesian is supposed to say ahead of time,
*  what would your expectations be? An update on the basis of the data there. So you can always come up
*  after the fact with reasons why aliens might come around and visit us but remain hidden,
*  but fail to remain perfectly hidden, but it's not at all what I would expect. The evidence that I
*  would expect if it were really true would be the aliens would just come down and say hi,
*  or they would remain hidden. Those are the two obvious things. This weird in-between thing
*  is extremely unlikely. So the minimum evidence that we require to change my mind,
*  I'm not sure what the absolute minimum would be. The number, no amount of grainy videos will do it,
*  let's put it that way. I think something much more direct, something that cannot be easily explained
*  away. By the way, if you're into this thing, just go on YouTube and look for people who've done a
*  really thorough job in explaining how all of these videos can be very, very easily explained without
*  using any aliens or super high-tech things whatsoever. There's much more down-to-earth
*  explanations for this stuff. Dan O'Neill says, are there major discoveries that you think would have
*  been made by the superconducting supercollider that are beyond the powers of the Large Hadron
*  Collider? What justification might be offered now for building a collider more powerful than the LHC?
*  So the superconducting supercollider, which was canceled back in the 90s, would have been higher
*  energy and I think also higher luminosity than the Large Hadron Collider. I'm not sure about the
*  luminosity thing. Luminosity is how many collisions per second, but it certainly would have been
*  higher energy. So energy is everything when you do this kind of particle physics at colliders,
*  because E equals MC squared and you want to make high mass particles, you need to have a lot of E
*  so you can get a lot of M. And so therefore it's absolutely plausible that there are many, many
*  particles that the SSC would have found that the LHC is not, just because the LHC doesn't quite have
*  enough energy to get there. Now it's also absolutely plausible that there are none, right? There's
*  basically a range of energies that the SSC could have explored that the LHC has a lot of trouble
*  exploring and maybe there's a lot of particles there, maybe there aren't. That's the difficulty.
*  We don't know ahead of time what the answer to an experimental test is going to be because we haven't
*  done the experiment yet. That's why people are really, really invested in these precision
*  measurements like the muon experiments that we talked about on a previous podcast, because even
*  if you are able to find something in one of these precision experiments, you generally only measure
*  one number. You don't know exactly what is the underlying mechanism that is creating it. To really
*  understand what's giving you that number, you need to build a bigger particle accelerator. So if these
*  muon experiments that seem to indicate maybe tentatively, possibly, new physics beyond the
*  standard model are verified and turn out to be correct, that would be very strong motivation for
*  building a collider more powerful than the LHC. Kathy Seeger says, what are your favorite places
*  on Earth and where would you like to travel to in the universe if you'd had an interstellar
*  spaceship at hand? I think these are two separate questions, Kathy. There is a limit in the rules
*  that you're only supposed to ask one question, but somehow I forgot to edit this and I just asked them
*  both out loud, so let me give you a stab. The favorite places on Earth question is a weird one,
*  actually. It's a very obvious natural question to ask, but it sort of assumes that there's
*  a place you'd rather be than any other place. I actually like being in different places at
*  different times, you know what I mean? I love going to Paris, for example, or to Florence,
*  or to Hong Kong, or to Las Vegas, various places around the world. New York City,
*  Boston, San Francisco. I'm a big city guy more than an out-in-the-country guy,
*  but I'm very glad that I don't have to get stuck in any one of those places.
*  I like the big cities, the excitement, the experiences, the idea that each night when
*  you spend a week in a place you can go to a different kind of experience every night,
*  whether it's food or entertainment or just hanging out with friends or something like that. Those are
*  my favorite kinds of places. If I were able to travel anywhere in the universe, the universe is
*  mostly dangerous and boring, right? Most places in the universe, and the least boring places are the
*  most dangerous ones. It'd be fun to visit near a black hole and measure the gravitational field
*  and understand whether or not Einstein's theory of general relativity was correct. That's something
*  I would like to do, but I would worry about miscalibrating and falling in or finding myself
*  in the middle of an accretion disk or something like that. If I had enough knowledge to be safe
*  about it, I would like to visit close to a black hole and be equipped to do some experiments.
*  David Silbert says, my question concerns probability in an ever-readying universe.
*  You address this in the big picture, but mainly from the perspective of how we should think about
*  probability if many worlds is true. Whereas to me, probability is a major issue that many
*  worlds needs to explain. In particular, if a measurement has, say, two possible outcomes,
*  why don't we always observe them as being equally probable? So I almost didn't answer this question
*  because I've answered it many times. There's a blog post that I've written that you can Google,
*  called, why probability exists in quantum mechanics or something like that, or why
*  probability is given by the wave function squared, something like that, where I try to answer exactly
*  this question. You mentioned the big picture. Now, maybe that was a typo and you meant to say
*  something deeply hidden, which is my book about quantum mechanics. But if not, if you really meant
*  the big picture, then certainly you should read something deeply hidden, because that's where I
*  explained this in detail. So I'm not going to rehearse every single answer that I have, but let
*  me just give you my one favorite short answer to this, which is that it can't possibly make sense
*  to give equal probability to getting any experimental outcome when there are only two
*  experimental outcomes, because of what is called, I think David Wallace labeled it, diachronic
*  inconsistency. So which means that it's not consistent over time, right? So if I have two
*  spins, and apologies for those of you who've heard me give this example before, but I'm going to
*  give this example before. But if I have, let's start with one spin. I have one spin that is in
*  pointing the X direction, which means that it is a 50-50 chance that if I measure it to be spin up
*  or spin down, I will get spin up or spin down, right? Or at least I can get either one. Let's not
*  presume the probabilities ahead of time. If it's a spin X plus X, and I measure it along the Z axis,
*  I could get either spin up or spin down. So I'm going to agree ahead of time that I'm going to do
*  that. I'm going to measure that spin. And if I get spin down, I'm going to get another spin,
*  which is also in the X direction. I'm going to measure it again. Okay, if I get spin up for the
*  first spin, I won't. So I measure only one spin if I get spin up the first time, and I measure two
*  spins if I get spin up spin down the first time. What that means is after measuring the first spin,
*  I have measured one spin and there's two possible outcomes with spin up or spin down, right? So 50-50
*  chance of getting either one according to this rule. But now I measure two spins on the down
*  branch, right? I say, well, if I measured spin down, I measure the spin again, and I get either
*  up or down for the new spin. So now there's three outcomes. There was either just spin up, or there
*  was spin down and spin up, or spin down and spin down, because I measure two spins if I measure down
*  initially. So if I did those right one after the other, I would say I get three answers, and I
*  should give them all equal probability one-third, one-third, one-third, okay? That clearly doesn't
*  work, right? Because why is it that the probability you assign to getting spin up changes just because
*  you're measuring a different spin on an entirely different branch of the wave function? It turns
*  out that the only assignment of probabilities that is consistent diachronically that does not change
*  if you fiddle around with different kinds of experimental apparatuses is the Born rule. Is
*  that the probability is given by the wave function squared. That doesn't mean it's right,
*  but it's the only one that doesn't have that problem. So you judge about whether it's the
*  right one or not. Jesse Rimmler says, I recently watched a Q&A with Noam Chomsky, where he was
*  asked to comment on the hard problem of consciousness. Here's my summary of his response.
*  In the 17th century, the hard problem was motion. The great thinkers of the time assumed the
*  universe itself was mechanical. Newton unintentionally showed that this model was hopeless. His theory
*  crucially involved forces that cannot be captured within the mechanical philosophy. Mechanical in
*  this sense is sort of you can directly see the gear wheels. This is me, Sean, interpolating into
*  the question. But rather than just saying this happens, you actually provide a physical mechanism
*  of things touching each other to explain why it happens. Okay, so back to Jesse's question.
*  Newton's explanation was mathematical, but Newton didn't believe it was an actual explanation. What
*  Newton showed, this is we're still paraphrasing Chomsky, what Newton showed is that we can
*  understand a theory, but not what it means. Thus, the question of motion was abandoned,
*  and science reduced its goals to finding intelligible theories. This was the correct
*  thing to do, and now the same should be done for consciousness. We can find out more about it
*  and develop theories, but we should abandon the idea of solving this current hard problem.
*  My question, says Jesse, is Chomsky's description of the history of science eccentric, or does this
*  square with your understanding, and do you agree with the understanding of the of abandoning the
*  hard problem of consciousness? Yeah, I would change the wording around in very minor ways,
*  but mostly I think I completely agree with what Chomsky is saying here. You know, I'm not quite
*  sure I would go along with the idea that Newton's theories were not an actual explanation. Newton's
*  theories fit the data, but they did not provide you this mechanical insight, in particular,
*  because there's action at a distance, right? The gravitational pull on the earth from the sun,
*  or something like that, is just assumed to exist and be instantaneous. There's nothing
*  connecting the sun and the earth in this particular view. What I would say is not that that doesn't
*  count as an actual explanation, but it doesn't count as the particular type of explanation that
*  you were hoping for, in terms of some mechanical gear wheels, or whatever. So I wouldn't say that
*  it's not an explanation, just not the kind that you were hoping for ahead of time. And I do think
*  that that is something that scientists have to be open-minded about. That when you ask, well, why is
*  this true? You always have to be open to the possibility. The answer is, well, it's just like
*  that. There's no special kind of mechanism that fills your pre-existing idea of what would count
*  as a solution to the problem. And that's exactly what I think is going on with the hard problem of
*  consciousness. I don't think that there will be a breakthrough where we say, oh yes, now we've
*  solved the hard problem. I think that, so the hard problem of consciousness, sorry, for those who don't
*  know, rather than the easy problems of consciousness, how do we see things? How do we process information?
*  How to react in the world? David Chalmers has isolated the hard problem as the first-person
*  experience. Why do I have the feeling that it is like a certain experience to, you know, see the
*  color of red or taste a certain color or something like that? The intrinsically subjective first-person
*  part of conscious experience. Explaining that is the hard problem. And the claim in certain circles
*  is that that can't be done with a purely physical view of the world. And I think it's just going to
*  be wrong. I think it's going to evaporate. It's not that there'll be a breakthrough where we say, now
*  this is the answer. It's just that we get better and better at understanding what happens in the
*  brain and in human behavior and in human thought. And we say, that's it. That's what consciousness is.
*  It's all that stuff happening. So that is the extent to which I agree here with Chomsky. I think
*  that the hard problem will evaporate rather than being explained by some brilliant insight.
*  Joy Colbeck says, what is chirality? Chirality is just handedness. Handedness in the sense of
*  right-handed versus left-handed. You know, if you hold up your hands in front of you so that your
*  thumbs are pointing up, the fingers on your right hand are moving in one direction. If instead of up,
*  you point your finger, your thumb at yourself, the fingers in your right hand are pointing
*  counterclockwise. The fingers on your left hand are pointing clockwise. So that's that difference
*  between right-handed and left-handed. That's what chirality is. It applies in particle physics
*  because there are particles, especially it makes a lot more sense when you talk about massless
*  particles. So that you have particles moving at the speed of light all the time, right?
*  So if a particle moves at the speed of light, you cannot go into its rest frame. It is always
*  moving at the speed of light. And so there is always a well-defined notion of the direction
*  in which it's moving. Count that, count the momentum of the particle as like your thumb.
*  And then the particle can be rotating. It can be rotating in around that axis, either clockwise
*  or counterclockwise. So there are left-handed particles and right-handed particles. That's
*  what chirality is. The fact that there can be both left-handed and right-handed particles.
*  And there's the additional interesting fact that in the standard model of particle physics,
*  these particles interact differently. The SU2 part of the weak interactions interacts with
*  a left-handed part of particles, not with the right-handed part. That's a fact about nature
*  that is kind of interesting. Joe Lertola says, I believe you said in your book something deeply
*  hidden, that there's a certain weight that's divided between the branches of the many worlds.
*  You said the branching would not continue forever. I found this quite surprising. How do you know this?
*  Well, I don't know it. So I'm sure I didn't say that it would not continue forever. It might not
*  continue forever. So the branching that is going on, and I mean, let me back up here a little bit,
*  because this is going to come up later in the AMA. There's a very common feature when you try to
*  explain physics using words, but not equations, that you're doing your best to translate very
*  particular, specific, rigorous equations into pre-existing English language vocabulary.
*  Okay. And so when you talk about branching and splitting and all this stuff, it's a close
*  approximation to what happens. But what we mean is very specific and definite. It has to do with
*  decoherence and entanglement and the environment and all these extra things that you don't
*  necessarily keep in your intuitive picture when you talk about branching. But the point is
*  that it's possible, I even think it's likely, that a region of space corresponds in quantum mechanics
*  to a finite dimensional Hilbert space. That is to say, there are only finite number of independent,
*  completely orthogonal quantum states that could possibly say or describe what is happening in
*  this region of space. And you can take that region of space to be our whole observable
*  universe, right? Tens of billions of light years across, a finite dimensional Hilbert space.
*  It's still a big number. The finite dimension is still like 10 to the 10 to the 122 or some big
*  number like that, but it's still finite. So if branching happens all the time, which it does,
*  then it can't happen forever because there's only a finite number of branches you could possibly fit
*  into Hilbert space. What this actually corresponds to dynamically is all of the branches begin to
*  look alike. And that's true because the universe expands, it empties out, every single branch of
*  the wave function begins to look like empty space with nothing in it. That's the highest entropy
*  state. And it's a state where all the branches look alike, which means that it doesn't make much
*  sense to talk about them as separate branches anymore. Okay. So it's not that there is like a
*  cessation of the evolution of the universe. It's just there's an equilibration. It's like the ice
*  cube melting into a glass of water. At some point it melts all the way and then it doesn't melt
*  anymore. It's done all the melting it's going to do. That doesn't mean the glass of water disappears
*  into the void. It still exists. Likewise, the universe and the wave function of the universe
*  will still exist, but there's just not going to be anywhere more for it to evolve into a higher
*  entropy state anymore. Alan White says, Alice has an electron. I sure hope that this is the drummer
*  for yes that is asking these questions. Alan White says, Alice has an electron when she measures the
*  spin, the universe splits. Bob has an electron that is entangled with Alice's. So she immediately
*  knows it's spin as well. Bob is far away. So he will have to wait a long time to learn Alice's
*  result, or he can measure his own spin. However, if he measures the spin, the wave function does
*  not split. I find this very confusing perhaps because I'm expressing it in words rather than
*  mathematically. See, I told you the whole words versus math thing would come back up. So again,
*  I've said this before, but I'll try to say it again, because not everyone hears everything I say
*  for some reason or another, and also because saying things slightly different ways is sometimes
*  helpful. The idea of taking the wave function of the universe and describing it as a set of branches
*  is very, very convenient. It is a useful thing for we human beings to do because what we label
*  as different branches don't interact with each other. They act like they're independent separate
*  worlds, thus the many worlds interpretation. But the universe is the set of all of the branches.
*  Okay. And so you need to ask the question, what is the best way of taking the universe, the whole
*  wave function and dividing it up into branches? And it's not obvious that there's a right way or
*  a wrong way. So in my view, it's up to you whether you say that when Alice measures for a spin,
*  Bob, the wave function of the universe instantly splits everywhere, including where Bob is,
*  or you have some patchwork quilt of branches, which says that in Alice's future light cone,
*  the wave function of the universe branches, but outside it doesn't. So in that view,
*  Bob doesn't split until Alice's light cone begins to intercept him. So what this means for Bob is,
*  let's take the first point of view. Let's say that when Alice measures her spin, the whole universe
*  instantly simultaneously splits in some reference frame and you can pick what reference frame it is.
*  It doesn't matter for any possible observational outcome. So now there are two copies of Bob,
*  right? It's not that there is Bob with one spin. There is a version of Bob on the branch where
*  Alice measured spin up and a version of Bob on the branch where Alice measured spin down. So as you
*  say, when Bob then measures the spin, the wave function doesn't split. That's true because it's
*  already split, right? There are two different Bobs. They're both measuring a spin, which is
*  guaranteed in each case to give them a definite outcome. So there you go. In the other point of
*  view, where the branching happens with the speed of light, but no faster, rather than
*  simultaneously, then when Alice and Bob measure their respective spins, splitting does happen in
*  both cases, but the different branches get knitted together when their light cones begin to overlap
*  in such a way that where Alice measured up, Bob measured down and vice versa. So it all works out,
*  but there's a little bit of arbitrariness here in how we divide up the universe into branches.
*  Valer O says, is there anything you had believed in but completely changed your view on?
*  I should have grouped this with a later question, but that's okay. Yeah, sure. I mean, obviously,
*  I used to be very young. I used to be a kid and I believed all sorts of crazy things. I believed in
*  psychic powers at one point in my life as a child. In university, I believed that you could
*  develop rigorous scientific notions of morality and ethics based on nothing but science.
*  I completely changed my mind on that. In more late in life terms, I believe that the cosmological
*  constant was zero pretty strongly, but my belief in that went away because we had data that
*  that really changed its mind. In more personal ways, I believed that it was really, really
*  interesting and important to think about all the different ways that the accelerating universe would
*  be caused by something other than a cosmological constant. So dynamical dark energy or modifying
*  gravity to get rid of dark matter or dark energy. But working on those ideas over and over again
*  as a theorist and then in watching the data come in again and again favoring the good old-fashioned
*  ideas. I'm not sure that those ideas are wrong, but they're less urgent to me. They seem like
*  less likely to lead to a breakthrough. So I changed my view on that. So yeah, I changed my
*  view about all these things. I've changed my view about the importance of the budget deficit. I used
*  to really be thinking that the federal government should always balance the budget every single year,
*  but I know better than that now. I think it was a very naive economic point of view.
*  Not to say that you should let the budget deficit grow without any bound whatsoever,
*  but it's very natural to have a deficit, to have a small amount of inflation, to let that encourage
*  growth, etc. You know, pay back some of the debt when the economy is growing. There's a whole much
*  more sophisticated view that people should have and that I had than what I had, is what I'm trying to
*  say. Gillis15 says, I live in Denver but I'm now a native New Mexican, so I'm curious about how you
*  ended up being an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute and have you visited the Los Alamos
*  National Lab? And regarding New Mexican food, red or green? So those of you who've been in New Mexico
*  know the state official question is red or green and it corresponds to the color of chili that you
*  want on your food when you're eating it. Do you get red chili or green chili? I'm definitely a red
*  chili guy. That's a very easy question. Sometimes I'll feel adventurous and go for the Christmas
*  option, which is half red and half green, but I can't imagine just straight green unless it was a
*  very specific dish that called exactly for that. I've not visited Los Alamos, no, at least I don't
*  think so. Certainly not for many, many years. I don't think I ever have, I'm pretty sure.
*  For Santa Fe, you know, it was always a natural fit for me, but one that never just quite
*  came to fruition. You know, back when I was in graduate school, I think that was when SFI was
*  founded, or at least it was founded not long before I entered graduate school. And, you know,
*  I had on the bookshelf that I was gradually accumulating these big red volumes of conference
*  proceedings from conferences at Santa Fe about quantum cosmology and complexity and entropy and
*  information that I thought were all fascinating and interesting. But just in the circles that I
*  moved in as a professional cosmologist and gravitational theorist, that really didn't
*  overlap very much with what Santa Fe did. Once I became interested in entropy in the arrow of time,
*  there was a more natural connection. And so I went to a couple of workshops there at SFI, and I loved
*  it. And they at least tolerated me or enjoyed having me there. So they invited me to be an
*  external professor. That's basically it. You know, I talked to them, we interacted, it all went well.
*  That's just about it. Chris Dillon says, how likely do you think it is that humans will one day
*  develop a technology that can be used as Laplace's demon? Will we ever be able to reconstruct a
*  historical event down to the finest detail? No, zero likely. 0.00001% likelihood. Because it's gone,
*  because the data, the information that was in any particular historical event, some of that was in
*  the form of photons being radiated away into outer space. And there's no way we can catch those photons.
*  They're moving away from us at the speed of light. Furthermore, we can't build something as delicate
*  enough to measure all the photons or atoms in anything, in any macroscopic thing. In a tiny
*  molecule we can, but once you get to a big macroscopic scale, it's just impossible. You
*  don't have the resolution. Literally, you don't have the resolution because if you used high enough
*  energy photons, right, short enough wavelength to give you resolution on all the microscopic
*  locations of the particles, you would also destroy the thing you're looking at and you would not be
*  able to measure the whole thing. So that is completely 100% implausible to build or even
*  come close to building Laplace's demon, which is why it is absolutely just a thought experiment,
*  nothing more than that. Casey Mahone says, you've totally persuaded me on many philosophical ideas,
*  but there's one I just can't side with you on. That's the principle of sufficient reason.
*  In my mind, if there are two possible ways for the universe to be, there's got to be some kind
*  of explanation for why it is one way rather than the other. Could you go a bit deeper in how you
*  justify the existence of brute facts in the world? Well, you know, I think that the
*  the burden of proof is on your side, Casey, not on my side. You know, you're saying there has got to
*  be some kind of explanation for why the world is one way or the other. Why? Why does there have to
*  be some kind of explanation? I mean, I can understand that you would be interested in
*  getting some kind of explanation, but there's no logical reason why there has to be. To be more
*  substantive about it, there's the whole philosophical thought experiment of possible worlds, right,
*  we think about different possible ways the world can be. David Lewis was the philosopher who was
*  the master of this, but it's an absolutely central idea for any human being, possible worlds, even if
*  they don't use that vocabulary. Whenever you say, you know, oh, I put on the wrong socks this morning
*  because I didn't have my coffee yet. What you're imagining in your mind is that there's another
*  possible world in which you did have your coffee and you did not put on the wrong socks, right?
*  You're comparing what actually happened to a different possible world. And I think that as
*  far as physics or even physical events are concerned, it is very easy and straightforward
*  to imagine other possible worlds. And so what picks out this world as the best, as the right one,
*  right? Given that there's more than one possible world, the fact that we live in one rather than
*  the other is going to have to come down to a brute fact, right? I could be wrong about that. I mean,
*  that's trying to be logically reasonable, but that's what goes into my mind when I think about
*  this. And I'm not afraid of brute facts. You know, these questions about why things are eventually
*  going to bottom out somewhere. I can't see how it could be any other way. Ken Wolf says, have you
*  had any exposure to East Asian pop culture, whether it's manga, anime, Hong Kong cinema,
*  or anything else? And if so, is there anything you found particularly memorable? Not really. No,
*  honestly, like I've had the usual amount of exposure that a typical American of my age and
*  socioeconomic status would have. So certainly, I grew up watching Godzilla movies and Japanese
*  TV shows from Ultraman to Speed Racer. These days later in life, I've watched the Studio Ghibli movies,
*  Hong Kong cinema, you know, I'm married to someone who has a black belt in jiu jitsu. So
*  there's a lot of Jackie Chan and Xiao Yong fat movies in our rotation. But I'm not in any sense
*  an expert nor is it in any sense central to my pop culture diet in any way. Like I try to keep my pop
*  culture diet somewhat eclectic and diverse. And so East Asian pop culture is part of it, but it's
*  not something that I'm in any sense an expert in. Tim Kennedy says, I was very interested in your
*  recent podcast with Henry Farrell and the concept of epistemocracy. What are your own thoughts on
*  weighting voting impact with some sort of coefficient, like contribution to budget or
*  some other relevant metric that might govern how much say someone should have in the running of
*  things? I think that's a terrible idea. Sorry, Tim, if you like this idea, I'm not sure. But
*  it's just incredibly rife for abuse, right? It's once you say that not everyone's vote counts
*  equally, but rather some votes are more important than others, someone's going to have to decide
*  what the importance is and the people making those decisions, guess what, they're going to
*  weight things so that their votes count more. That's just always going to happen. So I think
*  it's just opening yourself up for all sorts of abuse. In particular, the idea of weighting votes
*  by contribution to budget is more or less the opposite of what I would do. We should weight the
*  votes for negatively for people who have a large contribution to the budget, or we should push them
*  down to zero because they influence the process in other ways, right? Rich people have a hugely
*  outsized impact on the current way the government goes. To also give them more oomph to their votes
*  would be just bringing coals to Newcastle, as it were. And besides that, I think, so those are
*  just all practical considerations. There's also a philosophical consideration. What Henry and I
*  talked about is the idea that democracy does a better job than you might think at solving problems.
*  Like if you have a bunch of people in a room and they're faced with a task and they organize
*  themselves along different lines, whether it's an autocracy or market system or democracy,
*  Henry's point is that a democracy is better than you might have thought at solving problems.
*  But it's not the point. That's just a bonus. That's not why we have democracy. We have democracy
*  because we had the idea that all people are created equal or should be or should be treated
*  as if they are. Every person has a voice and has a right to have something to say in how the country
*  is run if they want to have such a voice. So that's for me the reason why everyone gets an
*  equal vote, not because I think that they're smarter or better or contributing more or anything
*  like that. That's not just not a consideration when you decide how to count votes. Jason says,
*  is the black hole information paradox really a paradox at all in all interpretations of quantum
*  mechanics? Spontaneous collapse theories, as I understand them, are not fundamentally information
*  conserving. How is Hawking radiation different from any other seemingly random quantum event?
*  I'm including this in the list of questions even though my answer is I have no idea.
*  I do not know what someone who believed in spontaneous collapse theories would say about
*  Hawking radiation. I'm not someone who follows spontaneous collapse theories. I'll elaborate on
*  that later in the AMA. But that is an absolutely interesting question, which is why I'm saying it
*  out loud anyway. A lot of people in the area of fundamental physics, particle physics, cosmology,
*  string theory, gravity, all those things are more or less implicit Everettians, even if they don't
*  care about the foundations of quantum mechanics so they wouldn't necessarily characterize themselves
*  in that way. Deep down, that's what they are. Not everybody. Tom Banks, for example, is a famous
*  counter example. I think he's basically close to an epistemic person when it comes to quantum
*  mechanics. A new and improved Copenhagenist in some kind of way. But most people are basically
*  Everettians and that's why it makes sense to them to say in the absence of some measurement process,
*  evolution should be unitary. You're completely correct. If you don't think evolution should be
*  unitary at all, even if there's not a measurement going on, then your attitude toward the information
*  puzzle might be very, very different. I'm not sure what it would be. That is my point because I haven't
*  actually followed that stuff. I should also say one more thing, which is that the reason why I don't
*  know might very well be that that's just not the kind of thing that advocates of spontaneous collapse
*  theories spend their time thinking about. This is one of the things that I try to emphasize,
*  but I think is underappreciated, which is that all of the non-Everettian approaches to
*  foundations of quantum mechanics, whether it's spontaneous collapse, hidden variables,
*  epistemic theories, etc. It's a community that thinks very, very hard about non-relativistic
*  quantum mechanics, about quantum mechanics circa 1930. They're not thinking about quantum field
*  theory, quantum gravity, string theory, black holes, or anything like that. There's a reason why,
*  because all of that stuff doesn't fit in very well with these alternative theories of quantum
*  mechanics. They go to great lengths to make a theory of an electron and an atom, but making a
*  theory of space-time itself is just a very, very different thing. You have to start from scratch
*  in any of these theories. This is part of the motivation for my mad dog Everettian approach,
*  because Everettian quantum mechanics is the one approach that says, if you give me the Hamiltonian,
*  as we say, the energy of a quantum system, everything else is supposed to be emergent.
*  You don't need to do any more work in putting more ontology in or more dynamical rules in.
*  All of the other approaches involve either new elements of reality or new dynamical rules or
*  whatever. Once you have a different system, you go from a single particle to a field to space-time,
*  you have to reinvent what all those new rules are. In Everettian quantum mechanics, you don't.
*  There's something you do need to do, which is to show where all the structure in the world comes
*  from, why there are tables and chairs and branches and things like that. That's what I and others
*  are trying to do. Chris Rogers says, I just bumped into a TV editor I know who tells me he's working
*  on a documentary series about the universe. Apparently, there's an episode all about the
*  Big Bang and in part what happened before the Big Bang. I asked what that could possibly mean,
*  and he said, apparently they have some new data that allows us to understand the universe before
*  the Big Bang. I'm English, so I just nodded politely. This can't be right though, can it?
*  Well, it depends on the reference to the word this in this sentence. Chris, I'm a big believer
*  that it might very well have been a universe before the Big Bang. My first trade book,
*  called From Eternity to Here, outlines exactly such a theory of my own. But what I bet with
*  pretty good credence is that they're talking about Roger Penrose's conformal cyclic cosmology
*  models. Penrose, former Mindscape guest, has proposed a model of cosmology where once the
*  universe empties out and there's nothing but empty space, a miracle occurs and it suddenly
*  becomes a hot, dense, expanding Big Bang kind of universe. What he claims is that evaporating
*  black holes in the previous universe can leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background in the
*  next universe. Furthermore, he and some collaborators believe that they've seen
*  these imprints of these evaporating black holes. That's probably what they're referring to when he
*  says some new data that allows us to understand the universe before the Big Bang. But essentially,
*  nobody else believes this other than Penrose and his collaborators. There's plenty of working
*  cosmologists who will be very, very happy to find evidence of a pre-existing era of the existence of
*  the universe in the cosmic microwave background. None of them believe the claims that are being
*  made by Penrose and his collaborators that they found such evidence. And of course, even though
*  Penrose is a co-author on the paper and believes and accepts these claims that there is such
*  evidence, he's not the one who did the analysis, right? I mean, he's one of the world's great
*  mathematical physicists, but he is not a cosmic microwave background data analyst. That is a
*  different skill set. He needs to trust the people he's working with and the other experts in the
*  field don't trust them. I'm not an expert in that field either, so I'm just going to go with the
*  majority in this particular point of view. Anders Hechter says, it'd be very interesting to hear
*  you describe the principle of conservation of information without using the word information.
*  Sure, that's very easy to do. I've done it many times. Principle of conservation of information is
*  just the idea that the state of the universe at any one point in time plus the laws of physics
*  determines the state of the universe at all previous times and all subsequent times.
*  That's it. That's what the conservation is. The use of the word information is just a translation
*  of the term the state of the universe into something a little bit more graspable and quantitative.
*  ACAC. I'm not sure if that's an acronym or it's ACAC, but that person says,
*  on your 70th episode of Mindscape with Professor Katie Mack, you mentioned that you like the term
*  smooth tension for dark energy. I was surprised to hear that and thought it was kind of cool
*  because Professor Edward Copeland also mentioned that he likes that term smooth tension.
*  I'm pretty sure you were on Brady Horan's YouTube channel, 60 Symbols, where Professor Copeland is
*  often featured. I have to ask, did you ever get to hang out with Brady's crowd? Did you stay in
*  touch? Do you have any cool stories? Is there a secret smooth tension movement in the physics
*  community? Yes, the term smooth tension goes back to a review article on dark energy and the
*  accelerating universe that I wrote in the early 2000s where I pointed out something that many
*  other people have pointed out, which is that dark energy is not a very good name for dark energy.
*  I mean, dark matter is not a great name for dark matter. It is matter, though, the dark matter,
*  rather than being radiation or something else. Okay, so that's at least somewhat informative.
*  And it is dark, but the more important thing about dark matter is that it's transparent,
*  right? It's invisible. So calling it invisible matter would have been more accurate, but it
*  would sound spookier. So maybe dark matter is fine. Dark energy, likewise, it doesn't glow.
*  So it is dark, technically speaking, but again, it's invisible. That's the important thing,
*  not the fact that it is not glowing. And yes, technically it's energy, but everything is energy.
*  Everything has energy. Matter has energy. Radiation has energy. So you're just not conveying a lot of
*  information when you say dark energy. The important thing about dark energy, besides the fact that
*  it's invisible, there's two important facts. One is that it is everywhere, right? It is spread
*  smoothly throughout the universe. It does not clump into galaxies and stars, so it is smooth.
*  And the other important feature is that it has a negative pressure. Rather than pushing, it pulls.
*  If you had a bottle of dark energy, it would be like having springs inside the bottle pulling on
*  the edges, pulling them together, a kind of tension. The gravitational effect of the dark
*  energy is to push the universe apart, but the energy itself has this negative pressure, aka
*  tension. So I proposed, half-jokingly, that it would be more accurate to call it smooth tension.
*  Okay? It was not ever of the misguided opinion that it would catch on, other than as a
*  half-hearted joke. It is more accurate than dark energy, but the labels that we put on things in
*  science are not necessarily chosen for their accuracy. Whichever is the first one to stick,
*  sticks. And then you're stuck with it, right? Quantum mechanics is not a great name. Relativity
*  is not a great name, but those names have stuck. So yes, Ed is a friend of mine, and he read the
*  article and he liked it, so he's been another proponent of smooth tension. But I don't really
*  hang out with those folks. They're in a different country. Brady Huron lives very close to Ed
*  Copeland and all the other people who appear on 60 Symbols. I'm not going to start listing them,
*  because I'm going to leave some out and then insult them, but it's a great YouTube channel.
*  If you haven't watched it at all, I always call it 60 seconds, for obvious reasons, but it's called
*  60 Symbols, and they do a great job talking about different aspects of physics. I've talked about
*  quantum mechanics in the arrow of time there. Randall Newman says, can you talk about how you
*  go about deciding on what problems to solve, and more importantly, what your research process is
*  like? What tools do you use? How do you work out proofs and experiments? How do you collaborate
*  with others? Actually, let me combine this with a question from Umberto Nani, who says,
*  may you please comment on how you select an idea to pursue it to be the matter of a paper, an
*  article? How do you decide the worthiness of something as you decide to work on it?
*  Both questions are about deciding what problems to work on as a scientist and then the process
*  by which you're doing it. If you want more details on this, I did, again, write blog posts. I wrote
*  a series of three blog posts a few years ago called Anatomy of a Paper, part one, part two,
*  part three, where I took a paper that I had recently written with Lottie Ackerman and Mark
*  Wise, and I explained where the idea came from, how we worked it out, how we collaborated,
*  all those things. It was a nice paper about what the microwave background would look at if the
*  universe were anisotropic on very large scales. If it had accelerated during inflation, for example,
*  at different rates in different directions. That's a kind of overall cosmic anisotropy.
*  We worked out from the idea what the paper would look like and we published it. If you want some
*  details there, it'll be longer than the following answer. These are good questions because as a
*  scientist, once you've forgotten about getting your job and getting your grant money and all
*  that stuff, you're always faced with the fundamental issue of what to work on. As a theoretical
*  physicist, especially where you don't have a giant laboratory, you don't have a lot of
*  superstructure built around you, you might think, well, I could work on a different thing after
*  every paper is done. But of course, that's not completely true because you have areas of expertise,
*  you have questions you have cared about in recent times, you have students and post-docs who you're
*  working with, other collaborators who you might be working with who have their own interests.
*  There's a very natural way to build on what you've already done. That's the most easy thing in the
*  world as a working scientist is just to do a little bit more on what you've done outside.
*  But otherwise, the way that you come up with a problem, there's no algorithm. There's no simple
*  answer to that question. You can either take a question, an issue that has existed for a while
*  and you're just chewing over it. Why is the past different from the future? What happened at the
*  Big Bang? How does gravity work really? Where does space time... All these big, big questions,
*  and you can just sit and think about them in some idealized sense. Mostly, it doesn't happen like
*  that. Mostly, what you're doing is you're interacting. Mostly, the ideas for papers
*  come from not sitting by yourself in your ivory tower, but from reading other people's papers,
*  talking to people one-on-one or one-on-several, going to talks that other people give, reading
*  papers that appear in the archive, things like that. You are constantly bombarded by other
*  people's ideas and different scientists will have different levels of openness to those ideas. Some
*  people are just very focused on their current problem and couldn't really care less. Other
*  people are always interested in digging into what other people are working on and therefore
*  thinking about them in new ways. Sometimes, people are dramatic in how they change what they're
*  working on. Jeffrey West is a great example of that. He was one of the first Mindscape guests
*  where he was originally doing work on particle physics, supersymmetry, phenomenology, as we call
*  it, inventing new models of other particles. When the superconducting supercollider got canceled,
*  as we just said, he said, nope, I don't want to do this particle physics stuff anymore. I'm going
*  to switch fields entirely. He became a complex systems researcher. He now writes books on scale
*  and cities and biology and things like that. There's no algorithm. You have to chase what
*  you think is interesting. Think about puzzles. There's a huge number of puzzles out there in
*  the universe that we don't know the answer to. The art form is to formulate a puzzle that is
*  answerable or at least progress can be made on it in some way. To talk about Randall's question
*  about what tools, what proofs, et cetera. I'm a theorist. I use pen and paper, pencil and paper.
*  I use pens more than pencils. That doesn't mean I don't make mistakes. It just means I cross them
*  out. These days, sometimes I use the iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil. It's all scribbling down ideas,
*  equations, working them out. A lot of my physics papers are in collaboration with graduate students.
*  That depends a lot. Very often, I have an idea because I'm the old head. I've been around for
*  a while. I would say it'd be interesting to think about this, go off and think about it. We try to
*  see whether with conversation, can we come up with a particular angle on the question that is
*  work on-able, publishable, able to write something. There's constantly a question in the academic
*  community. What is the least publishable unit? You make some progress. You learn something.
*  Is it just something that is amusing to you? Do you write it up, but then just share it as notes
*  on your web page? Or is it worth actually publishing as a paper? These are ongoing
*  conversations and it's not very clear. In many ways, it's something you learn by doing. You can't
*  actually be handed the right answer to this. You have to actually take things up and decide for
*  yourself where it's going. DLP says, is it accurate to think of observing a quantum state as merely
*  becoming entangled with that state? It's close, but I wouldn't put it exactly that way. It depends
*  on what you mean by observe, obviously. In the traditional Copenhagen-esque way of thinking about
*  things, the thing doing the observing is ultimately a person, a conscious agent. They might use some
*  apparatus or whatever, but the observation itself inheres in the act of the agent doing the observing,
*  and that's why the word observing made sense. John von Neumann extended the formalism a little bit
*  so that not only did small quantum systems like an electron with a spin or something like that
*  have a wave function, but he allowed the measuring apparatus to have a wave function also. He did not
*  allow the observer to have a wave function, though. Everett was the one who really pushed the idea that
*  even the observer should be part of the wave function of the universe. Once you get to the
*  Everettian way of thinking about things, there's no special role of observing. The observer is just
*  another quantum system with a lot of degrees of freedom. We change our focus from the word observing
*  to the word decohering. That's what really matters in Everettian quantum mechanics.
*  Decohering comes from the idea that there are quantum systems that are typically microscopic,
*  but they're in superpositions of different possibilities. There's also an environment
*  that we don't keep track of. Many, many degrees of freedom, particles flying around in the air,
*  in the photon bath in which we're all embedded, stuff like that. The branching of the wave
*  function of the universe to an Everettian, that's what matters. That happens when decoherence occurs.
*  Decoherence is the tiny quantum system becoming entangled with the environment. In that more
*  modern framework, yes, entanglement is completely central, but it's not entanglement with the
*  observer that matters. It's entanglement with the environment. The observer is already entangled
*  with the environment, so they go along for the ride in a very trivial way. Two questions I'm
*  going to group together, which is really weird because I've literally never had questions about
*  this topic before, and now I've got two of them. They're both about what is called the master
*  equation. Jeff asks a priority question. I'd be grateful if you could discuss the master equation
*  in quantum and classical physics without shying too much away from the mathematics of it. David
*  Wright says, I was reading one of Steven Weinberg's essays on quantum mechanics in his view on some of
*  its remaining issues. He mentioned that the wave equation is actually a special case of the more
*  general Lindblad master equation. The Lindbladian models the time evolution of non-equilibrium
*  open systems and would seem to be very useful for dealing with processes above the fundamental
*  scale. I'm curious why the Lindbladian is not more widely referenced in the scientific literature.
*  There are two things going on here. There's the idea of what is called the master equation,
*  which makes it sound a little bit more important than it is. Master equations apply whenever you
*  have something that has a probability attached to it. If you have some process, whether it's
*  flipping a coin or the state of a spin or something like that, a spin is being buffeted by
*  thermal fluctuations around it. The master equation just shows you how a certain probability
*  distribution evolves over time. Typically, a master equation is just linear. What that means is you
*  start with a probability distribution for different possible states of the system and you act a simple
*  linear matrix on it to get you the rate of change of that probability distribution. You call that
*  the master equation. It appears, as Jeff says, both in quantum and classical physics.
*  The Lindblad equation is a specific example of that kind of thing, but it's a little bit more
*  general. As David said, it's an equation for the density matrix, which is a quantum mechanical
*  generalization of the probability distribution of a classical system. It's not strictly just
*  multiplying a matrix by the density matrix. That's why it's a slight generalization.
*  This is obviously a very powerful and important idea. There's plenty of circumstances in which
*  you have a probability distribution. You want to ask how it evolves with time,
*  but there's a huge, huge problem with these equations, which is that they often don't work.
*  The master equation, the Lindblad equation, etc. work in very specific circumstances,
*  and in other circumstances they just don't work. The Schrodinger equation always works,
*  but it only works to the extent that you know the complete quantum system. What you're trying to do
*  with the master equation is to ignore some parts of the quantum system and focus in on some other
*  parts. That's why you have an open system. You have a system here which is not isolated from the world.
*  There's other parts of the world that could bump into it and affect it in some way, but you're
*  trying to say, what can I say about the evolution of this system without specifying what the rest
*  of the world is doing? You instantly see why that's difficult. You can say, here I am in my office
*  making this recording of the AMA. What am I going to do next? What's going to happen to me? How will
*  I evolve? That's a perfectly reasonable question. If the office was a closed system, in principle,
*  I could answer it, but the office is not a closed system. Someone could walk in the door. The phone
*  could ring. A meteorite could come down and smash into the house. Many different things could happen,
*  all of which would have a dramatic effect on how I would evolve in the future, and none of which
*  are sensibly modelable in any easy way. Who knows whether a meteorite is going to hit the house or
*  not? Typically, the restricted circumstances under which the Lindblad equation makes sense
*  is when you say, well, specifically, even though I don't know exactly what the environment is doing,
*  let's just say it's a uniform homogeneous thermal bath. There's no meteorites out there. There's
*  just the atmosphere at some temperature or something like that. Then you can do a pretty
*  good job, but really, if you really want to get an accurate description of what's going to happen
*  in my office, you have to include the possibilities that unanticipated things are going to happen from
*  the outside world. That's why you need a more general framework. Louis B. says, I've invented
*  my own interpretation of quantum mechanics called the one world interpretation of quantum mechanics.
*  It's exactly the same as many worlds, except all but one world collapses and doesn't exist.
*  Is there any material difference between my new one world interpretation and the Copenhagen
*  interpretation? Put another way, is the only difference between Copenhagen and many worlds
*  the claim that other worlds are real? Well, you don't yet have, Louis, an interpretation of
*  quantum mechanics. Sorry about that. You can't just say all but one world collapses and doesn't
*  exist. You have to say which worlds collapse? Is it random? Is it random in some measure?
*  Who chooses? More importantly, you have to say when the collapse happens. Does the collapse
*  happen? Do collapses happen when there's a certain physical criterion that is reached?
*  Or is it just stochastic? Does it happen occasionally? These are all different kinds of
*  ways that you can make something like that happen. Guess what? They've all been explored.
*  So something like Roger Penrose's attempt to interpret quantum mechanics is an objective
*  collapse model where the collapse happens when a certain physical threshold is reached,
*  when superpositions become more than the Planck scale or something like that.
*  Whereas things like the GRW theory are spontaneous collapses. So again, they only have one world,
*  but there's no special threshold that needs to be reached for a wave function to collapse.
*  It's just that wave functions collapse every so often. So they're different theories, right? But
*  also, most importantly, none of them are in any sense many worlds. The entire point of many worlds
*  is that the Schrodinger equation is always obeyed, right? The Schrodinger equation says that more
*  than one world will come into existence. So any other theory violates the Schrodinger equation,
*  modifies it, alters it in some way. That's fine. If you don't want all the many worlds,
*  then by all means, invent a new rule where you modify the Schrodinger equation. But this is
*  physics. You've got to tell me exactly what that modification is, very, very quantitatively and
*  rigorously and objectively. Until then, you don't quite have an interpretation of quantum mechanics.
*  Rodrigo Nader says, do you see emergence as a human concept or fundamental in nature? Is
*  it a consequence of our reality being shaped by patterns? I think emergence is a fundamental
*  thing. Well, I shouldn't use the word fundamental there because often emergence is contrasted with
*  fundamentality. There are fundamental parts of nature and there are emergent parts. But emergence,
*  I think, is built into the fabric of nature rather than just being a human concept. I think it's
*  actually an easy mistake to make or at least an easy confusion to draw because we often say that
*  emergent phenomena are ones where you can say something about the phenomenon without knowing
*  all of the microscopic details. You can say something about cream and coffee mixing together
*  without knowing everything there is to know about the individual molecules inside. That makes it
*  sound like it's just a convenience for human beings. We don't know everything, so we say
*  whatever we can. But the generic situation, if you didn't have specific laws of physics,
*  if you had general laws of physics that were not embedded in a certain way, in a certain framework
*  of locality and microscopic interactions and things like that, there wouldn't be anything you
*  could say from the low information point of view about the behavior of the system. It would be
*  necessary to know all of the details. Sometimes that is true in nature, right? Some things in
*  nature you would need to know all the details. Like you don't know when a particular volcano
*  is going to erupt ahead of time just by looking at it and knowing its macroscopic features. You
*  would need to know all sorts of microscopic features to predict that exactly, and you never
*  will. But there are other cases like the orbit of the earth around the sun where you don't need to
*  know all the microscopic features of all the particular atoms and molecules in the earth.
*  You just need to know its center of mass. So it is a feature of our laws of physics that it allows
*  these emergent behaviors in ways that human beings have observational access to the data you
*  need. Even though it's incomplete data, it's macroscopic rather than microscopic, it's still
*  enough to make reasonable predictions. And that's a nice feature of the laws of nature that didn't
*  have to be there. Okay, I'm going to group two questions together. One is from Abdul Avzal who
*  says, on one of your Reddit Q&As you mentioned that Tim Maudelein came close to changing your mind
*  on Platonism about math. I was curious to know his line of reasoning was and did you ultimately
*  not change your mind in the end? And then Michael Adelman said, have any of your guests strongly
*  influenced or changed your thinking on a particular topic as a result of the conversation you had? So
*  maybe this is a little bit of a stretch, gluing these two questions together, but the general
*  theme of changing my mind is once again here. For Tim Maudelein, you know, I'm going to be honest
*  here, more honest than I should be and say I don't remember specifically what it was that Tim said
*  because not that I haven't thought a lot about Platonism about math, but since talking to Tim
*  about it, I've talked to other people about it and there are arguments that are in my mind and they
*  have a certain salience, but I don't remember where they came from. I don't remember who told
*  me which argument. So I can't say exactly what it was in that particular conversation. The thing
*  that is, I'm still, and I'm still up in the air about this. I'm not a Platonist about math, but
*  I'm not strongly anti-Platonist. There might be some version of Platonism that I'd be willing to
*  sign on to. I just haven't sort of settled my personal beliefs about this. I think that one of
*  the things that gets me thinking that you need to take something Platonistic into consideration is
*  the idea of counterfactuals. You know, we talked earlier on about possible worlds and this is
*  something that is very important, a concept that you need to do physics or science or anything else.
*  You talk about other possible worlds, but if you're not Platonistic, if you don't think that math
*  exists out there as a real thing, maybe what you want to think, these are a whole bunch of
*  ideas that are mixed up together, but there's this humian idea that all that exists is the universe,
*  right? And sort of that's where I want to be. That's my natural happy place for me. All that
*  exists is the universe and everything else is we have a way of talking about it, including math.
*  But if all that exists is the actual universe, how can you talk about other universes? That's
*  hard. Like when you talk about other universes, you usually attribute to them the same laws of
*  physics and the same mathematical structure, right? But if those laws of physics and mathematical
*  structures don't have independent existence from our universe, what gives you the right to do that?
*  How do you know how to carry over the physics and math from one universe to another?
*  I don't think that this is a really killer argument, to be honest. I think that there are
*  ways to justify doing that, but on my own understanding of it, it's not quite sophisticated
*  enough to really promise you that I have the right answer where it comes to that. I'm still
*  thinking about that. And for Michael's question, have any guests on Mindscape, Tim has not been a
*  guest on Mindscape, but have any other guests changed my mind about something? Usually not.
*  It's not the standard thing. Sometimes I have a guest on who's talking about something that I knew
*  nothing about, right? So when Rachel Loudon is talking about the history of world cuisine,
*  she didn't change my mind, but because I didn't have many strong opinions about it, but I learned
*  a lot. So that's a kind of changing your mind. I mean, maybe Joe Walston, who talked about
*  urbanization and its relationship to the environment was something where I thought maybe
*  I knew a little bit, but I was wrong and I definitely changed my mind about that.
*  But I don't think I've had any epiphanies that really made me completely change my mind. The
*  talk that I did with Ned Hall actually touched on these issues of humanism and Platonism and so
*  forth. And so that is part of the conversations that are all mixed up in my brain about those
*  things. So maybe that had an impact also. Jan Smith asks a priority question, which is a
*  multi-part question, but I'll grant it this one time. The question is, what do you think of
*  Sabina Hossenfelder? She says the many-worlds interpretation does not solve the measurement
*  problem and she finds string theory not interesting. It has made some contributions to
*  mathematics, but even so, this would have nothing to do with string theory as an approach to a
*  unified theory. So I will interpret your question as what do I think of these particular opinions
*  that Sabina or beliefs or positions that Sabina holds? I don't want to talk about what I think
*  of individual people. Sabina is a friend of mine. She blurbed one of my books. I think she did. Or
*  I blurred one of her books. I don't remember. But she's a real physicist, unlike some commentators
*  on the internet about physics things. Sabina is an actual practicing real physicist and deserves to
*  be listened to. We also disagree about a bunch of things, just like I disagree with Lee Smolin
*  about a bunch of things or David Albert about a bunch of things. So she says the many-worlds
*  interpretation does not solve the measurement problem. I disagree. I don't know exactly what
*  she says about it, to be honest, but I've written a whole bunch about the many-worlds interpretation
*  and why I do think it solves the measurement problem. So you can certainly read that.
*  She finds string theory not interesting. That's great. That's completely allowed. I'm definitely
*  one who thinks that when it comes to unproven ideas in theoretical physics, we should have a
*  plurality, a pluralism of different approaches, diverse approaches, as I talked about in another
*  context with Musala Garbi some time ago. I believe in intellectual diversity when it comes to that.
*  So some physicists think string theory is not interesting. That's great. Others do think it's
*  interesting. That's also great, right? We don't know yet, I think, is my particular attitude.
*  A lot of the debate and discussion about something like string theory comes down to,
*  will it be correct? String theory might be correct. It might actually be that what we think of as
*  electrons and neutrinos and quarks are really little loops of vibrating string. In that case,
*  I certainly think that string theory is interesting, but we don't know, right? It might not be the case
*  that that's true. So it's just a judgment call. It's not really something that we can prove one
*  way or the other, and different people's judgments will differ. Anders says, do we think that black
*  holes erase information about baryon and lepton number? Yes, we do. So if you make a black hole
*  out of a bunch of baryons, for example, and then you let it Hawking evaporate, typically we think
*  that it will mostly evaporate into photons, a few gravitational waves or neutrinos. In rare cases,
*  it would emit a proton or an electron or an anti-proton or an anti-electron, but when it's
*  emitting photons, those photons have zero baryon number, and when it emits baryons, which it will
*  occasionally but rarely do, it's 50-50, we think, whether it emits a baryon or an anti-baryon. So
*  the general thought is that baryon and lepton number are not conserved in black hole information,
*  which it is also thought, and again, we don't know these things for sure, but the thought is,
*  this is a generic feature of quantum gravity, not just a particular feature of black hole evaporation,
*  but the general feature is that gravity doesn't know the difference between baryons and
*  anti-baryons, okay? Gravity knows how much energy you have or how much mass you have,
*  and if you believe in the basic principles of quantum field theory, baryons and anti-baryons
*  have exactly the same mass, so they couple to gravity in exactly the same way, so we wouldn't
*  expect gravity to care about whether or not it was interacting with a baryon or a lepton,
*  or a baryon or an anti-baryon, I should say. So generically, we expect gravitational interactions
*  to not conserve those quantities. We have never observed it, though. These are very, very weak
*  hypothetical effects. Edward A. Morris says, is it theoretically possible to have two particles
*  with the exact opposite wave functions so that they perfectly cancel each other out and disappear
*  like sound waves in noise-canceling headphones? So yes and no. I mean, strictly speaking, the answer
*  to that is no, because what you're doing is you're thinking about wave functions
*  to literally like waves. Wave functions are not waves. The difference is that every particle
*  doesn't have its own wave function, right? There is only one wave function for all the sets of
*  particles in the universe, so you can't have the wave function of particle one and the wave function
*  of particle two interfere with each other, because interference happens only between two different
*  instances of the same thing, but what you can have and what you might be thinking of is two different
*  contributions to the wave function of the same particle can interfere with each other. Indeed,
*  that's exactly what happens in the double slit experiment. In the double slit experiment,
*  you get an interference pattern which can be thought of as one part of the wave function of
*  the particle interfering with another part of the wave function of the same particle.
*  Ron Gryber says, what would Laplace's demon think about the three-body problem? More directly,
*  in a deterministic universe, how should we think about chaos and randomness that can't be backward
*  resolved or forward predicted? Laplace's demon has no trouble whatsoever with the three-body
*  problem or the Avogadro's number of bodies problem, because Laplace's demon, by construction,
*  has perfect information about the universe and perfect ability to calculate. Now, as we already
*  discussed earlier in the AMA, no real computer or person ever has that, so for real things in the
*  universe, when you have chaotic behavior, you cannot predict exactly what's going to happen on
*  sufficiently long time scales, but Laplace's demon doesn't exist. Laplace's demon is a thought
*  experiment with perfect information, so I think that's a distinction worth drawing. Laplace's
*  demon is a thought experiment in principle if you really had perfect information. All the discussion
*  about how chaos theory says you can't make predictions is only in practice, in the real world,
*  but even before we knew about chaos theory, no one in their right mind thought you could make
*  perfect predictions about the future in practice, because none of us is close to being Laplace's
*  demon, so there's no sense in which chaos, etc., etc., overturned the idea of Laplace's demon.
*  Bill Warner says, I understand classical uncertainty. There are some pairs of quantities
*  such as position and velocity or frequency and phase that are defined in such a way that the
*  more you know about one, the less you know about the other, but Heisenberg introduced Planck's
*  constant h to this otherwise unremarkable relationship, and it's totally thrown me off.
*  How am I to interpret Planck's constant in the context of uncertainty? So you've thrown
*  together a bunch of things that don't quite fit. You say some pairs of quantities such as position
*  and velocity or frequency and phase are defined in a way that the more you know about one, the less
*  you know about the other, but that's not true. Position and velocity are an entirely different
*  case than frequency and phase in classical mechanics. In classical mechanics, there's no
*  uncertainty relationship for position and velocity. In classical mechanics, you can know exactly,
*  if you're Laplace's demon, for example, you could know precisely the position and the velocity of a
*  particle. There's absolutely no reason why not. Frequency and phase are defined for waves, not for
*  particles, and to discuss the frequency of a wave or the phase of a wave, you need more than
*  information at a point, right? You need to understand what the wave is doing over some finite
*  interval, and so when you have a wave like that, then there is uncertainty between quantities like
*  frequency and phase, but particles don't have that uncertainty at all in classical mechanics.
*  The reason why they have it in quantum mechanics is because particles are now waves, right? They
*  are wave functions, and the things that we call position and velocity are not properties of those
*  waves. They are potentially observable quantities, and quantum mechanics, famously, the whole point,
*  the whole reason why quantum mechanics is hard is because what is observable is not what exists
*  when you're not observing it. So this wave-like thing exists, the wave function, when you're not
*  observing it, but then when you measure it, when you observe it, you see either position or velocity,
*  and there are ways of extracting information about that wave function that are incompatible
*  with each other. If you get definite information about position, you have completely destroyed
*  information about velocity in quantum mechanics or vice versa. So it is purely a quantum
*  mechanical phenomenon that this uncertainty principle applies to things like electrons or
*  quarks or so forth. Douglas Albrecht says, the wave function for a single particle allows for
*  probability of a superposition of very different positions. These distances could be further than
*  the speed of light would allow. Why is this any less strange or different from the spooky action
*  at a distance when we try to understand entanglement? So I think you got to clear
*  some things up again, once again here. The wave function for a single particle allows for a
*  probability of a superposition of very different positions. Yes, that is true. You say these
*  distances could be further than the speed of light would allow. By itself, that sentence doesn't
*  quite make sense. What you might mean is, if you were to measure the position of a particle,
*  then you find that it is somewhere and you know instantly that it is not somewhere else,
*  and that somewhere else could be further than the speed of light away. It almost inevitably would be,
*  in fact. So you need to include the measurement process there. Just having a wave function spread
*  out doesn't have anything to do with the speed of light. So the point you're trying to make is,
*  when I observe the position of a single particle, the wave function changes simultaneously all over
*  the universe. And that sounds like it is incompatible with special relativity, just as much as Alice and
*  Bob and Entangled Particles does. So the reason why we always talk about the Entangled Particles is,
*  you're imagining a world where the current theory of quantum mechanics isn't necessarily the final
*  theory. This whole discussion is in the context of, could we improve quantum mechanics to a
*  position where these puzzles don't occur? And so if all you had were one particle, you could always
*  imagine the wave function was somehow just a way of talking about your uncertainty about it,
*  your lack of complete information. And you could imagine that when you observe its position,
*  you're learning something about the universe you didn't know before, but you're not changing the
*  universe in any particular way. The particle was always located there, you just didn't know it.
*  Okay? You can get away with that if you just have one particle. If you have two particles and they're
*  entangled, you can no longer get away with that. That's the point of the Bell Inequalities. John
*  Bell showed that there's no way to secretly have real once and for all true information about the
*  spins or momenta of entangled particles in a way that is purely classical and yet purely local.
*  At the same time, and be compatible with what we now know are the experimental outcomes. So you
*  really need that entanglement there to get something that you would call a puzzle in the first place.
*  Abdulrahman Al-Jourbuah says, I am wondering about your opinion on procreation from a moral
*  standpoint. I don't have much of an opinion about procreation. I'm not even sure what you're getting
*  at. Whether it's like good to procreate or bad to procreate, I think the procreation is more or less
*  morally neutral. I don't think that that is an intrinsic good or an intrinsic bad. You know,
*  if you've been listening for a long time, you know that I am a moral constructivist. I'm not a moral
*  objectivist or a moral realist. So I don't think that there are once and for all rules built into
*  the structure of the world that tell us what is right and what is wrong. We invent the rules,
*  okay, ultimately. And there's still rules. They're still there and they still mean a lot to us and
*  it matters what rules we invent, but they're subjective. They're things that we construct
*  as human beings. So it seems clear to me that some people are going to be very much in favor
*  of procreating and some people are not and that's fine. As long as they don't interfere with each
*  other's choices, that's completely fine. Even though that answer I just gave you was kind of
*  uninteresting and unilluminating, the reason why I included this question was because I think that
*  there is an interesting difference. Well, this kind of question, I guess I should say, is what
*  one of the things that leads me to be skeptical of utilitarianism. Utilitarian approaches to morality
*  try to invent a quantity that they call the utility, the net utility of everything that happens.
*  They say that the idea is to maximize the utility and there are various thought experiments that show
*  that if you really wanted to maximize the utility, you would make as many people as you could. You
*  would procreate like crazy. Even if those people were miserable, you could always make enough of
*  them that there would be more utility than otherwise. And that's just very counter to my
*  own moral intuitions entirely. So I do think that thinking about giving birth to new generations
*  is an important thought experiment for moral philosophy, but I don't have any strong opinions
*  about whether it is intrinsically good or bad. Vladimir Joff says, is the Higgs field
*  potential the same across space-time? If it's not, does that mean the masses of particles like
*  electrons will be different in different parts of the universe or changing over time?
*  So today, in the universe today, so that is to say at a slice of space-time, which we can call
*  space at this moment of time in some reference frame that you pick, the Higgs field is constant
*  everywhere. So there's a good reason to think that it's built into the fundamental equations,
*  it's not varying or anything like that. So we do expect the masses of electrons or quarks to be
*  the same everywhere in the universe. However, even though the potential, which is the sort of
*  equation or the function that sets the minimum value of the Higgs field is constant, the actual
*  value that Higgs field takes is not constant over time. That's because in the early universe,
*  when there's a lot of heat and thermal radiation and things like that, the effective potential,
*  as we call it, changes because the Higgs field is buffeted around by all the hot plasma interacting
*  with it all the time. And rather than falling down to some non-zero value and giving mass to
*  particles at very high temperatures, the Higgs field sits at zero value at the center of its
*  potential rather than at the brim of the Mexican hat where it usually lives today. So the Higgs
*  field is not constant over time. And indeed, the mass of the electron or the mass of the quarks was
*  zero at early times. Now, even saying that, you have to be careful because the mass is zero in the
*  vacuum, but you're not in the vacuum, right? You're in this plasma. And so there will be plasma effects
*  that can in some sense give particles, who are charged particles, an effective mass, but that's
*  a more complicated thing. To answer your question, the Higgs field value is not the same in space time,
*  but it is the same throughout space today. Josh says, what are your thoughts on the ship of
*  Atheus? So I think that you mean the ship of Atheus, unless there's a different ship
*  I don't know about. The ship of Atheus is something that I talk about in the big picture,
*  actually, so you can read about it there. It's a thought experiment where Atheus has a ship,
*  very famous, ancient Greek hero. They preserve the ship, put it in dry dock as a little
*  memorial or whatever. But then over time, different parts of the ship kind of rot away and they have
*  to be replaced. And eventually, like every individual piece of wood on the ship has been
*  replaced by another piece of wood, but it's still in the shape that the original ship had. And so
*  the question is, is that still the ship of Atheus? Like if you replaced one piece of wood,
*  then it would still be the ship of Atheus, right? But if you replace all the pieces of wood, then
*  maybe you're thinking it's not anymore. So what's the cutoff? And I think, you know, yeah, I think
*  this is an important thought experiment. And the reason why I think it is, is because to me,
*  the answer is perfectly obvious, which is that the notion of continuity of identity over time
*  is a macroscopic approximate emergent notion. It's not fundamental. The reason why I talk about it
*  in the big picture is because I'm talking about living beings, right? People change over time,
*  too. They're the actual atoms in their body get replaced. Many of them do over time.
*  And they maintain more or less the same shape, but not exactly like, you know, you look older
*  20 years later than you look today, etc. You have more memories, all of those things, but there's
*  some notion of continuity. That notion of continuity has to do with the pattern being described over
*  time, rather than the specific atoms of which you are made. And I think that's the lesson of
*  the thought experiment of the ship of Atheus. If you want to push it, so the extra bonus level of
*  the thought experiment is, well, what if they repaired all those pieces of wood in the ship,
*  but someone had saved all the original ones, and then put together all the original ones? Would
*  that be the ship of Atheus? And you can say the same thing about people in thought experiments,
*  like Derek Parfit had his famous teletransporter thought experiment, where you get into a Star
*  Trek like transporter machine, but by mistake, it creates two copies of you rather than just one,
*  which is the original. Clearly, this has some relationship to the many worlds interpretation
*  of quantum mechanics, right? There's one of me right now, if I generate a quantum random number
*  and branch, then there'll be two of me. Which one is the real one? Well, the answer is neither one.
*  There's no such thing as the real one. They're both continuous in some sense with that original
*  pattern. And we should give up on treating identity over time as some fundamental feature
*  of the universe because it's just not. Jim Murphy says, as an eternalist, I know you view all of
*  time is equally real. I wonder if the same could be said about all of Hilbert space. Is it likely
*  that all possible states of the universe are equally real? Or is it more likely that many
*  of these states will never be reached? It's a slightly tricky question, because on the one
*  hand, I want this goes back actually to the Platonism question. On the one hand, I want to say,
*  what's real is the universe. Okay. And, but the universe at different times, not just the
*  universe at one time. So from the Hilbert space point of view, what that's saying is,
*  what's real is a path through Hilbert space that is followed by the quantum state of the universe
*  as it evolves. So you can think about that, you can be mathy about it. And you can say, well,
*  does the wave function of the universe evolve through almost all of Hilbert space? Or does it
*  stay confined to a small region? And the answer is actually, wait for it, it stays confined to a
*  small region, the wave function universe never evolves all through Hilbert space, if the universe
*  is a closed system, which I take it to be. So in some sense, quantum mechanics only uses a tiny part
*  of Hilbert space. So maybe only that part is real, and the rest is not. But that's weird,
*  because the whole Hilbert space is a much simpler mathematical structure than just the
*  tiny part that is actually used. So I don't know is the short answer. And this is very much in line
*  with me not having strong opinions about mathematical Platonism. When you say is this or that
*  mathematical structure or physical hypothetical structure real or not? I don't know. I'm more
*  comfortable saying that other moments of time are real, because they're physically really there.
*  But parts of Hilbert space that the universe never reaches, I'm less sure about one way or the other.
*  I mean, probably if you force me, if you gun against the head, I would say,
*  we use the idealization of Hilbert space, but it's not real. There you go, the parts that we
*  don't reach should not be considered real, but I'm not 100% devoted to that opinion. Nicholas Weiberg
*  says, if closed time like curves existed, what would the experience be like to travel around one?
*  Specifically, what would happen with the thermodynamic arrow of time? So closed time like curves,
*  like curves are, you know, subsets of space time in universes where you can start from one point
*  on the closed time like curve, locally travel forward in time along that curve. And yet you
*  come back to exactly the same event in space time, the same point in space and moment of time,
*  not just the same point in space at a different moment of time, that would be a closed time like
*  curve. They probably don't exist in the real world. So that's the simple cheating answer,
*  you know, they don't exist. But you can ask, could they possibly exist and what that would be like.
*  So it's almost inconceivable that anything macroscopic could literally travel around
*  a closed time like curve, you could travel around pretty close, right, you could imagine a person
*  starting on a closed time like curve going around the loop and coming back almost to where they
*  started. But they can't come back exactly to where they started because their earlier self is there,
*  they're in the way, right? They haven't left because it's the same point in space time.
*  And you can't really imagine just joining back up. That's not a physically realizable circumstance. So
*  maybe you can imagine a certain individual photon that is perfectly on a closed time like curve. But
*  even that I wouldn't really take seriously. So most of the time when physicists are talking about
*  traveling around a closed time like curve, they mean traveling within some set of space time that
*  consists of closed time like curves, but not literally on the same curve. And about the
*  thermodynamic arrow of time, nothing weird happens. You would have to have entropy increasing,
*  how that's supposed to work out. Okay, that's a good question, right? Like,
*  entropy increasing is a feature of the whole universe, whereas closed time like curves
*  map different parts of time on to each other in interesting ways. So the way I like to say it is,
*  the reason why we have trouble with time travel at all, is because you think, according to the laws
*  of physics, that the past is fixed, and the future you can make choices about, right? That's the arrow
*  of time gives you that impression. Of course, if you were Laplace's demon, that wouldn't be true,
*  but you're not. Okay, so you think you can make choices about the future. But the existence of a
*  time machine or a closed time like curve mixes up your individual notion of the future with the
*  universe's notion of the past. And then it's hard to make sense of these particular things. You would
*  have to tell me exactly what kind of scenario you meant or you had in mind with the closed time like
*  curves. But my impression was any working scenario would have the arrow of time going on as always.
*  Maybe there are no working scenarios like that, that I'm not sure about.
*  David Grimes says, PBS Space Time recently published a video explaining that the lack
*  of a theory of quantum gravity leaves us with no real sense of what happens to a black hole just
*  before Hawking evaporation would dismantle it. There might not be a allowed transition to permit
*  the black hole to emit a necessary final photon with sufficient energy for it to pop and thus such
*  plank relics that might have been formed in the extreme energy densities before and during
*  inflation might account for dark matter. Since such relics would have the plank mass and event horizon
*  spanning the plank length, is there any reasonable prospect that we'd be able to observe them or rule
*  out their existence? So yeah, so the idea here in case that wasn't sufficiently clear, my reading of
*  it, most of the time when we think about black holes evaporating, we imagine they evaporate all
*  the way, they completely disappear. But we're not sure about that. It's possible that they evaporate
*  just down to the plank energy and they stop. So you're left with a little relic or a little remnant.
*  Now there are very good reasons to not believe that, okay? If those relics existed, they would
*  have a lot of entropy, sorry, not a lot of entropy, but there would be a lot of different ways of
*  making them, let's put it that way. And therefore, they could have bad effects in virtual processes,
*  Feynman diagrams, things like that. There would be a lot of different kinds of black holes that
*  could do a lot of different kinds of things to particle physics. So it's a very, very, it's not
*  a very popular theory, let's put it that way. But maybe they're there and maybe they could be the
*  dark matter. However, there's another puzzle, which is where did all these black holes come from?
*  So in this scenario where black holes are the dark matter, you have to imagine you've made a huge
*  number of black holes and then they almost completely evaporated away. Most versions,
*  there are stories of how black holes could be produced in the early universe and be the dark
*  matter. But in those stories, usually the black holes are taken to be pretty massive, right?
*  You know, the size of the earth or something like that or Jupiter or whatever. And so there's a lot
*  of mass in each black hole, so you don't need to make as many of them. If your black holes are only
*  the plank mass, you need to make a huge number of them. And how do you do that? That's just very hard
*  to imagine. Finally, to actually answer your question, as far as I know, no, it would be very,
*  very, very hard to detect them if the dark matter is plank mass particles with plank scale
*  interactions. Plank scale interactions are very weak interactions. They're gravitational strength
*  interactions. And if you think about it, you know, the plank mass is 10 to the 18 times the mass of
*  a proton. So if the, even if the density of dark matter is five or eight or whatever times
*  the total density of ordinary matter, the number density, the number of particles per cubic centimeter,
*  if they're plank mass relics, is very low, very tiny compared to the number density of ordinary matter.
*  So number one, the chance that you would actually run into one is much smaller than for other
*  theories of dark matter where the particles are much less massive and they're more numerous in
*  the universe. And number two, they interact very weakly. So they're, they would be much harder to
*  detect than an ordinary conventional weakly interacting massive particle. Doesn't say you
*  absolutely can't, but it would be very, very hard to do. I know of no way that would be guaranteed
*  to be able to do it. Let's put it that way. Justin Bailey says, I know that measuring the spin of an
*  electron is subject to superposition, that is uncertainty. Are there cases where that is true
*  of the type of particle itself? Are there cases where a particle could be an electron or a muon,
*  an electron or a photon? So, you know, kind of. I wanted to say originally no to the answer to this
*  question. In practice, no. In practice, there are no cases where a particle could be an electron
*  or a muon. You could try to create one. You could try to create a wave function for the quantum
*  fields of the universe that was sort of half electron and half muon. But the point is that
*  because the mass of the electron and the mass of the muon are so different, the part of the
*  wave function that was electron would just quickly separate itself from the part of the
*  wave function that was a muon. Okay? So they would quickly distinguish whether it was one or the other.
*  There is one, and sorry, and if it's an electron or a photon, it's even worse because the
*  photon is always moving at the speed of light and the electron is electrically charged. So those
*  two particles are so different that there's never a case where it would be even tempting
*  to think about a superposition of two types of them. The one exception to that set of rules is
*  neutrinos because neutrinos are all very light. There are three kinds of neutrinos, electron
*  neutrinos, muon neutrinos, tau neutrinos. They have different masses, but they're all low mass. So
*  they're typically all moving close to the speed of light and they all have the same quantum numbers,
*  they're all zero charge spin one half. So you might imagine that you could create a superposition of
*  different kinds of neutrinos and guess what? You do. This is the whole subject of neutrino
*  oscillations. When you create a neutrino, you create an electron neutrino or a muon neutrino
*  or a tau neutrino. That's what happens in the particle physics process that makes a neutrino.
*  But there are also three different masses of neutrinos. There's the lightest one, the middle
*  weight one, and the heavyweight one. And I have to distinguish those because each mass state is a
*  superposition of the different flavors as we say in neutrinos. So the lightest neutrino is part
*  electron neutrino, part muon, and part tau neutrino, likewise for the middle weight neutrino,
*  and likewise for the heavyweight neutrino. So what this means is that the neutrinos can sort of
*  oscillate back and forth between different kinds. If they're moving through matter, then those
*  oscillations happen in a certain way that can be detected and help you explain the solar neutrino
*  problem. So these have been observed in experiments. Neutrinos really do oscillate and you can think of
*  that very much like the quantum uncertainty in a spin or something like that. Hilbert Spaceman says,
*  do you have any insight as to what motivates publish or perish from the perspective of the
*  people who run universities? Why are they biased towards frequent rather than high quality publishing?
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a good question. It's a tough question because different people are different,
*  right? I mean, you say the people who run universities, but there are presidents,
*  there are provosts, there are deans, there are chairs, there are faculty members who are in
*  their department and don't have a title but are nevertheless very influential. You know, it's a
*  whole bunch of voices come into this game and they don't all think in the same way. Certainly,
*  we would like to think that what matters is the quality of the research you do, right? But guess
*  what? How do you measure what the quality is? You know, one way is to read the papers, right? To read
*  what people actually have written. As a practical matter, if you're the provost, so you're overlooking
*  the tenure cases of every single faculty member in your university, you're not going to read all
*  their papers, you wouldn't even understand them. Most of them are in fields you know nothing about.
*  You have no way of judging whether they're high quality or not. The faculty should be able to do
*  a better job, but as you maybe know, in physics or biology or whatever, mathematics, these are
*  such highly specialized fields that it is very often difficult for even a person in the same
*  department to read and pass judgment on the papers written by somebody else. So we turn to proxies,
*  both because of the practical and the in principle difficulties of this. So you turn to how many
*  citations did the paper get? I think that that's one of the more reasonable proxies actually for
*  quality. High quality papers have a big impact, lower quality papers don't, but it's clearly not
*  a very good one. And even so, just to be clear, even if it's one of the better ones, that doesn't
*  mean it's very good, because obviously you can write a paper that is very, very important and
*  goes years without getting any citations. I know that because Steven Weinberg's paper establishing
*  the electroweak theory got no citations in the first several years after it was published,
*  and then it took off once we had reason to believe the electroweak theory was probably right, and it
*  became the most highly cited paper in all of physics. So you could have made a mistake if
*  five years after the paper was published you judged it on the number of its citations,
*  but even that's better than what a lot of departments do, which is just to look at
*  the journal you published it in. If you publish it in a high prestige journal, that counts better
*  than if you publish it in a low prestige journal. And the lowest possible filter, the dumbest
*  possible filter is, like you say, just how many papers are there that this person published.
*  I'll be very honest, I'm on various committees to look at prizes and things like that, and
*  if someone publishes too many papers, in my mind it can count against them. By too many papers,
*  I mean like there are people out there who publish over 50 or 100 papers a year.
*  That's like more than one a week. How do you do that? Well, clearly you're
*  barely reading those papers, much less writing them and doing the research. You're part of some
*  bigger group that is doing a lot, you're putting your name on it, maybe you're having many papers
*  that are very tiny variations on each other, and so forth. So there's a point of diminishing returns,
*  but all of this is to say that whenever you have a situation where many people are being evaluated,
*  sadly in the real world, the evaluations are not always going to be as careful as you would like
*  them to be, especially when they're being evaluated at a very high level by the provost, the dean,
*  the president of the university, or whatever. I'm not trying to excuse it, I don't think it's a good
*  system. I wish that there was much more room in academia for sitting and thinking for five years
*  and then publishing something really brilliant, rather than publishing several things every year,
*  none of which are brilliant. The obvious problem with that ambition is if you say,
*  okay, sit and think for five years, you don't need to publish anything, 99% of the people in that
*  system are not going to publish something brilliant. At the end, they're just going to
*  publish nothing. So at least if you're publishing lots of things, then you're doing something,
*  right? It's a very crude, very inadequate, very unsatisfying system, but it is hard to have
*  reasonable, realistic systems that would be completely different than that. Sherman Flips says,
*  you mentioned coming from a working class background. When you got into science and
*  philosophy, how did you find people to talk with about those things? Was it all people in the same
*  education system or did you find people elsewhere? Well, if we're talking about when I was in high
*  school, we didn't have the internet back then. I had to show my age here a little bit. And basically,
*  I didn't talk to people about science and philosophy. I was interested in science. I didn't
*  know anything about philosophy when I was in high school. I had smart people in my high school,
*  big public high school, smart friends and so forth, but science wasn't one of the things we
*  talked about. I was on the debate team and we talked a lot about policy questions because I was
*  on the policy debate team. So we talked about politics and economics and things like that,
*  less so about science. And when I got to university, I was surrounded by suddenly people
*  who did care about science and philosophy and I talked to them. So I didn't have any secrets
*  to reveal to you. Sorry about that. Michelard Zabo says, I'm having a hard time wrapping my
*  head around this fundamental principle that the laws of nature must be reversible. Information
*  must be conserved. In our everyday life, we are surrounded mostly by irreversible phenomena,
*  even when it comes to abstract things. So clearly not everything must be reversible. Why is it then
*  that the state transitions of the universe are such that a successive state is mapped onto exactly
*  one prior state? So I think I'm getting a different vibe from different parts of your question.
*  There's no fundamental principle that the laws of nature must be reversible. That's just not a
*  principle. That is a fact we figure out about the laws after we invent what the laws were. So
*  it's not that we start from a presupposition that the laws of nature must be reversible.
*  It's that we invent the best laws we can, whether you're Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein or whatever,
*  and lo and behold, they're reversible. They just are. And so we call that a principle that we
*  invented after the fact. In fact, it was literally Laplace who invented conservation information a
*  century after Isaac Newton had invented these rules that have this principle embedded into them.
*  So that principle could be wrong. We don't know what the fundamental laws are. Maybe they are
*  irreversible. But our best notion, our best idea today of what the fundamental laws are, have the
*  feature that they're reversible. That's just a fact. One of those brute facts about the universe
*  that I think we have to accept, as I said. Herb Berkowitz says, what did you think then and what
*  do you think now of the demotion of Pluto in the solar system? Good. So I'm glad you asked this
*  question because it's an example of me changing my mind. When that first came up, the whole demotion
*  of Pluto thing, I was on the side of the people who said, this is just silly. We've already labeled
*  Pluto to be a planet. Why are we working so hard to unlabel it? Just grandfather it in, call it a
*  planet, and then invent another definition of planet that will apply when we go to other
*  solar systems, other stars, things like that. But my mind was changed by talking to people who knew
*  more than I did. In fact, Mike Brown, who was a guest on the Mindscape podcast back in the day,
*  old school guest, for those of you newcomers, listened to the interview with Mike Brown. Mike
*  is the single person who is more responsible than anybody for getting Pluto demoted. Pluto killer
*  is his Twitter handle because he discovered all of these other objects in the Kuiper belt out there
*  in the outer solar system, which are just as big as Pluto, very Pluto-like. There's zero reason
*  to think that you should have Pluto be in one category and all these other objects be in another
*  category. So as Mike says, look, all of his incentive was to keep Pluto as a planet. In that
*  case, he would be credited for discovering more planets than any other person ever in the history
*  of astronomy. But he says, intuitively, that doesn't make sense. These are just little rocks
*  out there at the edges of the solar system. They don't deserve to be planets, and neither does
*  Pluto. And there is something important. There's a relationship. And I think this is the argument
*  that changed my mind from Mike and from others. There is a relationship between how we talk and
*  how we think. Language is arbitrary. We can invent whatever words we like. We can invent whatever
*  definitions we want to for the words. But if the words we invent and the definitions we have for
*  them don't map on to some feature of reality, then they don't help us think. Having a definition of
*  the word planet that can be extended beyond our solar system consistently, so we can say what we
*  call a planet and what we don't, helps us think about planets in a careful, precise way. And we're
*  entering an era now where we're discovering more and more planets around other stars. So now is the
*  time to get our house in order, to figure out what we mean by planet. There's really no good
*  definition of planet if you just came up with one carefully, by which Pluto would count. So now I'm
*  on the side where Pluto should not count as a planet anymore. Krather Luca says, can you explain
*  why Bayesian reasoning is not just inductivism with extra steps? And if it is, then why do you
*  believe it is important to try to be a good Bayesian? I think it's quite different, actually. I mean,
*  Bayesian reasoning can be thought of as what inductivism should have been all along. I hope
*  I'm interpreting the word inductivism correctly. I know what induction is. I presume that inductivism
*  means using induction to learn more about the world. So there's mathematical induction or
*  logical induction, which says, if I know something is true for, if I have a whole set of things,
*  thing one, thing two, thing three, thing four, etc. If I know if a certain property is true for
*  thing zero, the first thing, and I know that if something is true for thing n, then it is true
*  for thing n plus one, I can inductively demonstrate that that thing is true for all the things,
*  right? I go from the zero thing to first to second to third, etc. That's mathematical logical
*  induction. Zero problems with that. That's just logically completely valid. There's also sort of
*  a more empirical kind of induction, which is you say, oh, I see a swan and it is white. I see
*  another swan and it's white. Oh, look, I see a dozen swans. They're all white. I therefore
*  extrapolate out into the world and say swans are always white. Okay, that's a sort of more empirical
*  kind of induction. But that's also nonsense. As David Hume famously pointed out, all we have to
*  do is tomorrow see a black swan and we would change our mind. He wasn't using the swans,
*  I don't think, but other people have used that example. You can never be sure that tomorrow
*  you won't see a violation of your rule. You don't have certainty in that step that you have in
*  mathematical induction that if something is true for thing n, it must be true for thing n plus one.
*  That's what you're trying to prove. You can't assume it and therefore, and then draw a deduction
*  from it. What you should do instead is be a good Bayesian, which means rather than saying, oh,
*  I've seen 12 white swans, therefore all swans are white. You should say, well, I have a theory that
*  all swans are white. I have another theory that some swans are white and some are black. And I
*  give a certain credence, a priori prior credences to these two theories. And then I observed some
*  swans. And if I have a theory that says that half of the swans in the world are white and half are
*  black and they're equally distributed uniformly through the world, if I observe 12 swans in a row
*  and they're all white, that is very strong evidence against the 50-50 theory. If the swans cluster so
*  that all swans in the Northern Hemisphere are white and all swans in the Southern Hemisphere are black,
*  then the fact that I observe 12 white swans in the Northern Hemisphere is completely unsurprising,
*  gives me no evidence whatsoever. So that's the right way to do it, right? So it's not just
*  inductivism. It's the other way around. Inductivism is a sloppy preliminary version
*  of Bayesianism is what I would say. Harris Stark says, you said something along the lines of,
*  in your podcast, you want to let the other person speak and give them a platform to share their
*  ideas and opinions instead of you talking and giving your opinion. However, for me as a listener,
*  it is likely that I come to your podcast because I think you have valid and interesting opinions
*  and often would like to hear more about how you judge some ideas and your opinions on them.
*  What do you think of bringing more of your views into the podcast? You know, this is always a
*  balance, right? This is a perfectly legitimate question, but my attitude is, you know, I do want
*  to let my opinion be known and I try to do that in the podcast, in the conversations I have. When
*  I disagree with somebody, usually I will say that I disagree with them and I will even try to very
*  quickly give my reason why. What I don't want to do is debate back and forth. What I'm trying to
*  do is educate the people who are listening. So I want them to know what my opinion is and the
*  reasoning behind it. But really, I want you to know I'm bringing some experts, someone who knows a
*  lot about some subject, and I want you to think about what they're saying, whether or not you or
*  I agree with them. I want to enter into the mind space of thinking about what it would be like
*  to agree with them, right? To try to really understand where they're coming from, from their
*  point of view. Even with all that, the amount of time I spend talking in any one podcast is
*  smaller than the guest is spent talking, usually. But if I integrate over many, many episodes of
*  the podcast, I do a lot more talking than any individual guest does. So I think, and especially
*  because I have AMAs and solo podcasts and things like that, most people are going to hear my
*  opinions way more than any one guest on the podcast. I don't think there's any shortage
*  of my opinions being put out there into the world. And if you have, if you ever want to know more
*  about my opinions about some specific thing, here you are, here's the AMAs, this is a great time to
*  ask about them. Some of my favorite questions to answer in the AMAs are follow-ups to the podcasts.
*  I had people on the podcast for reasons. I think the way they say is interesting. And so,
*  talking about that stuff is a lot of fun to me. Hugh H. says, if a speeding cannonball travels
*  further than a Wimbledon cross court winner within the set time period given, and both balls are
*  released at the same moment, does the speeding cannonball also entangle with more particles
*  than the tennis ball on its journey? Good. This is a good question. It took me a while to sort of
*  interpret this question. What do you mean is if a big thing and a tiny thing are both moving the
*  same velocity, does the big thing entangle with more particles than the tiny thing?
*  No, roughly speaking, no. You know, there's probably some fuzziness around the edges here
*  because quantum mechanics is hard and there's a lot of approximations we're making. But the point is,
*  when a big macroscopic object is flying through the air, roughly speaking, it's not entangling
*  with anything at all. It's interacting with things, right? But the difference is
*  Schrodinger's cat, okay? In the case of Schrodinger's cat, you have a cat that is in a superposition of
*  awake and asleep, and that means that the two parts of the superposition of the cat are physically
*  located in different places. And therefore, a photon that has a location in space will hit the
*  cat if it's in one part of the superposition, but miss it if it's in the other one. And that's what
*  branches the wave function of the universe, and then it just has two different branches, one where
*  the cat's awake, one where the cat's asleep. But once that happens, once you're in one branch where
*  the cat is either awake or asleep, another photon either hits the cat or it doesn't, right? In one
*  branch, forget about the other branch, in any one branch, when you have a situation where the object
*  has some macroscopic coherence, a photon will either hit it or not. Neither one of those interactions,
*  hitting or not hitting, is an entanglement, right? Entanglement means different parts of the state of
*  one system become differently interacting with different parts of the state of the other system.
*  So in the case of Schrodinger's cat, you have the environment with all sorts of photons, and you have
*  the cat which is awake and asleep, and they become correlated, connected with each other. In the case
*  of a tennis ball or a cannonball or an awake cat, the photons either bounce off them or they don't.
*  There's no correlations that are induced by that. Again, this is not precisely true because the
*  photon could be in a superposition of being in one place or another place, and maybe the big object
*  has more of a probability to entangle with that kind of photon. But roughly speaking, once you're
*  classical, once you're big and coherent and in some branch of the wave function, you're not
*  constantly entangling with things around you. That's kind of a more special event.
*  Stefan Lyon says, in the biggest ideas, you briefly touch on the evolution of particles as they squeeze
*  past neutron degeneracy pressure, as in a collapsing black hole, and that the collapse becomes runaway.
*  You briefly mentioned quark stars, but past that point information everywhere seems to dry up.
*  Do we have any conception of what happens when quark degeneracy pressure is surpassed? So the
*  answer is yes and yes and no. Do we have any conception? The reason why we don't hear much
*  about it is that there is no reason we have to think that there is another step beyond quark
*  degeneracy pressure. What we're talking about here is when you have a white dwarf star.
*  So a white dwarf is a star which is given off. It's radiated all of its... It's not all the nuclear
*  fusion it's going to do. It's cooled off and shrunk and is held up by degeneracy pressure.
*  The electrons in the neutron star are packed as tightly as they can be packed. But if it
*  accretes more matter, Chandra Sekhar showed a long time ago that there is an allowed transition
*  where the electrons combine with protons to create neutrons and the whole thing just becomes a neutron
*  star. So there's a neutron has a much smaller wavelength than an electron does. So if you
*  convert all those electrons into neutrons plus the protons, the electrons plus protons get converted
*  into neutrons, the whole thing is much smaller and you get a neutron star. So you might ask,
*  as is being asked now, well if you just squeeze the neutron star what happens? It has a pressure,
*  degeneracy pressure from those neutrons. What if you have a gravitational force that is greater
*  than the degeneracy pressure? And the short answer is what we think happens is it just collapses to
*  a black hole. There's not like one or more or an infinite number of intermediate steps. It just
*  collapses all the way to zero. It's easy to say that but it's hard to prove because you're at this
*  interface of quantum field theory and general relativity, right? Which is a place where we
*  don't know a lot about. Plus you're into questions about quantum field theory and particle physics
*  itself that we just don't know a lot about. Are there smaller things than neutrons that it could
*  collapse into? And that's where you get strange stars and things like that. But the reason why
*  the information seems to dry up is because as far as we know there are no steps in between neutron
*  star and black hole. P. Walder says, are Bayesian and Popperian approaches to getting closer to
*  truth both valid or are they mutually exclusive? I should have combined this one with the
*  inductivism question because I would say the same thing. Namely that the Popperian approach to truth
*  is a crude approximation to the Bayesian approach to truth. And not everyone would agree with that
*  but I think it's right. What Popper says is imagine all the theories. Imagine all possible
*  hypotheses. He had a book entitled Conjectures and Refutations. So imagine all the possible
*  conjectures you should make about the world. And what you should do according to Popper is treat all
*  of them as potentially true and collect data that says oh nope that one is false. So you slice away
*  the false ones bit by bit and you're left with the truth. That is the Popperian way of reaching the
*  truth. So this is not what people actually do for all sorts of reasons. Mostly because just like
*  with the induction discussion we had before it assumes a level of certainty or of definitiveness
*  that is never there in the real world. When you have a conjecture, let's say your conjecture is
*  Newtonian gravity is correct. That's your conjecture. You do an experiment and you find that you are not
*  agreeing with the prediction of Newtonian gravity. Do you throw away Newtonian gravity? Well you know
*  we did that for the motion of Uranus. You know when the planet Uranus was discovered and we
*  tracked its motion through the sky it was not agreeing with the prediction of Newtonian gravity.
*  Did we falsify Newtonian gravity? No. We said maybe there's another planet out beyond Uranus. We call
*  it Neptune and we eventually found it. The same thing happened with Mercury. The planet Mercury's
*  motion around the sun was not compatible with Newtonian gravity. Did we falsify Newtonian
*  gravity? Actually yes. This time we did because general relativity was the right theory. So the
*  Popperian falsificationist approach as a program for doing science isn't very popular these days
*  just because the refutations part of conjectures and refutations are never quite as cut and dried
*  as he would like to have you believe. How do you fix it? How do you improve on that situation? How
*  do you take into account the fact that they're not very cut and dried? The answer is called Bayesian
*  reasoning. You say well what is the probability that I would get this kind of experimental outcome
*  if this theory were true etc. So I think that you know Popper is the limit of Bayes where you set
*  certain experiments, certain likelihood functions to being zero or one. But I think as a good Bayesian
*  you should never do that because maybe you made a mistake in your experiment. You always have to
*  consider the possibility as small as it might be that you might have made a mistake and Bayes lets
*  you do that. Carlos Núñez has a priority question which is many scientists have recently put forth
*  the lab leak theory for the origin of COVID-19 as a viable option. Have you updated your Bayesian
*  priors based on this new information and what probability do you grant to this hypothesis vis-
*  a-vis the zoonotic origin alternative? Yeah I mean I've updated a little bit but honestly I don't have
*  strong credences one way or the other. I never really followed the discussion about the origin
*  of COVID-19. So it's completely plausible to me that it started in you know a wet market or whatever,
*  completely plausible to me that it started in a lab and leaked out and so I believe what they
*  tell me roughly speaking. I haven't really followed what the experts are saying. Again that's not a
*  very interesting answer to your question. Why am I answering it? I think that this is an interesting
*  sociological case in how we talk about these situations. I think that there are, it's important
*  to distinguish the hypothesis where there was a lab that was doing work on coronaviruses and they
*  developed one either intentionally or unintentionally in the course of their experiments and it leaked
*  out. Okay that's a hypothesis. There's another hypothesis is that the coronavirus, the novel
*  coronavirus that gives us COVID-19 was intentionally developed as a bio weapon and set free.
*  Okay these are two separate hypotheses but they're kind of next to each other and I think that early
*  on this bioterror explanation was given more credence in certain circles than it should have
*  just for political slash cultural slash racist reasons and it was a mistake to give too much
*  credence to that because you wanted to blame somebody. But now the opposite mistake is being
*  made. In certain circles they're discounting the lab creation hypothesis because they don't want
*  to give credence to the racist hypotheses. I mean maybe it was a bio weapon. I don't even know that
*  as far as I know. That's plausible but I know that that idea was leveraged for political reasons.
*  And there are people now who don't want to give credence to those political reasons and therefore
*  they also discount evidences in favor of the lab origin hypothesis. So I have no dogs in the fight
*  about how the actual virus was created or where it came from but I do think that we should put aside
*  the political motivations for favoring or disfavoring one hypothesis or the other. We
*  should take them all seriously if you care about that. I mean if that's one of the things you're
*  following. Like I said I'm not really following it but when you do you should do so for scientific
*  reasons not for political ones. Scott says you've taught us that the interaction with the Higgs
*  field is responsible for the masses of elementary particles. More massive particles like a muon
*  can decay into less massive particles like an electron with the additional mass converted into
*  kinetic energy, photons etc. Is there anything deeper about the Higgs field interaction that
*  determines how these decays work or how mass is converted into other forms of energy?
*  So the short answer is no. There are tiny little details but they're very very irrelevant at this
*  level of analysis. The reason why what I wanted to emphasize in the answer to this question is
*  mass is mass once you have it. The Higgs field is the mechanism responsible for giving mass
*  to things like electrons and quarks, W bosons and Z bosons. But once that happens the mass of the
*  electron is just the mass of the electron. It behaves like the mass of the electron and you
*  can forget about the Higgs field. At low energies indeed you can completely forget about the Higgs
*  field. All you need to know is what electrons do, what their mass is, how they interact with other
*  particles. Paul Dirac, Richard Feynman etc were very very able to make calculations in quantum
*  electrodynamics with electrons and their mass not ever having heard about the Higgs field back in
*  those days. And I think that when people hear that the Higgs field gives mass to these particles
*  they somehow attribute some essence of massiness to the Higgs field. And sometimes they go so far
*  as to say well you know mass is important for energy and for gravity and therefore
*  does the Higgs boson have some connection to gravity? No it really doesn't. The Higgs field
*  is the mechanism responsible for giving particles mass and mass has a connection to gravity but the
*  Higgs field has no connection to gravity because of that connection. Does that make sense? Once
*  you know what the masses are that's all you need to know. There's nothing deeper about that interaction.
*  Okay let's group together three questions here. Kevin Wolk says, wondering if you've read Carlo
*  Rovelli's latest book Helgoland? More specifically assuming you have or are familiar with Rovelli
*  and his ideas I'd like to know if and on which points you agree or disagree with him. Rovelli
*  does not seem to be as big a proponent of the many worlds theory as you are as far as I understand
*  both of your positions. Anders Strand Vestbo says, in his latest book Helgoland Carlo Rovelli reflects
*  on his interpretation of quantum theory as relations. The world should be understood as
*  a web of interactions and relations rather than objects. An object does not really exist without
*  interacting with another object. To me this sounds like a more blurred way of explaining the same as
*  entanglement and branching of the wave function in the many worlds interpretation. Is it related
*  in any way or is it fundamentally different? And then Francis Day says, I've been reading Carlo
*  Rovelli's paper on relational quantum mechanics and wondered what your take on it is. I've heard
*  him say he was an Everettian up to but not including many worlds so I'm guessing you are
*  not entirely on board. So obviously all these three questions are about Carlo Rovelli and his
*  relational quantum mechanics which he recently talked about in a popular book called Helgoland.
*  I have not read Helgoland but yes I am familiar with Carlo Rovelli. He was the very second
*  guest on the Mindscape podcast. In fact I think he was the first person I actually interviewed
*  although his interview appeared second episode number two. And we're friends, we get along,
*  we have very different ideas about quantum mechanics. I have not read Helgoland because
*  number one I don't read a lot of popular physics books right? I mean I read physics papers but if
*  I'm reading popular level books it's not going to be physics generally. I get enough of that in my
*  day job. And number two I don't really follow his particular interpretation of quantum mechanics.
*  I don't know a lot about it. It's not many worlds, not in the sense that I would define it or Everett
*  would have defined it. He does not introduce hidden variables or dynamical collapses so in that case
*  there's a family resemblance to many worlds. He does think that you need to have some preferred
*  way of looking at the world, some preferred observables or something like that. And then as
*  the questioners say he emphasizes the relational aspects of all these things. But so my short
*  answer is no. I'm not very familiar with these works or this interpretation but the reason why
*  I wanted to answer the questions is to say you know I don't know a lot about any other interpretations
*  of quantum mechanics. I know a little bit about the main ones enough to you know teach them when I
*  teach a class. Like here are the basics of Bohmian mechanics or cubism or something like that but
*  only the very basics and I do not either follow the large number of alternatives to the main
*  contenders nor do I get very deeply invested in any of the others. And the reason why is because
*  I think that I have the right interpretation. I think that the Everett interpretation is the
*  correct one. Now as a good Bayesian that doesn't mean I'm certain that it's right. I could certainly
*  change my mind if evidence either in the form of experiment or in the form of really good arguments
*  came my way but I haven't heard those arguments and therefore I have to act like a working
*  physicist. I have to say you know what am I going to spend my time thinking about? I could spend
*  time thinking about alternatives to Everettian quantum mechanics and see whether or not I think
*  that they're plausible and should be pursued or I could take Everettian quantum mechanics as my
*  starting point and ask what can I do within that right? What can I do to relate it to the real world
*  to use that framework to develop better theories of cosmology and space time and field theory and
*  what have you? And I choose the latter point of view and indeed everybody does that right? Everybody
*  takes some either theories or views of the world as more or less what they assume is correct until
*  other information comes in and they move on from there right? Otherwise you're stuck in some terrible
*  Cartesian skepticism scenario where you can't believe anything like you don't know anything
*  at all and you have to start from I don't know set theory whenever you start to write a new paper.
*  So I'm just explaining why even though I write a lot about the foundations of quantum mechanics
*  when people ask me about other formulations of the foundations of quantum mechanics I'm
*  I'm just not an expert. I really don't follow that stuff very carefully.
*  Speaking of which the next question is what are your thoughts on idealism as proposed by
*  Bernardo Kostrup which offers a more parsimonious explanation for reality versus the many worlds
*  theory. Again I'm not very familiar. I know the I've heard of it read a little bit about it but
*  number one I certainly don't think it is more parsimonious than many worlds. Remember many
*  worlds is not a theory that says there are many worlds. It's a theory that says the quantum wave
*  function which exists in one form or another plays some role in every single interpretation
*  of quantum mechanics. Many worlds says that's all that exists the quantum wave function and the
*  Schrodinger equation which talks about how the wave function evolves under some circumstances
*  in every interpretation of quantum mechanics. The many world says it's the only thing that says how
*  the wave function evolves. There are no other modes of evolution unlike collapse models or what
*  have you. So in my view many worlds is absolutely the most parsimonious explanation. The fewest
*  equations the fewest ontological elements. Now idealism as a strategy I'm again not very familiar
*  with Kostrup's specific point of view on it but it seems like a terrible strategy to me and certainly
*  not very part very parsimonious. Idealism being the idea that rather than putting the physical
*  world at the center of one's ontology or view of reality and showing how things like minds and
*  thoughts and agents and experiences all arise as part of the physical world idealism in some sense
*  takes the mental world as the primary thing. Mental aspects of the world are what lead to our views
*  that there is something called the physical world out there. This seems like just a terribly bad
*  strategy to be like a laughably bad strategy. What could be more evident than the objective reality
*  of the physical world to me. I admit that when quantum mechanics came along there was this sort
*  of moment of weakness early on in the development of quantum mechanics when the fact that quantum
*  theory drew a distinction between what we directly observed and what really exists opened a door for
*  people to say well you know maybe we're bringing reality into existence by the way that we think
*  about it. But now we know better right now we have very even if it's not many worlds we have multiple
*  purely physical absolutely mechanistic theories that give you the quantum mechanical answers whether
*  they're dynamical collapse theories or hidden variable theories or many worlds or what have you.
*  So that temptation that moment of weakness has passed for most of us and the idea that we should
*  sort of forget that this amazing fact that when we different human beings all look at the physical
*  world we come up with the same rules of behavior for it right. That individual different people
*  do not have different notions of the laws of physics. To me that's more than enough to squelch
*  any temptation there might be to be an idealist about the fundamental nature of reality.
*  Steven Bernard says my question is about the possibility of universal principles behind complex
*  systems. There are many examples of systems that appear to be complex in some sense both natural
*  and artificial the brain the cell evolution etc. But these systems all appear to be sui generis one
*  damn thing after another with little or no common features at a systemic level. Do you think it's
*  possible to discover universal principles of complexity? Yeah I do think it is possible to do
*  that although the word universal might be stretching it a little bit. I think there are
*  common aspects of complex systems that appear over and over again. Maybe not in absolutely every
*  single one but in enough of them that you can say okay in these systems we see these features
*  and the opposite features almost never appear right. You see you see features like interactions
*  over various scales. I want to say scale-free behavior but that's a little bit too strong
*  but roughly scale-free behavior right. Power law behavior for different important elements.
*  You see subsystems coming together to show emergent behavior in conglomerations of these
*  subsystems. You see information processing right. You see that there are non-linear ways in which
*  influences from the outside world get thought about if you want to be a little bit poetic and
*  then responded to by the complex systems. So I think there's plenty of ways in which what we
*  think of as complex systems do show commonalities. It's not that there are no commonalities,
*  it's that these systems are messy. They're big macroscopic things. It's like saying you know
*  I've met many many people and no two of them are exactly alike therefore do you think there
*  are no commonalities between people right. No I think there's actually a lot of commonalities
*  between people and there are a lot of differences. That's a that's a trivial toy version of the same
*  thing I would say about complex systems more generally. Joe Grewinski says in regards oh sorry
*  I'm combining two questions here. One is from Joe Grewinski. In regards to the arrow of time,
*  if I'm not mistaken I remember you talking about the possibility of another arrow of time opposing
*  our own that could have been created at the Big Bang. If that's possible could it be possible for
*  there to be other arrows that point in other directions? And Andrew Vernon Smith says Julian
*  Barber in his book Janus Point at the end of chapter five refers to a paper by Jennifer Chen
*  and Sean Carroll, that would be me, and to an unpublished idea of Sean Carroll relating to
*  fundamental equations of a theory for the temporal evolution of the universe that obey the first and
*  second laws of thermodynamics and also have bi-directional arrows of time in all regions and
*  at all times. Would you compare or contrast your ideas with those of Boltzmann, Feynman, Penrose,
*  Barber or whatever the consensus or leading theories may currently be? So I think that neither
*  one of these questions got exactly right, my own theory that I proposed with Jennifer Chen
*  back in 2004. The idea behind our paper was there were basically two ideas and this is always
*  a mistake. Whenever you have two ideas you should just write two papers because one of your ideas
*  is either going to get forgotten or misunderstood because the other idea is going to take up all the
*  oxygen, okay? And so we made that mistake. So the two ideas we had was number one, a general fact
*  about how one could go about explaining the arrow of time. You know the arrow of time is explained
*  in our universe because entropy was low near the big bang and has increased ever since. That to me,
*  this is work to be done to show why this is true, but to me that's the underlying thing that gives
*  rise to the arrow of time in our observed universe. And the cosmological question is why
*  were initial conditions near the big bang so special, so low entropy? And there have been a
*  lot of very very bad attempts at accounting for this up to and including people like Stephen Hawking
*  making terrible mistakes about trying to explain the naturalness of the early universe. And so
*  Jennifer and I, Jenny Chen and I, who was a student at Chicago at the time, we took very seriously the
*  idea that if you wanted to explain the arrow of time without cheating, so without putting in an
*  asymmetry by hand, the point is that the laws of physics show no asymmetry between the past and
*  future. The arrow of time does, but you don't want to explain that arrow of time by putting in an
*  asymmetry, otherwise you're just explaining something by putting in the same thing, right?
*  You're begging the question. So given that our early universe had low entropy and our late universe
*  has high entropy, how in the world can you explain that without putting it in by hand? And the answer
*  that we came up with is you need the conditions in the far far past and the far far future to be
*  similar to each other, right? That's the way, that's the only way basically that you can imagine a
*  dynamical origin for the arrow of time without cheating. So if we think that our future is going
*  to be high entropy, the solution would be to say that the past was high entropy. But we know that
*  the immediate past wasn't high entropy. By immediate we mean the last 14 billion years. So you say that
*  the Big Bang was not the beginning of the universe. There was something before the Big Bang. And the
*  temptation, this is an old idea that the Big Bang was not the beginning of the universe. The temptation
*  when you do that is to make the Big Bang the middle of the universe, right? To say that there is some
*  special moment at the Big Bang where things are symmetric about that moment. So maybe there is a
*  past in which there's a Big Bang going in the other direction and there's a future that we live in
*  where the Big Bang goes in our direction. But that doesn't really explain the arrow of time. You're
*  just making it a middle condition rather than a past condition, right? And so you haven't explained
*  why that's true. So our idea is not that there is a past that is similar to our Big Bang universe
*  popping out of the Big Bang in the other direction, but rather that our Big Bang universe
*  arose out of empty space. We know from observations that empty space has a small cosmological
*  constant, at least in our observable universe. So let's just take that for granted. And we pointed
*  out using ideas from Alan Guth and Eddie Farhi and others that it's possible, not something we know
*  for sure, but it's possible that empty space is unstable to bubbling off a little baby universe.
*  So you can start with empty space, no arrow of time, nothing going on, but time is still passing,
*  and it's almost, it's metastable in some sense. It's almost the highest entropy possible state,
*  but entropy can always increase by creating new universes. So the two ideas, to go back to the two
*  ideas that we had, one is you can explain why entropy is increasing naturally by saying that
*  entropy can always increase. By saying that there is a number you can assign to the universe called
*  the entropy, maybe some finite number or some regularizable infinite number, but it can always
*  go up. So if that's true, then given any value of the entropy, if you evolve it at one moment of time,
*  if you evolve it both forward and backward and wait long enough, it will increase. So that's one
*  idea that basically you can naturally explain why you see a gradient in entropy by saying that there
*  is no equilibrium of maximum entropy for the universe to settle into. The other idea was this
*  specific implementation of that general scheme based on the idea of baby universes. And so in
*  our baby universe idea, it's not just that empty space would spit off universes toward the future,
*  and those little baby universes would start small in a Big Bang-like configuration, then grow and
*  increase in entropy, but they would also do the same thing toward the past. So our Big Bang in
*  our picture is not the center of the universe or the middle, but it is the beginning of our little
*  baby universe, and there are oppositely directed baby universes going the other way. So all of
*  which is to say, so number one, for Joe's question, there's no possibility of arrows pointing in our
*  model in directions other than toward the past and toward the future, because time only goes in one
*  direction, right? Time is one dimensional, so there is only the past and the future. Those are the two
*  sort of directions you can move in, in the time direction. So there is in the far future a whole
*  bunch of many, many universes, all of which have increasing entropy until they locally settle down
*  to empty space, and then in the past there's a whole bunch of universes that grow to the past,
*  and they locally increase in entropy toward the past and then settle down into empty space.
*  So Julian Barber works in a very different context of cosmology than I do, okay? He's interested in
*  what is called shape dynamics, which is this particular take that he and his collaborators
*  have on general relativity, and he actually heard me talk about this stuff at a conference,
*  and in part, you know, he heard me talk, and again, he focused on the model that I had with
*  the baby universes and not the general idea of entropy increasing because it can always increase,
*  and then what he discovered was in his shape dynamics model, entropy will increase because
*  it can always increase, okay? So he's written several papers about that idea, and he wrote
*  this book about this idea, and you know, I had to like remind him a little bit that we said that in
*  our paper first, okay? And so I take it as, you know, a different example of the same basic idea.
*  It's incompatible because it's a different physical scenario, but it's the same spirit,
*  and so I think it's, you know, a friendly addition to the set of ideas along these lines.
*  Penrose, in contrast, in his conformal cyclic cosmology, the arrow of time always points in
*  the same direction, which I think is completely cheating. It requires an infinite amount of fine
*  tuning to make that happen. It doesn't really explain the arrow of time in our universe.
*  I do think that there are, in principle, other ways of explaining the arrow of time,
*  but they would usually involve some principle that told you that either at the beginning of
*  the universe or at the temporal boundaries of the universe, things had to be a certain way.
*  It wouldn't be like a robust thing. What Jenny and I were aiming for was almost any initial
*  conditions would lead to the following behavior. If that's what you want, as far as I know,
*  our scenario is the only one that purports to do that, and so it's definitely in my mind
*  one of the leading contenders for explaining this kind of thing.
*  Jorge N., the letter N, asks a priority question. He says,
*  any thoughts on the idea that velocity has a probabilistic nature, meaning during a unit of
*  time a particle has a probability P of moving a unit of space or not moving at all. During a long
*  time interval, a particle with a high P would then be seen as having a high velocity and vice
*  versa for low P. An implication would be that since P has an upper bound of one, there's an
*  upper limit to velocity. My thoughts on that idea is I have no idea how that would work or fit in
*  with modern physics. Number one, because at the classical level, if you think about the limit of
*  physical behavior in the universe that is well described by classical mechanics, velocities don't
*  behave probabilistically. They just obey Newton's laws completely deterministically and completely
*  measurably. Now you can say, well, okay, quantum mechanics kicks in there, right? But
*  in quantum mechanics, wave functions don't even have a well-defined velocity. As I mentioned earlier
*  in the AMA, velocity in quantum mechanics is an observable feature of wave functions, but it is
*  not a fact, a property, a characteristic of wave functions without observing them.
*  And so it's not in quantum mechanics that velocity has a probabilistic nature, it's just that it's
*  not well defined for almost all wave functions until you measure it, okay? So if you want to
*  take an idea like this and make it into a respectable physical theory, I'm not sure what
*  you're going to try to do, either change quantum mechanics or forget about quantum mechanics and
*  go back to some other theory. You know, you're welcome to do that, it's a free country, but
*  it's a lot of work to really turn an idea like that into enough mathematical background that
*  other people can play with it and test it and ask what it would mean for experiments and things like
*  that. John Shoning says, having previously enjoyed your talk with Jennifer Roulette on the
*  black hole information paradox, do you think theorists will now turn their attention elsewhere
*  since Netta Engelhardt's team has claimed to solve it? So yeah, Jennifer and I gave a talk
*  at the Royal Institution in London, you can find online in YouTube explaining the black hole
*  information paradox, but it was a couple years ago before the modern advances. But let me be
*  perfectly clear, Netta Engelhardt nor her team has not ever, neither Netta nor her team has claimed
*  to solve the black hole information paradox. We had Netta on the podcast here, you can hear her
*  very, very clearly say, we have not yet finished trying to do this. They have some ideas that might
*  be relevant for eventually understanding the black hole information paradox, they might lead
*  to a solution sooner or later. But we're not there yet, we don't have it. And so, no, I do not think
*  that the theorists are going to turn their attention elsewhere anytime soon. There's still
*  a lot of work to be done there. Riverside says, Trump has been voted out of office partly as a
*  result of his COVID mismanagement and his mistrust of science, which he shares with other populists,
*  but the deep economic inequalities that allow populists like Trump to thrive are still there.
*  And it seems to me that the USA cannot hope to maintain a cohesive democracy,
*  unless it turns itself into a more egalitarian European style country, with a functioning social
*  safety net and stronger fiscal redistribution. Merely safeguarding procedural democracy,
*  which was the theme of your some of your last podcasts would not be enough. Would you agree?
*  I don't think I would agree. You know, I would agree with a weaker version of the statement
*  that you made. I mean, you're making a pretty strong statement. You say that the USA cannot
*  hope to maintain to remain a cohesive democracy, unless it turns itself into a more egalitarian
*  European style country. That is a prediction that is far too confident for me to even imagine making,
*  you know, I mean, the United States, on the one hand, has been pretty robust for a couple of
*  centuries now. And we've never been a European style egalitarian welfare, social welfare state,
*  right? We're less egalitarian than most European countries, at least in the last 100 years.
*  And we've survived now that it certainly doesn't mean that the United States is going to continue
*  to survive as a cohesive democracy. I would absolutely not be surprised at this rate if
*  things went disastrously wrong. And 20 years from now, or 50 years from now, we do not recognize
*  the United States as a democracy anymore. I think that's a terrible prospect worth taking very,
*  very seriously. I don't want to downplay it. But I certainly don't have the confidence in my own
*  prognostication abilities to say that unless we do this specific thing, that will happen. Okay,
*  maybe it will happen. I am sympathetic with the idea. I'm sympathetic with the idea that
*  there's too much inequality in the United States. We've all seen the numbers of how in particular,
*  in this particular pandemic that we're trying to come out of, it is greatly increased inequality,
*  right? I mean, people who were struggling before struggled worse during the pandemic.
*  Billionaires who are very wealthy have done better, have increased their wealth. And I don't think
*  that's right. That's not how pandemics should affect the economy of a country. But I also
*  think that the issues are not precisely mapped onto income or wealth equality issues. I think
*  that the more important issues are one of feeling that you have a say. I think that the reason why
*  populists resonate is not because some people are poor, that has something to do with it, or difficulty
*  getting jobs or whatever. It's because people think that they're powerless, that their voice is
*  not being heard, that the government is going and doing its own thing in ways that they don't have
*  any influence over, despite the fact that it's purportedly a democracy. I think that's actually
*  the more important thing to be fixed if we want to strengthen democracy going forward. I could be
*  totally wrong about that. Again, I'm not an expert, and maybe nobody is enough of an expert to make
*  statements about those things with high degrees of confidence there. Eric Carstensen says,
*  priority question, do you have an ideal world where certain historical events go differently?
*  The ideal world I think of is where Robert F. Kennedy is never assassinated in 1968,
*  and he goes on to become president instead of Richard Nixon, which avoids prolonging Vietnam
*  and the Watergate scandal. Short answer is no, I don't have an ideal world. I mean, there's things
*  that I would like to improve about the world, but, and so let me be more specific, there are aspects
*  of the world which I unambiguously think could be improved by changing them in certain ways.
*  But the question of going to certain discrete influential historical events and tweaking them
*  a little bit so as to bring about the world I would rather see is much more problematic.
*  There you get into chaos theory and the difficulty of making predictions and things like that. So
*  maybe if Robert F. Kennedy had not been assassinated and Nixon would not have been
*  voted in, other things would have gone better, but maybe not. Maybe you could even say there's
*  a 60% chance, but I don't think I could say there's a 99% chance things would have gone better.
*  Vietnam obviously was a problem, but JFK and Lyndon Johnson, who were both Democrats, were
*  running the Vietnam War for a long time. There's no obvious idea that because if Robert Kennedy,
*  Bobby Kennedy, had been elected he would have gotten us out of Vietnam. Politicians are tricky,
*  they say things and they don't end up doing them all the time. So I don't know enough about that
*  error to say how devoted or how influential he would have been to actually make that happen.
*  And as far as Watergate is concerned, you know, Watergate was an example of egregious abuse of
*  power, illegal actions on the part of the president, but it also led to reforms of the system,
*  you know, the ability to have special prosecutors and things like that. So maybe it would have been
*  worse overall if Watergate had not happened. If I were to imagine ideal histories, I would have
*  wanted to stop some terrible massacres or tragedies or genocides, right, like the Holocaust or various
*  other terrible things that happened. Like there is a little bit more cut and dried to me that if
*  that had not happened, the world would be better. On the other hand, I don't know, like if it comes
*  to either assassinating or not assassinating one person, I'm not at all sure what would need to
*  happen to guarantee that the Holocaust would not have happened. You know, you can say, well, kill
*  baby Hitler. That's the usual thing to say. But it's not at all obvious to me that the social
*  forces wouldn't have led to something more or less similar to what actually happened in World War II.
*  I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't have, but I just don't know. Claudio Slomovitz says about Amuamua,
*  the interstellar visitor we had that we talked about with Avi Loeb. Well, Amuamua's speed was
*  notably high for solar system standards, 26.3 kilometers per second relative to the sun.
*  It's still very low compared to the speed of light. Would we have noticed anything weird had
*  Amuamua's dash been, say, 100 or 1000 times faster? Is it conceivable that a material object can be
*  accelerated to relativistic speeds by a succession of pushes from stars or other massive bodies?
*  So it certainly would have been much weirder if Amuamua's speed had been 100 or 1000 times
*  faster. So if you think about what is going on in our galaxy, the stars moving around and, you know,
*  with respect to each other and around the center of the galaxy, the typical speed you should have
*  in mind is something like a couple hundred kilometers per second, okay? 200 kilometers per
*  second, 300 kilometers per second, something like that. That's the typical speed that stars and other
*  object have in the galaxy. So that's the speed you expect everything to have with respect to
*  everything else on average, okay? This is why Avi made the point that in some sense, Amuamua's
*  speed is anomalously low. 26 kilometers per second is lower than 300 kilometers per second.
*  But if it had been 3000 kilometers per second, that would be anomalously high and that would be
*  weird. So yes, that would be weird. Is it conceivable that something could naturally be accelerated that
*  fast? You know, it's conceivable, but it's very, very unlikely. You know, things do get pushed around
*  by passing by stars, but it happens slowly and gradually. And every little push is very tiny.
*  And sometimes the pushes go in opposite directions from each other, right? So you certainly do not
*  expect things to be accelerated to very, very fast speeds. And I should go further than that.
*  You certainly don't expect things to be accelerated to relativistic speeds near the
*  speed of light, because once they're accelerated to the escape velocity of the galaxy, they escape
*  from the galaxy and they are no longer being accelerated by gravitational assists from nearby
*  stars and things like that. So there is an upper limit to speeds you expect for things in our galaxy,
*  namely the escape velocity, whatever that is. Farin Christu says a priority question. You guys are
*  using up your priority questions. Remember, only once in your life are you allowed to ask this,
*  but I'm glad that it was a useful mechanism that we came up with. So the question is,
*  I really enjoy your interviews with Daryl Morey and Julia Gallif. And along those lines,
*  would you consider doing an interview with an expert on the stock market? There may be no other
*  endeavor with such a rich history of formally intersecting analytics with the study of rational
*  irrational decision making. Yes, thank you for giving the suggestion. You know, this was a
*  not a good choice, Farin. I have to say for your priority question, because I will always take
*  suggestions and I will never comment on whether I will do it one way or the other. When I try to
*  make predictions ahead of time or even aspirations, even goals for either who to have or what subjects
*  to have, I feel like I'm locking myself into something that may or may not happen. So I
*  personally like to just take all the suggestions I can and whenever I get a suggestion, I will say,
*  thank you. I always like getting suggestions, but that's all I will say. I don't want to say
*  more than that. I mean, certainly I can say, yes, this topic area is very, very interesting
*  to talk about and think about, like you say, the connection of intersecting analytics with
*  decision making. That's a good topic. Okay, I'm grouping these next two questions,
*  ones from Linney Umizyara, who says, if a quantum particle doesn't really spin, what's the best way
*  to define quantum spin? And Craig Steven says, a while back, you said that we could think of the
*  spin of particles such as electrons as somewhat similar to the spin of larger objects, namely
*  angular momentum. Thus, a spin could be considered roughly either clockwise or counterclockwise. If
*  this is true, how are we to imagine a spin of one half? So to Linney's question, it is really spin.
*  That's what I think these days. There is lore. If you read books on particle physics or quantum
*  field theory, people will say, we talk about spin of elementary particles, but don't think of it
*  as really spin. It's just some component of angular momentum that is related to spin,
*  but is not really the same. And that whole discourse sounds very weird. Like,
*  if it is literally angular momentum, why isn't it spin? Like that sounds like a weird thing. But
*  what they have in mind is that the electron is like a little dot, right? That is like a little,
*  literally a particle of zero size. And a particle of zero size can't spin, obviously. What you could
*  do is say, well, what if we treated the electron as, let's say, a solid sphere of some non-zero size?
*  And then what you can show is that there is no size of the electron that can spin at the right
*  rate without going past the speed of light to give it the spin, the angular momentum that it actually
*  has, given the mass that it has. But that's a little bit silly, that discourse also, because
*  the electron is neither a little dot nor is it a little sphere. What the electron is, is the
*  excitation of a quantum field, right? The electron field. And as I mentioned on the podcast before,
*  I think this is what Craig is getting at. When you legitimately think of the electron as a field,
*  fields can have angular momentum, depending on the field configuration. Even a stationary field
*  can have a certain amount of angular momentum. And basically, you should and can think of,
*  can and should think of the spin of the electron as amount of angular momentum contained in the
*  electron field. So that is the best way to think about it. It really is something spinning in some
*  very real sense. To Craig's question, how are we to imagine a spin of one half? Well, remember,
*  the one half is a bit of a convention, right? It's not that the spin of electron is one half,
*  it's that it's one half times h bar. H bar is Planck's constant, h divided by two pi, okay?
*  So h, Planck's constant, is a universal constant in quantum mechanics. It appears in the Schrodinger
*  equation and elsewhere. It appears so many times that we often set it equal to one. That's why we
*  say a spin one half particle, what we really mean is a spin h bar over two particle. And if we had
*  defined h double bar to be h over four pi, okay, then in units of h double bar, the electron spin
*  would be one. And the spin of the photon would be two. And rather than talking about spin one half
*  particles versus spin one particles, we talk about odd spin particles versus even spin particles and
*  so forth. So there's nothing special about or mysterious or weird about the spin of one half
*  in that particular context. Jeff B says, actually, wait a minute, I'm just realizing now, sorry,
*  Craig, I'm realizing that there's a deeper level to your question, which is probably what you had
*  in mind that I that is sort of skipped by me. Angular momentum in forms other than the spin of
*  individual particles does only come in integral values of h bar, right? So what I mean by that is,
*  if you have an electron in an atom, the electron can have spin, which is angular momentum, but it
*  can also be orbiting the atom with a certain amount of what we call orbital angular momentum.
*  And unlike the spin of elementary particles, the orbital angular momentum is only in always an
*  integer in units of h bar. So probably what you're asking is a more sophisticated question that I
*  gave you credit for, sorry about that. How can the spin of elementary particles take on these
*  different allowed values that orbital angular momentum cannot take on? So that's a much more,
*  that's a much harder question to answer. And it has to do with the nature of the topology of
*  the Lorentz group, okay, and the group of rotations in three spatial dimensions. There are
*  relationships between objects in three spatial dimensions with the feature that if I rotate them
*  360 degrees, they don't come back to where they started. So I'm being very vague because it is
*  not a physical thing. If you take like a physical thing like a coffee cup and you rotate it 360
*  degrees, it comes back to where you start. But if you think about the relationship between the coffee
*  cup and yourself, if you rotate it without moving your hand, without letting go of it,
*  it will come back only when you do a rotation of 720 degrees, two rotations of 360 degrees.
*  So topologically, the different kinds of rotations that you need to do to get an object back to where
*  it started classically only are 360 degree rotations, but quantum mechanically, there is the
*  possibility of having objects or fields or whatever that only come back to where they
*  started when you rotate them twice around the circle, 720 degrees. That is on the one hand,
*  what we mean by spin one half, and it is also realized by electrons and quarks and neutrinos
*  and so forth. If you want more details than that, a tiny bit more detail is in my YouTube
*  lecture in the biggest ideas of the universe. I think the one called matter, why in the world
*  is it in the one called matter? Because the one called matter is really about the spin statistics
*  theorem and how the fact that particles of different spins are either bosons that pile on
*  top of each other, or fermions that take up space. If you want much more detail than that,
*  then I would Google around spin statistics theorem and things like that. It is a fascinating,
*  but quite tricky and subtle story. Sorry not to be more definitive than that. Okay, Jeff B says,
*  in your biggest ideas series, you mentioned that space and time are different because it is not
*  unusual for objects to very abruptly end in space. But it would be surprising to see an object
*  abruptly end in time. You went on to explain that we measure distances in space differently
*  than we measure intervals in space time. But I am not sure how this explains why we do not see
*  objects abruptly end in time. Is it possible to paint an intuitive picture for why objects behave
*  this way? So I am not sure if I am going to be able to do justice to what you are asking. It is a
*  perfectly good question. It is a very, very good question. Why do we have some continuity over time
*  in ways that we do not have continuity over space? So for those of you who do not know
*  what I was talking about in those lectures, like the desk right in front of me as I am
*  talking into this microphone here, it exists here where I am pointing my figure and it does not
*  exist here right next to it. There is an abrupt edge to the desk. There is no rule in physics that
*  says if there is a desk at this spatial point x, there is probably more desk at spatial point x
*  plus delta x. But there is a rule in physics that says if there is a desk at time t, there is probably
*  something desk-like, probably a desk in fact, but at the very least something that was created from
*  the pieces of the desk at time t plus t, delta t. And in some sense that comes down to the,
*  that is how the laws of physics are. The laws of physics relate stuff at different moments of time.
*  You can be a little bit more specific by appealing to conservation laws.
*  Nutter's theorem says that when there is a symmetry, there is a conservation law. And so
*  you get conservation laws from time translation invariance, for example, conservation of energy.
*  And what that means is conservation of energy over time. There is a number you can define by
*  integrating the total amount of energy at one moment of time and that stays more or less fixed
*  from moment to moment. Take that plus the fact that the laws of physics are local. If I poke
*  something here, the physically observable consequences of that poking do not instantaneously
*  spread throughout the universe. They travel no faster than the speed of light. Together those
*  things imply that if you have conserved energy and you can't change things at rates faster than
*  the speed of light, that if there is something here now, there's something similar to it,
*  the same amount of energy, a moment later. Now you can always ask, well, why is there, why are
*  there conservation laws, why are there symmetries, etc. That's a deeper question. But as we said
*  before in the podcast, at some level, you're going to bottom out and you're going to say that is
*  because that's how the laws of physics are. Another angle on saying the same thing would be
*  there's only one direction of time, there's multiple directions of space. So there is at
*  least the possibility that there's this continuity along the one dimension of time, where continuity
*  in space would have to mean everything is just uniform everywhere in the universe. And that
*  really wouldn't make quite as much sense, wouldn't be as fun a universe to live in anyway.
*  Okay, Johnny says, is there anything from your work that has changed how you live your life?
*  In other words, does knowing the intricacies of how matter works modify the way you make choices
*  or conduct yourself in the world? Well, I guess there's two levels to this question. One is
*  the detailed level of, you know, knowing the standard model of particle physics, do you
*  interact with the world differently? No, not really, like it doesn't really help me
*  drive a car or play basketball or anything like that, right? That's a far too microscopic level
*  of knowledge to be very helpful in the macroscopic world. It's nice to know that energy is conserved
*  and momentum is conserved and entropy increases and things like that. But you can do pretty well
*  in life without knowing those things. I do think that at the deeper level or the more meta level,
*  knowing and thinking carefully about the laws of physics and the way that nature works
*  does affect how I think about life, right? How I think about what life is, the meaning of life,
*  the morality of different actions, what will happen when life ends, all of those things,
*  which are very important things, right? These are important things and they're metaphysical
*  questions in some sense. And to me, metaphysics is extremely informed by physics. How could it be any
*  other way? So not that there's a simple direct line that I can draw between the two sets of
*  questions, but I certainly think that one affects the other in important, intricate, complicated ways.
*  Okay, Lou Argyers says, I don't know how to pronounce your name, sorry about that, Lou.
*  Argyers says, is there anything interesting to say about gravitons in the absence of a theory of
*  quantum gravity? For instance, can a graviton escape from a black hole? Yeah, there's plenty
*  of interesting things to say about gravitons because we, even though we don't have a full
*  theory of quantum gravity, we do have two things. Namely, we have a good theory of classical gravity,
*  general relativity, and we have quantum mechanics. And there are very basic,
*  robust features of what happens when you take a classical theory and you quantize it in some sense.
*  So there will be gravitons. If you believe in general relativity and you believe in quantum
*  mechanics, you should believe in gravitons. To believe in gravitons does not mean that you need
*  to think you have a full theory of quantum gravity or any full, complete, robust understanding of
*  what space time even is. You know, there are things called phonons. You've heard of photons,
*  right? Photons are the particles of light. But we also have, in addition to classical
*  electromagnetic waves, which you then quantize to get photons, we have classical sound waves,
*  right? There are classical waves that you're listening to right now and you're listening to
*  my voice. You could ask, could you quantize them and get particle-like excitations of sound?
*  The answer is yes, absolutely, because you don't need to know that the sound wave is made out of
*  some atoms bumping into each other. There's a higher level emergent theory of a fluid,
*  the gas in the air that has equations that it obeys, and you can quantize those equations and
*  show that there are particle-like excitations in them. Same thing is true with gravity,
*  no matter what the fundamental theory is. Can gravitons escape from a black hole? No,
*  because gravitons don't equal gravity, okay? Just like photons don't equal electromagnetism.
*  Photons are the particle-like excitations of the electromagnetic field. If you have a big,
*  classical, coherent field around a charge, like a charge around of an electron, you shouldn't think
*  of that as a set of photons. There's nothing changing. It's just some big Coulomb electromagnetic
*  field that's sitting there unchanging, whereas a photon is a ripple, right? It's a vibration that
*  is traveling at the speed of light. Likewise, black holes have gravitational fields that are there,
*  and we can define them and measure them, and we've seen their effects. A graviton would be a tiny
*  ripple propagating at the speed of light over and on top of that classical background field.
*  And since they move at the speed of light, they cannot escape from black holes, because you cannot
*  escape from a black hole unless you move faster than the speed of light. All right, I'm going to
*  group two more questions together. Robert Rux and Rescue says, priority question. Imagine a situation
*  where you have a particle in superposition. Its wave function says there's a 50% chance of finding
*  it in place A and 50% chance of finding it a thousand light years away in place B. My question
*  is, what's the gravitational field going to do in this situation? Say you don't measure the particle,
*  so you don't disturb its superposition state. Instead, you simply observe the gravitational field.
*  What's the gravitational field going to do? And Gregory Mendel says, here's a gravity and
*  decoherence question. You measure an electron spin in St. Louis. Heads you go to New York,
*  tails you go to LA. Your spouse on the far side of the moon uses a torsion balance to measure the
*  tidal force you produce. Does the torsion balance show you're in one location, New York or LA, or
*  both at the same time? So in both cases here, you know, gravity is a bit of a red herring in both of
*  these questions. You could have asked exactly the same question about electromagnetism, right? Charged
*  particles have electromagnetic fields that are very much like the gravitational fields of little
*  particles. So particles have fields around them. And when it comes to decoherence and so forth,
*  for many purposes, you can think of the fields attached to particles, whether they're the electric
*  fields for charged particles, or the gravitational fields for particles with energy, as part of the
*  particle, right? Because they go along with it. You cannot separate an electron from its electric
*  field. You cannot separate a planet from its gravitational field. Okay. So when you say, well,
*  I observe the gravitational field of the particle, but not the particle itself, the answer is that's
*  just as good as measuring the particle itself. In this case, where there's a superposition,
*  where there's a particle in a superposition of being at A or B, the gravitational field of the
*  particle is in a superposition of being around A and around B. And if you measure it, you're only
*  going to find it near A or near B, and then you've branched the wave function of the universe.
*  Similarly, for Gregory's question, once you do that, you measure an electron spin, and then you
*  move, you go to New York or LA, depending on the outcome, you're a big macroscopic thing, okay?
*  You're decohering all the time. You are not staying in a superposition of going to New York
*  and staying in LA, okay? You have branched the wave function of the universe, and your spouse
*  on the far side of the moon has branched along with it. So the answer is, your spouse is, there's
*  two copies of your spouse, just like there's two copies of you. There's a you that goes to New York,
*  and a spouse on that branch of the wave function. There's a you that goes to LA, and a spouse on
*  that branch of the wave function. And either one of them, if they use a torsion balance very carefully
*  to detect where you are, will uniquely detect where you are on that branch of the wave function.
*  Okay, Moshe Fader says, in 2016, astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Michael Brown proposed
*  explaining unexpected clustering in the Kuiper belt with a hypothetical planet nine five to fifteen
*  times larger than the earth. In 2018, Amir Siraj and Avi Lobe proposed an alternative, the existence
*  of a primordial black hole in the outer solar system and a method for the new Vera Rubin
*  telescope to search for it. What prior probability distribution do you assign to the black hole idea?
*  So just in case you don't know, Moshe, Michael Brown was one of the first guests on the
*  Mindscape podcast. Mike is a good friend of mine at Caltech, so is Konstantin. And Mike talked about
*  both killing Pluto, as we talked about earlier, and also perhaps replacing it with a real planet
*  out there, which they call planet nine. To me, you know, sure, it's possible. You can always replace
*  a planet that is too far away to see with a black hole that is too far away and too small to see.
*  That is difficult to disprove an idea like that, but I think that the prior probability distribution
*  you should assign to that is really, really small. Why? Well, we know of lots of planets,
*  we know of lots of planet-like things. We don't know of any tiny primordial black holes. Any,
*  right? We know of big black holes that were made by collapsing stars and so forth,
*  but we've never seen any primordial black holes. So I would put the prior on that as pretty darn small.
*  Okay, I think I'm grouping two more questions together here. Anonymous says, Google AI researcher
*  Francois Chollet recently tweeted, within 10 to 20 years, nearly every branch of science will be,
*  for all intents and purposes, a branch of computer science. Is this something you'd agree with? Do
*  you think you'll be having to use more computer science AI for research in the future? Oh, and
*  then Dan Inch says, it is fascinating how the Schrödinger equation is empirically correct and
*  yet still needs an interpretation. Could we feed all the physics data we have into a very powerful
*  computer, wait until it finds the systems of equations that can generate all the data,
*  and then work backwards to place our interpretation on whatever the equations are? If we could, what
*  would our extra interpretations really be adding? So I grouped these two together. There's a slight
*  connection between them, but I want to use Dan's question to answer Anonymous's question.
*  The Schrödinger equation doesn't need an interpretation at all. It's an equation. It
*  says that here is a function and here's how the function evolves over time. Okay, what we need
*  an interpretation for is to say, in what sense, in what way does that equation describe reality?
*  That question is one that computers, even the very powerful ones, are not good at answering.
*  So a computer might very well be able to invent the Schrödinger equation, but that's not the
*  problem. Schrödinger did that on vacation, literally. He was in the Alps and he invented
*  the Schrödinger equation. No surprise that a computer would be able to do that. Max Tegmark,
*  who was on the podcast, is literally generating AI programs that are trying to do exactly that,
*  come up with new laws of physics based on curve fitting to the data. But science is enormously
*  more than curve fitting, okay? Enormously more than looking for an equation that packages the data
*  in a simple and compact form. We need to understand what is going on, right? That's why there's more
*  to science than just fitting the data. So I think that all of the issues with quantum mechanics are
*  not from, we don't understand the Schrödinger equation, but that the fact, the empirical reality
*  of quantum measurement doesn't seem to be described by the Schrödinger equation. Now Everett, or
*  many worlds, says, well, really it is, but you're not seeing the whole wave function, and that's
*  perfectly legitimate. But to at least the point of view of any one observer, the Schrödinger equation
*  is not up to the task of describing quantum measurement. That's why you need more than that.
*  That's why it's not just a task for a computer. And so therefore, for Anonymous's question,
*  I mean, it's very charming that a computer scientist thinks that in the future, all science
*  will be a branch of computer science, but I can't agree with that, okay? I do obviously agree that
*  there will be more and more computer work in science. That's already happening. You know,
*  you don't need to wait 10 or 20 years. That was happening 20 years ago, or longer than that.
*  But there will still be plenty of room for doing something more than that. You know, I don't even
*  use computers that much in my science, a little bit, but my kind of science isn't going to change
*  that much at all. I do think that there'll be more and more computer science, like I said,
*  artificial intelligence, because, especially because we have these big data sets, and we're
*  searching for patterns in them. So I see what the computers are doing. The most obvious use
*  for computers is something kind of like Kepler, right? If you think about what Johannes Kepler did,
*  you had Tico Brahe, before him, who collected a lot of data. It was the first big data era
*  in astronomy, Tico looking at the positions of planets on the sky, okay? And Kepler did the
*  curve fitting. Kepler was the one who came along and said, you know, it's not circles and epicycles,
*  it's ellipses, right? And ellipses describe the motion of planets in the solar system.
*  But they weren't done. That wasn't the end of planetary science, right? Because you could say,
*  well, why? Why is it ellipses? And that's where the real excitement came with Newton and other
*  people saying, there's an inverse square law of gravity, there are laws of motions that explain
*  why the motion is ellipses. So the computers will be really good at finding the ellipses. They would
*  be terrible at, or at least, I shouldn't say they'd be terrible. I'm completely open to the idea that
*  someday computers will be much better than human beings at this. But my point is, there's a
*  qualitatively different kind of question being asked that is much less well suited for computers
*  as they are today, when you come to explaining why the numerical relations that we find in the data
*  are there. So I don't see any need to worry that in the next 10 to 20 years, that kind of work is
*  going to be outsourced to computers away from scientists and philosophers and so forth. Okay,
*  Murray Dunn says, as part of a previous AMA answer, you explained why the net charge of
*  a topologically closed universe would be zero, but you also mentioned that the net energy would be
*  zero as well. Can you explain why that is the case? I can try, you know, think of a topologically
*  closed universe as a sphere. And there are other more complicated topologies you could have, but
*  it's a simple visualization, right? So if in this imagine a two dimensional sphere, keep our lives
*  easy. Imagine the world was two dimensional. So the thought experiment is put a positive electric
*  charge, we'll do it for electric charge first, positive electric charge on the north pole of
*  the sphere and say I'm only putting that positive electric charge on the sphere, no other charges.
*  The point is that the lines of electric field from that charge need to go somewhere, right? They
*  emanate away from the electric charge. If it's a positive charge, the electric field points away
*  from it, but then they go around the sphere and they focus back on the south pole if you put the
*  charge of the north pole. So what you have at the south pole is a bunch of electric field lines
*  pointing inward and then ending. What that means is there is a negative charge there. You can define
*  a negative charge as the place where electric field lines point into an end. That's what it is.
*  So that's the proof in slightly hand wavy form for why the net charge of a closed universe must be
*  zero. Same exact thing happens for gravity, but we place lines of gravitational acceleration
*  with lines of electric field, right? If I put a mass at the top of the sphere, there's a gravitational
*  pull toward the mass and I follow those lines backward. What it means is that at the south
*  pole there's a gravitational push, okay? Which means that there needs to be a negative amount
*  of mass, a negative amount of energy, and the net energy has to be zero. This all comes down to
*  Gauss's law and Stokes's theorem in the world of differential geometry, but I think it's pretty
*  easy to understand just in terms of those pictures. Josh Hedgepeth says, mine is a philosophical
*  quandary. Have you ever played the lottery using a quantum random number generator and if not, why?
*  Even if you are no more likely to win, does it still increase the fraction of worlds where some
*  variant of you does win as opposed to if you just didn't bother? It's the type of thing where you
*  don't play to win, you play to create. As I said before, in my mind, even though I'm a many worlds
*  person, the upshot of many worlds is that for actual human beings in these many sets of worlds,
*  all of their expectations and all of their actions and all of their rules for living life should be
*  exactly the same as if they lived in a truly stochastic single world. That is the conclusion
*  that you reach from thinking carefully about the philosophy of many worlds. So yes, if you made a
*  quantum random number generator to play the lottery, you would, if it were a fair lottery, etc.,
*  you would guarantee that on some branch of the wave function you would win, but you would also
*  guarantee that on many, many, many, many branches of the wave function you would lose if it's a big
*  lottery, like Powerball or whatever. And so, yeah, on some branch you win a whole bunch of money,
*  on other branches you lose a couple bucks. And so the net outcome is that the total numbers of
*  yourselves lose money, because the government doesn't do these lotteries for free. They're
*  making money by doing these lotteries. So yeah, I don't want to do that. And it's exactly the same
*  reasoning for why I don't want to play a single lottery in the single world, if that's what only
*  existed. The expectation value is against you there. Preston says,
*  Well, there are plenty of people working on it. That's absolutely true, which is weird in some sense.
*  It wasn't true in the 70s or 60s, right? There were very, very few people working on quantum
*  gravity, even though people knew both about quantum mechanics and about gravity. And the
*  difference is that in 1984, we realized there was a promising theory of quantum gravity,
*  namely super string theory. Before that, what people said was, look, gravity is too weak.
*  We can't get any data about it. We can't create gravitons in our laboratory. So sure, we need
*  quantum gravity, but it's just too hard. So we'll not going to expend a lot of effort trying to do
*  that. Whereas once string theory became popular, people said, well, maybe, even though we don't
*  have a lot of data, we have this very promising theory, maybe we can get lucky and just think our
*  way into the right answer. So that may or may not be true, depending on your opinions about string
*  theory. But that was the motivation for so much quantum gravity effort going on right now. Why is
*  it hard? Well, you know, no one ever said it should be easy. So my individual idiosyncratic
*  take on why it's hard is because people keep trying to quantize classical theories. And my takeaway
*  from things like black hole information and holography and complementarity and all the thought
*  experiments that have been done over the last few decades is quantum gravity will not arise from
*  quantizing a classical theory of space time. And I'm not the only person to think this Tom Banks
*  and Willy Fischler are two other physicists who really pushed this idea. I mentioned Tom before
*  because he's an epistemic person when it comes to quantum mechanics. But you know, very, very smart
*  person thinking about quantum gravity and field theory and quantum mechanics. And he's made the
*  point based on ideas from Ted Jacobson and others that we shouldn't start by quantizing gravity,
*  we should we should do something else. And so he and I have gone in different directions about what
*  we do. But we take that as a good starting point. But very few people do. Most people just start
*  with some classical theory and quantizing it. That's my guess. It's more detailed than that.
*  I mean, the point is not just that that strategy doesn't work, because that strategy worked pretty
*  well for electromagnetism and the standard model, starting with the classical theory and quantizing
*  it. There are specific features of gravity, the lack of perfect locality and things like that,
*  the lack of a background space time to work with that make that conventional procedure not work as
*  well. How long do I predict it will take? I have no idea. Literally no idea. It could be done five
*  years from now, or it might not be done 500 years from now. I really don't know. Marianne Markali
*  says, at the largest scales, is it likely that the universe has enough complexity, diversity of
*  structures and coupling mechanisms for yet another higher level of organization, computation or
*  intelligence? For lack of a better term, since it would be as different in character as our
*  intelligence to molecular dynamics. So this is a good question. I really, really like this question.
*  It's an important kind of thing to think about, you know, is in our everyday experience of
*  intelligence and consciousness, we're used to dealing with organisms, right, with individuals,
*  with biological beings, and they have some very, very definite notion that this is the individual
*  and this is the rest of the world. Could you imagine the emergence of what you would recognize
*  as intelligence or agency, but at a much larger scale, so that the big thing that we were calling
*  intelligent was as much bigger as us as we are to our cells, okay, to our individual biological cells.
*  So I'm very open to the idea that you can do this on an intermediate scale, right, like you could have
*  some super organism that was made of, let's say, a billion human beings or a billion human being
*  sized alien organisms or something like that. That's fine. That's a sort of, on the scales we're
*  talking about here, that's a minor increase in size. But if you're really thinking astrophysically,
*  like could a galaxy attain intelligence in some kind of way, there's a huge problem,
*  namely the time scales. It's not the distance scales that get in the way, it's the speed of
*  light that gets in the way. You know, it takes tens of thousands of years for a signal to travel from
*  one size of the one end of the galaxy to the other. So I haven't done this thought experiment,
*  but if you take, you know, however long it takes a neural signal to get from our head to our feet,
*  whatever fraction of a second that is, and compare that to our lifespan of 100 years, right,
*  so divide those two numbers by each other, and then take the, you know, I don't know, 50,000 years,
*  it takes a light signal to go across the galaxy, and boot that up to a certain number of years,
*  it'll be much, much longer in the age of the universe, I think, I think, I'm pretty sure.
*  So the point is that there's just not enough time, forgetting about the fact that it took
*  billions of years for we human beings to evolve through natural selection, right?
*  The universe will run out of steam before there is enough time in it for truly astrophysically
*  large systems to become intelligent. I see no objection to it in principle, once again,
*  but our universe is not static, it's expanding, it's emptying out. Stars will stop shining in 10
*  to the 15 years. So there is a finite amount of time available for complex structures to arise,
*  and I just don't think there is enough time for truly astrophysically big structures to
*  attain the level of complexity and structure and organization that we would recognize as conscious.
*  Okay, slightly similar question, this will be the last question of the AMA from Rafael
*  Roussitska, and it is, I thought a lot about this one recently, if increasing entropy is a fundamental
*  feature of time itself, higher entropy equals more configuration possibilities, meaning chaos,
*  humans emotionally yearn for some form of the easier, more structured, less chaotic order life,
*  aren't the laws of nature itself against this emotional want, and we need to accept that
*  everything, I mean everything we take for granted, will at some point become more unstructured and
*  chaotic, and will we need to develop ever more capabilities of dealing with ever more
*  interdependent chaos centers? So this is a complicated question, it's a good question,
*  I'm glad you asked it. It's complicated in an interesting and fun way. The first thing that I
*  feel the need to say is, you know, entropy is increasing in the universe, but there's a long
*  way to go before we're anywhere close to maximum entropy, okay? Even, you know, the sun shining,
*  our sun is going to keep shining in a more or less similar way as to what it's doing now,
*  for another five billion years. So on the time scale of a human life, we don't recognize any
*  profound difference in the total entropy of the universe from our birthday to our death day,
*  okay? So I don't think that you need to worry that we're just being surrounded by more and more
*  chaotic low entropy or high entropy things, because we are not a closed system here in the biosphere
*  of the earth, we're an open system that is very, very far away from thermal equilibrium. Once the
*  sun dies and we reach the heat that of the universe, that's a different story, that's a long way in the
*  future. But also, I wanted to comment on the presuppositions earlier in the question, you know,
*  that humans emotionally yearn for some form of the more ordered life. I don't think that's true,
*  and I think it's an oversimplification of something that is true, but it's a bit more complicated.
*  You know, Per Bach, who was one of the pioneers of thinking about complex systems and self-organized
*  criticality and things like that, characterized complex systems as living on the edge of chaos.
*  So this is the important thing. And you know, Benoit Mandelbrot would say similar things,
*  Stuart Kaufman would say similar things. There's a limit where everything is very, very simple,
*  and everything is very, very orderly, like a checkerboard, right? A chessboard, where
*  everything is literally, there's a square, a different color, nothing is going on except
*  this very, very simple pattern. There's another limit where things are just completely random,
*  where rather than a checkerboard where if you're on a black square, you know that all the squares
*  around you are white, if you move in, you know, vertical or horizontal directions. If you're on a
*  completely random board, then knowing what the color of one square is tells you nothing about
*  the squares next to it. Neither one of those limits is interesting in the sense of biological
*  organization. Where you have interestingness is in between, that's the edge of chaos. So you have
*  some structure, but not perfect rigidity, okay? And we are not just, not only do human beings
*  feature that kind of in-between level of structure, but we live off the fact that
*  the earth is very far from thermal equilibrium, right? That's what lets us maintain this very far
*  from a perfectly ordered or perfectly chaotic in-between state. So like I say in many different
*  talks in many different contexts, the second law of thermodynamics and the increase of entropy
*  is not our enemy as living breathing beings, it's our friend. It enables us to live and to breathe.
*  It gives us a resource that we depend on and survive because of. And we have again, another
*  several billion years worth of it just because the sun is shining, a hot spot in the dark sky.
*  So life is much more interesting and intricate than just avoiding chaos or something like that.
*  Life is about having a little bit of chaos, but not too much, which is a lot more fun,
*  a lot more challenging, but a lot more rewarding way to live. And with that pseudo profound thought,
*  that's the end of the AMA for this month. Thank you to all the Patreon supporters for
*  supporting Mindscape. I really appreciate it. And to everyone, thanks for listening.
*  I appreciate that too. Take care. Bye bye.
