The 200th episode of Mindscape! Thanks to everyone for sticking around for this long. To celebrate, a solo episode discussing a set of issues naturally arising at the intersection of philosophy and physics: how to think about probabilities and expectations in a multiverse. Here I am more about explaining the issues than offering correct answers, although I try to do a bit of that as well.

# Mindscape 200 | Solo: The Philosophy of the Multiverse
**Mindscape Podcast:** [June 06, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B40PRvLtiec)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and this believe it or not is the
*  200th regular episode of
*  Mindscape I say regular because there's been a lot more episodes if you count
*  Various bonuses and the ask me anything episodes and holiday messages and things like that
*  But 200 is pretty good at roughly 50 a year. That's four years. This is the fourth anniversary of
*  Mindscape so pretty long compared to many
*  Projects that people launch in various points of their careers and I've been very very
*  Gratified with all of the responses from people listening and hoping that it does some good
*  So want to do something to celebrate so I thought do a solo episode, which is often what I do in these situations and
*  Meanwhile I have going on this shift from Los Angeles and Caltech to Baltimore and Johns Hopkins
*  Where I will be a professor of natural philosophy
*  Which is the title that I made up to indicate that I'll be both doing philosophy and physics
*  Really secretly it's physics, but it's the kind of physics that fits into a philosophy department very well
*  There's no boundary between these two areas, right in both cases
*  You're thinking hard trying to understand the fundamental workings of reality. That's what I'm interested in doing
*  So I don't perceive a barrier but because of various ways in which academia has evolved over the years
*  There is a quite a substantial barrier that other people perceive
*  so I thought that because this is happening and because this is the 200th episode for my solo episode I would talk about a
*  particular set of issues that count as
*  natural philosophy in this sense the intersection of
*  Physics and philosophy and furthermore some of the ways in which physics and philosophy intersect are pretty
*  Well known you've heard about them before we've talked a lot about quantum mechanics and you know the collapse of the wave function
*  foundations of quantum mechanics we've also talked a lot about time the arrow of time and entropy and
*  emergence the connections between fundamental physics and higher levels so all those things are
*  Recognizable obvious places where both physics and philosophy have something to say
*  There's another area which has been sometimes remarked on but not quite as much which is cosmology
*  And cosmology is what I grew up doing as a research scientist. So I'm especially interested in
*  Philosophical issues in cosmology and even though it has gotten less attention
*  It is really a perfectly natural place for thinking philosophically about questions in physics
*  because of for better for worse the fact that the cosmology problems
*  That are asking big questions like what happened at the beginning of the universe
*  Why is there something rather than nothing things like that?
*  We don't have data on these questions at least what I should say to be more slightly more careful is
*  There is no straightforward path to addressing these questions just by doing the appropriate experiment
*  Nevertheless, they're important questions and we should think about them and therefore we should think carefully about them
*  There's a tendency to think sloppily about things in physics
*  Physicists often sort of rely on the fact that eventually we'll do experiments and therefore get the right answer
*  So they can think pretty sloppily along the way knowing that they're fundamentally guided by the data in questions like this
*  That's harder to do but that doesn't remove our
*  Responsibility to do a good job at it thinking about the nature of space and time in the universe
*  So the training the philosophers have in digging out our hidden presumptions
*  Making sure that we're being logical along the way things like that make perfect sense
*  But in fact the philosophy of cosmology is quite a broad field by itself
*  So I want to home in on something very specific which is the philosophy of the multiverse
*  Now when I say that there's two different things that come to mind and I want to talk about both of them one is is the multiverse
*  Even physics is it even science, right?
*  This is sort of a meta or methodological or epistemological question about how science is done
*  Does this particular set of questions count as science? It's been debated to death
*  I will give you my little perspective on it, but I don't want to dwell too much on it
*  What I really want to emphasize is beyond those
*  Methodological questions there's a real
*  Ontological question or a set of questions about how the world actually works
*  That are at the intersection of physics of cosmology and philosophy in particular in the case of the multiverse
*  How do we reason if we live in a multiverse?
*  How do we talk about probabilities and where we are and what our expectations should be?
*  This is one of those things in physics that is crucially important
*  What do we expect when we do an experiment, right? What do we expect a theory to predict?
*  But usually we're lucky because it's pretty straightforward answer
*  And in cosmology in the multiverse in particular, it's not straightforward. How do we think anthropically?
*  Does it even make sense to think anthropically all of these questions? That's what I want to talk about in today's podcast
*  So that's what I mean in this particular case by the philosophy of the multiverse
*  And to me, it's a perfect example of this sort of intersection that we'll be pursuing at johns hopkins
*  Not only myself but other people as well who are interested in these sort of interdisciplinary questions
*  One other note I wanted to put out there
*  Which is that some people have asked quite sensibly whether or not the podcast will keep going at its current pace
*  Given that I have these new responsibilities
*  And the answer is I certainly want it to keep going at quite a strong pace
*  But I also had to be realistic. I'm going to be teaching
*  I have other duties that I will have that I haven't had before
*  So i've come up with the following temporary strategy
*  We'll see how this works, which is that at some point i'm not sure whether we immediately or in a couple months
*  We'll switch to a mode where rather than having a podcast come out every monday
*  Plus an ask me anything episode in the middle of the month as a bonus
*  I'm just going to start counting the ask me anything episodes as regular monday episodes
*  So i'll still have the numbered interview plus solo episodes that will appear on mondays
*  But one of those mondays during the month we will get an ask me anything episode the same
*  Ask me anything episodes that i've been doing but it will be that monday slot. So overall instead of roughly five
*  Podcast episodes per month will be getting four and I think that you know a little bit of a change
*  But it'll save me some time and that change
*  In time savings might be crucially important
*  To my sanity and my ability to do a good job quality wise with all the things that i'll be doing
*  So we'll see how it goes. Who knows maybe i'll find that I have extra time on my hands and go back to the previous schedule
*  I'm not i'm not sure it's a it's an experiment. That's what we do in this field
*  Finally for those of you who are not long-time listeners
*  What I mean by an ask me anything episode is an episode where people send in questions and I answer them
*  But the people in this case are patreon supporters
*  So if you want to become a patreon supporter of mindscape just go to patreon.com
*  And you sign up for a dollar a week or a dollar an episode whatever
*  By the way, the ama episodes are not charged to patreon
*  So the patreons will be saving a little money because of this new arrangement because there'll be one fewer
*  Charged episode per month for the patreons
*  But the patreons get to ask the questions and they also get access to ad free episodes of the podcast
*  As well as you know the feeling that they're doing something right and they're part of a community that is kind of fun
*  There's a separate, you know conversation in the comments of the patreon site and and things like that
*  So if you want to do that, please do. I certainly appreciate the support of the patreons enormously. It helps me
*  Finance various things for the podcast and it's also just a nice thing
*  But of course as I always say it's perfectly okay not to do that
*  Especially, you know, you know for some people even four or five bucks a month is an extra outlay that they don't really want to do
*  That's perfectly fine. Anyway, I
*  Really appreciate the support 200 episodes in from everyone listening to mindscape help spread the word help send it to other people
*  Leave reviews on itunes or wherever you listen to your podcasts and hopefully we'll be going for another
*  Couple hundred in the future with that. Let's go
*  My main goal here really is to bring out the fact that
*  This is an area the philosophy of the multiverse where both physics and philosophy have both real interests and real things to say
*  Real things to offer in this discussion and they don't talk to each other that much to be honest
*  I mean sometimes philosophers talk about the multiverse or physics or whatever
*  but they don't talk to physicists as much as they should and physicists never talk to philosophers about these things because
*  Physicists have this attitude, you know that if they sat down for 15 minutes and thought about it hard
*  They could figure it out and I think that attitude is often not correct
*  But the point is that today i'm not necessarily focusing on solving these problems
*  But just pointing out that the problems are there that this is an area where discussions should be had that we should be open-minded
*  Not only have individual people who are interested in both sides of the philosophy physics discussion
*  But have actual interactions between people on both sides. I do have some opinions about some of these issues
*  So I will try to put them forward but I very quickly admit that my positions are not completely settled here yet
*  So the questions are truly open in my mind
*  Let's start by thinking about what we mean when we say the word multiverse as you all know
*  As sophisticated mindscape listeners, there's more than one idea
*  That is captured by the word multiverse. We're not talking about the multiverse of movies like dr
*  Strange or everything everywhere all at once. We're talking about the scientific multiverse, but even there we have different
*  Ideas in mind very very different ideas, but some of the same philosophical questions are common to these scenarios
*  So let's focus on three kinds. I think that there are probably more kinds than this
*  But there's three ways in which these multiverse questions pop up in my work
*  Anyway
*  One is and probably what most working physicists have in mind when they say the word multiverse
*  What we might call the cosmological multiverse and already it's a bit of a misnomer
*  Because the other so-called universes in the cosmological
*  Multiverse are just regions of our universe that are very far away
*  Okay
*  The cosmological multiverse is the idea that we see an observable universe
*  Roughly tens of billions of light years across
*  And the reason why we can't see further than that is because there's a horizon where you look back in time and you hit the big bang
*  So you can't see further away than that just because the speed of light is a finite number one light year per year
*  Within this observable universe within the part of the of the universe that we can see
*  You know things look pretty smooth things look pretty uniform over large scales on small scales
*  There's galaxies and stars and whatever but if you average out over millions of light years
*  You will get a more or less similar situation in different parts of the observable universe same number of galaxies
*  Same density of matter all that stuff
*  Outside the universe we can observe
*  Let's just be honest. We don't know what's gonna happen
*  So we can guess and that's what we traditionally did in cosmology. The traditional thing in cosmology was to say well
*  Let's just guess that what happens outside is more or less a continuation of what happens inside
*  And you can do that and then that's where you get this idea that the universe is either flat or positively curved or negatively curved
*  There's really only three choices
*  Maybe there's some topological obstruction or something like that or complications who knows but that idea that the universe just continued on
*  Indefinitely or maybe for some finite amount if it was a closed universe
*  Looking just like it does in our observable universe was always just a guess
*  There's no principled reason why it should be that
*  And if you worry about the multiverse or you know different copies of yourself as many people have pointed out
*  If the universe is spatially flat or negatively curved and not topologically twisted up
*  It will be infinite in size in this simple-minded idea where the universe is just uniform on large scales forever
*  and within our universe if we're just taking the conditions we see and extending them indefinitely
*  the
*  Average density is a number and then there are fluctuations around that density and there's kind of only a finite number of ways
*  That the number of particles we see in our observable universe could possibly have arranged themselves, right?
*  It's a big number a lot of possible ways because we have something like 10 to the 80th
*  Atoms or massive particles in our universe another 10 to the 88th
*  Photons and neutrinos and stuff like that. So a lot of particles they could arrange themselves in a lot of ways, but remember
*  Infinity is way bigger than any finite number
*  so if you really think that
*  The universe is the same everywhere on very large scales
*  So every patch of universe the size of our observable universe has roughly 10 to the 80th atoms in it
*  And those atoms arrange themselves differently from place to place but space goes on infinitely far
*  Then everything that could possibly happen
*  Will happen in within those
*  Universes within those parts of the universe that are the size of our observable universe and there will be an infinite number of them
*  So there will be an infinite number of people exactly like you and me somewhere else very very very far away in this infinitely big universe
*  that right there raises these
*  Philosophical problems of how to deal with the multiverse because the philosophical problems i'm going to care about
*  Are ones that have to do with who are you in the multiverse? Which copy of this person?
*  Are you how do we reason about that if there are multiple copies of me to which everything happens in some sense?
*  How do we make predictions for anything and none of any of those questions?
*  Rely on crazy ideas about inflation or string theory or quantum mechanics. It's just letting our universe be infinitely big
*  I think this is one of the reasons why people like einstein
*  Favored the idea that the universe would be spatially closed positively curved and finite in size
*  As far as we know observationally, it's very close to flat
*  Which would be consistent with it going on for infinity but not it doesn't demand it
*  You could have a flat universe that was still wrapped over on itself like a torus for example
*  But anyway, as I tried to say at the start
*  There's no principled reason to think that the universe is the same everywhere. It's just a guess. Maybe it's true. Maybe it's not
*  The idea of the cosmological multiverse is that it's not
*  That different regions of space very far away from each other are really very different even maybe not only different
*  Densities of matter or different collections of galaxies and stars, but maybe even different local laws of physics
*  different things we would use and recognize as
*  Equivalents of the standard model of particle physics but with different particles different forces different strengths of those forces
*  Maybe even different numbers of dimensions of space time
*  I once wrote a paper with matt johnson and lisa randall about how you could dynamically undergo a transition
*  From a certain number of dimensions of space in some region to a different number of dimensions of space
*  So that could be part of the cosmological multiverse
*  and the crucial thing to
*  understand about this idea of the cosmological multiverse is
*  Like will be the same crucial thing to remember about the other
*  Versions of the multiverse is that it wasn't invented because it sounds cool
*  It wasn't invented because physicists thought you know, it would be fun to think about this
*  We were dragged kicking and screaming into thinking about the cosmological multiverse against our will and the reason why is because
*  The cosmological multiverse is not a theory
*  It is a prediction of various theories and it is a consequence of those theories
*  But you should judge the theories that it's a consequence of not the prediction all by itself
*  You can't divorce the prediction from the theory that is making that prediction
*  In this case the cosmological multiverse case the theories came about
*  starting from
*  inflationary theory which alan guth and others invented
*  Circa 1980 and it was driven by an attempt to understand the data in particular the data that our universe is smooth
*  Homogeneous and isotropic and also nearly spatially flat
*  Also the fact that there are no observable magnetic monopoles in the universe, which was a prediction of various grand unified theories at the time
*  So guth used this idea of inflation which says that if the universe starts out or at some early time anyway
*  Its energy density is dominated by what we call a false vacuum energy
*  So much like today we think since 1998 when we discovered the universe was accelerating
*  We think that there is an energy in empty space a cosmological constant of vacuum energy
*  But you can also get a temporary form of vacuum energy or false vacuum energy
*  Which could be really a lot of energy
*  In empty space and it would cause the universe to expand at a hugely accelerated very fast rate
*  And that's kind of like pulling the edges of a wrinkly bed sheet or something like that
*  It tends to smooth everything out this super accelerated expansion
*  So guth did the physics and he showed that you could start in this false vacuum
*  And then you could turn all that vacuum energy into ordinary matter and radiation
*  So first you inflate you are dominated by false vacuum energy
*  You smooth out the universe and make it flat and then you convert all that false vacuum energy into ordinary matter and radiation
*  Now he got it a little bit wrong, but he knew he got it wrong
*  He pointed out that in his own original model you never left inflation
*  You didn't get this nice exit graceful exit as it was called
*  Into a situation where you've turned that energy into ordinary matter and radiation
*  So soon thereafter andre linde and andy albrecht and paul steinhardt proposed models where you smoothly
*  Rolled a scalar field down from a high
*  Potential energy to a low potential energy and you could convert all that energy into ordinary matter and radiation. No problem
*  So this was called new inflation and it solved the graceful exit problem
*  But here's the problem in either old inflation or new inflation
*  This scalar field which we pause it we invent it
*  There's no evidence for it yet, but it was posited and very well could be related to other ideas in physics
*  um
*  It's not a classical scalar field, right?
*  There is such a thing in the world as quantum mechanics
*  And so as the scalar field rolls down its potential and turns into matter and energy there are quantum fluctuations
*  It's not absolutely the same value at different points in space and that's crucially important. That is the explanation
*  We think in inflationary universe theory for the perturbations in density that give rise to stars and galaxies today
*  We see the imprint of those quantum fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background
*  And in the pattern of large-scale structure in the universe if inflation is correct
*  We certainly see the fluctuations in density and temperature in the universe
*  Inflation attributes those fluctuations to quantum fluctuations during the inflationary period
*  And people soon thereafter noticed paul steinhardt andre linde alex flenkin and others
*  That if you allowed for these quantum fluctuations you could sometimes have quantum fluctuations where instead of rolling down the hill
*  If you visualize the potential energy of a scalar field like a hill
*  The field tends to roll down like a ball rolls down a hill
*  But the quantum fluctuations say that maybe you could bounce up the hill occasionally. It's a quantum fluctuation, right?
*  It's a rare thing, but it could happen and these potentials are very flat
*  So it's not that hard to bounce up the hill and when you bounce up the hill, you now have more energy density
*  Inflation happens faster and you create more volume of space
*  So you do the calculation and you show that for very reasonable values of the parameters
*  Inflation never really ends
*  It will end in some region of space
*  But somewhere else the inflaton field as we call it this new scalar field that we invented
*  It quantum fluctuated up the hill and even though that's relatively rare
*  When it happens it generates a huge amount of space because it inflates very very quickly
*  And then the process repeats where in that new region that you've created
*  Some places inflation ends other places it keeps going, but overall it will keep going somewhere in the universe
*  So this is the idea called eternal inflation
*  And it's not necessarily a part of inflationary theory, but it's a very natural part of inflationary theory
*  It happens very easily. You don't need to work very hard to make inflation be eternal
*  So that's already giving you a kind of a multiverse because it says that inflation will end where the
*  Inflaton field turns into ordinary matter and radiation
*  It will end differently at different points in space at different times in the history of the universe
*  But that only became super exciting when we realized that
*  When inflation ends the local laws of physics could be different in different regions of space
*  And this was something people had thought about also, you know once again, but it became
*  Very on people's minds when we stumbled across what is called the string theory landscape
*  And the string theory landscape was also in some sense inspired by data once again when we discovered in 1998 that the universe is accelerating
*  We attribute that to a cosmological constant and this was a revolution
*  This is the only revolution that I personally have lived through
*  in fundamental physics in my time
*  When we realized that the cosmological constant was probably not zero because we all knew that there was an issue here
*  That the cosmological constant the energy of empty space
*  Could be anything in principle, but you could estimate what it should be
*  You could estimate on the basis of effective quantum field theory
*  What a natural value for the cosmological constant would be and the answer is way way way bigger than what you actually observe
*  so
*  Most people when I was in grad school most people strongly believed
*  That because the vacuum energy was for some unknown reason much much much smaller than it would predicted
*  Would be predicted to be on the basis of naturalness
*  Probably even though we didn't know what there was some mechanism that was setting it to exactly zero
*  Because it's just hard to think of some reason why you should set it so close to zero and not go all the way
*  Right in the space of all possible theoretical ideas
*  It was easier to come up with hypothetical ideas or imagine that they're there if they just set the cosmological constant to exactly zero
*  But then we discovered it's not zero
*  Or at least it doesn't look like it's a zero
*  It's certainly also possible that what is causing the universe to accelerate is something like a dynamical
*  Scalar field much like inflation but at a much much lower energy density
*  That's on the table as a possibility, but it's harder to make that work
*  So, you know, we don't know yet. We're testing that experimentally once again, but the simplest idea is just that it's the vacuum energy
*  So back to the drawing board, you know, we can't say that there's some unknown
*  Mechanism that sets the cosmological constant to zero because it's not zero
*  And in string theory, which was the leading candidate for quantum gravity
*  Um, it certainly was easier to make string theory work if the cosmological constant was not positive
*  In fact, it was much much easier to make it work if the cosmological constant is negative
*  That's a nice way to understand string theory, but if it were zero, okay, we could get along with it
*  It was really hard it remains really hard to understand why
*  You would have zero cosmological constant in the string theory even though you do not have manifest supersymmetry at low energies
*  Supersymmetry is part of the string theory
*  Toolkit, um, it's easy enough to hide it
*  We don't see any evidence for string theory experimentally, but it's easy enough to hide it
*  Just like we hide other symmetries in physics
*  But in general when you break supersymmetry in order to hide it, you're not left with a zero cosmological constant
*  It's easy for it to be negative. It's it's hard for it to be exactly zero
*  It's conjectured to be easy to be positive, but the word easy is problematic there. We don't know
*  Uh, there are debates that are still raging about whether or not the cosmological constant can indeed be positive in string theory
*  But again naively it seems that you could get a positive cosmological constant in string theory
*  And then once that possibility was put front and center
*  We need to understand how the cosmological constant could be a positive number
*  People sat down and realized well, yeah, we could do that
*  We have all these extra dimensions of space in string theory string theory works most naturally
*  If space time is 10 dimensional
*  Some versions it's 11 dimensional but but more than four dimensional. Okay, so we have to hide those extra dimensions of space
*  How do we do that? We curl them up into some geometrically interesting shape and
*  Different geometrically interesting shapes give rise to different low energy laws of physics
*  including different values of the cosmological constant
*  And this seems at least to many people to be a natural outcome of string theory something you didn't need to put in
*  It's just something that we didn't really notice or dwell on that much
*  Before the data forced it on us as often happens in physics, okay
*  So now what you have if you combine eternal inflation with the string theory landscape
*  Not only do you have inflation giving rise to many different regions of universe
*  But string theory says that the local laws of physics in those regions might be based on different ways of compactifying
*  The extra dimensions of space and that could give rise to different local laws of physics including the vacuum energy
*  So suddenly what you have is different values of the vacuum energy in different regions of space
*  And then you apply an old argument stephen weinberg made it famous, but other people have pointed out long before him
*  Namely that if the cosmological constant was very very big either big and positive or big and negative
*  It's very hard to imagine how human beings could exist or how life could exist because a big vacuum energy tends to either blow things apart
*  If it's positive or crunch the universe in a very short period of time if it's negative
*  So there is what we call an anthropic selection
*  If and this is a very very big if
*  If there are many different regions of space where the vacuum energy is different. It is completely natural
*  So the story goes to imagine that living beings only arise in that subset
*  Of all these parts of the universe where the vacuum energy is not that large and this would be an explanation
*  For why we observe a small but not zero vacuum energy and to be completely historically accurate stephen weinberg
*  pointed this out 10 years before we discovered the cosmological constant he pointed out specifically that if
*  The explanation for the vacuum energy is not some dynamical mechanism that sets it equal to zero
*  But rather some anthropic selection that says that you know, there's many different values of the vacuum energy
*  But we only observe the ones that are compatible with our existence
*  Then you should predict
*  That the cosmological constant should be observable. It should be small but not so small that we can't observe it
*  It's just easier
*  There are more values of the cosmological constant that are observable that are not observable even compatible with our existence
*  And that's a prediction that he made 10 years before we actually observed it
*  So that's a plus in the ledger on the on the plus side of the ledger for this kind of reasoning
*  Anyway, that's the cosmological multiverse. That's one of the ways in which you can get a multiverse
*  and so in the cosmological multiverse as far as we know with the kind of
*  Calculational techniques we have there are an infinite number of universes out there
*  At least if you include the future as in the past as well as the present moment
*  And not only do we have different laws of physics in many of them
*  But we could also have exactly the same laws of physics in some of them
*  This is a very different idea than the second scenario. We want to talk about which is the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  Longtime listeners will be familiar with this so I don't have to do quite as much detail
*  But many worlds comes about because we're again trying to explain the data, but the data are very different data here
*  we're trying to explain the data of
*  quantum physics the fact that when you observe the position of an electron
*  Even though you describe the position of an electron in terms of a wave function that is spread out all over space
*  When you're not observing it when you do observe it, you always see it in a position
*  You never see the full wave function. What's up with that?
*  There are many different possibilities for what's up with that the many worlds possibility says
*  When you think about that measurement of you measuring the position of the electron
*  You really need to think of yourself as a quantum mechanical system that has a wave function
*  And when you model the interaction between you and the electron that that qualifies as a measurement
*  What really happens is you become entangled with the electron
*  So the reality is not that the electron collapses to some position according to many worlds
*  But that there is part of the wave function that says the electron was here and you observed it here
*  Another part that says the electron was over there and you observed it over there and so on for every possible measurement outcome
*  And whatever it proposed is that we take these different parts of the wave function and treat them as
*  separate independent worlds
*  He had reasons for doing that but I think that the best reasons post-date ever the best reasons for
*  Talking about these different parts of the wave function as completely independent worlds come down to what we call decoherence
*  And decoherence was started in the 70s people had premonitions of it before that
*  But really, you know
*  The the theory was developed in the 70s and 80s and it explains why these different worlds become independent from each other
*  So that what happens in one world does not affect anything that happens in another world
*  So they can't affect each other in typical circumstances and therefore that's why we call them other worlds
*  completely different idea
*  Than the cosmological multiverse the cosmological multiverse literally has regions that are far away from each other in space
*  Okay
*  The many worlds of quantum mechanics literally come into being in my room when I do a measurement of a quantum system
*  I'm not creating a different region of space far away. I'm creating a whole other parallel universe and it's not located anywhere
*  They just exist
*  Simultaneously, okay, the worlds all are there
*  Uh with different amplitudes and the amplitudes matter if we're talking about many worlds, but we're not talking about that today
*  We're not talking about the details of many worlds. The point is that there are many copies of my future self
*  So there's one copy me right now. There's other copies that have descended from my past self
*  But here I am right now. I do some measurements. There will be many descendants of my present self in all of these different worlds
*  So that's a different kind of multiverse that appears in physics
*  And finally, there's the idea of eternally fluctuating cosmologies
*  Which don't have a great name. That's why I will call them eternally fluctuating cosmologies. The idea is the following
*  so remember back again the
*  Accelerating universe. Okay, so we discovered in 1998 the universe is accelerating
*  The easiest explanation for that is the cosmological constant
*  And there is a theorem proved back in the 1980s by bob wald at the university of chicago that says that under
*  pretty general circumstances
*  if you have a universe with a positive cosmological constant and
*  Not too much other stuff
*  Okay, then that universe will always empty out
*  So if you have other stuff if you have positive cosmological constant
*  But a lot of matter so much matter that it curls space into itself and get a positively curved universe
*  Then that will eventually re-collapse
*  But if there's not too much matter
*  So if the universe is close to flat, for example, then the universe expands forever
*  And what happens is galaxies and other things are just pulled away from each other
*  All the density perturbations that we had in the early universe will flatten out under the influence of this cosmological constant
*  Accelerated expansion. This is called the cosmic no hair theorem
*  There's more details you can put on it because the galaxies have dynamics
*  They have stars in them. The stars will burn out fall into black holes. The black holes will evaporate
*  The evaporating radiation from the black holes will be red shifted to essentially non-existence
*  And then you're really left with nothing but empty space
*  And the name of this empty space with nothing in it
*  But vacuum energy is called desider space after willem desider the astronomer who first solved einstein's equations and found this cosmological solution
*  One of the things I love about this cosmic no hair theorem that all
*  Universes with a positive cosmological constant evolve toward desider space just like all black holes evolve towards
*  Just mass charge and spin black holes
*  is that
*  Like the black hole case there's an entropy interpretation here, right?
*  Whenever you have a system that inevitably evolves towards some macroscopic state and then just sits there forever
*  That sounds like increasing entropy
*  thermalization
*  Approach of the system to equilibrium
*  So I had long conjectured that this cosmic no hair theorem was probably equivalent
*  to
*  Equilibration to entropy increase to the second law of thermodynamics and finally with a graduate student aiden chatwin-davies
*  I was able to prove that aiden did most of the proving I gotta I gotta admit but we basically
*  uh found a definition of entropy that applied to these cases and we showed that even without
*  einstein's equation of general relativity
*  If you just had an expanding universe with a certain definition of entropy and you conjectured that the entropy in a region
*  Approached a maximum value and then stayed there forever
*  That would be equivalent to desider space to this exponentially expanding accelerating universe
*  so that's
*  The standard model of our universe. Okay, so i'm not making anything up about inflation or string theory or anything. I'm
*  Teasing about making things up. I'm not speculating
*  Uh, this is the most commonly
*  Accepted view of what our actual universe is doing. It's accelerating because there's a cosmological constant
*  It's conceivable that cosmological constant will disappear sometime in the future, but we don't know
*  And it's conceivable that won't okay
*  So the easiest thing is that the universe just expands forever under the influence of that cosmological constant
*  In which case we will approach desider space
*  And again just like black holes
*  desider space has a horizon and a temperature and an entropy and this was all figured out by stephen hawking and gary gibbons back in the
*  1970s so just like a black hole gives off a little bit of radiation
*  There is a sense in which
*  Desider space is a thermal state a black body state a state with the
*  Physical characteristics of a body at a fixed temperature and the temperature is going to be very low
*  You know, we think about the cosmic microwave background out there today at about 2.7 kelvin. Okay
*  This is going to be oh forget the numbers. Unfortunately, I think it's something like 10 to the minus 35 kelvin when we eventually reach
*  Uh the desider equilibrium in our future. I forget the exact number. Is that the right number?
*  I really don't know maybe 10 to the minus 30 but way way lower than the current temperature of the cosmic microwave background
*  But just as with the classic universe that is just infinitely big
*  The desider universe is infinitely old right? It lasts forever under this some simple way of thinking about it
*  So if you have a desider universe that lasts forever there is a sense and this is an argument
*  This is less clear than other things i've said. So let me just say the argument and then i'll sort of give you the caveats to it
*  It's a little bit like a box of gas at a fixed temperature
*  That lasts forever
*  Okay
*  So if you have a box of gas at a fixed temperature that lasts forever
*  You have a bunch of particles running around inside bumping into each other and mostly for most of the time
*  They will sit there in their highest entropy state, but just due to random fluctuations
*  occasionally
*  The thermal fluctuations inside the box of gas will lead to an entropy decrease
*  There will be a fluctuation downward in entropy to a more orderly configuration and then it will relax back
*  And sometimes you know
*  You can actually calculate how much of an entropy fluctuation you expect and the answer is you will get all sorts of
*  Fluctuations if you wait long enough. So a very standard thing to torture undergraduates with is
*  Calculate how long you would have to wait
*  For all of the air in the room in the classroom that we have right now to move over to one side
*  Of the classroom and leave the students on the other side gasping for breath
*  Okay, it's many many times the current age of the universe not something you have to worry about
*  But it will happen if you thought that your classroom would last forever and the probability of such a fluctuation
*  is
*  bigger for small fluctuations
*  Smaller for big fluctuations. Okay, that should make sense a tiny fluctuation away from equilibrium
*  Will be much much more likely than a huge crazy fluctuation away from equilibrium
*  So it's much more likely that the gas in the room goes on to one half of the room
*  Than it is that all the gas in the room shrinks down to one little cubic centimeter in the corner of the room
*  Both will happen, but the medium-sized fluctuation happens much more often than the huge fluctuation
*  And this of course this way of thinking
*  If de Sitter space is like this
*  If the future of our universe is a thermally fluctuating box of gas
*  Then you will eventually fluctuate downward in entropy and you will fluctuate so much that you know
*  Sometimes you'll have a couple of particles appear out of the vacuum
*  A couple of times more rarely you'll have a few particles appear with high energies and bump into each other and make you know atoms
*  If you wait long enough, you'll have enough stuff fluctuating to existence that it makes molecules or macroscopic
*  Amounts of stuff. I mean if you wait long enough, you'll fluctuate into stars and planets and galaxies or even the whole universe
*  I wrote a whole nother paper about that with matt johnson and anthony aguirre. Anthony, of course was a previous mindscape guest
*  And uh, so it will happen if you wait long enough and the de Sitter future of our universe is supposed to last
*  infinitely long so you'll get all sorts of these fluctuations and that leads to the Boltzmann brain problem the idea is that if you had
*  some reason to believe that
*  You are a typical observer in the universe. Well, what does a typical observer in this universe look like?
*  It looks like a random fluctuation, right? Most observers, you know, you get who knows how many billions or trillions of
*  Observers like you and me after the big bang, but then you get an infinite number of observers that are random fluctuations in the future
*  So who cares about us living right after the big bang?
*  Most observers in this situation are going to be random fluctuations
*  That causes a philosophical problem, which is exactly what we're going to get to in a second
*  Before I get to that. Um, let me just mention that we're not sure by any means
*  That even if our universe does settle down to an empty de Sitter like phase there will be
*  These random fluctuations because there's a tricky
*  Interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity going on here
*  I wrote a paper with kim body and jason pollock where we explained that in a very natural set of assumptions
*  Where the hilbert space of quantum gravity is infinite dimensional if you don't know any of those words mean
*  Don't worry about it. Some of you who followed for a long time will know what they mean
*  But it's basically a fancy way of saying if an arbitrarily large number of things can happen in the universe
*  Then that actually lets the universe settle down into a static quantum state
*  So what what happens in that case is that you interpret the statement?
*  That decider is a thermal state as saying that if you were to make a measurement of it
*  Then you would measure if you had a thermometer there literally which you can't because you're not in empty de Sitter space because you're a thing
*  You're not emptiness. But anyway, if you had a thermometer there, you would measure a thermal spectrum of photons
*  But in the many worlds interpretation
*  There's a difference between what is happening when you're not measuring the thing where it's just a wave function versus what you observe
*  When you physically interact with it in order to measure it
*  And the point is that when you're not measuring it when there's nothing disturbing the state, there's also nothing happening
*  There's no dynamical fluctuations the thermalness of this quantum state is a statement of what you would observe
*  But not a statement about the dynamical things coming and going like brains coming into existence or anything like that
*  By the way, I forgot to finish the boltzmann brain story
*  The reason why they're called boltzmann brains is because a typical observer would not just be a random fluctuation
*  But the typical random fluctuation would be we expect the minimum fluctuation needed to count
*  As an observer in this universe that's because there's more easy way easier to get small fluctuations in entropy than large ones
*  So the idea is that the minimum observer is just a brain
*  You randomly fluctuate into existence a brain which looks around says, huh thermal equilibrium and then it dies then it goes back into
*  It dissolves back into the surrounding thermal equilibrium
*  And the argument by some people says well, we're not a boltzmann brain. Therefore that can't be the world
*  And the issue here is that this is not some speculative scenario about the early universe
*  This is the most popular view of our actual universe. And so that's a real problem
*  So the paper that kim and jason and I wrote tried to say that it's easy to avoid this problem
*  If you make certain assumptions about quantum gravity, but of course, we don't know those assumptions are true
*  So it's still very very worth thinking about these ideas. Okay
*  So that's three different versions of a physics oriented multiverse the cosmological multiverse
*  The many worlds of quantum mechanics and an eternal fluctuating cosmology the eternal fluctuating cosmology is a kind of a multiverse in time
*  It's not like different regions of space are different universes
*  But if you wait long enough, whatever kind of universe you want to think about will fluctuate into existence. So it is effectively a multiverse
*  One thing to emphasize which i've noted
*  All along is that every single one of these three options is a consequence of other ideas
*  It is not put forward for its own sake and it's a consequence of other ideas that were
*  Proposed in order to account for data in order to explain the universe that we see
*  Okay, so it is 100% the standard scientific process going on here. There's in no sense
*  some
*  Diversion or distraction away from doing real science by thinking about these different multiverses
*  nevertheless
*  Not everyone agrees people object
*  Uh, there are people out there who don't like these discussions of multiverses and you know, to be honest it gets weirdly emotional
*  People get very angry talking about the multiverse on both sides, you know on all sides I should say
*  They talk to each other about being unscientific and they get kind of ad hominem and name-cally
*  And it's really kind of tiresome and that's why that's kind of what I don't want to talk about here today
*  I don't want to dwell on the question of
*  Does talking about these scenarios count as science?
*  I feel what I want to do is dig into how to talk about these scenarios if you think that it is okay to do it
*  But I need to very quickly comment
*  On this issue of is it doing science? Is it science at all to talk about the multiverse?
*  The
*  All too easy objection to the multiverse is that it's not falsifiable, right? Famously sir. Carl popper
*  philosopher of science proposed the falsifiability criterion to demarcate
*  Scientific theories from non-scientific theories now almost none of the physicists who bring up falsifiability
*  Have actually read what carl popper wrote
*  But they carry on their shoulder a little straw popper that they have simplified down to this
*  Motto that says if you can't falsify the theory through an experiment, then it's not science
*  That's not what popper said. That's certainly not what philosophers of science believe
*  They don't even believe that falsifiability works at all generally most of them as a demarcation between science and non-science
*  But popper was on to something the real popper
*  He did have good reasons to
*  To propose this criterion even if I don't think that it actually gives you the final answer
*  He cared about having theories that were definite that said something. Okay, so he was worried about theories that he thought like
*  Marxist analyses of history or freudian psychoanalysis
*  In popper's mind, i'm not going to make any statement about whether I agree with this or not
*  I haven't really thought about it. But in his mind
*  Literally anything could happen
*  And advocates of marxist history or freudian psychoanalysis could after the fact tell a story to purportedly explain it
*  Okay, so he was really worried about the fact that these theories didn't have any content to them
*  And that's why he proposed falsifiability because he said look if you could say if anything
*  Happening in the in the world is explicable in terms of your theory anything that could possibly happen
*  Is explicable then your theory has no explanatory value
*  That is not the worry in the case of the multiverse. Okay, though all these different multiverse scenarios are absolutely
*  Undisputably saying something than saying not other things. Okay
*  The problem is that what they're saying happens in the universe are things that we can't see
*  Things that we can never in principle see we can never touch
*  The other worlds of the many worlds theory we can never see the cosmological multiverse we can never
*  Notice the boltzmann brains coming into existence
*  Tens of tens of tens of ten to the ten to the ten billion years in the future or whatever. So
*  It's saying something definite
*  But you don't know you're not going to be able to test it in any simple way. So should we count it as science?
*  Well, of course we should and pauper I think would agree with me about this because he had different fish to fry
*  The basic issue is that these scenarios could be true, right?
*  And that really could be the way nature works
*  And that's a difference with what pauper was worried about there really could be other universes out there elsewhere in the wave function
*  Or in space or in time
*  And the reason why it matters is because whether or not there are these other universes
*  Affects how we do science here in this universe
*  Trying to explain the data that we have in our observable part of the universe
*  When you do cosmology or when you do these large-scale scenarios to explain the universe things are connected to each other
*  They are interrelated
*  We talk about the multiverse and things we can't observe
*  But the reason why we talk about them is because they play an explanatory role in what we do observe
*  And this is just science. This is not anything new
*  I'm not in the camp that says we need to like think about a new paradigm for doing science because of the multiverse
*  It's exactly the same paradigm we always had we come up with a theory. We use it to account for the data
*  Okay
*  so
*  for example in the cosmological multiverse we
*  We invoke the cosmological multiverse as an explanation for the observed value of the vacuum energy
*  And possibly for the observed values of other constants of nature like the mass of the higgs boson and so forth
*  to account for the apparent
*  Mysterious numbers that we observe in physics the fine tuning of certain parameters
*  That was what stephen weinberg tried to do before we even knew the cosmological constant was not zero
*  And so the point is if you're a working physicist and you say I would like to understand why the vacuum energy has the value it does
*  Whether or not
*  You think that the cosmological multiverse is a promising theory
*  Absolutely indisputably affects what kind of theoretical
*  Ideas you will consider and put forward right if you don't think that the multiverse makes sense or is there
*  Then it is beholden on you to come up with some dynamical mechanism that explains
*  Why the cosmological constant has the value we observe?
*  If you do think that the multiverse is there then arguably you don't need to do that
*  It's just an environmental selection effect other you can't have a dynamical theory that predicts
*  With probability one that the cosmological constant has a certain value
*  And think that's a good theory if it has other values elsewhere, right?
*  So how you do science is affected by whether or not you take this particular theory seriously
*  Likewise for the many worlds of quantum mechanics again, you're trying to do science. We science is not done
*  Physics does not have the theory of everything yet
*  You're trying to build on what we currently know
*  And how you do that will be dramatically affected by your attitude towards the foundations of quantum mechanics
*  If you don't believe many worlds
*  Many worlds just comes out of thinking that there's a wave function or a quantum state that obeys the schrodinger equation
*  If you don't believe that you need to tell me either
*  What there is in addition to the wave function or why and how the wave function doesn't obey the schrodinger equation
*  That's extra work. You got to do if you don't believe in the many worlds of quantum mechanics
*  Tell me what the hidden variables are. Tell me what the explicit
*  objective collapse rule is if you believe in those kinds of things again, your practice of science is affected by the
*  Reasonability of this multiverse scenario and finally again likewise for the fluctuating cosmology the eternal fluctuating cosmology scenarios because
*  How do you account for the big bang in its low entropy state that will matter that will be affected by if you think our universe
*  Is eternal and fluctuating what do you think will happen in the future to our universe also?
*  Affects is affected by how you think about these scenarios
*  So in my mind, of course it is science. It's not a close call. It's not like, you know quasi science. It's hard
*  That's true. That's okay
*  I'm not saying that I can tell you some easy straightforward experiment that I can imagine to do which will once and for all
*  Reveal whether one of these multiverses exists or not
*  But nobody ever promised you a rose garden just because I can't think of an experiment which will help us change our
*  Credences to either close to zero or close to one doesn't mean it's not science. Sometimes science is just going to be hard
*  Sometimes we will be left in the dark for maybe a long time about what is the correct scenario
*  But there is something that is true about what the universe looks like outside our horizon
*  What the wave function of the universe looks like overall and so forth. So therefore in my mind it is completely science
*  Having said all that I think that and this is always a dangerous angle to take when you start to
*  Probe the psychology of people you don't agree with but I want to give people credit here a little bit
*  I think that the anxiety that is centered on multiverse scenarios
*  Does arise out of a perfectly legitimate worry and the worry is how do you think about our place in the universe in such?
*  Cases, okay
*  So this is fundamentally a philosophical problem like there's just no question
*  This is what philosophers were trained to do and and often there are philosophy papers written about problems that are
*  Typically not phrased in down-to-earth cosmological terms, but nevertheless utterly relevant to them
*  That address the question of what credence should we have for these different questions credence being a degree of belief
*  How confident are we that these things are true and in particular there's actually two different sets of credences
*  We need to think about one is the standard scientific question of which theory is correct
*  Okay, which theory is there a multiverse cosmological multiverse or not?
*  Is many worlds correct or is you know, bohme mechanics correct or something like that is the
*  The
*  Hilbert space of quantum gravity finite dimensional or infinite dimensional down to earth questions about what is the physics underlying what's going on?
*  So that's a credence that we all have as working scientists for these different models
*  And we would like to adjust them according to bays's theorem in the correct way
*  But there's also a different credence that comes in
*  And that's why the even though there's always some philosophy of science involved in doing science
*  Here the philosophy of science is sort of more interesting and fun
*  Because the other credence is who are we in the universe?
*  In other words, these are multiverse scenarios that have a lot of people in them
*  If it's the cosmological multiverse, we have different regions of space possibly an infinite number with different laws of physics
*  But some of them will have the same laws of physics and we can imagine there's a wide variety of different kinds of intelligent observers
*  In them, how do we place ourselves within?
*  That huge set of different numbers of observers in the case of many worlds
*  It's a very down to earth and very in your face version of this question when the wave function branches
*  And there are now two different versions of the observer who made the measurement
*  What probability do they assign to being on the spin up or spin down?
*  Branches of the wave function of the universe that they've measured the spin of some electron
*  That is the problem of deriving the born rule in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Which version are you?
*  Chips Evans, my Caltech colleague and I wrote a paper about this
*  Where we called it self-locating uncertainty or sometimes people also call it indexical uncertainty
*  It's not just there are many observers in the universe
*  There are multiple copies of the same kind of observer
*  They're different because one's on one branch of the wave function one's on the other
*  But they're identical except for where they are located in the universe that's self-locating uncertainty
*  Which one are you?
*  And finally for the Boltzmann brain slash eternally fluctuating universe scenario, right?
*  Are you a Boltzmann brain? Are you sure? Are you a Boltzmann something else or are you
*  Really really confident that you're an ordinary observer
*  And if so, does that lead you to reject the hypothesis that there are Boltzmann brains at all? Okay
*  all very good questions all questions that require
*  careful philosophical analysis and
*  Again, just to be a little bit editorializing here
*  You know one of the reasons why it's fun and interesting and also productive to get physicists and philosophers
*  Talking to each other is because they have different kinds of blind spots
*  I would say I love them both some of my best friends are physicists and or philosophers
*  But they have different things they're really good at and different things. They're not so good at
*  Philosophers are really good at telling you why your theory is wrong
*  I mean to put it in more careful terms
*  Philosophers are good at analyzing the logical chain of reasoning that leads you to some conclusion and telling you
*  You know where you messed up like you made a leap here. That isn't quite okay
*  Physicists just want to get the right answer and over and over again in the history of physics
*  They get the right answer for the wrong reasons, right?
*  You know the data always save you in physics
*  You will eventually get the right answer no matter how bad your reasoning is because the data just not going to let you
*  Continue to get it wrong over and over and over again
*  This is exactly the case where when you get to the multiverse you're going to get in trouble
*  Because you know with something like quantum field theory, you know
*  You write down the quantum field theory and it's in the 1930s or 40s and you get an infinite answer
*  And if you didn't have any data, you might just say well, this is bad theory's wrong answer is infinite
*  The data said you couldn't get away with that. You needed to do something about it
*  So you did a lot of work to understand renormalization and getting rid of the infinities and so forth
*  Even the invention of quantum mechanics is an example just like that where there was just so much data forcing you to these crazy conclusions
*  But the multiverse you can reason very sloppily about it
*  And think that you're on the right track because there's no immediate experiment that is guiding you to the correct answer, right?
*  That's exactly where philosophers
*  Are very helpful. That is their strong point
*  Their weak point in my mind
*  Is that they care less about getting the right answer than the right reasoning that gets you to whatever answer you're getting
*  That's a slightly overly harsh way of saying it
*  But the way that it shows up in practice is there's a lot of philosophical effort put into
*  Working out the consequences of theoretical constructs that in my mind I would say we know are not right
*  You know quantum field theory is a very good theory
*  But it's probably not the right answer for what nature does because it doesn't really play well with gravity
*  General relativity is a very good theory of gravity classically
*  But it's not the final answer for gravity because it doesn't play well with quantum mechanics
*  And there's a lot of my philosophy friends who just put a lot of effort into understanding
*  Consequences at the very very detailed level of these theories because it's a fun little puzzle, you know of logic, etc
*  But to me, it's not actually helping us understand nature that well, so I
*  Rely on philosophers to tell me where my chain of reasoning is wrong
*  But they're not as good at explaining at picking out a better theory and that's what physicists are very good at
*  So that's why we need both in the case of the multiverse. Okay editorializing over
*  To the problem that we're facing with you can think about it in terms of
*  Bayesian inference right Bayesian reasoning
*  We have Bayes's rule for those of you who don't know it Bayes's rule is a way of saying I have some propositions
*  Some are going to be true. Some are going to be false
*  Let's pick a set of propositions that are mutually exclusive
*  So they can't all be true at the same time like there is a cosmological multiverse or there's not okay
*  Or I am this branch of the wave function or i'm some other branch of the wave function
*  Well Bayes gives you a way of updating
*  That the probability the credence really that you put on these different propositions
*  When new information comes in when new data comes in as we usually say
*  And Bayes's rule says that the probability of any given theory
*  given the new data
*  Is proportional to the probability of what the probability you would have to get that data if the theory were true
*  Times the original prior probability of the theory
*  Okay
*  So you have some prior probability on all the different propositions like this multiverse or that multiverse you say if
*  These different propositions were true
*  What's the probability the likelihood as we call it that I would get some data?
*  You multiply those together and that tells you the probability of your theory now that you have that data
*  And the problem we're facing with here is
*  What exactly do you mean?
*  By the likelihood function of Bayesian analysis the likelihood is what is the probability you would see that data?
*  If this theory were true, okay
*  And unfortunately or fortunately the data we're talking about is I exist
*  That's the data. Okay
*  What is the probability that I would exist or you would exist if you can go ahead and do it yourself?
*  That we would exist in this cosmological scenario
*  What does that mean exactly? I mean, is it the probability that
*  Intelligent observers exist or would exist in this scenario or is it the probability that observers like me or exactly?
*  Like me really exist and do I have to like exist with certain other features or anywhere in the universe?
*  Etc
*  In fact, this is a well-known problem in Bayesian reasoning called the problem of old evidence
*  Does something that we've known about all along some evidence that we've had from the start?
*  Really help us update our priors. Does it provide extra evidence?
*  So does the fact that you and I are here thinking about this
*  Count as evidence for anything
*  I mean obviously if you have a cosmological scenario where I could not exist
*  Then I should give that a credence of zero. You know, I my existence is a very well known fact
*  But can I pretend not to know that?
*  Write down all the cosmological scenarios and then update the credences
*  I have on them using Bayes's rule and with the data that I do exist
*  I don't know. Can I do that? Like is that okay or
*  Did the fact that I exist already go into me making up these credences in the first place?
*  So I shouldn't count it twice. That's the problem
*  And then furthermore at a slightly more detailed level, you know if I say, okay, I exist
*  Is that supposed to favor a scenario where I would exist with probability 0.9?
*  Over a scenario where I would exist with probability 0.1
*  Maybe probably I mean that that seems reasonable. But okay. Now, what about this one?
*  What about comparing a universe where there is exactly one person like me
*  With another universe where there is a huge number a billion quintillion people exactly like me
*  In both universes the probability that someone like me exists is one
*  But there's more of people like me in the other universe
*  So should I count that should I give that a bonus?
*  Should I count that as extra evidence in favor of that cosmological scenario?
*  I'm not sure this is the question. This is what we're trying to address right here right now. So let me finally
*  You know, whenever I get the solo podcast, I just can't help talking and keep talking for a long time
*  So I'm finally now introduction over ready to talk about what we're actually here to talk about. How do we
*  Think about probabilities and credences in these multiverse theories and this is a question for the philosophy of cosmology
*  And it's look I'm not pioneering this this question people have certainly worried about this quite a bit
*  And there is a standard strategy
*  For dealing with this which is to say something like the following
*  We should reason as if we are typical in some reference class of observers
*  Okay
*  So the idea is this is called the principle of typicality or the principle of mediocrity
*  Right or the Copernican principle like the idea is that we're not special in the universe and the motivation comes from
*  The anthropic principle from thinking about this question
*  Allah Weinberg if you had many many different parts of the universe with let's say different values of the cosmological constant
*  How do you use that to make a prediction for what you should observe?
*  And the idea is you say well, there's many observers who are not very good at this
*  And the idea is you say well, there's many observers in this collection this ensemble, you know, some of them might live in
*  High values of the cosmological constant parts of the universe others might live in low values. Whatever there's some distribution
*  There's some number that you could figure out
*  And I should not according to this reasoning think of myself as special
*  I'm a typical observer in this and so I predict
*  That I should observe what a typical observer in this ensemble should see okay, that's the idea of typicality
*  mediocrity
*  Copernican principle whatever you want to call it
*  and I think that
*  Some version two things number one some version of this idea is more or less universally accepted among modern cosmologists
*  This is how modern cosmologists think if they think about it at all
*  Like i'm putting aside the people who just don't think it's science to talk about the multiverse within multiverse theorists
*  This idea that we should presume we're typical is more or less
*  consensus
*  And number two, I don't think it's very well defined or very good idea at all. I think we need to do better
*  That's why we're here having this conversation. So why am I worried about this? Well number one
*  Why?
*  Are we typical? Why are we supposed to think that we're typical observers?
*  I mean to me, it's perfectly obvious that I am not a typical observer even among people here on earth
*  Most people on earth don't have podcasts. There you go
*  That's one of the very large number of ways in which I am not a typical observer
*  So isn't that evidence against this so-called principle of reasoning that you are putting forward?
*  and even more
*  Importantly and at more technical level. I'm typical within
*  Precisely what class of observers?
*  like all living beings that you do bacteria count or do they have to be
*  Really conscious like what level of consciousness do I need to count as a typical observer in this
*  Scenario like what if there's a hive mind? What if there's the borg?
*  Do they count as one observer or they count as do I get count them separately for all the different?
*  Biological entities that went into making them up. Do I count?
*  Artificial observers do I count?
*  artificial intelligences in silicon in the simulation in the matrix
*  These are all important questions that are not immediately addressed
*  So this is called the reference class problem in these um in this sort of principle of typicality way of thinking
*  Let's put all that aside. I'm going to be very very generous for the moment. I'm going to say okay
*  Forget about the reference class problem. That's something to keep in mind. It should bug us
*  It seems that you know, you're proposing a fundamental
*  Principle of reasoning that is
*  Terrendously ill-defined that should worry you but let's assume you can figure it out. Let's assume that's a technicality
*  and
*  I would say nevertheless that this is not we're not done yet
*  Just to say we're typical in some reference class of observers isn't quite enough to let us make the next step and turn this into
*  Given a cosmological scenario. What probabilities do I predict?
*  So to make this down to earth, i'm gonna I can't draw pictures. It's an audio podcast
*  But I want you to imagine two different universes. Okay
*  Universe a and universe b universe a is a small universe by which I mean there are relatively few observers
*  There's maybe you know, maybe it doesn't have to be when I say relatively few
*  Maybe it's like the universe we see right with billions of galaxies in it and so forth
*  But nothing outside not an infinite amount of extra stuff
*  That's universe a small universe and then there's a big universe
*  Universe b is big and it's you know, physically in many ways like the small universe a but it's just bigger
*  So there's many many many more observers in universe b than in universe a. Okay, so we have two
*  numbers
*  For each scenario and when I talk about these universes, I should should try very hard to get the vocabulary, right?
*  These are two different theories not really two different universes. These are two different theories of
*  the
*  cosmological whole shebang the whole ensemble so
*  Theory a has relatively few observers everywhere in the multiverse
*  Theory b has many many many observers in the multiverse
*  Okay, and so they come attached with both the number of observers in them n a and n b
*  But then also our prior probabilities we're going to try to be good basians. We're going to try to say like
*  What do the observations tell us about these two cosmological scenarios should we give more
*  Likelihood to theory a or theory b. Okay, and so there's a prior probability that's based on you know
*  Questions of simplicity and fruitfulness and how well it fits in with other things we know about physics
*  Probability the prior probability of scenario a and scenario b then how do you reason?
*  In this set of questions, you know, how should we update our priors when new data comes in?
*  And there's actually out there. So even though I said
*  Almost every multiverse cosmologist believes some kind of version of the principle of typicality
*  They employ it in very different ways. And in fact, there's two different ways roughly speaking to two big popular camps
*  for dealing with this one is more popular than the other but
*  And they have terrible names one is called the self sampling assumption or ssa
*  And the other is called the self indication assumption or sia
*  We talked about these a little bit in the podcast with nick bostrom some while ago. He is
*  partly responsible for this nomenclature
*  So I honestly struggle because when you say ssa self sampling assumption and si a self indication assumption
*  those words
*  Imply nothing in my brain. I have no idea which is supposed to be which so i've rechristened them
*  Uh, think about them as the world first
*  versus observer first
*  Approaches, okay
*  So the world first approach says you assign assign your prior probability to each world each scenario, right?
*  Scenario a or scenario b and then inside each scenario you assume we are a typical observer, right?
*  So that's a very sensible thing to do you have your first year prior that the theory is right
*  Then within the theory you assume that you're typical but notice what this is doing if you had in
*  Theory a and theory b the same prior probability, right? They were equally likely a priori, but
*  There was only one observer like you in your reference class in in theory a
*  And who knows 10 to the 100 observers like you in theory b
*  Then the probability that you are that observer in theory a is 50 percent
*  And the probability that you are any one of the observers in theory b is 50 times 10 to the minus 100
*  So you see what's going on? It's like a non-trivial move
*  You're much more likely to be that particular single observer in the small universe scenario given these assumptions the world first approach
*  Then you are any one of the observers in the big universe
*  But the total probability here in the big universe is assumed to be equal under this set of assumptions
*  That's the self-sampling assumption. Okay ssa when other people out there
*  Talk about the self-sampling assumption
*  They mean the world first approach to assigning probabilities assign a prior to the scenario to the world
*  Then assume you're typical within it
*  The other approach the self-indication assumption is what I call the observer first approach
*  And this is a bit of a move here. You know, you can we'll argue about it, but people do
*  It's to say assume you're typical within the set of all observers
*  And what that means is effectively so all observers in all of the different scenarios assume that you are typical
*  and effectively and you
*  Need to do some extra work to make that work at a quantitative level because if you had different priors
*  for the different cosmological scenarios, then
*  How do you make how do you mean to assign yourself
*  Typicality within that ensemble of all of them, but you can do it you can do the math
*  You can run the numbers the point of this move, even though it seems a little bit counterintuitive is
*  If you have a cosmological scenario with more observers in it
*  Then you should think that that scenario is more likely to produce an observer like you
*  Right because there's just more ways
*  So if you if you don't say that these observers were considering in our reference class are exactly like you
*  Let's just say we have the reference class of all intelligent observers, right?
*  And in universe a there's literally one intelligent observer
*  And we don't know it's like a human-like observer
*  Maybe it's an octopus or a gas bag in the clouds of jupiter or something, right?
*  And in scenario b there's 10 to the 100 intelligent observers
*  The argument would be that even if on physics grounds
*  You had equal
*  prior probability for scenario a and scenario b
*  Given that you are a human being with certain characteristics and so forth
*  It's just easier to imagine someone just like you coming into existence
*  In the universe scenario with more observers in it
*  So we should count that more and well the way that we do that in this observer first approach the self-indication
*  Assumption is effectively to boost the prior probability by the number of observers in your reference class
*  So roughly speaking world first says
*  Give your prior probabilities to all the different scenarios and then assume you're typical within them
*  observer first says
*  Assume that you're somehow typical in the space of all observers in all possible worlds and therefore favor
*  Those scenarios with more observers in them. Okay, and uh bostrom himself
*  As well as people like brandon carter and alex flanken have argued for the world first approach
*  Um, uh ken olem and others have argued for the observer first approach. So they're both people arguing for these approaches
*  now
*  Do the philosophers have anything to tell us about this?
*  Well, yes, what philosophers are really good at is setting up a problem logically and clearly and then disagreeing about how to solve it
*  So there is a problem that if if you are a philosopher or you know, philosophically
*  adjacent
*  these words i've been telling you about
*  Small universe a big universe b assigning priors to them
*  Will very strongly remind you of a very well-known problem in philosophy called the sleeping beauty problem
*  Which I believe was first put in these words by adam elga a philosopher at princeton
*  And so the sleepy beauty problem is the following and it's nothing to do with cosmology, but you'll see what the connection is right away
*  So this is a thought experiment. You don't really do this
*  You would never get approval from the
*  institutional research board to do this experiment but the idea is
*  You have a test subject sleeping beauty who are you are going to put to sleep?
*  And then wake up and ask a question
*  Okay
*  and what happens is you put sleeping beauty to sleep and then you flip a coin and sleeping beauty knows exactly what the
*  The
*  Experimental protocol is going to be and the experimental protocol is the following you flip a coin after she's asleep
*  It's going to be heads or tails and it's a fair coin
*  So it's what you would ordinarily assign 50 50 credence to 50 50 for heads versus tails
*  If the coin comes up heads then you put her to sleep on monday on sunday
*  Sorry on monday you wake her up if it came up heads and you say what is your credence that the coin came up heads?
*  But if the coin came up tails
*  Then you wake her up monday you ask her that question and then you put her back to sleep
*  And you wipe her memory. This is why you would never get approval to do this in the real world
*  And you wake her up again on tuesday and you ask her the question again
*  So the difference is if the coin came up heads you only wake her up once
*  Well, you will wake her up on wednesday in either case and you know
*  Let her live her life
*  But you do the experiment where you wake her up and ask her about the credence that it's heads only once on monday if it is heads
*  If it was tails, you will wake her up and ask that question twice once on monday once on tuesday, okay?
*  And the question is when she is awakened and asked this question
*  What is your credence that the coin is came up heads? What should she say? What is the rational thing to say?
*  and I believe that um
*  Well, there's two possible there's two ways of thinking about it there is
*  the idea which elga originally argued for in his paper, which says that
*  Even though it's a 50 50 coin when sleeping beauty wakes up. She doesn't know whether it's monday or tuesday
*  She doesn't know whether it's been heads or tails
*  And she should give a one third
*  Probability one third credence to the question. Did the head did the coin come up heads?
*  Why well imagine that you changed the experiment a little bit and you told her if it was monday, okay
*  So now you're saying if it you wake her up
*  If it's heads and monday you say it's monday. What's the probability?
*  It was heads if it's tails and monday you say
*  It's tails and monday. Sorry. Yeah, it's monday. What is the probability was tails or heads?
*  And if it's tuesday you say up never mind. It's tuesday. Okay, this doesn't count
*  Well in that case, she knows that it's monday and there's a 50 50 chance of being heads or tails
*  And it's the same either way if it's monday. There's no extra thing going on. So therefore it's 50 50, right?
*  Or sorry, I shouldn't say I should I skipped ahead
*  She should give equal credences
*  To it being heads or being tails if she knows it's monday, right?
*  Because conditionalized on knowing that it's monday there's an equal probability that the coin came up heads or the coin came up tails
*  but you can also
*  Use the same logic says elga if you tell sleeping beauty that the coin came up tails
*  And ask her is it monday or tuesday, right? If the coin came up tails, she's going to be awakened twice
*  They're completely identical situations. She should have equal credences for it being monday or tuesday
*  And therefore you have equal credences for tails and monday tails and tuesday and heads and monday
*  There's only one way to make three numbers equal which is to make them one third each
*  I don't know whether or not that was a very clear explanation of the point you can wikipedia it's there or you can read elga's original paper
*  um, I think this is a very sensible this is a perfectly reasonable thing to say
*  Because you know think about just doing the experiment over and over again, right and think about making bets with sleeping beauty
*  You know is are you gonna bet that it was heads or tails?
*  You'll be making bets twice as often
*  With versions of sleeping beauty where the thing came up tails, right?
*  Because there she will be awakened both monday and tuesday
*  And therefore the way to break even for sleeping beauty is to assign equal probabilities to each of the three possibilities
*  Heads tails monday tails tuesday. That's the thirder possibility
*  But then david lewis comes along a famous philosopher who uh passed away a while
*  ago and lewis said no no no
*  Before she goes to sleep on sunday sleeping beauty would assign a credence of 50 50 to the coin coming up heads or tails
*  And when you wake her up
*  She gains no new information in the original version of the experiment
*  She's not told whether it's monday or tuesday
*  So she's just awakened and she should stick by her guns and still say
*  That the credence for the coin coming up heads or tails is 50 50. You don't learn anything new
*  Okay, so most of us would say that the thirder position is probably a bit more
*  Reasonable a bit more intuitive. Anyway, whether it's right or not again people argue back and forth david lewis adam alga both very smart people
*  But think about what's going on
*  the thirder position
*  Is basically saying I give even even though my prior probability
*  For the head for the tails for for the coin coming up heads or tails was 50 50
*  If I know that in the tales universe
*  There will be two copies of me
*  One that woke up monday one that woke up tuesday and in the heads universe. There is only one copy of me
*  If i'm giving equal probability to all three of those ideas. That's the observer first approach
*  The observer first approach in cosmology the self-indicating assumption
*  Was assume we are typical in the set of all observers
*  In all different universes the analogy is that the different universes are a universe where the head where the coin comes up heads
*  And the universe where the coin comes up tails a scenario a scenario where it's heads a scenario where it's tails, right?
*  If you just stuck with the world first approach
*  You assign a prior to being in the heads world 50
*  Prior to the being the tails word 50 the fact that there are more of you in the tails world doesn't matter
*  so
*  Hopefully the tension here is a little bit clear when I described what was going on in the cosmology
*  Context I think like the more obvious intuitively appealing thing is the world first approach
*  You assign a probability prior probability to a cosmological scenario and only afterward do you assume you're typical within that?
*  Whereas in the sleeping beauty approach what seems to be kind of like most obviously intuitive
*  Is the observer first approach where we give equal credences to being all of the observers in all of the different scenarios
*  So what this should be teaching us is we need to think about it. This is not an obvious set of things to do at all. Okay
*  Now it's gonna get worse
*  I'm just gonna keep digging holes for us because remember my goal here is not to tell you the one once and for all final
*  Answer even though I have some ideas
*  But rather it is to explain why this is such an interesting philosophical problem
*  and the problem is
*  that in either
*  idea with either the world first approach
*  Assign priors to different cosmological scenarios and then assume you're typical within them
*  Or the observer first approach where you assume you're typical within the set of all possible observers
*  both of them lead you to
*  Draw conclusions that in retrospect seem unwarranted
*  Okay, so there is a name there is a something called the presumptuous philosopher problem
*  That arises in the observer first approach, but I think that there are equally weird problems that arise in either approach
*  So let me tell you what the problems are because I think they stem from the same mistake ultimately
*  In the world first approach so remember i'm gonna keep repeating this because I know it's hard to keep the jargon straight
*  The world first approach is I first assign accretance to the different scenarios, then I assume i'm some i'm typical within the scenario
*  So the problem here is that you seem to be giving yourself leverage over the future
*  This leads to what is called the doomsday argument that you predict imminent demise for humanity
*  And let me explain what I mean by that so
*  Let the reference class remember the world first so we have a reference class
*  We're gonna assume we're typical within it
*  But what we do is we first assign a prior probability and then we assume we're typical within all the observers within that scenario
*  so let theory a the small universe theory be a theory in which there are
*  200 billion human beings who will ever live
*  Okay, so we can go we can go again go to wikipedia and ask how many human beings have ever lived in the history up to today
*  The answer is about a hundred billion
*  so what we're assuming here in theory a is a cosmological scenario where
*  About an equal number of human beings are born in the future
*  It won't take that long. We already have like seven or eight billion already alive
*  So because of population growth won't take that many more years before we reach a total of 200 billion
*  And then we imagine some terrible disaster happens
*  Okay
*  That's theory a that's a cosmological scenario in a very broad
*  Idea of what qualifies as cosmology theory b is
*  Humanity is much more successful. So theory a is like humanity is doomed pretty soon
*  You know in 100 or 200 years humanity is going to be gone
*  Theory b says no humanity is going to flourish for a long time and maybe you know
*  It will go away, but it won't necessarily go away by dying. Maybe we'll transform into something else
*  But who cares the point is that in theory b the big universe theory we're imagining there are 200
*  Trillion human beings who will ever exist
*  So theory a only has 200 billion human beings only twice as many that actually have existed theory b has 200 trillion
*  so over a thousand times
*  The number that have already existed
*  now
*  Those are our two scenarios. We have some prior
*  that they are
*  Likely or unlikely. What is the prior?
*  Well, I don't know roughly speaking, but let's assume they're not too different
*  This is always a problem with bayesian reasoning is assigning what the prior credences are supposed to be but let's assume they're not too different
*  Let's be sufficiently pessimistic that we say look it's completely plausible
*  That humanity wipes itself out within a few centuries, right? I think that is plausible
*  So let's let's give that some prior and let's give the more successful theory b some other prior
*  Who cares about the exact numbers? They won't be relevant
*  The point is we have data
*  In in this scenario in this way of thinking about things with the world first scenario
*  We have assigned our prior and now we update
*  On the basis of the data. What is the data? The data is that we find ourselves within the first hundred billion
*  Human beings whoever existed. Okay
*  And the reasoning is without going into the numbers the reasoning is in theory a
*  That data is really likely
*  You know if there's only 200 billion humans that will ever exist
*  The probability that a random human a typical human is within the first hundred billion is 50. It's pretty darn likely
*  But in theory b if there are 200 trillion humans, then the probability that you find yourself within the first hundred billion is really small
*  Less than 10 to the minus 3, right?
*  So therefore the logic goes I have I can now conclude
*  Using reasoning that theory a is 10 to the 3 times more likely than I thought it was based on my prior probabilities
*  In other words, I predict just on the basis that I am a typical person that humanity won't last for much longer
*  That's why it's called the doomsday argument
*  And uh brendan carter john leslie richard gott other people have argued exactly along these lines
*  That's the prediction of the observer first scenario that because we are more likely
*  To have certain qualities if those qualities are typical we can reason our way into believing that if we're typical
*  Life is not going to continue on for human beings much longer
*  It might not be a doomsday scenario like maybe we all get uh uplifted or sublimed into the matrix or something like that
*  That would also count but human beings as we know it are not going to last very long
*  Uh according to this doomsday reasoning and richard gott in particular got a lot of publicity for pushing this this way of reasoning
*  um, there's a very
*  similar argument that was put forward by uh, james hartle and mark frednicki, um where they consider
*  Two different scenarios one of which is human beings
*  With roughly speaking, you know 10 billion human beings live today. That's a little bit larger, but okay, just a round number
*  Human beings are the only life forms only intelligent life forms in the solar system, right? That's the uh theory a assumption
*  Theory b is that there are human beings here on earth, but also
*  the atmosphere of jupiter
*  is
*  Teaming with life forms with intelligent beings. There's 10 trillion jovians out there
*  Okay
*  So a thousand times more intelligent jovians than there are human beings here on earth. That's theory b
*  So two cosmological scenarios both of which fit our data, uh that we have, you know from telescopes, etc
*  Perfectly. Well, we haven't really explored the uh atmosphere of jupiter so we can assign some priors to these but then
*  We do reasoning we do logic from this world first point of view and the idea would be
*  In theory a if we're typical observers
*  Well, typical observers would be humans because theory a says the only observers in the solar system are humans
*  Under theory b a typical observer
*  In the solar system would be a jovian, right? It would be a gas bag floating in the atmosphere of jupiter
*  We are not a gas bag floating in the atmosphere of jupiter. Therefore we have good evidence against theory b
*  Because in this way of thinking
*  And by the way, I mean harlund schradnicki are making this argument to make fun of it
*  They don't believe this argument. They say surely you don't believe this what they're saying is we can
*  Conclude that there probably aren't 10 trillion intelligent gas bags in the atmosphere of jupiter without ever going and looking
*  Just by sitting in our armchairs and doing this kind of reasoning, right?
*  And what's going on is that by assuming that we are typical observers?
*  We are granting ourselves huge amount of leverage over what a typical observer is
*  So in other words the way I like to put it is when you say well, i'm a typical observer
*  Principle of mediocrity, right? You know, it sounds all humble
*  It sounds like you're not really saying anything grandiose
*  But if you think about it
*  the
*  Proposal that you are a typical observer in the universe is really proposing the typical observers in the universe are like you
*  typical observers are
*  Roughly in our era of human history typical observers are here on earth not in jupiter, right?
*  So you're giving yourself enormous leverage over the rest of the universe by assuming that there aren't many many more
*  Observers that are not like you because if there were a typical observer wouldn't be like you
*  So this is the worry that this world first approach which seemed logical when we first said it out loud
*  Is secretly granting you an enormous amount of leverage over the universe without ever getting out of your armchair and looking at it
*  So you might say okay. I want to fix that problem
*  Um, I don't believe these doomsday arguments or aliens arguments
*  Let's go to the observer first approach the observer first approach. Remember
*  gives a boost to scenarios that have more observers in them because you're saying that you're
*  Typical within the set of all observers over all the different possible scenarios
*  so if you were
*  If you give a boost to let's say the theory where human beings last longer
*  Or a boost to the prior probability the prior credence to the theory where there are a lot of aliens on jupiter
*  So in both
*  Large universe scenarios get more of a boost and then you conditionalize by observing that you're in this tiny little
*  Piece of the universe these cancel out
*  Okay, and so you don't end up helping yourself to extra reasoning or extra conclusions about the large universe
*  But
*  So in other words the observer first approach gets rid of the doomsday argument or the jovians argument
*  It has a different problem and this is technically what bostrom has labeled the presumptuous philosopher problem
*  So again, let and i'll pick yet another set of numbers just to be clear about this. Um
*  Let's imagine scenario a some cosmological scenario with I don't know
*  A trillion observers 10 to the 12 observers in it and cause a scenario b is a big universe
*  Something like 10 to the 21 observers in it and as far as physics is concerned
*  They're equally simple these two scenarios. There's no reason to think that the big universe or the small universe are favored
*  Precisely as we would say for is the universe beyond our horizon
*  Stretching on for infinity or does it curl up into a sphere or a torus or whatever? There's no strong
*  Huge difference between those two scenarios. Do we live in an infinite universe or a finite one?
*  I could imagine good arguments for either one
*  I would give them roughly equal credences if I didn't have any other information
*  And what bostrom points out is that if you take the observer first approach so you give
*  Equal priors or roughly comparable priors to the small universe in the big universe
*  But now you say you're a typical observer within the entire ensemble then with overwhelming probability
*  With probability 10 to the 9 or so with you know, 1 minus 10 to the 9, I suppose
*  You're going to be in the big universe because there's more observers in the big universe. Therefore you conclude that
*  Theory b is correct. You conclude that our universe does in fact extend infinitely far
*  It does not curl up into a sphere or a torus just because there are many more observers
*  In that scenario and so to bostrom even though he's a fan of like the doomsday argument. He says that's presumptuous
*  I don't think that I should be able to conclude that the universe is big
*  Just from the fact that I exist again without getting out of my armchair without doing anything
*  So
*  This is the problem as I see it you started in both ways
*  In the world first or observer first approach you started by acting humble by saying
*  I'm just a typical observer nothing special about me
*  But in either way just the assumption that you are a typical observer has given you enormous leverage over what the rest of the universe
*  Is like without going out and looking at it
*  So the point is the typicality is actually presumptuous
*  It is not humble at all
*  The statement I am typical is the statement of the universe
*  The statement I am typical is the statement that typical observers are like me
*  What right do you have to say that that is saying something really really strong about the nature of the universe that you haven't looked at?
*  Hmm. Okay. So this is a problem
*  This is a problem for anthropic reasoning. This is a problem for
*  trying to go from a scenario like
*  The cosmological multiverse to a prediction for the cosmological constant the vacuum energy, right?
*  We need to have some mechanism you have some formula some formalism
*  That allows us to plug in numbers and and the good thing about the principle of typicality was that that's what it let us do
*  You know, let's let us say if there were
*  There were some different competing theories of the universe with different numbers of observers and so forth and we had
*  Distributions over what those observers saw you could make predictions for what those what we should see in that scenario
*  And if we can't assume that we're typical
*  Then how do we make predictions? How do we use anthropic reasoning at all? Can we use it at all?
*  So there are a couple of different solutions to this. Um, and I I want to talk
*  About one solution that I don't like because it's a little I I know why people do like it, you know, it's it's tempting
*  Um, but I really want I want to disagree with it. So
*  This is the point of that hartel and schvettnicki paper. I'll try to remember to put you know links to some of these papers in
*  the show notes
*  um the hartel and schvettnicki paper
*  Which gave us the issue with the aliens and the jovians and whatever. Why was it doing that?
*  It was to argue against typicality at all. That was their point they thought
*  And I agree with them this far, but not with their solution to it
*  They thought that assuming we're a typical observer is both
*  Unjustified and leads to incorrect conclusions. It's it's too presumptuous
*  So what is their solution? Their solution is what they call a zero graphic distribution
*  so what they
*  Say is that when you have a theory a cosmological theory with many observers
*  Rather than just saying we are a typical observer
*  In other words, we have equal probability of being any observer in this universe within some specified reference class
*  The theory comes not just with a list of observers but with the distribution
*  Over those observers and the distribution over those observers tells you what is the probability?
*  That you are one of those observers. Okay, so in other words they consider two different theories
*  um, so here's a cosmological
*  Scenario that has no boltzmann brains in it. So theory a the small universe theory has ordinary observers in it
*  people like you and me who
*  Came to exist after the big bang as a result of the evolution governed by the arrow of time, etc
*  Etc, etc ordinary thermodynamic observers. Let's imagine there's some large number of those 10 to the 40th
*  I don't know. I made up a number and zero boltzmann brains. So let's imagine, you know, the universe just settles down
*  There are no fluctuations. No boltzmann brains. That's theory a okay
*  But then there's theory b theory b has the same number of ordinary observers
*  But it also has a ginormous number of boltzmann brains in it
*  10 to the 10 to the 100 or whatever you want 10 to the 10 to the 10 of the 10 of the 100 if you want
*  a large number of boltzmann brains and
*  We'll get in a little bit to what I mean exactly by a boltzmann brain because that's a important question here
*  But an observer who has randomly fluctuated into existence. That's what I mean by that for the moment
*  so the
*  Typical cosmologist on the street when faced with these two scenarios would say okay
*  There's scenario a only ordinary observers. No boltzmann brains
*  Scenario b that has both and there are a lot of boltzmann brains
*  And the way that most cosmologists on the street would reason is to say well
*  I am an ordinary observer
*  And the probability that I would be an ordinary observer in theory a is one
*  All observers in theory a are ordinary ones. So the likelihood function
*  For being an ordinary observer conditionalized on theory a being correct is one
*  That's the the data is i'm ordinary the theory is theory a there are no boltzmann brains
*  Whereas in theory b the probability under the typicality assumption
*  That I would be an ordinary observer is vanishingly small 10 to the minus 10 to the 100
*  Okay, if theory b were right, I would be a boltzmann brain because most observers are boltzmann brains
*  Therefore says the ordinary cosmologist on the street
*  Theory b is ruled out. I don't need to leave my armchair. I know that's not right because if it were right
*  I would be a boltzmann brain
*  What hartlund schvernicke say this is a very different move than most cosmologists make they want to say
*  I don't know whether theory a or theory b is right. I have not left my armchair and I shouldn't allow myself to conclude
*  Issues that only have to deal with things that are far away from my armchair or any of my other observations
*  And what but they that's okay
*  But then they say well, I know i'm not a boltzmann brain
*  and
*  Yet, I want to be
*  In some sense typical but not really so that's what they solve with this idea of a zero graphic distribution
*  And so they say that in addition to theory a saying there's just ordinary observers. No boltzmann brains theory b saying
*  There's ordinary observers and the boltzmann brains
*  Theory b needs to come along with the distribution over those observers and they say well consider the following distribution
*  Within theory b so theory b has both ordinary observers and boltzmann brains
*  They say what if my probability of being a certain kind of observer?
*  Is zero for all the boltzmann brains?
*  And one over the number of ordinary observers for all the ordinary observers
*  So i'm typical but only within the subset of ordinary observers
*  So they're admitting that there exist all these boltzmann brains
*  But they're putting this extra probability distribution that just says by fiat. I am not one of them
*  How can they justify doing that? Well, they look around and they know they're not one of them
*  This might be considered cheating right because you're using your data to define your theory ahead of time
*  Yeah, maybe it's a little cheating but we'll get to the specific way in which I think this this fails
*  But the claim is that this solves the boltzmann brain problem, you know without doing any work. So
*  most cosmologists want to say
*  If your cosmological scenario predicts that most observers are boltzmann brains, then your cosmological scenario is wrong
*  But hartl and shrednicki want to say is all it shows is that you're not a boltzmann brain
*  I'm perfectly happy to consider universes that have lots of boltzmann brains in them because I can just say i'm not one of them
*  That is their move with this zero graphic distribution. Okay
*  Here's why I don't think that works. I I really do think that it's cheating
*  And the reason why it's cheating is a slightly more nuanced comes from a slightly more nuanced understanding of what you mean
*  By a boltzmann brain like people like literally today on twitter for no good reason someone was asking about boltzmann brains and
*  What counts as a boltzmann brain? Like how much oxygen do you need?
*  How much of a body do you need? How long do you need to survive to be a boltzmann brain?
*  So my point is that none of these questions matter in any real point because you can work
*  The calculation the other way around you tell me
*  What you want to count as an observer? Okay
*  Do you just need a brain? Do you need a brain in a body? Do you need a brain in a body?
*  On a planet with an atmosphere. Do you need a family?
*  Do you need other people to keep you happy do you need maybe
*  Everything you see so are you an observer that is literally in exactly the macroscopic state that you personally are in right now
*  So what's in your brain all the things you're seeing with your eyeballs. They're really there
*  So like let's take all that but the point is i'm defining all of this stuff
*  In terms of stuff that exists right now
*  Okay, not i'm not i'm not allowed to include the history of the stuff that got you there
*  I'm saying here are different kinds of observers that can exist at one point in time and we can
*  Basically classify them into two types. There are
*  Third thermodynamically sensible observers, right?
*  This is what we called ordinary observers people like you and me people who came into existence through ordinary evolution through physical processes biology
*  natural selection, etc
*  From a low entropy past in some sense the past hypothesis
*  Which you've heard me talk about before the idea that there was a low entropy past around 14 billion years ago
*  That's what gives rise in the immediate aftermath a few tens of billions of years aftermath to thermodynamically sensible observers
*  And the thing about those observers is when they look out at the cosmic microwave background, for example, and they say aha
*  That's evidence of a low entropy past and that's literally telling me that the universe was pretty smooth at very very early times and therefore low
*  Entropy. Well, there's a secret there. There's a secret
*  Step in that conclusion. How do you know when you look at the universe that the universe did have a low entropy?
*  the answer is that it's
*  Consistent but it's not implied by any observations we make if you just say
*  Let's think of all the different possible ways that photons could hit my telescope
*  And give me a map of the cosmic microwave background that looks like the one we see
*  Most of them do not correspond to universes where the early times really were smooth
*  It's true that if the early universe was smooth, then we would see what we see in our telescopes
*  But it's not true that if we see what we see in our telescopes, then the early universe must have been smooth
*  Just conditionalizing on what we see in our telescopes and not some extra assumption about entropy
*  It is overwhelmingly likely that the early universe was really really lumpy
*  Wily in homogeneous from place to place, but there's a number of different effects that give rise to the final
*  Wavelength of light when we observe it. There's the density and the temperature. There's also the doppler effect
*  There's also gravitational redshift and blue shift, etc. There's a whole bunch of effects
*  And even though it seems really unlikely
*  It is much more probable that there are wildly fluctuating things going on all of which almost exactly cancel out
*  By the time the photons reach us and this is just a fancy roundabout way of saying that given any
*  medium entropy state
*  Like us here in our telescope looking at the past
*  Given any medium entropy state there are many more high entropy pasts from which it could have evolved via a random fluctuation
*  Then there are low entropy paths that would naturally have led to it
*  So I know i'm repeating myself, but this is a critical and kind of difficult point. So i'll repeat it again
*  If you start by saying what are the kinds of early conditions which naturally would lead to us?
*  The answer is they must have been low entropy. I talked about this with david wallace on the podcast not too long ago
*  but if instead you're asking
*  What are the kinds of conditions?
*  That naturally would be in the past given that we're here
*  You see the difference you're asking a slightly different question not what are the kinds of universes?
*  That the kinds of initial conditions that would usually lead to us
*  But instead what are the kinds of what are the total set of universes that could lead to us? Okay
*  So the kinds of universes that could lead to us kinds of initial conditions early universe scenarios are overwhelmingly high
*  Entropy and we're the result of a random fluctuation
*  Okay
*  So all of this was a aside to say the idea of a thermodynamically sensible observer is one for whom that's not the case
*  We did not randomly fluctuate into existence
*  There the past hypothesis that says that there's low entropy is correct and therefore our inferences from the data
*  About what happened in the past of our universe are reliable
*  thermodynamically sensible
*  And then there's another kind of observer the generalization of the idea of a boltzmann brain
*  Which we can call a randomly fluctuated observer
*  Okay
*  So if you don't have a past hypothesis if you don't insist by assumption that the early universe had low entropy
*  All you know is some features of your current state
*  then
*  If you live in a thermal universe that exists forever if you listen live in this, uh eternal thermally fluctuating universe
*  It is overwhelmingly likely that both your past and your future had higher entropy
*  And that you represent a random fluctuation
*  And this has nothing to do with brains or minimal observers or anything like that
*  The statement is that for any conditions on your current macroscopic self
*  If that's all, you know
*  You don't also know the past hypothesis if you just think that you are an element of some randomly fluctuating ensemble
*  You have resulted from
*  A set of wild coincidences canceling out in the past to go from high entropy to create you, okay?
*  And if you live in this universe with random fluctuations forever the number of randomly fluctuating
*  observers of any kind
*  In other words any macroscopic features
*  Living on earth have a sun have memories in their heads whatever you want to say
*  Conditions that you put on your present self the number of randomly fluctuating observers like that
*  Is enormously larger than the number of thermodynamically sensible observers like that if you live in this randomly fluctuating universe
*  So this is the problem if you really think about it with the hartl and shrednicki
*  Way of wriggling out of the bolsterman brain problem because they say well, I just
*  Assume by fiat that i'm not a bolsterman brain
*  Fine, let's imagine that i've let you do that. There are still if you live in that eternally fluctuating cosmology
*  There are still observers that look exactly like you
*  But our random fluctuations by exactly like you I mean wherever you're sitting the room around you
*  I'll grant you the entire earth if you want
*  Okay
*  And all of the light that is coming to the earth from the sun and the stars and the planets and whatever all that stuff
*  I will grant you all that
*  It is still true that you are overwhelmingly likely to be randomly fluctuated into existence
*  In fact, I can continue on I can say like let's take our past light cone
*  Let's take you and all of your observations and extend it into the past and assume
*  That everything you think is true about your past is true. I'm going to grant you all of that
*  but I say also
*  That past that you think you're observing is not actually
*  Resulting from a uniform universe. It's it's a
*  Selection out of an ensemble in a randomly fluctuating eternal universe
*  Okay, like hartl and tridniki want to allow for they want to say that's okay
*  So if I give you your entire past and say I conditionalize on observers like that
*  They are still likely to be part of a bigger thermal equilibrium ensemble
*  Which means that tomorrow when you go out to the telescope and look at the microwave background, it won't be there anymore
*  It just your previous experience
*  Was just a random fluctuation. There's no reason because
*  Think about it. Sorry, you need to back up because this is obvious to me
*  But if you have not really thought about cosmology and general relativity, it's not always obvious
*  When we look at the cosmic microwave background, we're looking into the past right? We're using light to observe conditions far away
*  It takes light time to reach us and therefore
*  Billions of years have passed since the moment that this photon that we are observing today
*  Last interacted with the microwave background and as time goes on what that means is
*  There's more and more time between
*  The formation of the cosmic microwave background and us
*  So we're looking more and more time back at regions of the cosmic microwave background that were created slightly further away
*  The horizon that we have by stretching our past light cone back to the microwave background
*  Grows gradually with time as we get older
*  So we're looking at slightly different portions of the cosmic microwave background
*  And the point is if everything that we know is just a random fluctuation
*  There's no reason to think about it
*  Tomorrow we should look out and see no microwave background at all
*  That would be the most likely thing most likely way for the universe to be conditionalized on our current observations
*  And giving you everything about the actual past of our light cone
*  And I would argue I think that Harlan Tridnicki would disagree with me
*  But I would argue that there's zero principles of the cosmic microwave background
*  I think that Harlan Tridnicki would disagree with me
*  But I would argue that there's zero principle reason to exclude observers like that from your zero graphic distribution
*  If your motivation for excluding observers was I only want to consider observers who had legitimate fair inferences from the data
*  Reliable inferences from the past based on their observations
*  Then observers like I just described are perfectly okay
*  And there are many many more of them than ones that came from a universally low entropy condition
*  At very early times those observers who would still see the microwave background there tomorrow
*  So I would argue that their theory makes a prediction
*  And their prediction I mean they made it years ago so it's been falsified many many times
*  In other words the problem is not Boltzmann brains
*  The problem is Boltzmann use
*  The problem is whoever you are whatever you think about your current macroscopic state
*  You could have fluctuated randomly into existence
*  And if you believe that the cosmological scenario is one that is dominated by random fluctuations
*  Then you probably did fluctuate into existence just like that
*  And you're trying if you're Hartle and Shroudnicki to discriminate against Boltzmann brains
*  But there's no reason to discriminate against Boltzmann use in that cosmological scenario
*  Except because you just don't like it
*  You don't want to be a random fluctuation and therefore you say I deny that that's what I am
*  I think there's no principled reason to do that
*  This is a different version of the presumptuousness
*  You're just assigning a probability to being a certain observer
*  Not on the basis of any data whatsoever or any even reasonably chosen probability distribution
*  But just because you want a certain conclusion to be true
*  And I don't think that's that's not how science or cosmology or philosophy for that matter typically works
*  But I do think there is a slightly better way of doing things
*  I don't think it's the once and for all answer
*  But it sort of is suggested by the reasoning we just went through
*  Because at the end what I was arguing for was there is a kind of typicality that we really can't
*  wriggle out of in the case of these eternally fluctuating universes there are Boltzmann use
*  Right which means that this is you y-o-u in case you can't hear my lettering when I'm talking
*  There are random fluctuations with all of the characteristics of your current macroscopic self
*  And even though I was arguing earlier against thinking that we're typical in the set of all
*  possible observers if you limit yourself to the set of all observers exactly identical to you
*  macroscopically then I do think you kind of got to be typical in that set because you have no
*  criterion to distinguish between them so in the set of all people named Sean Carroll who have
*  podcasts called mindscape etc etc etc people in the multiverse with all of the macroscopic
*  features that I have if that's all I know I should assign equal probability to being them
*  there are subtleties there with quantum mechanics and different branches of the wave function but in
*  a classical ensemble I have no reason to assign myself in in allocating credences in this situation
*  of self-locating uncertainty I have no reason to favor some versions of me over the others I should
*  be typical within the set of me's in the universe and this idea was actually put forward by
*  Radford Neal who is a statistician at the University of Toronto and he calls the idea
*  fully non-indexical conditioning so what does that mean so it means you condition over everything
*  you know about you right so you say I already know I'm an earthling whatever you know about yourself
*  you know your age your gender okay etc everything you know about you your memories of the past your
*  observations of the universe all that counts you can conditionalize on that except for where you
*  are in the universe that's the non-indexical part that's what you can't conditionalize over because
*  you don't know it and so then what you're saying is it's a very different approach than the typical
*  cosmologists uses right the typical cosmologist says well there are some there is some notion of
*  observers and I don't know exactly what it means but they're they're smart people you know people
*  who can do science whatever it takes and I'm typical within that set and that lets me do
*  predictions because you know if I have a universe or a multiverse with different values of the
*  cosmological constant I can ask questions like you know what do most of these observers see
*  the problem with the apparent problem with fully non-indexical conditioning with saying I'm only
*  typical within the people set of people who have exactly my macroscopic data is how do I reason
*  anthropically right the the suggestion is that when you do that Bayesian calculation and you're
*  saying the probability of the data given the theory you interpret that as the probability
*  that there exists an observer in exactly your macroscopic configuration which seems to sort
*  of rule out the possibility of predicting things for like the cosmological constant because we've
*  already observed it people like me know what the cosmological constant is so there's no extra
*  prediction to be made so that is a that is a problem with it I'm upfront about what the problems
*  are but the problems are far outweighed by the benefits I think and the benefits are not 100
*  which is why I don't think this is the final answer but this is instead of saying you're a
*  typical observer just saying you are you and accepting that so taking all the old evidence
*  into consideration what does that lead you to conclude well let's go back to our presumptuousness
*  problems right in the world first approach where you assigned prior probabilities to different
*  scenarios and then said you were typical within them we had the doomsday argument we said oh well
*  if we're typical human beings then typical human beings are going to be within a couple generations
*  of us in the future and therefore humanity is going to die okay well the fully non-indexical
*  approach says I am I am me so I know how many other human beings there are I know how many
*  years ago agriculture was invented and the industrial revolution was etc and that's the
*  only set within which I'm typical so I can conclude nothing about the existence of either
*  future human beings or of alien gas bags on Jupiter I am not pretending to be typical within
*  those sets therefore I can do no reasoning that gives me any armchair insight into whether or not
*  I am whether or not those scenarios are legitimate so from this point of view there is no
*  extra benefit to sorry there is no way for me to say that humanity will end soon or there are no
*  aliens on Jupiter what about the Boltzmann brain problem if you are a typical observer right a
*  typical observer within exactly observers that have your data your macroscopic information here
*  I have to fudge a little bit and I'm being I'm trying to be overly honest I think it's a
*  perfectly legitimate fudge but I have to add an extra principle of thinking about these things
*  because by this logic if you live in the universe which is eternally fluctuating then indeed most
*  as I just said as I just tried to explain most observers with exactly my macroscopic data will
*  be random fluctuations not people who are thermodynamically sensible so and furthermore
*  you can go on to say that the probability of the existence of someone just like me will generally
*  be higher than the probability sorry the probability exists in someone like me in a randomly fluctuating
*  eternal universe is basically one right and given the local laws of physics that we're going to keep
*  fixed for this thought experiment eventually someone like me will randomly fluctuate into existence
*  whereas the probability of me existing in a small universe right if I just believe in the ordinary
*  big bang with a hot big bang with which makes hundreds of billions of galaxies but not an
*  infinite number then there is some probability of getting a person like me but it's a small
*  probability right even if you think that the probability of getting life somewhere in the
*  universe is pretty large the probability of getting exactly me is pretty small so much like the
*  observer first approach this approach does give a little bit of a boost to larger universes because
*  what I'm saying is what is the probability of someone like me coming into existence so it's not
*  the total number of observers that counts for its own sake it's the probability of me existing
*  that counts and a larger universe has a larger probability of me existing so therefore for the
*  boltzmann brain problem I need to worry why am I not a boltzmann brain and the fudge is the following
*  I believe that I can't believe that I am a boltzmann brain that's the problem the problem is as I
*  talked about in this paper I wrote why boltzmann brains are bad cognitive instability of the
*  boltzmann brain scenario so as I said if you believe in the scenario with random fluctuations
*  causing observers to come into existence all sorts of observers will randomly fluctuate into existence
*  and including in fact dominated by observers who are completely wrong about everything so
*  observers who have thoughts and beliefs both about the empirical situation in the universe and also
*  about the laws of physics and the laws for that matter of logic and reasoning and and science
*  but all of those thoughts about all those principles and pieces of data randomly fluctuated
*  into their brains so here is the problem if you use logic and reason to conclude that you are
*  probably a boltzmann fluctuation then you must also think that you have no right to believe
*  any of the steps you used along the way to do that reasoning because all of those steps were
*  based on principles of logic and reasoning that just randomly fluctuated into your brain
*  so this is a different kind of thing what I would therefore say is in order to be consistent
*  in thinking about this I have to modify the prior probability that I put in these scenarios by some
*  sort of cognitive factor a factor that says I am not going to give any prior probability or
*  essentially none maybe some incredibly tiny number to scenarios in which people like me would get
*  everything wrong because I want to try to get everything right so I can't reason my way into
*  saying I'm not a boltzmann brain but I can reason myself way my way into saying I shouldn't believe
*  I'm a boltzmann brain and what that means is I shouldn't consider cosmological scenarios in which
*  I should be a boltzmann brain did that make sense anyway the point is the reason why I would argue
*  we should give zero credence to boltzmann brain dominated cosmologies is not because we look around
*  and see we're not boltzmann brains that's just what a boltzmann brain would say it's not internally
*  consistent to say that rather we should rule them out a priori on just principles of reasoning
*  and if you think that's presumptuous it's only presumptuous if you think that you might actually
*  be a boltzmann brain which I don't think that anyone really thinks that they are certainly I'm
*  not advocating that you do think that I'm just advocating that we concentrate as working cosmologists
*  on developing cosmological scenarios in which most observers like me are not boltzmann brains and
*  like you also at the same time therefore I just need to assume as a principle of reasoning that
*  my reasoning is relatively reliable in other words okay then the final issue that we have to get
*  off the table here if this is the principles we're adopting this sort of fully non-indexical
*  conditioning reasoning that we are typical only within the set of people exactly like ourselves
*  then how do we do the anthropic principle how do we make predictions about things like the cosmological
*  constant etc so I claim that in fact if you think about it carefully the usual anthropic reasoning
*  goes through as long as you don't make the mistake which I think is just a logical mistake of using
*  the fact you already know the cosmological constant so if you think that we already know
*  the value of the cosmological constant you're not really predicting its value you have to sort of
*  temporarily pretend that we don't know and then you imagine asking yourself the question what
*  would I predict in different cosmological scenarios okay and the point is that for better or for worse
*  this idea that you have the probability of you existing be how you interpret the probability
*  of the data given the theory roughly speaking the probability of you existing is going to be
*  proportional to the number of observers right because if we rule out these eternal infinitely
*  fluctuating universes then the more observers we have in a universe that is doing all sorts of
*  things the more likely it is to land on exactly an observer like you so roughly this will sort
*  of saturate right if you get to enough observers that there's probably more than one observer
*  like you then you stop giving an extra bonus to large universes but if you're comparing a universe
*  where the probability of you is 10 to the minus 10 to the universe where the probability view is
*  10 to the minus 1 you would give a bonus to the probability being 10 to the minus 1 of an observer
*  like you and I think that's okay actually right I don't think it's a mistake to favor universes
*  that predict like observers that observers like me probably will exist and if you take that attitude
*  then if you then imagine that you apply this problem to a set of different sub universes within
*  the cosmological multiverse and those sub universes have different values of the cosmological constant
*  then you're basically doing exactly what Steven Weinberg did back in 1988 he in fact literally
*  used the number of observers who would measure the cosmological constant as a proxy for the prior
*  for the probability of being a measuring that value and then he used the number of galaxies as
*  a proxy for the number of observers so I think in other words that adopting this strategy of
*  saying the only thing that we're typical within the only set of observers within which we are
*  typical is the set of observers just like me still gives the same anthropic predictions as the typical
*  street cosmologist would get remember that I started the whole discussion by saying that
*  physicists were very happy to get the right answer using the wrong reasoning and I think that in many
*  cases in the anthropic scenario and the anthropic principle applied to cosmology that's exactly what
*  is going on I think they are getting the right answer but for the wrong reasons okay final thing
*  final issue is the other kind of presumptuousness so I mentioned the presumptuousness of the doomsday
*  argument etc and said that assuming that I am typical only within people like me eliminates
*  that presumptuousness it gets us out of that problem remember the other kinds of presumptuousness was
*  somehow giving too much of a bonus to big universes that's what Bostrom complained about
*  in the observer first approach and I think that this approach is actually closer to the observer
*  first approach by by it does give an extra little bump to universes with lots of people in them
*  because the probability of getting me is larger not because I'm sort of a priori favoring universes
*  with lots of people but I'm favoring universes that predict me and I think that I think that's okay I
*  don't think that's presumptuous at all it does kind of match nicely with the thirder position in
*  the sleeping beauty problem right so maybe at the end of the day it's all consistent so naively the
*  probability of you in a large universe is much much larger than the probability of you in a small
*  universe therefore you should allow yourself to conclude that if you have competing cosmological
*  scenarios which are similar physically similar so they have similar priors that we want to give them
*  but differ in the number of observers you should favor the scenario with more observers in it and
*  I think in in Radford Neal's paper he kind of fudges about this a little bit he doesn't quite
*  bite the bullet and say that that's true I think maybe it is this is my tentative place that I'm
*  landing on that it is okay to favor universes with lots of observers and therefore have a larger
*  probability of predicting me if you're considering a bunch of universes with effectively an infinite
*  number of observers it doesn't matter so this is where to me it's a difference between fully
*  non-indexical ah fully non-indexical conditioning and the more traditional self-indication
*  assumption aka the observer first approach because in that approach you would really give a boost
*  depending on how many observers there were full stop here in this approach you're just giving a
*  boost depending on the probability of you coming into existence right so the point is that if the
*  probability of that happening is low then it will be roughly proportional to the number of observers
*  you know you basically have a chance that each observer is just like you so the more observers
*  you have the more the probability is that you'll get you but once the number of observers becomes
*  so large that people like you are almost inevitable I don't give an extra boost to creating a billion
*  versions of you versus creating one version of you in either case the probability of the theory
*  predicting the existence of you is of order one okay so the the boost to large universes saturates
*  at some value in this way of doing things is it the right way of doing things I do not know I
*  need to think about this I've been thinking about this um I it is my tentative conclusion my
*  tentative way of thinking I'm pretty happy with it but um look this is hard this is what I started
*  saying you know I can't do an experiment that easily answers these questions um we need to
*  think as carefully as possible and be as honest and rigorous as possible about our reasoning that
*  gets us there and you know one way I started with saying different strengths and weaknesses of
*  philosophers versus physicists another way of characterizing the difference is just patience
*  physicists are much less patient than philosophers physicists want to get to the answer they want to
*  get there expeditiously and philosophers are much more patient about thinking like what does every
*  term mean in this sentence and whatever and look that's not an unalloyed good thing right you can
*  get bogged down in arguing over details of terminology and whatever and therefore not
*  get to the answer so again I reiterate that the approach favored by physicists and the approach
*  favored by philosophers both have their places here is a place where the questions we're asking
*  are clearly physics questions but the methodologies would benefit from careful philosophical analysis
*  that's what I like doing that's fun I now have a job that lets me do that um as I'm recording this
*  I'm not there yet but I'm packing things into boxes so soon it will all be very official I'm very
*  excited about it uh this is just one little example of the kinds of things that are interesting to
*  think about at this interface between physics and philosophy or science and philosophy more general
*  more generally I'm thinking very excitedly about uh still about quantum mechanics space time
*  space time the emergence of space time the emergence of other things the emergence of
*  causality the emergence of consciousness or societies or economics or complexity you know
*  there's many many sets of questions that just don't fit easily into disciplinary boxes and now
*  I am uh empowered to spend my time thinking about those things I can't wait thanks for hanging in
*  there with me see you next week bye
*  you
