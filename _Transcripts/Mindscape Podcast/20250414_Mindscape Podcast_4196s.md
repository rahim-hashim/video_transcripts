Blog post with audio player, show notes, and transcript: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2025/04/14/311-annaka-harris-on-whether-consciousness-is-fundamental/

Questions about consciousness range from the precise and empirical -- what neurons fire when I have some particular experience -- to the deeply profound -- does consciousness emerge from matter, or does matter emerge from consciousness? While it might be straightforward to think that consciousness arises from the collective behavior of atoms in the brain, Annaka Harris and others argue that consciousness could be the fundamental stuff from which matter arises. She talks with a variety of experts in her new audio series, Lights On: How Understanding Consciousness Helps Us Understand the Universe.

Annaka Harris received a BFA from New York University. She is the author of Consciousness: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind. She is a co-founder of Project Reason.

# Mindscape 311 | Annaka Harris on Whether Consciousness Is Fundamental
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll special treat for mindscape listeners today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=0.0s)]
*  We're gonna finally figure out this consciousness thing once and for all [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=6.36s)]
*  No, we're not actually sorry about that. That was false advertising. We're gonna talk about consciousness yet again [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=11.42s)]
*  It's not something that we're gonna ever in the course of a one hour long conversation quite [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=17.46s)]
*  Agree that people who have different opinions about this are gonna see the light [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  But we're gonna come closer and closer with every episode. That's all I can actually promise, you know, it wasn't that long ago [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=27.64s)]
*  We had Christophe Koch famous neuroscientist on the show and we talked a lot about consciousness in particular [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=33.96s)]
*  the neural [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  Carlots of consciousness and integrated information theory we touched on the idea of panpsychism [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=42.36s)]
*  Which we've talked about before on the podcast the idea that consciousness is everywhere [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=48.8s)]
*  But we didn't really give it a full airing out [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=54.800000000000004s)]
*  So I wanted to kind of give that idea maybe not panpsychism per se but the idea that consciousness is a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=56.88s)]
*  fundamental ingredient of reality rather than just an emergent level [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=64.88s)]
*  Something that we use to describe the collective behavior of matter when it becomes sufficiently [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=71.44s)]
*  Complex and self-referential and so forth rather than that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=76.76s)]
*  What if consciousness is the starting point for thinking about the fundamental nature of reality [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=80.5s)]
*  I'm very very honest that I don't think that that is the right idea [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  But I do think that it's useful to think about that kind of idea and I wanted to sort of give it a fair hearing [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=91.18s)]
*  So today's guest Anika Harris is the author of New York Times bestseller [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=96.58s)]
*  Conscious a brief guide to the fundamental mystery of mind and more recently she's done, you know in this sort of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=102.94s)]
*  Exploratory fashion she came up with an audio series aka a podcast called lights on how understanding [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  Consciousness helps us understand the universe where she talks to a bunch of people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=117.3s)]
*  I'm included actually there's a bunch of people who are former mindscape guests who are included and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=121.14s)]
*  She gets a lot of different opinions from physicists from neuroscientists from psychologists [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  About what consciousness really is and she talks about how she has made the journey [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=133.18s)]
*  From someone who was closer to my own point of view about these things with consciousness being emergent to someone who is very sympathetic [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=138.9s)]
*  to the idea of consciousness being fundamental and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=145.94s)]
*  We talk about why anyone would believe such a thing and what is the benefit of doing it? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=149.66s)]
*  What is the motivation for doing it from both thought experiments and real experiments and things like that? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=154.74s)]
*  So we had fun with it in the sense that we knew we weren't going to convince each other either way [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=160.02s)]
*  But that's okay. We can still talk about it [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=164.94s)]
*  We can discuss the ideas. That's what we're all about here. So as usual, I want you to listen [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=167.28s)]
*  And decide for yourself what it is that you think which perspective you think is the most convincing the way forward [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=173.68s)]
*  Never ever putting a credence of a hundred percent or zero percent on anything, but keeping an open mind and with that, let's go [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=180.36s)]
*  Oh [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=197.28s)]
*  Anika Harris, welcome to the mindscape podcast. Thank you so much for having me. I'm I'm honored truly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=205.2s)]
*  Well, especially thank you because you know that you're you know walking into enemy territory here, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=210.6s)]
*  We've talked about these things before we come out of opposite sides, but I really [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=219.24s)]
*  Appreciate [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=223.7s)]
*  Your new series and how you try to talk to a whole bunch of different people with different points of view [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=224.9s)]
*  So why don't you just before we forget mention the series and then what caused you to think of this particular media? Yeah [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=231.7s)]
*  So it's called lights on how understanding consciousness helps us understand the universe [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=239.42s)]
*  And you know, I didn't even know what I was making when I started out creating this project. I had finished [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=245.38s)]
*  Publishing and promoting my book called conscious that came out in 2019 [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=253.54s)]
*  And I just realized that I was left with so many questions and I wasn't quite ready to move on to a new topic yet [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=258.58s)]
*  and actually a film producer friend of mine came to me with this idea loose idea for a film and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=266.66s)]
*  I suddenly it's like all I needed was permission to start [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=273.1s)]
*  Recording the interviews. I wanted to record I had no [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=277.82s)]
*  Faith really that a movie would ever get made [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=281.22s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that world but I know it takes forever to do those things [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  But I thought oh he just gave me my dream project, which is talk to all the scientists and philosophers [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=287.18s)]
*  I want to talk to you ask all these questions keep thinking about [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=293.38000000000005s)]
*  You know these things that I can't stop thinking about and the idea was to record the conversations and then use the transcripts as [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=298.1s)]
*  Templates for dialogue for for this, you know potential film and [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  What he realized when I was a few weeks into this process was that we would have all this audio and it's much easier to make [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=311.90000000000003s)]
*  a podcast [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=318.54s)]
*  than a film [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=319.54s)]
*  So, you know, maybe we'll make the film down the line [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=321.26000000000005s)]
*  But I'm creating a podcast and so then it became clear that I was kind of on this journey and I was narrating my own [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  story of my process of thinking and my evolving thoughts [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=329.94000000000005s)]
*  And so I realized it was more like a documentary of kind of my story of trying to understand these concepts [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=334.34s)]
*  And so we were calling it a podcast documentary [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=341.38s)]
*  but then lo and behold McMillan the publisher from my publishing world that I [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=343.9s)]
*  That I'm so comfortable in and understand we're interested in in doing this as an audiobook [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=350.62s)]
*  So yeah, I mean the format doesn't really matter. It couldn't [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=356.78s)]
*  It could have really been called any anything [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=359.78000000000003s)]
*  Or it could have been called, you know a lot of different things [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=362.42s)]
*  But I knew I was making an audio documentary and so yeah the the content didn't change over time [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=364.38000000000005s)]
*  But the format that we put it into well [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  it's interesting because people have different ways of communicating their ideas and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=373.1s)]
*  There are books there's writing where we're very careful. I just got an interesting question my own AMA [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=377.58000000000004s)]
*  the other day about why does your [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=384.94000000000005s)]
*  Voice or at least your way of talking sound different in the AMA is than when you're reading your own audiobooks [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=387.82s)]
*  Interesting and of course, I attributed to the writing being different, right? Yeah, but I think this is you know [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=395.26s)]
*  This is one of the nice thing about podcasts, you know my form of interview podcast [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=401.7s)]
*  But also you have a much more polished production here, but you're getting people's viewpoints [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=405.58s)]
*  You know a little bit more viscerally right a little bit closer to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=411.7s)]
*  Yes, that's right. Yeah, and actually, you know, it's funny because I'm much more comfortable writing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=414.9s)]
*  I'm a nervous wreck right now because I don't trust myself to communicate my ideas [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=420.65999999999997s)]
*  Well in the moment [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=426.85999999999996s)]
*  Through speech, you know, I end up doing an okay enough job of it, but I'm really comfortable writing [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=429.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  and so but I wanted to have these conversations and I was recording them and so I [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=435.46s)]
*  Ended up being able to write the narration which kind of explains [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=440.3s)]
*  You know more in book form [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=445.46000000000004s)]
*  Where you know what what thoughts I was having what questions I was having where the answers were leading me [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=448.14000000000004s)]
*  And then use this audio that yes, it does. It's interesting because there were times when we needed to rerecord things [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=453.62s)]
*  And I really had a hard time [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=460.3s)]
*  Rerecording something that had happened in real time [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=462.78000000000003s)]
*  Because [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=465.52s)]
*  It's not my reading voice and yeah, it is different [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=466.68s)]
*  And did you find through the course of talking to various people with different attitudes? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=470.44s)]
*  Like do you think that are we making progress on this whole consciousness thing? Do you do? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=475.12s)]
*  I would say I would say yes [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=481.64s)]
*  I think so, you know [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=483.64s)]
*  I think there's a lot more progress to be made and I think it's one of those topics that is really hard to say [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=485.71999999999997s)]
*  Whether we can ever make the kind of progress we want to make [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=490.98s)]
*  But I mean there's progress just in the sense that when I started writing my book conscious [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=494.59999999999997s)]
*  I was afraid to share my questions with other scientists. That's where we were [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=498.92s)]
*  so we're definitely at a place now where [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=506.44s)]
*  many scientists are [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=509.96s)]
*  Open to having this conversation [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=511.64s)]
*  Realize that even if it doesn't seem as mysterious to them as it does to some other philosophers that there really is [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=513.56s)]
*  There really is something here that we haven't explained that that would be nice to explain [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  and [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=526.84s)]
*  Yeah, and I would say you know, and it's true for myself [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  So I've been in the sciences for over 20 years now. I did not start out with the view that I have now it really [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  Transformed a lot over the last 20 years and more [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=538.4s)]
*  And I'm now meeting other scientists Brian Green was one a total surprise actually [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=542.12s)]
*  Who you know, I think he he basically feels the same way you do about it, but [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=547.24s)]
*  He's able to appreciate the mysterious nature of consciousness in a way that he wasn't earlier in his career [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=552.44s)]
*  and so I think [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=559.24s)]
*  That that is huge progress just those of us who wouldn't have even considered it [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=560.6s)]
*  Really something interesting to think about or ask about [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=566.6s)]
*  Noticing that there's science has some work to do here [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=571.12s)]
*  Yes [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=574.88s)]
*  And it's an interesting problem that's different from every other scientific problem we have faced [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=576.08s)]
*  So what is your favorite definition of consciousness? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=581.84s)]
*  Yeah, I was actually I was thinking about this with you because I was going over some of the I was gonna say arguments [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=585.2s)]
*  But they're they're fun always our debates [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=591.16s)]
*  And I realized that we might be defining it differently and that may might be part of where we have [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=595.24s)]
*  Diverged in the past and so yeah [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=603.32s)]
*  so when I talk about consciousness and and the truth is you know, we could even change the terminology because the way some people use [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=606.2800000000001s)]
*  Consciousness is not the way I'm using it. So most people when they use the word consciousness, they're thinking about [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=613.08s)]
*  Complex thought complex life self-awareness often an ability to self-reflect [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=620.5200000000001s)]
*  I think part of that may be I well we'll get into it [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=626.2800000000001s)]
*  Was thinking about some of our conversations and wondering if when you were saying consciousness you were pointing more to those features [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=629.8s)]
*  And the thing that I think is really mysterious and that most of the time when I'm talking about consciousness, I'm using this other [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=636.28s)]
*  Definition or more basic definition, which is just the fact of felt experience [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=645.04s)]
*  So it could be something that is not self aware that is not a complex thought it could be and if we imagine I often give [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=650.68s)]
*  Worms or snails or some type of simple insect as an example, you know [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=657.78s)]
*  If there is consciousness there this neuroscientists are kind of split on this [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=661.2199999999999s)]
*  But if a bee is conscious or a fly is conscious, you know, they have a brain and a central nervous system [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=665.42s)]
*  I would not imagine that a that a fly is self aware [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=669.42s)]
*  Or has thoughts or language [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=672.9399999999999s)]
*  But could maybe you know [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=675.6999999999999s)]
*  Even I think simpler than than a fly would be something like a worm where maybe you know [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=677.02s)]
*  If I had to guess what the conscious experience is, it would be a pressure [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=681.6999999999999s)]
*  Maybe of temperature change [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=685.14s)]
*  Maybe even of something more complex like like hunger or fear, you know [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=688.38s)]
*  Depending on the circumstance if it needs to you know, look for food or get away from something that could cause it harm [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=692.8199999999999s)]
*  But yeah, so so so my definition and the thing I'm interested in whatever we call it [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=699.42s)]
*  It's really just the fact of felt experience. Why is it that some systems in nature? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=703.4599999999999s)]
*  Feel like something from the inside kind of have this perspective [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=708.5s)]
*  Where the feeling itself cannot be directly observed apart from [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=713.46s)]
*  The feeling itself. So I think I would have said if you just give me that definition [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=719.9000000000001s)]
*  I would have said yeah, I understand at least you know, we can debate over what's the best definition [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=724.7800000000001s)]
*  But I think I understand what you mean. Yeah, but somewhere in there you're drawing a distinction between that and awareness [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=728.86s)]
*  Like how can I be the worm feeling pressure or fear without being aware of it? Yeah [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=735.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, I guess it I mean awareness is a tricky term also [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=740.78s)]
*  So you can mean different things by being aware you could you know, I tend to use it [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=744.5799999999999s)]
*  Synonymous with consciousness. I when I say awareness, I'm usually meaning a felt experience of awareness [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=750.02s)]
*  So I could talk about my computer being aware of the audio input and the visual input and you know [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=757.3s)]
*  Whatever processing is taking place, but I'm not imagining that there's a conscious experience associated with it [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=763.9399999999999s)]
*  With that processing in the computer. So awareness, you know could be talked about in non-conscious processing where you know, it's just a [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=768.98s)]
*  Combining of information or a form of digital memory or something like that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=777.38s)]
*  I feel like now I'm not answering your question. You were saying how could you how could a worm be conscious without being aware? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=782.1s)]
*  Yeah, well, it sounded like you were trying to [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=787.94s)]
*  Put awareness at like a slightly higher level of complexity or sophistication than mere [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=791.14s)]
*  Self I may have said self-awareness. Okay, so being aware of oneself [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=796.1s)]
*  Which is usually how people think about consciousness, you know consciousness happens in very, you know complex life forms like human beings [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=799.78s)]
*  There's even this test that we do with other mammals, you know, are they aware of themselves? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=805.78s)]
*  Can they see themselves in the mirror that that sort of thing? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=810.34s)]
*  But I'm talking about something much more basic. That's very very helpful. Okay. Thanks and we do like you say we do [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=812.34s)]
*  We do a lot of things that we do in the computer [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=818.98s)]
*  Much more basic that's very very helpful. Okay. Thanks and we do like you say we feel it from the inside [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=821.46s)]
*  So you mentioned how science is making progress and we're gonna get to some scientific progress [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=829.98s)]
*  But is there are there whole bunches of progress to be made kind of without doing neuroscience, you know, can we? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=834.34s)]
*  I mean, I think I think it really as far as my imagination can go it has to be informed by neuroscience [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=842.58s)]
*  But no, I think if we are led to believe that [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=849.14s)]
*  Consciousness felt experience if it goes much deeper in nature than even insects and worms [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=853.86s)]
*  If or to plants or even, you know deeper than that [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=860.02s)]
*  We start crossing over into other realms of science and it's why I talked to so many physicists for for my audio documentary [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=863.9399999999999s)]
*  Because I wanted to know where this might be headed if we actually start to think it makes sense [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=871.1s)]
*  to assume that consciousness goes kind of beyond what we categorize as life and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=877.7s)]
*  What would that mean for physics and then how would what would this have to say about that? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=883.7800000000001s)]
*  And is there any way in which this can actually affect the physics we do or are we kind of just always? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=887.72s)]
*  Going to be limited by [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=893.98s)]
*  Observation and experiment the way we traditionally have but I do I try to let my imagination go wild in the very last [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=896.74s)]
*  Chapter of my documentary and it's called the future of science [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=903.6600000000001s)]
*  And I suggest some ways this this might go if we're convinced again that [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=907.34s)]
*  That it's rational to [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=914.34s)]
*  Well, let me let me take one step back because I think kind of where my starting point is [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=917.3000000000001s)]
*  Is realizing with working with neuroscientists over the course of about 20 years [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=923.6600000000001s)]
*  Realizing that we have actually [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=931.26s)]
*  Assumed that consciousness arises [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=934.22s)]
*  In complex life forms and that we don't have as good evidence for that as we think we do and kind of pulling apart [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=937.82s)]
*  Those intuitions that lead us to assume that now as I've said I also made those assumptions. I still think it may be correct [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=945.7s)]
*  But we're not really on as solid ground as I thought we were in [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=953.98s)]
*  Making that assumption and that I realized we kind of are forced because we don't know our starting point [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=959.8199999999999s)]
*  We're really forced to either assume that it arises at some point it emerges at some point in nature [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=965.66s)]
*  Or it's it's fundamental to nature [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=973.58s)]
*  It's either in all systems or or some because we know the answer isn't none, right? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=975.78s)]
*  And so we have we have evidence of at least our own conscious experiences [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=981.26s)]
*  And so the more convinced I became that we [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=985.54s)]
*  Could be very wrong in this starting assumption. We've used so far that it arises out of complexity [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=990.18s)]
*  What would happen if we you know, we're still we could say we don't know we don't have to believe that it's fundamental [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=996.66s)]
*  But what if we just assumed how how would that shape? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1002.9s)]
*  The phenomena we observe the phenomenon we observe [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1006.62s)]
*  How would that shape science going forward and so I just kind of let my [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1010.4599999999999s)]
*  Imagination run wild and then started to come up with new questions for neuroscience and neuroscientists and physicists [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1015.5s)]
*  Which is you know, what what my documentary is about? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1022.6199999999999s)]
*  but so it kind of became this question for me if consciousness is fundamental and then you know dot dot dot so [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1025.5s)]
*  How might we interpret this phenomenon in nature? Right? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1033.22s)]
*  So in this picture which you know offends me to the very core, but that's okay [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1037.5s)]
*  I will say that I was completely with you for most of my life [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1045.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's a way there's a way to see this [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1049.98s)]
*  I believe there's a way to see this that's not offensive even though it still sounds crazy to me coming out of my own mouth [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1052.34s)]
*  You're more than I am [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1057.26s)]
*  That's okay, but but I still you know, I'm very interested in understanding it [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1059.98s)]
*  So I think the interesting thing you're saying here is that if we take you know, forget about whether we should but if we take [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1063.9199999999998s)]
*  The view the consciousness is fundamental then rather it being an outgrowth of some complex information [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1070.32s)]
*  Processing system blah blah blah. It manifests itself in certain ways when the complexity is there to let that happen [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1078.0s)]
*  But it's kind of always there. Yeah. Yeah [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1084.6799999999998s)]
*  Which again, I know that sounds crazy [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1089.04s)]
*  Can't believe I'm I'm even suggesting it but the deeper you get into the neuroscience [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1092.04s)]
*  And what we've learned about the brain so far the more you realize our intuitions for that starting assumption [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1098.32s)]
*  Really break apart pretty quickly [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1105.8799999999999s)]
*  So one thing that that is, you know kind of obvious [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1108.12s)]
*  But we don't really think about and and I think is interesting in the context of all of these other [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1111.72s)]
*  intuition shattering I [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1115.84s)]
*  Think results of modern neuroscience is that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1118.1599999999999s)]
*  we are the most complex systems we know of in the universe, right and [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1123.36s)]
*  We also know that we can't tell the difference between loss of memory and lots of consciousness that we're completely [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1128.8799999999999s)]
*  dependent on this stream of memories [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1136.48s)]
*  You know to think all the thoughts we think to be human beings, right and so [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1140.24s)]
*  We have this sense that because we are conscious and we're the most complex systems we know of in the universe and [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1145.8s)]
*  You know, let's say if there's a felt experience associated with my the processing in my liver [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1153.76s)]
*  Let's say but that never enters my stream of memory [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1159.52s)]
*  I'll never be able to report on it's not part of the eye [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1163.44s)]
*  I'm referring to as I write and so we're kind of left in this situation where it makes sense that we would assume [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1166.76s)]
*  That consciousness is part of this [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1174.6s)]
*  complex processing [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1178.8s)]
*  But the truth is we have it's the only thing we have access to and the only thing we can [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1180.28s)]
*  Communicate to other systems like us about we have no way of getting information from a system [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1187.52s)]
*  That is too different from us because the communication completely breaks down and so there's no there's no way to report [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1193.0s)]
*  This is even true in a single brain which I was one of the pieces of neuroscience that I found most interesting and most [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1199.68s)]
*  Intuition shattering was the split brain research and so you can even have a circumstance [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1206.4s)]
*  I don't know how familiar you are with with this research. The audience is not okay. Okay [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1211.16s)]
*  So do you want me to kind of explain from the beginning? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1216.02s)]
*  Yeah [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1219.0800000000002s)]
*  because this this to me is where my [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1219.28s)]
*  Intuitions started to really break down and I started having interesting thoughts about where where else in nature we might find consciousness [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1221.96s)]
*  So split brain patients [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1229.48s)]
*  It's less used now. I don't think there are very many of them now [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1231.48s)]
*  But a few decades ago, it was a wonderful actually treatment for epilepsy [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1236.76s)]
*  So for people who were experiencing [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1242.28s)]
*  Grandmouth seizure seizures that would [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1245.04s)]
*  Sorry would spread from one hemisphere of the brain to the other and if they can be contained if the seizure can be contained to one [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1248.9199999999998s)]
*  Hemisphere, it's much less dangerous much less life-threatening and so they developed this procedure [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  By which they would actually disconnect the left and right hemispheres. They would they would sever the corpus callosum the [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1262.5600000000002s)]
*  the the center where the the information between the left and right hemispheres [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1270.3600000000001s)]
*  Is shared and what they discovered? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1275.72s)]
*  Through a series of experiments and I can describe one or two if you'd like, but what they discovered was that [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1278.92s)]
*  It seems as if when those connections are completely severed [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1285.0s)]
*  There are now two islands of consciousness two kind of centers of processing [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1289.84s)]
*  That seem to feel like a self and so there's kind of it's almost like the person is split into [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1295.04s)]
*  Conjoined twins or something where the left hemisphere is one person and the right hemisphere is another [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1301.32s)]
*  What's interesting is that in most people the left hemisphere is where the language center is where this where is is responsible for speech [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1305.56s)]
*  And so it's interesting these patients after the surgery seem actually to be very normal [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1314.04s)]
*  It's why it was so successful and such a wonderful [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1320.28s)]
*  Tool for people who who were being threatened by by these seizures [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1323.36s)]
*  When you talk to the person they can speak normally they can have a conversation with you [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1330.04s)]
*  They can tell you how they feel what they want for lunch [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1334.52s)]
*  What's interesting is when they figured out they were able to actually interrogate the red right hemisphere by other means [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1337.52s)]
*  Using cue cards having the person point with their left hand because the left hand is controlled by the right hemisphere [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1345.36s)]
*  They discovered that the right hemisphere had different answers different opinions different tastes than the right hemisphere [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1351.8s)]
*  now we can't know for sure whether there was consciousness associated with that, but [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1358.04s)]
*  The truth is in the same way that I can't know whether there's conscious experience associated with you [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1362.64s)]
*  You know, I mean I assume there are enough arrows pointing in the right direction for me to assume that's the case [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1368.16s)]
*  And so even in a single human [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1374.42s)]
*  body and brain you can have a circumstance where [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1377.5600000000002s)]
*  You're talking to someone they're telling you. Oh, yes. I feel that no, I don't feel that. Yes. I saw that I did not see that [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1382.98s)]
*  I want granola for breakfast and all the rest and there's actually [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1389.6s)]
*  Another part of that body of that brain that is seeing things the left hemisphere isn't seeing that is, you know [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1394.08s)]
*  Having thoughts having opinions all of that [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1401.3999999999999s)]
*  But never can get communicated to the outside world except through these experiments. They were able to figure out ways to interrogate [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1404.1599999999999s)]
*  But again if we wanted to understand if you know, there's any felt experience at all associated with the Venus flytrap [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1411.12s)]
*  We have yet to [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1418.64s)]
*  Find ways to communicate anything sufficient to even you know [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1421.0s)]
*  Be able to guess whether something like that is conscious and so so there was something I've been rambling you go ahead [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1426.1200000000001s)]
*  There's a tribe of human beings that only ever heard music come out of stereo speakers [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1432.2s)]
*  They might naturally think that music was a feature of stereo speakers. Not that it was just [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1437.1200000000001s)]
*  Medium by which it was being communicated [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1444.0800000000002s)]
*  Sure sure. Yeah, I never thought about that and okay. So I mean I'd have to think about that more [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1446.08s)]
*  It's probably not such a direct analogy [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1451.56s)]
*  But but yes, it's it's you know consciousness is something different from everything else that we study in science [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1454.1599999999999s)]
*  You know as I said because it can only be known from the experience itself. So we're completely reliant on [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1460.3999999999999s)]
*  Report a bit an ability to report but then also an ability to communicate [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1468.08s)]
*  And the split-brain patients, yeah didn't even themselves know that there was another conscious [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1473.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean they became aware of it when they were part of these studies and they could see that [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1481.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they could see that their you know, left hand was answering questions correctly [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1486.64s)]
*  Yeah, but no in terms of their conscious awareness [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1492.4s)]
*  It does not enter that hemisphere of the brain [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1495.68s)]
*  And so it's just not part of that stream of memory and so for them, you know if you ask them [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1498.72s)]
*  Are you conscious of you know, I just flashed a picture of a card. Are you conscious of it? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1504.16s)]
*  They would say I didn't see any any any card. There's no there's no picture at all yet [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1509.2s)]
*  There is another part of their brain that what that did see it [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1513.6000000000001s)]
*  And so it's tricky when we try to interrogate even different systems in the body [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1517.6000000000001s)]
*  You know when when we say, you know or when we undergo anesthesia when we're in a coma [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1522.8000000000002s)]
*  When we undergo anesthesia when we go to sleep, you know, I'll say I wasn't conscious [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1527.28s)]
*  Um, but was their consciousness present that just didn't enter my stream of memory that enables me [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1531.68s)]
*  Me, you know the the eye I call me to report on it [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1538.08s)]
*  Okay, so that was the big that was the beginning of my starting to wonder if our intuitions about what consciousness is and where we'd find it [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1542.24s)]
*  Or maybe throwing us off right? Good. Yeah, that's very helpful in me helping me make those connections there [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1549.44s)]
*  So because ordinarily we would [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1555.6000000000001s)]
*  Use people who were under an anesthetic a general anesthetic as an example of [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1558.56s)]
*  Not being conscious. Yes, and you're saying well, how do you know? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1565.04s)]
*  Right. This is the problem with consciousness is we just can't really [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  ever know I mean we can we can make [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1573.44s)]
*  Better and worse guesses. I think but even with anesthesia, you know [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1576.0s)]
*  There's this fascinating phenomenon that I talk about in my book and in my audio documentary [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1579.6000000000001s)]
*  um something called anesthesia awareness where the um [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1584.42s)]
*  Uh the paralyzing drugs take effect, but the drugs that are meant to make the person unconscious [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1590.26s)]
*  Um do not and so the the person is completely paralyzed. They have no way to communicate that they're fully conscious [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1597.06s)]
*  This is you know, my worst everyone's worst nightmare [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1603.06s)]
*  Many people come out of this situation [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1606.3400000000001s)]
*  with severe ptsd for understandable reasons [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1608.66s)]
*  Um because they then experience the operation or you know, whatever they've they've been given anesthesia for they have the full [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1611.7800000000002s)]
*  experience um [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1619.0400000000002s)]
*  The pain the sights the sound well, if usually their eyes would not be open [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1621.38s)]
*  But yes, they're just as as awake as you or I are right now [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1625.46s)]
*  But completely paralyzed and unable to communicate and so, you know, that's another good example [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1630.42s)]
*  There are also examples of something called locked in patients [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1635.38s)]
*  Um where they have certain brain damage the same [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1638.66s)]
*  um [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1642.02s)]
*  Same situation they're in where they are completely paralyzed. There's no way for them to report [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1643.0600000000002s)]
*  On these conscious things they have the communication skills, but they're not able to report [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1648.5s)]
*  and so it's this combination of communication and report that we really rely on and [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1652.5800000000002s)]
*  noticing [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1658.64s)]
*  Becoming like coming face to face with these circumstances where there's a human mind that I can relate to that is just like me [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1660.42s)]
*  But on the outside, you know, there's zero behavior if there's any behavior, you know, we could put them in an fmri machine [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1668.02s)]
*  We could see [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1674.1s)]
*  You know electricity essentially and which reminded me of [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1675.3s)]
*  Plant biology and you know, I do not have an intuition that the plants are conscious [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1680.1s)]
*  It does actually sound crazy to me, but I had to [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1684.82s)]
*  Let myself challenge my intuitions and say, okay [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1688.26s)]
*  um, you know essentially [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1692.1s)]
*  What's happening [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1694.5s)]
*  In the brain is similar to what's happening in a plant and it is the transfer of information [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1696.1s)]
*  through electrical signals and is it [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1702.02s)]
*  Possible that consciousness the felt experience is associated with that rather than the more the more complex [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1705.06s)]
*  So where did you come down? Where do you currently come down with the plant question? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1711.4599999999998s)]
*  Provocative one, obviously [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1715.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, I will I will just say I don't know about all of it. Honestly, I am continuing to [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1717.1399999999999s)]
*  um [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1724.1s)]
*  Ask these questions and investigate. I am open to [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1725.2199999999998s)]
*  everything [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1730.02s)]
*  Every system being conscious all the way down to the most fundamental and so that's kind of [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1731.4599999999998s)]
*  Where I let myself go in this documentary until the last two chapters where I just [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1736.5s)]
*  Really go with it and say okay if consciousness truly goes all the way down [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1741.3799999999999s)]
*  What does this mean for the future of science and how might we be able to get? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1745.3s)]
*  Yeah more clarity on this we've gotten this far in the podcast without using the p-word panpsychism, but that is that is [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1749.94s)]
*  That's where I never use it anymore [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1755.86s)]
*  People have been I never use it anymore because I don't like it and I don't think it's useful [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1758.58s)]
*  I see. Okay. Actually, I don't even know if you remember it [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1763.54s)]
*  But it's probably something that didn't catch your eye [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1766.34s)]
*  but other philop but philosophers in the room caught it which was [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1768.4199999999998s)]
*  Um at that conference that you and I attended together [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1771.94s)]
*  I gave a talk and one of the slides was actually panpsychism with the word crossed out [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1774.4199999999998s)]
*  You know was like a panpsychism circle sign with it. Right. Okay. Good to know I try I tried to convince them [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1778.74s)]
*  I'm sure I didn't convince a single person but that it's not so it's not such a useful [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1784.26s)]
*  framework [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1788.48s)]
*  Um for thinking about these things, but I mean I guess we'll get to talk about it [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1789.38s)]
*  We'll get to there later, but you do [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1794.34s)]
*  So panpsychism literally means consciousness is everywhere or mind is everywhere. I suppose [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1797.3s)]
*  Yes, and that does sound pretty close to what you were it does. Okay, and i'm not i'm not really opposed to it. It's the word [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1802.42s)]
*  Yeah, and the truth is, you know, I think idealism panpsychism, you know technically [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1808.6599999999999s)]
*  my view [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1815.06s)]
*  Certainly has crossover if not, you know falls into [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1817.1399999999999s)]
*  Part of my issue with these frameworks as they were developed so long ago before we understood anything about how the universe works [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1821.62s)]
*  um, and so [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1830.26s)]
*  The types of conclusions they tend to draw just don't sound [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1832.34s)]
*  Realistic and scientific to me and i'm i'm very much a science-minded person and I would like this topic to stay [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  Within the sciences and I'd like you know [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1843.3s)]
*  If if it's possible that consciousness goes deeper in nature [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1845.86s)]
*  I would like to have our best tools and our best minds, you know trying to under I think this will affect the future [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1849.3s)]
*  Of science and so it's something [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1855.06s)]
*  We need to keep in that realm. So yeah, so some of the conclusions that are drawn in those domains [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1857.6999999999998s)]
*  Sound too new agey to me. I don't I wouldn't you know make those assumptions about how the universe is structured [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1863.1399999999999s)]
*  Um, I also honestly just have an issue aesthetically with the word panpsychism because it sounds like a new age word [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1869.86s)]
*  And it's also it's a word that was developed. I think that the 16th century, you know, it's just yeah [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1876.5s)]
*  um, I I also think that if no if those views had never existed if no one had ever had this thought before [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1881.3799999999999s)]
*  I truly believe that many people in neuroscience and physics at this point in history [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1887.46s)]
*  Would be asking this question. And so I always just try to make the case that it's a legitimate [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1893.22s)]
*  Question to ask is consciousness [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1899.3799999999999s)]
*  Um, does consciousness go deeper in nature than we've assumed and is consciousness fundamental and those can be scientific questions [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1901.86s)]
*  And I think we'd be running up against them anyway, and we clearly don't know [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1908.98s)]
*  Um, so something like panpsychism also it kind of suggests that there's already [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1913.62s)]
*  A solution figured out and I think we so clearly don't know that I wouldn't like to use an ism to explain [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1919.54s)]
*  This line of questioning. I think they're they're questions. Got it. That makes perfect sense. So the plants you're not sure about what about computers? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1926.1s)]
*  Um, yeah, could they be conscious or is there going to be some point at which they can report? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1933.22s)]
*  The consciousness that they may or may not be experiencing. I know this I mean, this is a really bizarre situation [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1939.8600000000001s)]
*  We are very likely going to be and soon, you know, however far down consciousness goes. Um, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1944.74s)]
*  We're going to be very confused when the behavior of a system matches [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1950.5800000000002s)]
*  Our behavior or the behavior of a dog or some living system that we believe is conscious and how [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1955.7s)]
*  How we will know I mean that's that's a big question mark for me [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1961.0600000000002s)]
*  I don't I don't know [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1964.5800000000002s)]
*  But the truth is I've really kind of crossed over into [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1966.02s)]
*  Believing that if consciousness goes deeper in nature, it actually makes the most sense for it to go all the way down [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1970.02s)]
*  So I have kind of you know, my my list of questions quickly became about [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1977.78s)]
*  what [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1984.34s)]
*  How do we interpret the the physics we have the science we have if consciousness actually goes all the way down is the most fundamental [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1986.26s)]
*  feature and so that's where [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1993.54s)]
*  All of my thought experiments and and kind of where i've been living and so I would ask so I ask myself this question [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=1996.98s)]
*  if consciousness is fundamental if [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2002.98s)]
*  Every matter that we perceive, you know everything that we perceive all the light and the you know [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2004.98s)]
*  everything and all the things we don't perceive if um, our perceptions are really a representation or a mapping of [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2009.78s)]
*  Essentially other conscious experiences coming in and out of existence in the universe [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2017.04s)]
*  um, my guess is that [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2021.94s)]
*  You know what the what we deem the matter to be made of matters matters and so the structure we're getting some [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2024.8200000000002s)]
*  clues about the structure of things in our perceptions of them and in our mappings of them with the tools the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2032.8200000000002s)]
*  scientific tools we have and so [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2038.3400000000001s)]
*  I think our conscious experiences are dictated by the structure of of the matter [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2042.18s)]
*  and [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2048.02s)]
*  Computers are made of a very different matter than we are and so my guess would be if consciousness is fundamental [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2049.22s)]
*  Yes, I mean that it that would mean that there are conscious experiences. However minimal [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2055.2999999999997s)]
*  Coming into and out of being you know all around this room throughout my body, you know [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2060.8199999999997s)]
*  In my clothing though all it's all you know at bottom what we're describing is conscious experiences [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2065.7s)]
*  Um, and so yes, that means that computers and ai and more complex systems [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2071.7s)]
*  Would also entail conscious experiences the question is [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2077.24s)]
*  You know how similar to our own would they be and my guess is they'd be so different [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2081.72s)]
*  They would be unrecognizable to us. And so the weird so the thing that kind of disturbs me most about ai [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2087.48s)]
*  when I think about consciousness being fundamental is that [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2094.2799999999997s)]
*  We will be building these systems that the behavior of which [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2098.44s)]
*  We usually take to be evidence of our own conscious experiences when I talk to you about green [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2102.6s)]
*  And about the sound of a symphony and about my thoughts [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2108.52s)]
*  I can you know, I think it's it's [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2112.12s)]
*  See, it's a safe guess that you are mapping that onto a very similar conscious experience on on your side [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2114.52s)]
*  And so we've learned and our intuitions have evolved to map those things. But if we create [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2121.24s)]
*  Systems that actually feel very very different on the inside but behave the same way we do [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2127.96s)]
*  I mean we will just have no intuitions for navigating this situation that we're in. I mean I [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2134.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2140.36s)]
*  No, I think that does follow. I mean the question about whether a computer is conscious [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2141.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's very different if you think that an abacus is conscious or a stick is conscious. It really yeah [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2146.28s)]
*  Well, and I think it's not quite right to think of those things as single things the way we think of a human mind [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2151.7999999999997s)]
*  As a single thing, right? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2157.7999999999997s)]
*  um, you know there there are reasons that we can kind of talk about a human mind and a brain as a system [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2159.56s)]
*  That you know experiences things although [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2166.52s)]
*  You know ultimately I think that's not quite the right way to think about it [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2169.48s)]
*  But you know an abacus we we notice that as a single [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
*  Object but in reality if you know if consciousness is fundamental [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2176.6800000000003s)]
*  You know and even so an abacus itself is really [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2182.12s)]
*  Not an integrated system the way that a brain is an integrated system. And so I wouldn't expect the abacus [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2185.7200000000003s)]
*  To have an experience but I would expect there to be [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2191.56s)]
*  You know countless thousands millions of experiences coming into and out of being [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2195.0s)]
*  In the the point in space and time that that abacus inhabits, you know [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2200.36s)]
*  So I want to ask about some of the implications of the idea that consciousness is fundamental [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2205.0800000000004s)]
*  but first let me make sure that you you have said what you want to say about the [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2209.32s)]
*  Motivation for thinking that the split brains is definitely a part of it [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2214.34s)]
*  But you know, what is your best argument for thinking that consciousness is fundamental? Yeah [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2218.28s)]
*  Well, I take 11 hours to make that argument in my documentary series [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2223.96s)]
*  But i'll try to give a briefer one. I actually that that reminds me of a couple of um, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2228.92s)]
*  Neuroscientific discoveries and actually one just anecdotal story [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2233.6200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2238.1200000000003s)]
*  That were part of the reason [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2239.7200000000003s)]
*  I felt it was really important to question our intuitions about what consciousness is [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2243.56s)]
*  And so I would say I haven't become convinced that consciousness is fundamental what i've been [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2247.6400000000003s)]
*  Definitely convinced of is that our intuitions about what consciousness is [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2253.4s)]
*  What causal function it serves in the universe those intuitions come out of illusions and we're relying on [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2259.64s)]
*  Things that we actually in modern neuroscience understand to be illusions already [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2268.04s)]
*  and those have not quite been integrated in not only into the culture but into [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2273.32s)]
*  The philosophy of the scientists doing this work. It's very hard for us to integrate the things we have discovered about how the brain works into our [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2279.64s)]
*  um, the way that we think about how the world works [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2289.0s)]
*  Um, so one one example, um, david eaglemann is a scientist [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2292.52s)]
*  I've spent a lot of time talking to and he's also in my documentary series former mindscape guest [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2296.52s)]
*  Oh, okay. Yeah. So, I mean, i'm sure you talked about all the fascinating things he works on [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2301.88s)]
*  um [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2307.16s)]
*  You know, there are lots of areas I could go in in the documentary we talk about his work on [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2308.36s)]
*  sensory substitution and sensory addition [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2312.92s)]
*  Um, the the story that he shared with me in the documentary was actually a little piece of research that I didn't even realize had been done [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2315.72s)]
*  And this goes way back to his early work. So this is just in so he talks a lot about binding processes and binding processes in the brain [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2324.68s)]
*  Um connect the different inputs the sounds the sights [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2332.44s)]
*  The sensations that all kind of come to the brain at different times then get processed in different parts of the brain at different times [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2336.04s)]
*  And then kind of get delivered to our conscious experience [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2342.84s)]
*  As a single present moment event [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2346.28s)]
*  And even just these processes the fact that this type of thing happens before we're conscious of them [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2349.4s)]
*  Is something we haven't quite really grappled with properly. I think so [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2355.48s)]
*  so he talks about the ability to kind of hack some of these systems, so [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2360.2000000000003s)]
*  They did this very simple experiment where you the um participant pushes a button and when they push a button it makes a beeping sound [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2364.6000000000004s)]
*  So their brain, you know very quickly. It's a simple [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2373.08s)]
*  Um exercise learns that when they push the button the beep happens [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2376.04s)]
*  Then and I think that actual that processing actually takes something like 500 milliseconds for the brain to to coordinate those two things [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2380.44s)]
*  And then give you the experience that okay [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2388.28s)]
*  I push the button and the beep happens because out in the world those things are actually not happening at the same time [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2390.04s)]
*  um, and so [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2395.96s)]
*  So his team david eaglemans team started [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2397.88s)]
*  Inserting very brief pauses, um that were too [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2401.2400000000002s)]
*  Brief for the brain to recognize and it just kept making adjustments [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2406.04s)]
*  Which is what the brain does all the time to help us integrate all these different [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2410.6s)]
*  Signals that are coming in so it started entering a delay so that [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2415.0s)]
*  You push the button and there's actually a delay between the time you push the button and the sound [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2419.16s)]
*  Happens and then they introduce more and more and more of a delay your brain has adjusted for this [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2423.96s)]
*  So you still have the experience you push the button and the sound [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2429.08s)]
*  Um, the sound is created. So [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2432.44s)]
*  Then if they remove the delay they go all the way back, but they don't do it gradually [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2435.16s)]
*  The brain doesn't have time to adjust and the person has the experience [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2439.32s)]
*  That the sound the sound was made before they pushed the button [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2443.48s)]
*  Which it wasn't but their brain tells them that that's exactly your experience and you can't [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2447.16s)]
*  Change your experience because your brain is just generating it based on its best guess [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2452.2s)]
*  And so they created I love this they created an unbeatable rock paper scissors game [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2456.68s)]
*  Where they gradually introduce, you know a pause then they take it away and [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2464.52s)]
*  And so the computer actually knows what your hand is [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2470.12s)]
*  Um before so it has time to make to make the right guess you get the idea [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2474.04s)]
*  Um, but this exposes [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2479.16s)]
*  You know just a just a small, um [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2482.04s)]
*  Window on to how our conscious experience of the way things are happening [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2486.04s)]
*  Um is not a direct perception [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2492.44s)]
*  And it exposes how? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2496.04s)]
*  So many of our intuitions about consciousness [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2499.24s)]
*  Um come from these limitations [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2503.96s)]
*  Um of what we're consciously experiencing and so [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2508.12s)]
*  Conscious will is another area that I spend a lot of time talking about in the docu series because [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2515.56s)]
*  We tend to have this intuition there [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2522.2799999999997s)]
*  There are many illusions that are kind of wrapped up into one and and to my mind [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2524.6s)]
*  They are all related to how we view consciousness. So the idea of conscious will the idea of being a self [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2528.68s)]
*  That is solid across time [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2535.4s)]
*  Which is also another thing that is that is basically generated by the brain. There's a change blindness that happens across time [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2537.64s)]
*  Yeah, that causes us to feel like we're this stable entity. That's kind of um, you know consuming [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2544.2s)]
*  Our conscious experiences over time [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2550.7599999999998s)]
*  Rather than them being generated anew in each moment [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2553.16s)]
*  um [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2557.0s)]
*  and again because it's the thing we are conscious of and the only thing we can talk about or think about because it's the [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2558.04s)]
*  Only part that enters this stream of memory that we have access to [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2564.44s)]
*  We're kind of led to believe that all of that is what consciousness is [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2568.3599999999997s)]
*  And so my first question was really [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2572.7599999999998s)]
*  Is it possible that consciousness is much more simple than all of this? Um, and because there are all these [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2576.7599999999998s)]
*  um neuroscientific studies that that show us that what we experience to be our conscious experience is really at the tail end [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2583.06s)]
*  Of most of this brain processing [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2590.6s)]
*  Um, it's not causal in the way we feel it is. Um, we think we've evolved consciousness [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2593.4s)]
*  Based on the behavior we think it's associated with when in reality it's possible [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2599.98s)]
*  Um that it's simply how these processes feel but the processes are just playing out [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2605.8199999999997s)]
*  And the conscious experience of them is not necessarily the thing that that's driving them [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2613.5s)]
*  Okay, so I want to I I get all that I think it's super important and it is probably like you say underappreciated [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2618.62s)]
*  um [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2626.2999999999997s)]
*  I want to hear therefore we should take consciousness as fundamental. Ah, okay [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2627.58s)]
*  so [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2632.54s)]
*  Again, I mean it takes takes longer than a podcast interview to get all the way there [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2633.58s)]
*  But once you've realized the ways in which [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2638.2999999999997s)]
*  We could be wrong about our assumptions about what consciousness is and you start asking [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2641.58s)]
*  Where does it make sense for it to emerge in nature? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2647.2599999999998s)]
*  um [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2650.7799999999997s)]
*  What I discovered was that you run into paradoxes [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2651.98s)]
*  wherever you try to place that emergence and that you run into the same arguments for why it doesn't make sense to assume there and [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2655.96s)]
*  So it's kind of like it just by necessity goes all the way to the bottom [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2663.42s)]
*  there's there's no place at which it makes sense to put it and so [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2667.58s)]
*  I became convinced that the most rational answer was all the way down and and I became convinced of that [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2673.1s)]
*  really against [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2679.9s)]
*  My will as it were [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2681.98s)]
*  And it's only after kind of marinating in this for the last five years that i've kind of started to develop an intuition for it [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2684.62s)]
*  and can feel [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2691.98s)]
*  How it makes sense, but yeah, it was really just [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2693.42s)]
*  Logical thought experiments that brought me there that I had to kind of fight [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2697.0s)]
*  My my rational mind and my intuitions on um, and that actually I you know [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2702.38s)]
*  I think I could be wrong about it and it was I'm sure I mentioned to you when I called you up to [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2707.1s)]
*  Record a conversation for my docu series [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2711.58s)]
*  Um, I don't want to waste time [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2714.14s)]
*  so [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2716.38s)]
*  I'd like to be talked out of this, you know, and so I you know, i've i've been [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2717.8199999999997s)]
*  Attempting also to talk to people who disagree with me [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2721.4s)]
*  Um so that I can see if there's an error in my thinking so I can see if you know it actually there's there's a good reason [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2724.94s)]
*  to not actually follow [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2731.42s)]
*  these questions any further [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2733.2599999999998s)]
*  so if [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2735.42s)]
*  So good so that I think you you've motivated it very very well [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2736.86s)]
*  Um, then the question is can we build up a sensible? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2740.46s)]
*  Understanding of what it implies to say this [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2744.04s)]
*  So of course my the the constant thing that i've talked about and you've heard me talk about is look we understand [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2747.1800000000003s)]
*  How atoms behave? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2754.54s)]
*  We we understand those laws of physics very well [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2756.46s)]
*  And part of that is part of that behavior of atoms is that i'm made of atoms and what i'm talking to you here [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2758.94s)]
*  When i'm reporting my conscious experiences, I am a collection of atoms obeying the laws of physics [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2764.7799999999997s)]
*  So how in this understanding do my conscious experiences? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2770.94s)]
*  Affect my behavior my reporting my my physical moving around in the world [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2775.88s)]
*  How do your conscious experiences affect those? Yeah, if if consciousness is fundamental and you think that you know, I don't know [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2781.66s)]
*  I think consciousness might actually not be causal [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2787.74s)]
*  But I don't know this is one of the questions I have and this is something I spend a lot of time [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2791.66s)]
*  Thinking about and talking about [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2795.42s)]
*  You know if consciousness is fundamental it clearly has a structure for all of the reasons you just described like we've we've discovered a lot [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2799.66s)]
*  Of the structure already [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2806.78s)]
*  Um, it clearly is not just a free for all. Um [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2808.94s)]
*  but if what all the physics and mathematics [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2813.18s)]
*  Describes at bottom are this range of conscious experiences that arrives in the universe [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2816.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, yes, it it has this structure and one question [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2821.84s)]
*  um, I have when I really get into the weeds on this is [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2826.16s)]
*  Is it possible to have conscious experience with no content? Is there something that you know that that consciousness? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2830.08s)]
*  You know that that thing? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2837.92s)]
*  is that has you know a structure to it or [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2840.64s)]
*  You know the equation in many worlds for the schrodinger schrodinger equation [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2844.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but the what is it of the universe the the wave function of the universe the wave function of the universe. Thank you [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2850.0800000000004s)]
*  so the wave function of the universe, um [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2856.8s)]
*  Is not just [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2860.6400000000003s)]
*  A mathematical term and an idea and kind of a a force that that is kind of moving things but is actually [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2863.6000000000004s)]
*  In actuality felt experience [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2871.2799999999997s)]
*  And then it generates all of these different forms and things that come into being [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2875.2s)]
*  Um that in actuality are just different types of conscious experiences coming in and out of being [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2880.0s)]
*  um [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2886.08s)]
*  I [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2888.0s)]
*  I'm not sure I imagine that thinking about things in those terms might change the way [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2889.6s)]
*  That's the way [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2896.08s)]
*  Theoretical physicists think about things moving forward and I think that will have to be in combination with [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2898.72s)]
*  Experimental results. I think we'll have we'll have to start doing some very new and interesting science to at least make us [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2906.0s)]
*  As confident as we've been in in neuroscience that the consciousness arises out of complexity [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2914.96s)]
*  To you know to take it seriously and see but it's interesting to me because I actually think [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2920.56s)]
*  It generates a lot of creative thinking it does kind of open up new avenues [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2925.28s)]
*  For thinking about things at the fundamental level [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2932.16s)]
*  um [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2936.32s)]
*  I have no idea where they will go. I do not claim to have the kind of mind [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2937.68s)]
*  We'll figure any of this out, but I think it's kind of a paradigm shifting [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2941.52s)]
*  um [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2946.88s)]
*  It's a paradigm shifting [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2951.12s)]
*  framework that [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2953.66s)]
*  Could inspire new ways of thinking about [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2956.16s)]
*  uh [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2960.08s)]
*  Quantum mechanics the findings of quantum mechanics [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2961.2s)]
*  I don't know if you if you listen to the whole thing or have heard me say that [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2964.4s)]
*  Actually many worlds to me is the best way to describe [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2968.8s)]
*  Um is the best interpretation of quantum mechanics if consciousness is fundamental that it actually resolves a lot of issues [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2974.88s)]
*  That you run into you probably don't like that. You're like leave my leave many worlds out of it shameless pandering [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2980.64s)]
*  Encourage that here on the minds again against my will because many worlds was not something that [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2987.6s)]
*  That naturally resonated with me, you know, I I followed string theory for a long time. I [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=2994.32s)]
*  I like, you know aesthetically I like string theory better [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3000.0s)]
*  But I had to admit that many worlds actually fit better with my view of the universe of consciousness is fundamental [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3004.1600000000003s)]
*  So let me let me ask it this way. Um, as I said in my talk at that conference that you um, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3010.88s)]
*  Talked about organized by philip gulf another previous mindscape guest [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3016.32s)]
*  To me the very first question [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3021.2000000000003s)]
*  That has to be answered by anyone who wants to talk about the fundamentally of consciousness is yeah [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3024.4s)]
*  Do they think that it will? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3030.8s)]
*  Manifest in some change of what we understand as the fundamental [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3033.42s)]
*  Laws of physics for the just the behavior of stuff or does it leave the behavior of physical stuff completely as we currently understand it? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3038.16s)]
*  Oh, no, I think it absolutely leaves the behavior of physical stuff the way we understand it [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3045.52s)]
*  I think I mean my the way i'm approaching this and the way I think about this is completely from a physicalist perspective it is [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3049.68s)]
*  Um and deferring to the science we have already so, you know in in my mind if [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3057.44s)]
*  I run some thought experiment or if you know, we go down this path and it's kind of counter to things that are already [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3064.56s)]
*  Well established in physics we rule it out [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3071.52s)]
*  um [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3074.4s)]
*  Whether it can actually [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3076.0s)]
*  Help move physics along. I really don't know I can imagine ways that it might [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3079.04s)]
*  Um, but I don't know so then the worry I have is simply not the worry but the question I have is simply um, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3083.92s)]
*  if I [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3090.88s)]
*  Didn't think that consciousness was fundamental. Yeah, but I had the same idea of the laws of physics and that I am made of atoms [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3092.08s)]
*  Yeah [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3099.04s)]
*  Everything I do would be exactly the same including all the reports I have about how I feel and how i'm experiencing things and yes [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3099.68s)]
*  Love and pain and all those yes completely unaltered by whether or not this picture is true or false [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3106.48s)]
*  Well, yes and no, I mean mostly yes, I think to [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3111.68s)]
*  um [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3116.48s)]
*  Physicists who are trying to reach a deeper understanding I think there are [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3118.88s)]
*  Possibly places to take this that could take the many worlds interpretation in new directions [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3125.2s)]
*  um and and [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3131.04s)]
*  potentially give us um [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3132.86s)]
*  A better sense of what [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3138.0s)]
*  It's telling us about the structure of the universe, but I also just think as human beings, you know [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3140.96s)]
*  It's like every time there's a paradigm shift. I actually think it inevitably changes [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3145.44s)]
*  everything including science in ways that we can't even predict ahead of time, so [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3151.52s)]
*  You know, I often will give the analogy of you know, our intuition that the earth is flat, you know, and then [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3158.4s)]
*  Celestial observations give us a clue that maybe this isn't flat and eventually we have all the evidence we need [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3164.62s)]
*  um [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3171.44s)]
*  And while it doesn't necessarily affect my day-to-day activities, um, and the truth is [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3172.4s)]
*  Most of the time it's not relevant [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3179.12s)]
*  um [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3181.2000000000003s)]
*  I do think [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3182.7200000000003s)]
*  There's kind of this background feeling of our place in the universe and how we navigate the universe to know [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3184.48s)]
*  That outer space is out there [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3191.92s)]
*  and we're orbiting the sun and we have a [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3194.4s)]
*  Deeper better understanding of the way the universe is structured with all of these unanswered questions, but at least [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3197.7599999999998s)]
*  um [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3204.16s)]
*  I feel myself to be living in a different universe than someone lived in when they believed the earth was flat, right? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3204.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I think these things [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3210.7999999999997s)]
*  um [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3212.7999999999997s)]
*  have a way of [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3213.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know affecting our future [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3216.16s)]
*  thoughts and creativity and help progress science [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3218.7999999999997s)]
*  Even when we're not necessarily paying attention to them in every moment [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3223.12s)]
*  No, actually that that part of it. I like that very much what you just said because [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3227.68s)]
*  I've said many times on the podcast that there can be with just within physics [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3232.24s)]
*  two different ways of talking about or [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3237.2799999999997s)]
*  Mathematically formulating exactly the same theory. Yes, all the same predictions, etc. But by taking one perspective versus another [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3241.58s)]
*  Extensions or modifications of those theories are naturally suggested to themselves [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3250.7000000000003s)]
*  So so what you're saying, so I think that's very clarifying because certain other panpsychists who names I won't mentioned [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3256.4s)]
*  Uh refuse to answer this question that I asked but you you answered it. I'm not a panpsychist [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3262.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, yeah, well, and I also think it actually makes a difference [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3268.48s)]
*  Difference [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3272.64s)]
*  You know if we if we at some point down the line have more reason to believe it's fundamental [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3273.84s)]
*  The consciousness is fundamental than it is emerging in complex life forms [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3279.2s)]
*  um, I don't know what kinds of questions that will provoke in the next generation of scientists, but [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3283.76s)]
*  My goodness, that's a very different world [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3289.28s)]
*  And [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3293.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean i'd like to know which one is more likely and it will affect my my [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3294.64s)]
*  Questions going forward so yeah [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3300.48s)]
*  No, so I get the argument that the the reason to sort of take this perspective seriously is that it [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3302.24s)]
*  Opens up and suggests new research avenues going forward sure even new moral questions [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3307.84s)]
*  You know, it's I think it's just there's a world of unanswered questions if it's in fact true that consciousness [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3312.4s)]
*  Goes very deep in nature, right then suddenly [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3319.04s)]
*  There's a new dimension to things that we haven't really thought about. Yeah, I don't know if you know the work of jonathan birch [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3321.84s)]
*  He was a recent um [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3327.52s)]
*  Guest that we had he's a philosopher. Listen to that episode. He is, uh, the world's leader in animal sentience [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3329.28s)]
*  So he intentionally doesn't use the word consciousness just because it's fraught, right? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3337.44s)]
*  Yes, and he says, you know, there are people who won't believe that like you say an earthworm is conscious or whatever [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3342.6400000000003s)]
*  But sentience is maybe a little more sciencey sounding and you can yeah [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3348.2400000000002s)]
*  That is that is always the word I I choose to use also [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3351.44s)]
*  yeah, and so and he tries to make an argument that again, even if you [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3354.4s)]
*  I like the idea. I think I don't know where he comes down personally, but his philosophical argument is [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3358.2400000000002s)]
*  Even if you think it's okay to kill animals and eat them [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3364.5600000000004s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's okay to hurt them. Yes to cause them pain and I think it's you know, again people can agree [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3368.7200000000003s)]
*  To that interview. Yeah. No, that sounds right up my logically coherent perspective, which is I really yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3375.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's similar to um the plant biologist I spoke with daniel shamovitz. Um, that's I believe chapter four [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3382.64s)]
*  um, you know, he also really struggled with this because he is he is a [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3390.3199999999997s)]
*  well respected scientist who [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3394.8799999999997s)]
*  You know does good science [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3397.44s)]
*  um, and as he discovered these similarities, um [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3399.8399999999997s)]
*  In the types of process, you know when plants are processing light waves or [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3405.04s)]
*  um sound waves in the form of like a you know mechanical stimulus and [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3411.44s)]
*  He was finding it. He was finding himself using terms like hearing and seeing [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3416.16s)]
*  But not wanting to confuse them with human hearing and seeing but the truth is there there are these [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3422.2400000000002s)]
*  sense modalities that [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3428.88s)]
*  Um, you know again at the molecular level he actually is funny [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3431.2s)]
*  He talked about I don't think this made it into the documentary [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3434.2400000000002s)]
*  But he and I were talking about how his he comes from a family of doctors and how he was the rebel [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3437.52s)]
*  And he went out to to become a plant biologist and he realized [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3443.52s)]
*  you know, it's it's all part of the same thing he ended up kind of doing the same science in way because [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3447.6s)]
*  um, you know, you can you can give anesthesia to [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3454.0s)]
*  A venus flytrap and it blocks the information flow in the same way that it does in a human brain and yeah [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3457.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, so yes, he but he and he had a hard time knowing how to talk about those things and I think [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3464.24s)]
*  He really was wondering whether there were there were sentience or felt experience [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3470.4s)]
*  Um, not consciousness in the way we usually think about it [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3474.72s)]
*  But the way I talk about it he he really thinks it's it's likely that plants have some form of that [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3477.04s)]
*  Um, you know again, they don't have the same systems that we have [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3482.96s)]
*  They probably don't have they have some memory but not the type of memory we have so [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3486.08s)]
*  If there is felt sensation it probably comes in and out of existence very quickly [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3490.56s)]
*  um [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3494.8799999999997s)]
*  But yes, yeah [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3496.56s)]
*  I think this leads directly into this question of what what would be the new research questions and directions that get opened up by this perspective [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3497.6s)]
*  I mean if you go back to the abacus you said you said something very provocative that the abacus sort of isn't a coherent self [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3506.3999999999996s)]
*  Right the abacus you might have pieces that are made of fundamental consciousness stuff or whatever [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3514.3999999999996s)]
*  But the abacus doesn't cohere into a self. So yeah. Yeah, what does what do you have opinions about this? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3520.0s)]
*  Like when do we have a self? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3527.12s)]
*  Yeah, um, I don't know. I've thought a lot about this. I've written a lot about it. I think it's um, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3529.12s)]
*  Related to memory. I think highly dependent on memory, although not completely dependent on it [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3535.2s)]
*  um, I think you know if [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3541.12s)]
*  Consciousness, uh is fundamental. I think there's something um, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3544.54s)]
*  You know adam frank the the physicist and I had this conversation about the cell when a cell comes into being a single cell [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3549.4399999999996s)]
*  um [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3556.08s)]
*  that essentially [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3557.52s)]
*  The cell and the bath of chemicals it's in come into being in the same moment because they're in relationship to run [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3559.8399999999997s)]
*  there's no bath of chemicals if there's no cell, you know and vice versa and [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3566.16s)]
*  That in order to keep this the the borders that it has and to let in the things it needs to let in and maintain [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3572.16s)]
*  itself as a system [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3580.32s)]
*  Um that that's kind of the beginning of self and I would say that self without memory [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3582.4s)]
*  So just distinguishing, you know the system from the the bath of chemicals or the you know, the outside world [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3587.28s)]
*  um [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3594.56s)]
*  I'm forgetting your specific question. I feel like I was on my way to answering it. At what point does the [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3595.6s)]
*  Answering it coherence of the system [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3599.4399999999996s)]
*  Qualifies being a yeah. Yeah, no [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3601.7599999999998s)]
*  So I think I mean I think it largely has to do with memory and distinguishing a system from you know [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3603.9199999999996s)]
*  The thing that is keeping the system going [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3610.0s)]
*  um [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3612.8799999999997s)]
*  I also think though that at most levels even the idea of self is an illusion [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3615.2799999999997s)]
*  um [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3623.2799999999997s)]
*  At the level of the human mind too. So [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3624.56s)]
*  Um, i've talked about this a bit in my work where [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3627.6s)]
*  you know [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3631.84s)]
*  Our present moment experience is is based on this neuronal firing that's happening in every moment [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3633.6s)]
*  Um, I have this sense that there's kind of this solid me that moves through time [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3639.84s)]
*  um, but the truth is this new experience is being generated a fresh a new now that is obviously [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3645.7599999999998s)]
*  influenced by previous moments [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3653.2599999999998s)]
*  Um, but it still has to be brought into being in each moment [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3655.34s)]
*  And so I make this analogy to an ocean wave that you know, we we call ocean waves waves as if you know [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3659.42s)]
*  It's a single thing [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3665.5800000000004s)]
*  um a friend of mine actually just said something very sweet that he was at the beach with his daughter and his [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3667.1000000000004s)]
*  They were looking at the waves and his daughter said I wish we could take one home [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3671.6600000000003s)]
*  And he joked and he was like, let's get a bucket. Let's bring one home and that kind of you know [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3676.0600000000004s)]
*  Um shows the illusion there which is that we call it a wave but it's a system in nature [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3680.4599999999996s)]
*  It's an ever it's an ever-changing never-ending system in nature [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3686.14s)]
*  and that is true of the electrical firing of the neurons as well, and so [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3690.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure that self and and I actually think that the the concept of a self the fact that we feel ourselves to be [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3696.7799999999997s)]
*  Selfs is one of the things that get in the way of our being able to think [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3703.1s)]
*  Clearly about consciousness because I think we often equate consciousness with self [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3707.98s)]
*  um [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3712.46s)]
*  so [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3713.5s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know that was a weird answer to your question [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3715.2599999999998s)]
*  But i'm basically saying i'm not sure there are selves to begin with [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3717.42s)]
*  or that the that the illusion of self is created by [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3721.3399999999997s)]
*  Um a system that carries memory across time [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3725.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, do we get insight into these questions by some combination of meditation [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3729.34s)]
*  Psychedelics things like that things that give us a different perspective on our inner workings [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3735.56s)]
*  Uh, I think so. I mean maybe not as directly as as other people might suggest. Um, I think [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3740.86s)]
*  meditation absolutely because it does something very interesting which is [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3746.6800000000003s)]
*  Expose a lot of these illusions, you know in the same way that david eaglemans work [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3751.96s)]
*  You know, you can run these experiments and expose the way the brain works. Meditation is an interesting thing to do. It's very [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3756.3s)]
*  Counter to the way the brain normally is is operating [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3763.02s)]
*  And so I think it has a similar effect of kind of you you're able to catch [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3767.82s)]
*  These illusions and the act of being created [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3773.02s)]
*  And so the illusion of self is something that that regularly drops out for people when they've been practicing meditation for a while [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3775.34s)]
*  Um, and you know that I think that's that's the most important one [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3783.1s)]
*  But there there are others as well and it just I think it changes [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3786.14s)]
*  our normal everyday experience of being a human being so much [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3789.98s)]
*  That it enables us to be more creative in in our thinking and and to notice when we've made assumptions that we consider to be fact [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3794.7s)]
*  that are that are [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3803.9s)]
*  actually assumptions, um [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3805.96s)]
*  And psychedelics is a very interesting one too. I have a lot of questions about those experiences. I really don't know [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3808.12s)]
*  um, I think [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3816.2s)]
*  the most useful thing about them for myself and people I know who've taken them is again a similar thing to meditation, but on a much [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3818.44s)]
*  more, um impactful scale, I think is [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3826.04s)]
*  Having an experience that is so different from your typical human everyday experience [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3830.12s)]
*  causes you to realize [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3835.88s)]
*  The range of possible experiences even for a human brain that are far beyond anything [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3838.76s)]
*  I had ever known possible and are very hard to describe [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3844.6s)]
*  And so what experiences might be possible in other systems? I think it enables you to be [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3848.76s)]
*  Um, yeah to to think differently and more creatively. Well, I I kind of like that in the sense that you know [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3854.52s)]
*  It's not suggesting that psychedelics or if that matter meditation somehow give us [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3859.88s)]
*  Some closer data about the fundamental workings of reality so much as they [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3865.0s)]
*  They nudge us out of our dogmatic slumbers a little bit. Yes, you said it so much more eloquently than I did [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3869.8s)]
*  But yeah, so I stole it from imani wakant. So, uh [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3875.2400000000002s)]
*  So that that I would that I would say [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3879.16s)]
*  Yes to the to the first piece to the second piece [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3881.7200000000003s)]
*  Maybe and I don't know and I have questions about that [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3884.44s)]
*  And so, you know, I think it's interesting that on psychedelics people have experiences [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3887.32s)]
*  Of a spaceless timeless kind of consciousness, which I think is more in line with what physics is revealing to us than [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3892.54s)]
*  You know than our typical everyday experience of space and time and so maybe you know, maybe we kind of [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3902.7000000000003s)]
*  Generate over time as our brains evolve and well our brains don't evolve but as they develop [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3909.8s)]
*  to [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3915.7400000000002s)]
*  Operate in our in our circumstance where we need to survive and survival is the the main focus [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3916.62s)]
*  Um that it's possible we [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3924.06s)]
*  There there is a more direct [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3927.74s)]
*  line to [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3931.42s)]
*  the outside world [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3933.42s)]
*  That kind of gets pruned away into a more useful [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3935.1s)]
*  Line into the outside world and that psychedelics help us kind of access something that is more direct [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3938.7799999999997s)]
*  But that is all those are like big question marks [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3943.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't know but these are things I wonder about and think are possible. I mean maybe then as a last thing to ask [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3945.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you have much of a [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3952.94s)]
*  Suggested future research program for how we should be thinking about these things if it's true that this perspective [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3955.16s)]
*  Suggests different questions. How do we go about answering them? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3961.18s)]
*  Uh experiments so I do I do go into this in the in the final chapter of my docu series. I think um [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3964.3599999999997s)]
*  I really think the first place to start is kind of where david eaglemann has headed with sensory addition [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3969.9s)]
*  And I talked to a participant in a study where they were given an experience of magnetic north [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3977.5s)]
*  Um, so, you know eagle eaglemann's work has largely been about helping blind people and deaf people find other ways for their brains [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3983.82s)]
*  To process light waves and sound waves, but this is bringing in a new [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3990.62s)]
*  Perception altogether [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3994.86s)]
*  I think [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3996.7799999999997s)]
*  I also like the idea of scientific endeavors, which whether consciousness is fundamental or not will be useful [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=3998.06s)]
*  Of course, that'd be nice [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4005.66s)]
*  but I think these all kind of will help us get better intuitions for [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4007.2599999999998s)]
*  Answering questions about how how deep in nature consciousness goes. So I think you know, ultimately [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4012.7799999999997s)]
*  We only have our [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4018.62s)]
*  intuitions [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4021.08s)]
*  Or determining where consciousness is to begin with, you know, I [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4022.62s)]
*  Can communicate with you and we can talk about our shared experiences. So one is was having shared experiences [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4026.46s)]
*  I can't talk to a person who was born blind about the color red [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4032.14s)]
*  I mean, there's just no way we're you know, we're not going to get anywhere [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4035.8199999999997s)]
*  And so having a shared experience is important and then having the language to be able to to talk about those experiences [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4039.42s)]
*  So I think the more things more human beings are able to perceive and get intuitions for I think that could be useful to science [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4045.58s)]
*  anyway, you know we [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4052.8599999999997s)]
*  All of our perceptions give us some clue about the physics of things and then we we go on from there [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4055.02s)]
*  But the more things we can actually process directly the more intuitions we can develop for them [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4059.5s)]
*  and i'm hopeful that we might be able to [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4065.66s)]
*  Experience systems in nature [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4071.74s)]
*  That give us more of a clue one way or the other if they're conscious and so, you know, we have [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4075.42s)]
*  Limited ability to communicate with our pets, but there's enough crossover that we [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4082.62s)]
*  We make the assumption that there is consciousness there. And so I think if there would be some way for us to [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4087.5s)]
*  um experience and therefore communicate with [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4093.56s)]
*  plant systems, um, or you know other systems like that, I don't think I can't imagine how we could ever know conclusively [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4098.0599999999995s)]
*  Because the truth is I can't even know conclusively that you're conscious and so we're kind of limited [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4105.34s)]
*  And we seem to always be limited in that sense, but if we could [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4109.9s)]
*  Um produce tools that give us new intuitions that make me feel as confident that [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4115.74s)]
*  um, you know an insect or an a [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4123.179999999999s)]
*  Much simpler system in nature is conscious in to the extent that I believe you are conscious. I think that would be very interesting [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4127.339999999999s)]
*  Could virtual reality be any help? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4135.0199999999995s)]
*  Probably I haven't thought much about it, but yes and and anil seth is actually working on [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4137.5s)]
*  Some things that I think yeah are related [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4142.700000000001s)]
*  Um, yes, absolutely. All right. Well, i'm looking forward to understanding all this consciousness stuff [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4145.5s)]
*  No, we have to get the next generation on this because this is gonna take a while [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4150.06s)]
*  I've had several podcasts and we still don't agree on exactly what [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4154.14s)]
*  Is doing to us but anika harris. Thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4158.38s)]
*  I really appreciate your interest in this, especially since you're you're allergic to my conclusions [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4162.06s)]
*  It's something I really appreciate and respect about it's about the journey. All right. Yeah. Thanks very much. Thank you [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4167.5s)]
*  You [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDNF0vZafio&t=4192.06s)]
