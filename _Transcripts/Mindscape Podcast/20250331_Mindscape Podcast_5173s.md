Cosmologists were, let us be honest, pretty stunned in 1998 when observations revealed that the universe is accelerating. There was an obvious plausible explanation, the cosmological constant proposed by Einstein, which is equivalent to a constant vacuum energy pervading space.  But the cosmological constant was known to be enormously smaller than its "natural" value, and it seems fine-tuned for it to be so small but not yet zero. Once burned, twice shy, and since then we have been looking for evidence that the dark energy might not be strictly constant, even though that's even more fine-tuned. We talk to cosmologist Marc Kamionkowski about recent evidence that dark energy might be changing with time, and what this might have to do with the Hubble tension and other cosmic anomalies.

Marc Kamionkowski received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago. He is currently the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. Among his prizes are the Gruber Cosmology Prize, the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics, membership in the National Academy of Science, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.

# Mindscape 310 | Marc Kamionkowski on Dark Energy and Cosmic Anomalies
**Mindscape Podcast:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3.0s)]
*  I'm a working theoretical cosmologist, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4.62s)]
*  among other job descriptions. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=8.18s)]
*  Recently, there's been some news in [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  cosmology that may or may not turn out to be a big deal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=12.46s)]
*  This is often how it is in science. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=16.16s)]
*  You get a result, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=17.72s)]
*  but of course, by the very nature of having gotten a new result, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=19.44s)]
*  it's a hard result to get, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=23.56s)]
*  otherwise, he would have gotten it earlier. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=24.84s)]
*  The first indications that something interesting might be [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=26.68s)]
*  happening are typically faint, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=29.4s)]
*  and you're not sure whether they're on the right track or not. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=32.0s)]
*  But there's a couple of different things that have indicated that perhaps there are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=34.739999999999995s)]
*  kinks in the armor of the standard cosmological model, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=40.12s)]
*  the so-called Lambda CDM model, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=44.76s)]
*  Lambda for Cosmological Constant, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  CDM for Cold Dark Matter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  Not something that throws away [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=51.56s)]
*  the whole Big Bang scenario or anything like that, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=53.12s)]
*  but specific details might need to be tweaked. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=56.24s)]
*  This is something that I could have done a solo episode about, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=59.64s)]
*  but the data and exactly what the data are telling us really matter here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=63.18s)]
*  So I thought it would be better to have a true expert on the podcast. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=67.6s)]
*  So we're happy to welcome Mark Hamienkowski, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=71.04s)]
*  who is my colleague at Johns Hopkins, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=73.06s)]
*  and someone I've known for a long time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=76.0s)]
*  We've written papers together, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=78.14s)]
*  including suggesting the idea of dark electromagnetism, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=79.56s)]
*  in addition to dark matter out there in the universe. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=83.8s)]
*  We don't talk about that in this podcast. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=86.4s)]
*  Instead, we're talking about these accumulating possible anomalies in cosmology. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=88.48s)]
*  Most recently, there's a survey called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=94.64s)]
*  DESI, that has suggested that perhaps the density of dark energy is changing with time, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=100.24s)]
*  which is not what you would expect if it was just a cosmological constant, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=109.0s)]
*  if it were a dynamical field, you might expect something like that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=113.24s)]
*  And there was a hint a year ago that that was true. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=117.6s)]
*  Very recently, the hint has become stronger. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=120.8s)]
*  And there is another instrument called the Dark Energy Survey, DES, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=123.6s)]
*  as opposed to DESI for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=128.88s)]
*  that has less firm results, but also pointing in the same direction, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=133.16s)]
*  that dark energy might be evolving with time. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=136.72s)]
*  These are both amazing surveys. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=140.32s)]
*  Interestingly, they both look at galaxies out there in the universe, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  and they look at the distribution of galaxies [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=147.48s)]
*  and how they're evolving with time and things like that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=149.92s)]
*  They're both ground-based cameras that replaced previous cameras. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, DESI, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=157.28s)]
*  replaced the camera at Kitt Peak in Arizona, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  and the Dark Energy Survey replaced the camera in Chile. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=165.2s)]
*  It's a Victor Blanco telescope. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=169.0s)]
*  Anyway, these hints that dark energy might be changing with time [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=170.88s)]
*  are still tentative, it's not completely clear yet, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=175.56s)]
*  and indeed at face value, it would be remarkable if they were really true [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=178.44s)]
*  because of the specific way in which the dark energy is evolving with time, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=183.72s)]
*  so we're going to get into that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=187.32s)]
*  But of course, I have to take advantage of this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  to also talk about other cosmological anomalies. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=190.56s)]
*  The Hubble tension, which we talked about with Adam Rees some time ago, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=193.52s)]
*  Mark turns out to be one of the world's experts [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=197.6s)]
*  in thinking about models to explain the Hubble tension. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=200.36s)]
*  Mark was in on the ground floor in thinking about the cosmic microwave background [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=204.48s)]
*  as a cosmological probe, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=208.28s)]
*  and also was the author of some interesting ideas [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=210.08s)]
*  about what dark energy could be back in the day. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=213.12s)]
*  So he's really the best person to talk to about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=215.32s)]
*  what the microwave background tells us, what these galaxy surveys tell us, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  and what the theoretical implications are of all this stuff. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=222.56s)]
*  I would say that, hmm, right now I'm still on the fence [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  about whether there really truly is something dramatic going on, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=230.32s)]
*  but it's absolutely a legitimate possibility. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  Sadly, we're still going to have to wait for even better data to come in. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  That's how science goes sometimes, but if you listen to this episode, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=240.44s)]
*  you'll be well prepared to understand what's happening [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=243.44s)]
*  when that data does come in. So let's go. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Mark Kamienkowski, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=255.64s)]
*  Hello. Pleasure to be here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=258.36s)]
*  Nice to be talking to you on this beautiful Wednesday morning. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=260.4s)]
*  I know. You're back in sunny Baltimore. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=263.24s)]
*  I'm here in Santa Fe, but yeah, it's a reasonably nice day today. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=265.0s)]
*  A little cooler than yesterday, but probably more oxygen, right? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=269.12s)]
*  Santa Fe is at very high altitude. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little cooler than yesterday, but probably more oxygen, right? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=275.44s)]
*  Santa Fe is at very high altitude. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=276.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little cooler than yesterday, but probably more oxygen, right? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=279.24s)]
*  Santa Fe is at very high altitude. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=283.04s)]
*  Yes, gets me. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=285.56s)]
*  So we are here because there's been a couple of, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  more than a couple of anomalies, challenges, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=291.12s)]
*  puzzles, whatever you want to call them, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=295.0s)]
*  with respect to the standard cosmological model, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  which is nowadays known as Lambda CDM. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=300.44s)]
*  So we're going to talk about that, but let's first explain [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  what is the standard cosmological model and why do we believe it? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=305.76s)]
*  Give us a medium-sized intro to where we are before we have any anomalies. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=309.96s)]
*  Okay, medium-sized intro to where we are before we have any anomalies. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  So we live in a universe that we have been observing for centuries, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=320.4s)]
*  but I would say over the past 100 years in particular, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  our understanding of the universe, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=331.55999999999995s)]
*  which is everything that we know as one physical system. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  Has evolved tremendously and it sort of started, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  yeah, just under 100 years ago really, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  with Hubble's discovery that the universe was expanding. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=347.52s)]
*  So, you know, everybody knows that the Earth spins around the Sun [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  and the Sun is the center of the solar system. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=356.0s)]
*  Most people know that the Sun is one of about 10 million stars [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=358.64s)]
*  in our galaxy, the Milky Way, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=363.96s)]
*  and the Sun spins around the center of the Milky Way [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=366.68s)]
*  for the same reason that the Earth spins around the Sun. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=369.48s)]
*  So I think you said 10 million? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=371.76s)]
*  10 billion, sorry. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=373.88s)]
*  Good to know you're paying attention. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=377.16s)]
*  I'm going to give up the galaxy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=378.52s)]
*  Yeah, 10 billion, sorry, 10 billion stars. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=379.88s)]
*  And so the Sun spins around the center of the Milky Way [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=384.16s)]
*  for the same reason that the Earth spins around the Sun, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=387.56s)]
*  and that's because all of the stars in the Milky Way [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=389.76s)]
*  generate a very strong gravitational field. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=392.0s)]
*  And you might then wonder whether our galaxy [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=395.0s)]
*  is part of some larger structure, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  you know, whether our galaxy is one of tens of 10 billion galaxies [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=399.56s)]
*  that spin around each other, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=403.24s)]
*  but it turns out that the hierarchy ends there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=404.88s)]
*  And our galaxy, it turns out, is one of, you know, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  tens of billions of galaxies that are more or less the same [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=411.32s)]
*  that we know about, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=414.92s)]
*  but the galaxies don't spin around from each other. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=416.8s)]
*  It turns out that every galaxy is moving away [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=418.92s)]
*  from every other galaxy, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=421.88s)]
*  and this is what Hubble discovered almost 100 years ago. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=423.2s)]
*  And the relative, the speed at which any two galaxies [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  are moving away from each other [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=430.68s)]
*  is proportional to their distance. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=432.12s)]
*  And so the interpretation of this [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  is that the entire universe is expanding. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=436.8s)]
*  This was discovered by Hubble, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=439.64s)]
*  and it turned out that it was kind of convenient [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=441.48s)]
*  because Einstein had discovered general relativity [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  12 years before that, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=447.76s)]
*  and, you know, several people [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=449.52s)]
*  who were studying general relativity [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=451.56s)]
*  realized that equations of general relativity [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=452.92s)]
*  allowed for such a universe, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=456.0s)]
*  a universe that was filled with a bunch of stuff [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=458.24s)]
*  where everything was expanding, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=461.12s)]
*  everything was moving away from everything else. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=462.68s)]
*  So that was sort of the birth [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=465.08s)]
*  of the standard cosmological model. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=466.16s)]
*  And since then, we've discovered a bunch of other things. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=468.48s)]
*  Perhaps the next big breakthrough [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=472.04s)]
*  was sort of in the mid-60s. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=473.76s)]
*  There was a discovery of something [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=475.72s)]
*  that we now call the cosmic microwave background. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=477.64s)]
*  Basically, the idea is that if everything [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  is moving away from everything else today, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=483.28s)]
*  if we were to make a movie of that expansion [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=486.24s)]
*  and then run it backwards, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=488.28s)]
*  at some earlier time, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=490.12s)]
*  everything in the universe [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=491.4s)]
*  would be on top of everything else. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=492.47999999999996s)]
*  So although the universe, you know, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  is a fairly low density place now, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=495.88s)]
*  if everything's moving away from everything else, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=498.0s)]
*  at some time in the past, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=500.0s)]
*  which we call the Big Bang, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=502.2s)]
*  the density of the universe would have been very high. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=504.4s)]
*  Anybody who puts lots of air in tires [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=507.4s)]
*  and drives them around knows that when densities get high, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=509.88000000000005s)]
*  the pressures get high, the temperatures get high. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=512.64s)]
*  So the early universe, we have good reason to believe, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=516.96s)]
*  was very hot. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=519.32s)]
*  And, you know, if you look at a fireplace [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  where there was a fire that is now out, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  the embers still glow for some amount of time afterwards. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=527.76s)]
*  Even though there's no fire, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=531.24s)]
*  you can still see residual heat. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=532.12s)]
*  And in 1965, we discovered this residual heat, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=534.72s)]
*  the cosmic microwave background. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  So it turns out that we discovered another relic [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=539.6s)]
*  from this Big Bang, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=543.24s)]
*  that consistent with this picture of an expanding universe [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=544.28s)]
*  that Hubble sort of gave us 100 years ago. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=546.48s)]
*  This good so far? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=549.84s)]
*  This is great, yeah, I love it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=551.0s)]
*  Okay, just checking. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=552.52s)]
*  So, and then, so that was 1965. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=555.2s)]
*  So that was 60 years ago. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=560.44s)]
*  And since then, we've learned even more about our universe. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=562.5600000000001s)]
*  So we've been able to study the distribution of galaxies [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=566.52s)]
*  in the universe. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=570.56s)]
*  And we find that the universe on the very largest scales [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=571.56s)]
*  is very, very smooth. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=574.12s)]
*  So it's like a pond on a clear day, on a calm day. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=576.04s)]
*  But if you look very carefully, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=580.12s)]
*  there are some fluctuations. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=582.12s)]
*  There are some small amplitude ripples, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=583.88s)]
*  as if there was some light wind. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=585.9399999999999s)]
*  We've also been able to look at this cosmic microwave [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=590.0s)]
*  background very, very precisely, very carefully. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=592.36s)]
*  And we've been able to see that the temperature [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=597.44s)]
*  of this glow, this afterglow of the Big Bang, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=600.48s)]
*  is not precisely the same everywhere. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  It's pretty close. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=607.28s)]
*  The temperature is the same to one part in 100,000. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=608.6s)]
*  But if you actually look really, really carefully, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=611.84s)]
*  there are small fluctuations. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=613.84s)]
*  And we believe, we have very good reason to believe [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=617.38s)]
*  that these small fluctuations that we see [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=619.76s)]
*  in the cosmic microwave background [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  were then the seeds for the larger amplitude fluctuations [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=623.44s)]
*  that we see in the galaxy distributiverse today. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=627.12s)]
*  We believe that those small fluctuations were amplified [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=630.12s)]
*  by gravitational forces. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=632.6800000000001s)]
*  So we have all of these very, very detailed measurements [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=637.8000000000001s)]
*  of the cosmic microwave background, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=640.48s)]
*  of the distribution of galaxies. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=642.24s)]
*  And we have a model that allows us to relate [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=644.5200000000001s)]
*  distribution of galaxies in the universe today [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  to the distribution of the cosmic microwave background [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=649.8800000000001s)]
*  that we see, the afterglow from the Big Bang. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=652.16s)]
*  And in order for our model to account for the features [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=655.52s)]
*  that we see both in the cosmic microwave background [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=658.56s)]
*  and in galaxies, we need to have, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=660.92s)]
*  we need in these models, in addition to the ordinary stuff [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=665.64s)]
*  that you and I and everything in the solar system [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=670.52s)]
*  are made of, which we call baryonic matter, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=672.68s)]
*  which jargon for ordinary atomic stuff. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=675.56s)]
*  In addition to the baryons, we also know [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=679.12s)]
*  that there has to be a lot of dark matter, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=681.4000000000001s)]
*  about five times as much mass in dark matter [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=683.9200000000001s)]
*  as in baryons. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=686.6400000000001s)]
*  We don't know what dark matter is, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=688.0s)]
*  but the models require that, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=689.6800000000001s)]
*  the dark matter is required in order for the models to work. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=692.84s)]
*  And then there's also something called [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=696.6s)]
*  the cosmological constant that was inferred [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=697.84s)]
*  in the late 1990s, but we now also understand [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=700.7600000000001s)]
*  from the models that we have for these fluctuations [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  that it has to be there. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=706.4000000000001s)]
*  And then the cosmological constant is something [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=707.5600000000001s)]
*  we don't really know what it is, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=709.48s)]
*  but in some sense, it's some energy density [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=710.8s)]
*  that pervades all of space. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  So we have this great model, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=715.92s)]
*  explains the origin of the universe, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=717.9599999999999s)]
*  why the expansion of the universe. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=720.12s)]
*  We have some ideas about why it's expanding, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=722.92s)]
*  although those are not fully formed yet, I would say. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=726.3199999999999s)]
*  You mean what started it in some sense. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=730.28s)]
*  Yeah, what set it in motion. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  The good news for you is that I have a future upcoming podcast [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=733.3599999999999s)]
*  about what happened near the Big Bang, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=736.24s)]
*  so you don't have to worry about that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=737.68s)]
*  Oh really, near the Big Bang. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=739.92s)]
*  What about before the Big Bang? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=741.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's gonna be there. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=742.56s)]
*  Yeah, that should be fun. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=744.8s)]
*  Okay, so we have this great model [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=745.84s)]
*  that explains all this wealth of observations [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=748.6s)]
*  that we have of the galaxy distribution. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=751.84s)]
*  This is millions and millions of galaxies [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=753.36s)]
*  that we've been able to map. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=755.8s)]
*  And the temperature of the cosmic microwave background, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=757.72s)]
*  we've been able to measure it [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=759.96s)]
*  about a million different points of the sky. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=761.36s)]
*  So there's a lot of data. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=763.24s)]
*  It's not just a hand wavy squiggly approximate model. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=765.24s)]
*  It's not like about 3000 miles [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=768.68s)]
*  from New York to Los Angeles. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=770.92s)]
*  It's 3,118,632. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=772.56s)]
*  And it's a really good model. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  And we're really proud of ourselves. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=781.2399999999999s)]
*  I think we should be. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=783.2399999999999s)]
*  Let me pause though for a second [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=784.2399999999999s)]
*  because something sneaked in there [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  that I think is really interesting. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  A lot of people, I'm sure that you get emails from people [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=789.68s)]
*  who have explained away dark matter [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=792.76s)]
*  without being professional scientists, et cetera. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=794.3599999999999s)]
*  And of course, they always concentrate [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=797.4s)]
*  on the rotation curves of spiral galaxies. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=800.0s)]
*  So this idea that the amount, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=803.16s)]
*  the rate at which stars and gas [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  are rotating around the centers of spirals [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=807.52s)]
*  depends on how much mass there is, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=809.6s)]
*  Ordinarily, Vera Rubin and her collaborators proved this. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=812.3199999999999s)]
*  We attribute that to dark matter, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=815.6s)]
*  but it could be something else. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=816.9599999999999s)]
*  But you didn't even mention spiral galaxies. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=818.4399999999999s)]
*  You went right to the microwave background. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=820.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  So I think I did that [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=825.68s)]
*  because I was trying to give you a capsule summary of- [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=827.56s)]
*  No, I like it. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=831.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=832.76s)]
*  The model for the universe, but yes. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=833.5999999999999s)]
*  So the measurements of the cosmic microwave background [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=836.0799999999999s)]
*  and large scale distribution of galaxies [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=838.8s)]
*  that I told you about that implied the existence, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=840.76s)]
*  required the existence of dark matter, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=843.16s)]
*  those happened about 25, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=845.56s)]
*  started happening about 25 years ago. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=847.3199999999999s)]
*  But you are correct that even 20 years before that, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  around 1970, Vera Rubin and her collaborators [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=854.0s)]
*  and a few other people started to realize [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=857.52s)]
*  that most of the matter in the galaxy has to be dark. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=860.2s)]
*  And so we actually had reason to believe, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=865.28s)]
*  you know, we had good reasons to believe [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=867.56s)]
*  that there would be dark matter in the universe [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=869.4s)]
*  even before these large scale structure, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=871.28s)]
*  cosmic microwave background, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=873.68s)]
*  which is what I told you about. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=875.0s)]
*  So in some sense, it wasn't a surprise when that happened, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=876.12s)]
*  but it was a confirmation. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=878.88s)]
*  And it was, you know, gave us much more confident [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=881.24s)]
*  that what we were, that the anomalies that we were seeing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=885.16s)]
*  with galactic rotation curves were actually real [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=888.0s)]
*  and due to some new form of that. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=891.36s)]
*  But the reason why I like to emphasize it [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=893.24s)]
*  is because it does kind of highlight a difference [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=894.72s)]
*  in how the professionals think about this [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=896.96s)]
*  than how we perhaps talk about it to the broader public. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=899.08s)]
*  We, you know, we tend to be historically quasi accurate [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=902.72s)]
*  and we want to give the early people credit. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=906.96s)]
*  So we talk about spiral galaxies, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=908.6s)]
*  but the real reason we are confident [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=910.56s)]
*  that there's something like dark matter [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=913.4799999999999s)]
*  is much more something like some combination [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=914.92s)]
*  of the microwave background radiation, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=917.92s)]
*  large scale structure, things like that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=920.28s)]
*  And so accounting for spiral galaxies [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=921.88s)]
*  doesn't actually get you out of the need for dark matter. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=924.52s)]
*  Accounting for spiral galaxy [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=928.4399999999999s)]
*  does not get you out of the need for dark. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=930.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, that's right. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=932.16s)]
*  If that's right. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=933.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to parse what she said. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=935.1199999999999s)]
*  If there were indeed, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=936.88s)]
*  if somebody had some other explanation [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=938.76s)]
*  for the galactic rotation curve [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=941.4s)]
*  that did not involve dark matter, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=944.48s)]
*  we would still have reason to believe [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=946.4s)]
*  that dark matter exists as of observations [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=947.96s)]
*  of cosmic microwave background and galaxy. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=950.12s)]
*  Right, yeah, sorry to hinder you on that, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=952.88s)]
*  but it is the internet that we're talking to here [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=954.48s)]
*  and there are people out there who have ideas [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=956.36s)]
*  and we love them and we support their efforts, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=959.16s)]
*  but we'd want to be clear about why we believe these things. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=961.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's actually, I mean, it's a good point that you make [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=964.16s)]
*  and I think it's something that we are becoming, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=967.88s)]
*  we've always known but appreciate more in cosmology [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=970.24s)]
*  with time and that is that when we do cosmology, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=973.72s)]
*  it's sort of like archeology or physical anthropology [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=980.4399999999999s)]
*  or paleontology. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=987.28s)]
*  Yes, paleontology. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=989.52s)]
*  I was missing the word there. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=990.88s)]
*  You know, with paleontology, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=994.32s)]
*  what you do is you find bones somewhere [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=996.0s)]
*  and they have these funny looking shapes, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=999.12s)]
*  but you look at them and it's sort of like a puzzle [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1001.28s)]
*  and you sort of try to put the pieces of the puzzle together [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  consistent with what you know about bones [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1006.4s)]
*  of animals that exist. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1009.64s)]
*  So it's a puzzle, but it's also informed by, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1011.64s)]
*  you know, your solution to that puzzle is reformed [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1015.64s)]
*  by other solutions to similar puzzles you have. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1017.84s)]
*  And we do the same thing in cosmology. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1021.2s)]
*  It's very similar, it's not an experimental science. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1024.04s)]
*  Like in paleontology, you don't build a dinosaur, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1026.0s)]
*  although some people are trying. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1029.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1031.16s)]
*  You don't build the dinosaur, you know, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1033.6000000000001s)]
*  we can't alter the system, we just have observations. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1035.28s)]
*  There are things that we find with telescopes. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1038.56s)]
*  And so we try to construct a model that's consistent [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1041.92s)]
*  with the observations and consistent with what we know [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1044.64s)]
*  about the laws of physics. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1047.44s)]
*  And so, you know, if we have a model for galactic rotation [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1049.36s)]
*  that involves something other than dark matter, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1053.28s)]
*  that's a perfectly legitimate thing to try. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1055.36s)]
*  But then you have to ask, is that solution going [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1058.12s)]
*  to be consistent with other things that I said? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1061.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1063.4399999999998s)]
*  And now with cosmology, you know, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1064.28s)]
*  we try to make as many different observations we can, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  try to study as many different systems as we can in detail. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1070.1599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, in some cases, there are things we can try [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1074.2399999999998s)]
*  in the laboratory, but basically in order to actually [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1077.2s)]
*  have confidence in, you know, conclusions that we make, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1080.28s)]
*  in order to, you know, increase our confidence, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1084.24s)]
*  we want to have different measurement [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1086.76s)]
*  and different observations from different systems [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1088.72s)]
*  and different types of observational techniques [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  that then all match and give you a consistent. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1094.28s)]
*  Speaking of which, this dark energy business, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1097.0s)]
*  this cosmological constant business, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1099.6s)]
*  where did we figure out that? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1101.44s)]
*  So the cosmological constant, I mean, the story is [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1103.8400000000001s)]
*  that Einstein had this, you know, realized that there must, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  there might be a cosmological constant, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1113.2800000000002s)]
*  the Einstein equations and called it as Gisplunder, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1114.88s)]
*  whether that's true or not, I don't know. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1117.8400000000001s)]
*  I actually saw the notebook, the page, you know, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1120.48s)]
*  Diana Buchwald, the Einstein papers. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1127.8000000000002s)]
*  So Diana once showed me the actual like notebook pages, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1128.64s)]
*  Einstein's notebook where he was doing the calculation [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1133.56s)]
*  to let him to think of the cosmological constant. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1135.64s)]
*  And it was kind of interesting what she told me. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1139.04s)]
*  It's, she said it's the only case that they have [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1140.64s)]
*  in all of his papers, the only example in all [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1145.32s)]
*  of his papers where he was actually doing [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1147.24s)]
*  a numerical calculation. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1148.68s)]
*  Flugging him in a purse. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1151.48s)]
*  Yeah, he actually like had a graph in those graph paper [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1152.64s)]
*  and he was like trying to calculate the area under the curve. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1156.2s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1159.2s)]
*  He did it by counting the boxes. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1160.04s)]
*  So anyway, you know, the cosmological constant [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1163.56s)]
*  sort of existed as a possible theoretical addition [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1166.68s)]
*  to the basic theory of general relativity [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1171.72s)]
*  for over a hundred years. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1173.84s)]
*  But, you know, the observational evidence [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1177.16s)]
*  that that thing actually exists came about [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1180.08s)]
*  in the late 1990s. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1183.08s)]
*  And you can look in the literature even before [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1184.96s)]
*  the late 1990s, there were people who were sort [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1187.52s)]
*  of speculating that various cosmological observations [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1190.32s)]
*  were better fit with the non-zero cosmological constant. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1193.2s)]
*  But, you know, the real smoking gun was measurements made [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1196.52s)]
*  by two independent groups, the Supernova Cosmology Project [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1200.8799999999999s)]
*  and the- [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1206.92s)]
*  God, I don't know how high Z Supernova team. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1208.16s)]
*  Yes, the high Z Supernova team. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1210.48s)]
*  They sound like the same thing, yeah. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1211.76s)]
*  And so I told, you know, we talked earlier about how [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1214.36s)]
*  every galaxy in the universe is flying apart [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1216.56s)]
*  from every other galaxy. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1218.6s)]
*  And if you think about, you know, a ball [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1220.6799999999998s)]
*  that I throw in the air, if I throw a ball in the air, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1224.8799999999999s)]
*  it goes up, but then experiences the gravitational [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1229.0s)]
*  attraction to the earth. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1232.7199999999998s)]
*  And so even though I throw it up initially [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1234.4399999999998s)]
*  with some large velocity, the velocities flows, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1236.48s)]
*  eventually goes to zero, becomes negative [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1238.8799999999999s)]
*  and then it falls back down. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1241.32s)]
*  Now, if I had a really, really good arm [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1243.8799999999999s)]
*  and I could throw the baseball at a velocity [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1247.52s)]
*  bigger than 11 kilometers per second, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1250.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know what that is in miles. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1253.24s)]
*  If I could throw a ball with a velocity greater [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1254.96s)]
*  than 11 kilometers per second, it would actually escape [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1257.28s)]
*  the gravitational field of the earth. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1259.96s)]
*  It would actually, you know, instead of, you know, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1263.08s)]
*  going up and then flying back, I would actually, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1265.68s)]
*  the ball would actually fly away from the earth [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1268.24s)]
*  and continue flying away from the earth forever. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1270.2s)]
*  But since gravity is a long range interaction, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1272.56s)]
*  a long range attractive interaction, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1275.44s)]
*  even though that baseball was flying away from the earth [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1278.52s)]
*  and would continue to fly away from earth forever, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1282.16s)]
*  the speed at which it does so would be continually decrease. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1285.44s)]
*  So, you know, ordinary gravity, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1290.6000000000001s)]
*  ordinary Newton's gravity suggests that, you know, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1293.04s)]
*  if two galaxies are flying apart from each other, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1296.48s)]
*  the relative speed that they fly apart from each other [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1300.3600000000001s)]
*  should be decreasing with time. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1304.04s)]
*  And that is in fact what was in the standard [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1306.2s)]
*  cosmological model based on Einstein's general relativity [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1308.08s)]
*  with no cosmological constant until the late 1990s. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1311.56s)]
*  And then what happened is that the Hi-Z supernova team [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1315.2s)]
*  and the supernova cosmology project independently [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1317.72s)]
*  actually measured how fast galaxies were moving away [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1320.36s)]
*  from each other. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1323.72s)]
*  And what they found is that the speed at which galaxies [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1325.24s)]
*  are moving away from each other is actually increasing [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1328.48s)]
*  with time rather than decrease. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1331.44s)]
*  And this was Science Magazine's breakthrough of the year [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1334.52s)]
*  in 1998. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1338.16s)]
*  It was completely and utterly shocking [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1340.8400000000001s)]
*  to everybody in physics. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1342.68s)]
*  We knew that general relativity, you know, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1345.5600000000002s)]
*  could allow for the possibility [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1348.64s)]
*  of a non-zero cosmological constant, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1350.64s)]
*  but everybody just assumed that it would be zero [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1352.68s)]
*  because the actual value is something like 0.000 [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  with 120 zeros, one. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1362.12s)]
*  The actual value is extremely, extremely small. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1364.08s)]
*  And physicists don't like extremely small. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1367.56s)]
*  We like one, we like pi, we like 2.3. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1370.6799999999998s)]
*  We don't like extremely small or extremely large. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1377.0s)]
*  So everybody was very, very shocked. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1382.1599999999999s)]
*  I remember being very, very skeptical. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1384.6799999999998s)]
*  People tried to explain it away. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1387.36s)]
*  They tried to suggest that maybe the supernovae themselves [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1389.68s)]
*  were evolving with time. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1392.5600000000002s)]
*  They speculated that maybe light was being absorbed [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1394.2s)]
*  by the more distant supernovae, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1396.6000000000001s)]
*  thus making them look fainter. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1398.0800000000002s)]
*  And, you know, the people in both projects [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1400.5200000000002s)]
*  did a really good job, you know, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1403.44s)]
*  checking all of these things and dispelling, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1404.88s)]
*  you know, all of these possibilities, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1407.76s)]
*  ruling out all these possibilities. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1409.5200000000002s)]
*  And then I became really, really convinced [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1412.5600000000002s)]
*  when the Cosmic Microwave Background Experiments came out [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1414.5600000000002s)]
*  in the early 2000s. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1418.64s)]
*  And, you know, from a completely different type [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1420.5600000000002s)]
*  of measurement, different type of observation, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1422.88s)]
*  they also inferred that there had to be a non-zero value [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1425.44s)]
*  of the cosmological constant. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1427.92s)]
*  Did I answer your question? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1430.88s)]
*  You did, you did. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1432.0800000000002s)]
*  And thus, lambda CDM, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1432.92s)]
*  the Lambda for the Cosmological Constant, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1435.68s)]
*  CDM for Cold Dark Matter, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1437.8400000000001s)]
*  that is the standard target fiducial cosmological model. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1439.0800000000002s)]
*  That is our standard cosmological model. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1443.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't like the name. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1446.0400000000002s)]
*  It's not the sexiest name, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1448.32s)]
*  but, you know, maybe we'll overturn it. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1450.12s)]
*  So that's okay, we can come up with a better name. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1451.56s)]
*  I guess the one other piece of cosmological measurement [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1453.8s)]
*  that I wanted to get on the table [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1459.32s)]
*  was the idea of a baryon acoustic oscillation. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1461.04s)]
*  I think that's probably the trickiest thing [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1464.0s)]
*  for the person on the street to wrap their brains around, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  but apparently very, very important to modern cosmology. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1468.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is the hardest thing to explain, but I'll try. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1471.36s)]
*  So we know from our observations [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1475.24s)]
*  of the cosmic microwave background [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1478.36s)]
*  that the early universe was very, very smooth. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1479.8s)]
*  So I said it was sort of like the surface of a pond [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1484.52s)]
*  on a very calm day. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1487.68s)]
*  But suppose I threw a pebble into that pond. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1490.04s)]
*  There would be a splash, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1495.32s)]
*  but then there would be a wave that propagates out [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1496.76s)]
*  from the place where, you know, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1499.84s)]
*  a circular wave that propagates out. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1501.08s)]
*  From where the pebble landed in the pond. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1505.0s)]
*  And so, you know, that wave expands with time [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1508.04s)]
*  and it's moving at some velocity. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1511.48s)]
*  And at early times, you know, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1514.2s)]
*  if I were to take a snapshot just a few seconds afterwards, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1515.96s)]
*  the circle would be small, that wave would be small. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1518.3999999999999s)]
*  And at later times, that circle, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1521.84s)]
*  that circular wave would be larger. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1524.12s)]
*  Now, I told you that although the early universe [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1526.44s)]
*  was very, very smooth, it was not perfectly smooth. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1529.0s)]
*  And so there were sound waves propagating [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1532.56s)]
*  at the early universe. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1535.56s)]
*  The early universe consisted of this, you know, fluid. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1536.56s)]
*  You know, all the baryons that make up the galaxy [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1539.76s)]
*  and you and me, the sun, all the other stars, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1542.12s)]
*  all those baryons would have made up a fluid [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1544.56s)]
*  in the early universe. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1547.6399999999999s)]
*  If I have a disturbance in the early universe, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1549.4s)]
*  if I were to throw a pebble into the early universe, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1551.4s)]
*  there would be a wave that propagates out [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1554.28s)]
*  at the speed of sound. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1556.12s)]
*  Now, although we don't see an individual such wave, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1557.92s)]
*  what we do see, you know, if I have a pebble in a pond [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1561.32s)]
*  and I throw it in the pond, there will be that circle, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1565.72s)]
*  which is the wave propagating out, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1570.0s)]
*  but there will also still be some bubbling [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1572.56s)]
*  right at the center. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1574.96s)]
*  And so there will actually be a correlation [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1576.6799999999998s)]
*  in the surface height of the water [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1580.12s)]
*  at the center and at the wave, okay? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1583.48s)]
*  So the surface, you know, the surface height [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1587.12s)]
*  far away from the wave is zero. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1590.08s)]
*  The surface height inside the wave is pretty small, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1592.1999999999998s)]
*  but there will be, you know, an increase [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1595.36s)]
*  in the surface height at just this right distance. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1598.52s)]
*  And so when we look at the galaxy distribution, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1601.32s)]
*  we don't see any individual wave, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1603.72s)]
*  but we can measure the probability to find one galaxy [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1605.76s)]
*  at some distance from some other galaxy. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1610.52s)]
*  And if you look at that probability to find one galaxy [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1613.4399999999998s)]
*  at some distance from some other galaxy, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1616.24s)]
*  that probability decreases as you go to larger [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1618.08s)]
*  and larger radii, the excess probability. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1621.24s)]
*  But then it turns out that there's a bump, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1625.48s)]
*  somewhere around 100 megaparsecs. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1627.52s)]
*  And that bump is actually essentially a consequence [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1630.04s)]
*  of these sound waves in the early universe. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1634.6s)]
*  Okay, so it's roughly speaking, metaphorically, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1636.48s)]
*  God threw pebbles at the smooth pond of the early universe [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1639.4399999999998s)]
*  and ripples went out and there's gonna be sort [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1643.1599999999999s)]
*  of a natural correlation length [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1645.68s)]
*  between the different galaxies that we see today [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1647.76s)]
*  because of just the time scales of which everything happened. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1650.0s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1652.8000000000002s)]
*  Good, and that's the baryonic acoustic oscillation BAO. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1654.3200000000002s)]
*  Yep, it's pretty remarkable when you see it in the data. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1658.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1661.4s)]
*  I mean, I mean, this is another example of the whole, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1662.24s)]
*  you know, everything hanging together. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, we had, you know, the cosmic, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1668.44s)]
*  we have the expansion of the universe, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1671.64s)]
*  we have the cosmic microwave background, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1673.4s)]
*  we have these cosmic microwave background fluctuations. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1677.16s)]
*  And I mean, I remember when I was a postdoc [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1680.3200000000002s)]
*  and assistant professor in the mid 1990s, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1684.48s)]
*  people sort of understood that you should also see a bump [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1688.64s)]
*  in the galaxy distribute. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1692.48s)]
*  But I remember thinking that there's no way [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1694.92s)]
*  we'd ever be able to like see, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1697.88s)]
*  it's an interesting theoretical idea, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1699.88s)]
*  but you know, you'd need to, you know, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1701.72s)]
*  measure the positions of God knows how many millions [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1703.88s)]
*  of galaxies to actually ever see this. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1706.92s)]
*  And even so, you know, all kinds of complicated things [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1709.4s)]
*  happen between the big bang and now, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1712.92s)]
*  but it turns out that the model actually works [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1715.56s)]
*  and you actually, you know, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1719.04s)]
*  and we actually do have surveys of millions [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1720.44s)]
*  and millions of galaxies with very well measured position. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1723.4s)]
*  And we see this bump in the galaxy distribute [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1726.92s)]
*  and it's not at all subtle now with current measurements, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1729.6s)]
*  yes, you know, really in your face. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1732.0s)]
*  It's, I mean, we're actually, you know, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1735.8s)]
*  you look at the distribution of galaxies on distant scales [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1737.32s)]
*  of, you know, hundreds of millions of light years [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1741.32s)]
*  and you see the imprint of this physics [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1746.24s)]
*  that we have in our models to describe the early universe. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1751.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, and it's important to emphasize [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1754.76s)]
*  that with both the temperature fluctuations [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1756.1999999999998s)]
*  in the microwave background [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1759.4s)]
*  and with the baryon acoustic oscillations, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1760.5600000000002s)]
*  you are measuring in principle all these parameters [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1762.76s)]
*  like the density of dark matter, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1766.76s)]
*  the density of the cosmological constant, et cetera, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1768.1200000000001s)]
*  but you're not measuring them directly. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1770.2800000000002s)]
*  You're saying that I have a model for everything at once [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1772.0400000000002s)]
*  and I'm gonna make all sorts of predictions [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1775.48s)]
*  and those predictions will depend on the parameters. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1777.48s)]
*  I'm gonna measure some things and then ask [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1779.8400000000001s)]
*  which values of the parameters give me the best fit. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1782.1200000000001s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1785.0s)]
*  So on the one hand, very, very impressive [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1786.6000000000001s)]
*  that the model, the standard model works so well. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1788.32s)]
*  On the other hand, there's a lot of moving parts, right? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1791.8s)]
*  If something doesn't start fitting, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1794.6399999999999s)]
*  then it's not gonna be perfectly obvious where to look. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1796.2s)]
*  Yes, that is correct. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1799.52s)]
*  So another thing I think that's been surprising [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1802.12s)]
*  about our understanding, our evolution [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1803.9199999999998s)]
*  of the understanding of the universe [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1806.56s)]
*  is that the universe has turned out [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1810.12s)]
*  for reasons we probably don't fully understand [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1814.08s)]
*  to be a much simpler system than anyone might have surmised. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1816.52s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1821.44s)]
*  We measure the distribution of bazillions of galaxies. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1822.4s)]
*  We measure the distribution of millions, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1826.44s)]
*  the temperature of the cosmic microwave background [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1829.04s)]
*  over millions of points on the sky. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1831.08s)]
*  It's a really complicated system because galaxies have gas, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1833.68s)]
*  they have stars, they have interaction [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1837.4s)]
*  between outflows from stars that are supernovae that blow up [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1839.84s)]
*  and then pollute the intergalactic medium [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1843.08s)]
*  with heavier elements. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1847.2s)]
*  There's gravity, there's this cosmological constant, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1849.24s)]
*  there's dark matter. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1852.68s)]
*  It turns out to be a very, very complicated, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1854.92s)]
*  seemingly very, very complicated system. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1857.52s)]
*  But it turns out that it's much, when we look at it carefully, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1860.2s)]
*  the system as a whole turns out to be much simpler [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1864.64s)]
*  than anyone might have sort of, you know, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1866.88s)]
*  our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1869.2s)]
*  much more precisely parameterized and specified by the model [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1873.8s)]
*  than is our understanding of the solar system. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1879.9599999999998s)]
*  Even though we live in the solar system, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1883.0s)]
*  have visited parts of it, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1885.8s)]
*  and it's much simpler physics in principle, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1889.72s)]
*  gravity and Kepler's law. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1893.1599999999999s)]
*  So it turns out that you're right. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1895.9199999999998s)]
*  We have all this data, we have all these parameters to turn. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1898.12s)]
*  It seems like it would be a really complicated system. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1902.08s)]
*  It would be hard to have any confidence, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1904.92s)]
*  have much confidence in any individual parameter [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1907.88s)]
*  given that you're trying to simultaneously fit [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1910.88s)]
*  for these other parameters. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1912.8400000000001s)]
*  But it turns out that a model with five parameters [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1914.32s)]
*  can account for it all. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1917.8s)]
*  And I mean, that's been one of the things [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1920.1200000000001s)]
*  that's been so surprising and impressive. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1921.96s)]
*  That one model can explain, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1927.0s)]
*  we'll see the galaxy distribution [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1928.68s)]
*  and the cosmic microwave background. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1930.32s)]
*  Well, that's why we were so proud of ourselves. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1932.8s)]
*  We shouldn't be proud, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1936.08s)]
*  but we should also be interested to see [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1936.92s)]
*  if there's anything weird going on. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1940.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, in terms of weird things that could go on, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1942.44s)]
*  there's like theorists, favorite ideas, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1945.36s)]
*  and then there's what the experimenters [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1947.72s)]
*  actually come back and tell us about. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1949.0s)]
*  What is it like very quickly, I think, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1952.36s)]
*  what are some of the main alternatives [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1955.08s)]
*  in terms of perhaps the physics of dark matter [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1957.76s)]
*  and dark energy that we're trying to test [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1961.16s)]
*  when we do the cosmic experiments? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1962.8s)]
*  Oh, okay, that's a good question. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1965.16s)]
*  So one thing that we do to test the cosmological constant. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1969.48s)]
*  So as we said, the cosmological constant [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1973.8s)]
*  is a very, very strange thing from the point of view [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1975.72s)]
*  of our understanding of fundamental physics. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1978.8400000000001s)]
*  And so one thing that you can wonder [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1983.56s)]
*  is whether the cosmological constant is really constant. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1985.8s)]
*  So it sort of says that there's some mysterious energy [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1989.3999999999999s)]
*  pervading all of space, but you can ask, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1992.6799999999998s)]
*  is that changing with time as the universe expands, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1996.1999999999998s)]
*  or is it really, really constant? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=1999.56s)]
*  And so if your cosmological constant [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2001.36s)]
*  is not really constant, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2003.9599999999998s)]
*  and people have been using the word dark energy [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2006.32s)]
*  in place of cosmological constant, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2009.32s)]
*  because the cosmological constant isn't constant, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2011.08s)]
*  then not a good name for it. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2013.6799999999998s)]
*  So you can ask whether the dark energy density [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2015.32s)]
*  is constant in time or evolving in time. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2018.4s)]
*  There's been a major effort over the past 25 years [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2021.2s)]
*  to try to address this question, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2026.48s)]
*  try to figure out whether the energy density [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2028.48s)]
*  is changing with time or not. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2031.24s)]
*  And that is sort of done with the same types of measurements [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2033.0800000000002s)]
*  that we use to determine the expansion rate, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2036.4s)]
*  and to determine dark matter density, et cetera. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2039.76s)]
*  We have models for how the galaxy distribution, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2043.48s)]
*  the cosmic microwave background should look. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2047.04s)]
*  Those models have incorporated into them [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2049.7599999999998s)]
*  as one ingredient, dark energy. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2053.36s)]
*  In the simplest models, the dark energy, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2055.6s)]
*  the only parameter that we use [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2057.52s)]
*  to describe the dark energy, it's density, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2058.96s)]
*  which we assume to be constant. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2061.52s)]
*  But you can also see what happens if you have a model [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2062.84s)]
*  where the dark energy density evolves with time. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2065.44s)]
*  And so we have parameters now that we can measure [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2068.84s)]
*  for fit from the model, fit from the data with the model [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2072.24s)]
*  to figure out or see if the dark energy density [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2076.6400000000003s)]
*  is evolving with time. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2079.2400000000002s)]
*  With dark matter, it seems to harder to have [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2081.1600000000003s)]
*  sort of physically plausible modifications, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2084.32s)]
*  but people still do play around with it. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2086.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's actually in some ways a bigger industry. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2089.0400000000004s)]
*  We have no idea what dark matter is. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2093.0s)]
*  The models work very well if we make the simplest assumption [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2096.44s)]
*  that dark matter interacts with itself [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2100.88s)]
*  and with everything else only gravitationally. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2103.32s)]
*  So in other words, dark matter particles [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2106.1200000000003s)]
*  don't scatter from themselves. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2107.8s)]
*  They don't scatter from the ordinary step. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2109.2000000000003s)]
*  But that's an assumption. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2112.6400000000003s)]
*  And again, you can construct more complicated models [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2114.6000000000004s)]
*  where dark matter has some type of interaction with itself [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2117.52s)]
*  or some type of interaction with ordinary matter. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2121.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you can describe those interactions [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2124.0400000000004s)]
*  in terms of parameters that you can then try to fit [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2125.84s)]
*  from the data, from the galaxy distribution, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2128.4s)]
*  cosmic graph background. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2132.16s)]
*  But with dark matter, it's a little, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2133.64s)]
*  we've got a few more possibilities. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2135.64s)]
*  The dark matter is not only out there in the universe, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2138.12s)]
*  it's presumably also in the Milky Way [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2142.0s)]
*  and in the solar system and presumably passing through us [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2145.48s)]
*  here on earth every single day. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2150.56s)]
*  So one of the prevailing ideas for dark matter [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2152.72s)]
*  is that it's a elementary particle [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2156.3599999999997s)]
*  that has a mass of roughly 100 times the proton. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2158.72s)]
*  And it turns out that the dark matter density locally [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2162.3199999999997s)]
*  is roughly half a proton mass per cc. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2165.3599999999997s)]
*  And so what that means is that every time you buy [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2169.3999999999996s)]
*  a liter of milk at the store, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2172.0s)]
*  in addition to your recommended daily allowance of calcium [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2176.04s)]
*  and vitamin D, you are also getting one dark matter particle. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2179.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, if it's axions, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2187.4399999999996s)]
*  you're getting a lot of dark matter particles. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2188.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the question is, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2190.16s)]
*  are you buying it by weight or by? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2192.8s)]
*  So, as I said, the canonical idea for dark matter [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2198.24s)]
*  is that it interacts with nothing else except gravitationally. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2203.68s)]
*  So you don't have to worry about it [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2206.44s)]
*  if it winds up in your milk. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2207.6s)]
*  But if it does have some very weak interaction [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2209.24s)]
*  with ordinary matter, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2212.04s)]
*  then we can construct laboratory detectors [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2213.12s)]
*  to try to see the effects of interactions [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2215.92s)]
*  of these very rare dark matter particles [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2220.3999999999996s)]
*  with ordinary matter. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2222.2s)]
*  So that's a fairly big industry. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2223.9199999999996s)]
*  And so far we have seen zero. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2226.3999999999996s)]
*  But just to emphasize, there's plenty of room [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2231.6s)]
*  for very, very sensible, viable dark matter candidates [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2233.7999999999997s)]
*  that we would not have seen yet. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2237.4399999999996s)]
*  Yes, that is correct. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2239.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's interesting that, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2242.7999999999997s)]
*  I think the people first started to think about [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2247.52s)]
*  elementary particle dark matter [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2251.68s)]
*  seriously about 40, 45 years ago. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2254.6s)]
*  So in the late 1980s, people started to get serious [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2259.84s)]
*  about actually looking for these dark matter particles [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2263.88s)]
*  in the lab. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2266.6s)]
*  And so we've been looking for dark matter particles [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2268.24s)]
*  in the lab for 40 years. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2271.88s)]
*  And during that time, 40 years ago, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2275.12s)]
*  we had predictions, very, very elegant, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2277.7200000000003s)]
*  attractive predictions for what the dark matter should be. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2281.8s)]
*  And many of those models have been ruled up [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2286.1600000000003s)]
*  because we haven't seen them. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2289.84s)]
*  So in some sense, we don't know what dark matter is, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2291.48s)]
*  in some sense a shot in the dark, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2294.6400000000003s)]
*  but we have actually had over the past few decades, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2296.04s)]
*  a number of really intriguing and interesting [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2299.8s)]
*  and promising theoretical models for dark matter. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2302.88s)]
*  And it's interesting that we've been able to rule those out. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2306.04s)]
*  It's dark matter, this is an experimental science. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2310.6800000000003s)]
*  We're not just casting up, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2314.48s)]
*  flailing about completely in the dark. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2316.88s)]
*  That's nice to hear, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2319.6400000000003s)]
*  but it brings us smack into the fact [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2320.48s)]
*  that we do have puzzles that we need to deal with. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2322.96s)]
*  I guess chronologically, the first puzzle [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2327.0s)]
*  that I personally took seriously [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2329.92s)]
*  that is still lingering is the Hubble tension. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2331.8s)]
*  In fact, we had our mutual colleague, Adam Reese, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2335.1200000000003s)]
*  on the podcast talking about it a couple of years ago. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2337.2000000000003s)]
*  So update from a couple of years ago, is it still there? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2339.84s)]
*  Are we still worried about the Hubble tension? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2342.6000000000004s)]
*  What is it? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2344.0400000000004s)]
*  Hubble tension is a big problem. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2346.0800000000004s)]
*  So discussed, we have these models, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2349.28s)]
*  we fit for a bunch of parameters [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2352.6800000000003s)]
*  to try to explain the measurements [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2354.6800000000003s)]
*  in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2356.0800000000004s)]
*  And one of the parameters is the Hubble constant, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2359.08s)]
*  which is the rate at which galaxies [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2361.88s)]
*  are moving apart from each other. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  So essentially measures the speeds [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2367.44s)]
*  at which galaxies are moving apart from each other. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2369.7999999999997s)]
*  And so, the galaxy distribution, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2372.4s)]
*  the cosmic microwave background, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2374.72s)]
*  we don't actually see the universe expanding, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2376.56s)]
*  but this expansion rate is a parameter in the models [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2379.0s)]
*  that we describe the distributions of the galaxy [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2382.0s)]
*  in the cosmic microwave background. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2385.84s)]
*  But alternatively, you can try to measure [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2388.6s)]
*  the Hubble constant directly, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2390.68s)]
*  just like Hubble did a hundred years ago. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2392.68s)]
*  So you can look at some galaxies that are not too far away, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2394.92s)]
*  and you see those galaxies moving away from each other, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2400.16s)]
*  moving away from us, from our galaxy. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2402.64s)]
*  And if you can also figure out the distance, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2405.44s)]
*  then that gives you the Hubble constant. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2408.92s)]
*  So the Hubble constant is the ratio of the velocity [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2411.12s)]
*  which galaxies are moving away from us to their distance. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2413.8399999999997s)]
*  In principle, it's straightforward. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2418.6s)]
*  So measuring the velocity at which galaxies [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2421.0s)]
*  are moving away from each other, from us, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2423.64s)]
*  is actually fairly easy. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2426.08s)]
*  And the reason is the galaxies emit light, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2428.08s)]
*  and some of that light is either absorbed or emitted [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2431.12s)]
*  by various atomic transitions. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2434.36s)]
*  And so there are spectral lines. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2436.44s)]
*  There are lines in the spectrum, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2438.48s)]
*  the frequency spectrum of the light that we see. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2440.48s)]
*  And if the galaxy that's emitting this light [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2442.6s)]
*  is moving away from us, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2444.7599999999998s)]
*  those lines are Doppler shifted to different frequencies [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2446.2000000000003s)]
*  or longer wavelength. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2449.04s)]
*  So the same effect is when an ambulance [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2450.2000000000003s)]
*  is moving away from you, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2452.76s)]
*  it sounds lower pitched than it does when it's towards you. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2454.56s)]
*  So we measure these Doppler shifts, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2458.12s)]
*  we can figure out the velocities very, very well. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2459.48s)]
*  The distances are surprisingly difficult. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2463.52s)]
*  And the reason is that when we look at a galaxy on the sky, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2468.08s)]
*  it has some angular size. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2473.7599999999998s)]
*  And if we knew what the physical size was, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2476.88s)]
*  then we could infer the distance. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2478.84s)]
*  Or if we see a galaxy, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2481.12s)]
*  it has some brightness that we can measure very, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2482.7599999999998s)]
*  very precisely. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2485.08s)]
*  And if we knew exactly how luminous the galaxy was, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2486.3199999999997s)]
*  then we could figure out exactly how far away it was. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2489.2799999999997s)]
*  If I give you a standard flashlight [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2492.04s)]
*  and you shine it at me, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2496.2799999999997s)]
*  I can figure out how far away you are [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2497.7999999999997s)]
*  because I know how bright the flashlight is, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2499.52s)]
*  and how luminous the flashlight is, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2501.2s)]
*  and I can measure how bright it is. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2503.64s)]
*  But galaxies don't all have the same luminosity. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2506.8399999999997s)]
*  And so we can infer the distance [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2510.16s)]
*  just by looking at the luminosity. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2511.8799999999997s)]
*  It turns out though, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2513.7599999999998s)]
*  that there are things called supernovae. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2514.6s)]
*  And in fact, a very specific type of supernova, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2518.24s)]
*  type 1a. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2521.08s)]
*  A type 1a supernova is a white dwarf, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2522.52s)]
*  an exploding white dwarf. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2527.24s)]
*  So what happens is when a star uses up [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2528.64s)]
*  all of its nuclear fuel, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2532.2799999999997s)]
*  it evolves to a state where it's a gravitationally bound star [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2533.68s)]
*  in which there's no nuclear fuel being burned. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2537.08s)]
*  And the star is held up from gravitation collapse [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2540.64s)]
*  by quantum pressure, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2542.8799999999997s)]
*  quantum electron degeneracy pressure. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2546.04s)]
*  But there's a limit as to how massive such a star could be [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2549.12s)]
*  before the gravitational forces overcome [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2553.2799999999997s)]
*  this electron degeneracy pressure. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2556.88s)]
*  And so, if I have a white dwarf [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2558.84s)]
*  that's in a binary with some other star, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2562.0s)]
*  and it's a creating matter from the other star, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2564.2000000000003s)]
*  as soon as that white dwarf exceeds this limit, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2566.56s)]
*  it's called the Chandra-Sekhar limit, it explodes. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2569.2400000000002s)]
*  And since that happens at a very specific type of mass, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2572.48s)]
*  we believe that all of these supernovae [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2578.32s)]
*  are exactly the same. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2581.6400000000003s)]
*  So there's a good theoretical reason [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2583.92s)]
*  to believe all type 1a supernovae have the same luminosity. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2586.12s)]
*  And it's also been measured empirically. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2591.3599999999997s)]
*  You can look at a bunch of supernovae, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2593.2s)]
*  the same galaxy, and they do have the same brightness. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2595.88s)]
*  And so these supernovae are what we call standard candles. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2598.8399999999997s)]
*  They're objects that have a very well-determined luminosity. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2602.48s)]
*  And so if we observe how bright they are, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2606.04s)]
*  we can actually figure out the distance to the supernova [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2608.52s)]
*  and therefore the galaxy that hosts it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2611.0s)]
*  So there has been a project that's been going on [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2613.84s)]
*  for 15-ish years called the Shoes Collaboration, SH0ES. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2616.48s)]
*  And there's also been another collaboration [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2624.56s)]
*  called the Caltech Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Project, CCHP. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2627.24s)]
*  And they've been measuring the Hubble constant in this way. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2633.44s)]
*  They've been looking at supernovae in distant galaxies [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2635.8s)]
*  and measuring the brightnesses of the supernovae [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2639.24s)]
*  and the velocities in which the galaxies are moving. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2641.4s)]
*  And when they do these measurements, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2644.92s)]
*  especially the Shoes Collaboration, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2646.44s)]
*  they find that the expansion rate is about 10% larger [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2648.08s)]
*  than the expansion rate you'd infer [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2653.7200000000003s)]
*  from the cosmic microwave background in galaxy search [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2655.12s)]
*  and our models to account for them. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2657.96s)]
*  And we call it the Hubble tension [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2662.1600000000003s)]
*  because when this was first noticed, it was a discrepancy, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2663.96s)]
*  but it wasn't clear whether it was [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2666.84s)]
*  statistically significant or not. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2668.28s)]
*  It also wasn't clear whether it was maybe [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2672.08s)]
*  some misunderstanding of how supernovae work [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2674.16s)]
*  or how the observations work [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2678.08s)]
*  or perhaps some problem with the calibration [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2679.68s)]
*  of the distances and brightnesses. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2682.72s)]
*  But things have evolved with time. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2686.2s)]
*  The measurements have become better. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2688.16s)]
*  There have been more of them. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2689.8799999999997s)]
*  And the error bars have shrunk. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2691.4799999999996s)]
*  And many of the systematic effects [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2693.6s)]
*  that people were concerned about 10 years ago [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2695.68s)]
*  have been shown to be of no concern [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2697.8399999999997s)]
*  to the source of the discrepancy. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2700.32s)]
*  And if anything, things got, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2702.36s)]
*  the Hubble tension became much more serious [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2704.96s)]
*  just a few years ago with the launch of JWST. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2707.0s)]
*  So until I would say three years ago, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2710.36s)]
*  it was reasonable to be skeptical [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2713.4s)]
*  about the brightnesses of the supernovae. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2716.96s)]
*  And the reason is that the supernovae brightnesses [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2720.32s)]
*  are calibrated to things called Cepheid variables, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2723.6400000000003s)]
*  which are variable stars. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2726.36s)]
*  They're stars that become brighter and dimmer [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2728.92s)]
*  over timescales of weeks to months. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2731.08s)]
*  And Cepheid variables are also standard can. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2734.36s)]
*  And so we have Cepheid variables in the nearby, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2739.12s)]
*  in the Milky Way, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2742.2400000000002s)]
*  and we can measure their distances very well. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2743.36s)]
*  And then there's some Cepheid variables in nearby galaxy [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2746.56s)]
*  that also host supernovae. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2749.6800000000003s)]
*  There are about 40 such galaxies [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2751.08s)]
*  that host Cepheid variables [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2753.56s)]
*  that we've observed very well and supernovae. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2755.2400000000002s)]
*  So the supernova distances are calibrated [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2759.6800000000003s)]
*  to the Cepheid variables. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2761.7200000000003s)]
*  And the Cepheid variables then [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2765.44s)]
*  are what we're calibrating against. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2768.36s)]
*  So when you look at a Cepheid variable [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2770.6800000000003s)]
*  in one of these nearby galaxies, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2772.5600000000004s)]
*  if you look at it with the Hubble Space Telescope, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2775.0s)]
*  which was the best instrument that we had [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2776.92s)]
*  for doing these measurements, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2778.52s)]
*  the angular resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2780.5600000000004s)]
*  is great, but not perfect. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2784.0s)]
*  And in many cases, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2787.0s)]
*  when you were looking at one of these Cepheid variables, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2788.4s)]
*  there'd be light from nearby stars [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2791.24s)]
*  that would sort of spill over [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2793.36s)]
*  onto the Cepheid variable limit. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2794.76s)]
*  So this was something [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2798.16s)]
*  that you might be reasonably concerned about. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2799.16s)]
*  Can we actually separate the light from the Cepheid variable [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2800.84s)]
*  from the light from nearby stars [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2804.08s)]
*  well enough to actually tell how bright [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2806.24s)]
*  that Cepheid variable is? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2808.36s)]
*  But now we have the James Webb Space Telescope [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2810.72s)]
*  that launched, what, three years ago now? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2812.96s)]
*  And the James Webb Space Telescope [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2815.4s)]
*  has much better angular resolution [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2817.04s)]
*  than the Hubble Space Telescope does. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2819.32s)]
*  And so you can go back [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2821.36s)]
*  and look at some of the Cepheid variables [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2822.96s)]
*  and do the measurement with this better telescope. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2824.6400000000003s)]
*  And when you do that, there's no issue of crowding. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2827.4s)]
*  The Cepheid variables are very, very well separated [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2829.6s)]
*  from the nearby stars, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2832.04s)]
*  and you can make the measurement. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2833.4s)]
*  And for the 16 such supernovae, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2834.8s)]
*  or sorry, 16 such Cepheid hosts [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2838.4s)]
*  for which they've done this measurement [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2841.6800000000003s)]
*  out of the sample of 45-ish HST hosts, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2843.12s)]
*  the measurements are spot on [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2848.16s)]
*  from what was inferred from HST. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2849.56s)]
*  So this crowding issue is no longer a concern. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2852.08s)]
*  And so the Hubble tension is more serious now [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2858.04s)]
*  than it was three years ago because of this. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2860.88s)]
*  Okay, so unless there's some huge mistake [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2863.48s)]
*  that we are really missing, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2867.92s)]
*  and the experiment is obviously been very good, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2869.2s)]
*  there's a mismatch between the sort of direct local [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2871.56s)]
*  measurements of the expansion rate [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2874.04s)]
*  and the inferred expansion rate we need [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2876.2799999999997s)]
*  to fit the data of like the CMB and the wider models. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2878.52s)]
*  So at a very broad strokes without getting [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2882.04s)]
*  into model building or anything like that, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2884.52s)]
*  but how would we solve this? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2887.12s)]
*  Could we just do, what are we looking for? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2889.96s)]
*  We're looking for something [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2892.52s)]
*  that makes the universe slow down at later times [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2893.36s)]
*  or speeds it up at later times, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2897.04s)]
*  or what is the target here? [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2899.2s)]
*  So the target here is the baryon acoustic oscillation [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2902.04s)]
*  in the cosmic microwave background. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2909.52s)]
*  So we talked about how you see this peak [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2911.68s)]
*  in the correlation function for galaxies at 100 megaparsecs, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2913.8399999999997s)]
*  but you also see this peak [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2917.7999999999997s)]
*  in the cosmic microwave background. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2919.12s)]
*  But you don't measure the physical size of the peak, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2922.16s)]
*  you measure the angular size. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2925.08s)]
*  Same thing with a pond. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2926.7599999999998s)]
*  If you're viewing a pond from some distance [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2927.96s)]
*  and you see the ripples going out, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2931.36s)]
*  you see the waves going out from where you see the pebble, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2933.52s)]
*  you can't tell how big those waves are [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2936.76s)]
*  unless you know how far away you are viewing them from. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2939.76s)]
*  So we measured the angular size of this sound horizon [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2944.32s)]
*  with baryon acoustic oscillation, very, very precisely, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2948.04s)]
*  one part in the 10,000 [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2951.32s)]
*  with cosmic microwave background measurements. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2952.7200000000003s)]
*  And the angular size is the physical size [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2954.96s)]
*  divided by the distance to the cosmic microwave background. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2958.36s)]
*  That angular size is determined from cosmological models [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2961.64s)]
*  that have as their parameters, the Hubble constant, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2966.32s)]
*  the dark matter density, and the baryon density. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2969.44s)]
*  And the dark energy density? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2974.36s)]
*  And the dark energy density, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2975.84s)]
*  and how it evolves with, whether it evolves with time. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2977.2400000000002s)]
*  So the two solutions that people have [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2979.88s)]
*  can be sort of classified into late time solutions [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2982.2s)]
*  and early time solutions. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2984.8s)]
*  So the late time solutions, we sort of change that angle, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2986.04s)]
*  the model predictions for that angle [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2991.1600000000003s)]
*  by changing the distance to the surface of last scatter. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2993.8s)]
*  And that would happen if the expansion rates [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=2997.6400000000003s)]
*  in the recent past was somehow different [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3001.5600000000004s)]
*  than in the standard cosmological. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3004.44s)]
*  Those tend to not work [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3007.28s)]
*  because we can also get a measurement of the Hubble constant [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3008.84s)]
*  from the baryon acoustic oscillation [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3011.1600000000003s)]
*  in the galaxy distribution. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3013.12s)]
*  And that is sort of agrees with what we get [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3015.24s)]
*  from the cosmic microwave background. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3018.2s)]
*  So these late time solution people thought about early on, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3019.72s)]
*  but they don't really work. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3022.92s)]
*  So the other possibility are early time solutions [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3024.48s)]
*  where we somehow change the physical size [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3027.24s)]
*  of the sound horizon in the early universe [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3030.3599999999997s)]
*  and ways to do that. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3033.16s)]
*  And in fact, we have to decrease the physical size [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3034.56s)]
*  of the horizon in the universe [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3037.3199999999997s)]
*  to account for the Hubble tension. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3038.7599999999998s)]
*  And so one idea that people have spent a lot of time [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3041.48s)]
*  thinking about is called early dark energy [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3044.4s)]
*  where we have something that's sort of [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3047.2400000000002s)]
*  like a cosmological constant, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3048.56s)]
*  but has a much larger magnitude. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3050.92s)]
*  And it's around only in the early universe [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3053.2s)]
*  for the first half million years of the universe, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3056.0s)]
*  and then somehow decays away. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3058.68s)]
*  And people spend a lot of time thinking about these [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3061.48s)]
*  from about 2018 until now. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3064.96s)]
*  And I'd say, you know, initially we were thought of [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3069.44s)]
*  as a promising idea. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3074.0s)]
*  You were one of these people, by the way. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3075.76s)]
*  I was one of these people. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3077.32s)]
*  And in 2021, there was this very interesting result [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3080.52s)]
*  from one of the cosmic microwave background collaborations, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3084.16s)]
*  the ACT Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3086.88s)]
*  They published a paper late 2021, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3090.76s)]
*  where they said that their new measurements [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3093.4s)]
*  were actually more consistent with the early dark energy [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3095.12s)]
*  model than the standard of the CDM. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3097.44s)]
*  And that was very exciting. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3100.0s)]
*  Not at all excited. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3101.28s)]
*  And that got people even more revved up [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3102.6s)]
*  about early dark energy models. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3104.64s)]
*  There was more, you know, another round of model building, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3106.2400000000002s)]
*  but then also more scrutiny from experiments. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3109.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think, you know, that was four years ago, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3112.04s)]
*  three and a half years ago. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3116.04s)]
*  And over the past three and a half years, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3117.68s)]
*  we've had more measurements from the cosmic microwave [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3119.44s)]
*  background, from galaxy surveys, more data, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3121.7200000000003s)]
*  more scrutiny of the data. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3124.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think the pendulum is swinging back to lambda CDM [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3125.96s)]
*  away from early dark energy. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3131.2s)]
*  So it sounds like there's two options, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3133.32s)]
*  late time solutions and early time solutions, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3135.28s)]
*  and neither one of them work. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3137.88s)]
*  That is a, I would say, fair summer with the situation. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3139.68s)]
*  So it's very different, just again, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3143.7200000000003s)]
*  for the sort of non-experts here. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3145.36s)]
*  In 1998, when people claimed, when the two teams claimed [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3147.44s)]
*  that the universe is accelerating [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3151.08s)]
*  and that was an anomaly, et cetera, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3152.7200000000003s)]
*  there was instantly a theory that explained it. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3154.96s)]
*  And everyone could say, oh, OK, so we found this thing. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3157.04s)]
*  Here we have an anomaly. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3159.76s)]
*  And my impression is it's still not [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3161.16s)]
*  clear what could explain it. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3163.64s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3165.88s)]
*  I mean, early dark energy was a really very plausible idea [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3167.28s)]
*  until just a few years ago. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3173.56s)]
*  And I would not say that it's ruled out, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3175.44s)]
*  because early dark energy is not a model. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3178.08s)]
*  It's sort of a class of models or an idea [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3180.32s)]
*  that can go into models. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3183.04s)]
*  But what's happened is with new data that is increasingly [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3185.6s)]
*  more consistent with lambda CDM, the wiggle room [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3190.4s)]
*  for constructing early dark energy models has decreased. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3193.44s)]
*  And it becomes harder and harder to find some model that actually [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3196.44s)]
*  works. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3200.24s)]
*  So but your summary, yes, is probably [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3201.04s)]
*  the first approximation correct. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3205.0s)]
*  The simplest late time models don't work. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3207.36s)]
*  The simplest early time models don't work. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3209.0s)]
*  But it's even sort of a, yeah, I think [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3212.0s)]
*  if you had Adam on your podcast, I mean, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3215.68s)]
*  what Adam would say if he were here [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3217.84s)]
*  is that the evidence for the Hubble tension [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3220.36s)]
*  is now much stronger than the evidence [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3223.2s)]
*  they had for accelerated expansion in the late 90s. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3226.0s)]
*  But people are much more reluctant to accept this, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3231.24s)]
*  because we don't have a model to explain it. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3234.36s)]
*  So interestingly enough, if it was the other way around, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3237.2s)]
*  so if the cosmic microwave background was giving us [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3241.28s)]
*  a Hubble constant that was 10% bigger than that from supernovae, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3245.48s)]
*  then we would just change our dark energy model. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3250.28s)]
*  So we'd say it was time evolving dark energy. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3255.48s)]
*  Given that the Hubble constant from supernovae [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3258.84s)]
*  is larger than that infer from CMB, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3261.92s)]
*  the same solution could also be tried. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3264.6800000000003s)]
*  But it would require a dark energy density that [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3266.96s)]
*  increases with time rather than decreases. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3270.28s)]
*  And decreasing with time is OK, because the energy [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3273.36s)]
*  can go somewhere else. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3279.0800000000004s)]
*  But in order to have a dark energy [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3281.36s)]
*  density that increases with time is sort of equivalent [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3282.7200000000003s)]
*  to having energy just appear out of the vacuum, which is not [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3286.28s)]
*  something that we like. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3291.1600000000003s)]
*  I think about, I think you probably [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3292.7200000000003s)]
*  know this better than I. In the general relativity community, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3294.52s)]
*  it violates the strong energy. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3298.44s)]
*  It violates the weak energy. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3301.2000000000003s)]
*  There we go. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3302.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3303.88s)]
*  I think I learned this from you. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3304.52s)]
*  But I didn't. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3305.8s)]
*  Actually, apparently didn't learn it from you. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3306.32s)]
*  I'm forgetting myself, but it violates. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3309.64s)]
*  But your point is right. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3311.52s)]
*  It's just sort of so magical and scary to have [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3313.16s)]
*  energy appear out of nothing. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3316.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the weak energy condition is [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3318.0s)]
*  general relative for creating energy out of the vacuum, which [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3320.44s)]
*  makes us physicists uncomfortable. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3325.36s)]
*  But the cosmological constant also made us uncomfortable. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3329.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3332.8s)]
*  I mean, to be fair, it's more than uncomfortable. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3333.32s)]
*  When you try to construct a model in which it happens, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3335.04s)]
*  other things tend to go disastrous. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3337.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, our discomfort is not purely emotional and vibe [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3339.28s)]
*  based. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3342.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3343.08s)]
*  OK, I guess I remembering now, and I [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3344.28s)]
*  know that we're running long. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3347.04s)]
*  So let me know if I'm abusing your kindness here. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3348.56s)]
*  But there's another tension even before we [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3352.36s)]
*  get to the variable dark energy stuff. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3355.4s)]
*  There's the S8 tension that cosmologists worry about [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3357.32s)]
*  and has not sunk into the popular imagination. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3360.8s)]
*  Should we worry about that? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3363.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the S8 tension is a little more subtle. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3365.32s)]
*  And I sort of have less confidence in it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3369.0s)]
*  And whether it's a tension or not [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3372.48s)]
*  seems to bounce around a lot more depending on who you ask [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3374.28s)]
*  and which data set. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3377.96s)]
*  And one of the conclusions from the new results [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3379.84s)]
*  that we've seen from the DESI collaboration and the Dark [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3382.92s)]
*  Energy Survey collaboration just last week [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3386.04s)]
*  is that with new data, the S8 tension is going away. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3389.2000000000003s)]
*  So the S8 tension is a discrepancy [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3392.88s)]
*  between the amplitude of fluctuations in galaxy surveys [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3397.08s)]
*  on small distance scales compared [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3402.84s)]
*  with that expected from the cosmic microarray, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3405.1600000000003s)]
*  the models that best fit the cosmic microwave background. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3408.44s)]
*  And it's a strange tension because it sort of depends [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3411.2400000000002s)]
*  on which data set you look at and in some cases [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3415.32s)]
*  how you analyze the data set. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3417.76s)]
*  And there's some measurements that seem to indicate [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3419.88s)]
*  that there's discrepancy, but then other measurements [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3422.2000000000003s)]
*  that indicate that it's not a discrepancy. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3425.16s)]
*  And it also involves measurements or observations [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3428.52s)]
*  of the galaxy distribution on smaller scales [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3431.96s)]
*  where the theory becomes more complicated [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3434.84s)]
*  and we have less confidence. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3437.36s)]
*  So a lot of people in cosmology worry about the S8 tension. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3439.92s)]
*  There's probably less consensus about whether it's there or not. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3443.8s)]
*  And I think it might be going up. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3449.36s)]
*  Well, that's another reason why the Hubble tension hasn't [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3452.36s)]
*  quite been as completely accepted [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3455.6s)]
*  as the accelerating universe because when [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3458.96s)]
*  you find a tension like that, maybe you [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3460.84s)]
*  find other tensions or other signals that kind of go [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3462.4s)]
*  in the same direction. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3466.8s)]
*  But rather than building up, we're [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3467.76s)]
*  having other things sort of come and go and waffle around [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3470.2000000000003s)]
*  and nothing quite definitive yet. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3472.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a perfectly reasonable view. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3474.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think 10 years ago, most people [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3482.1600000000003s)]
*  would think that as we analyze more C&B data, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3484.84s)]
*  as we understand the analyses better, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3488.6800000000003s)]
*  and as we understand the supernova [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3491.96s)]
*  and the analyses better, we'll find small errors in one [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3494.64s)]
*  or both that sort of have accrued together [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3500.2s)]
*  or give you some consistency. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3504.08s)]
*  But that has not happened. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3506.8399999999997s)]
*  Not yet happened, yeah. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3508.48s)]
*  OK, you already referred to two new results which [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3510.3199999999997s)]
*  have sadly very similar names, DES and DESI. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3515.0s)]
*  And they're both attempts to measure dark energy. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3520.64s)]
*  And they're both hinting that it is not [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3523.36s)]
*  the cosmological constant. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3525.1600000000003s)]
*  So if true, I have sort of public statements [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3526.36s)]
*  that I'm skeptical that something like that [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3531.28s)]
*  would come to pass. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3533.08s)]
*  But it would be a big deal if it were true. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3534.56s)]
*  I agree. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3537.96s)]
*  I am also skeptical. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3538.44s)]
*  I think sometimes when I'm skeptical, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3542.48s)]
*  I have to try to like dial it back. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3545.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3548.84s)]
*  Because I think often what you find [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3549.76s)]
*  when you study history of science [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3553.44s)]
*  is that major fundamental discoveries are made not just [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3555.32s)]
*  by people who have made really good measurements [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3563.2400000000002s)]
*  and are really good at the analysis, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3565.5600000000004s)]
*  but they're people who have an open mind [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3567.44s)]
*  and will be accepting of the possibility [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3570.4s)]
*  that this might be big. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3574.28s)]
*  We're not as young as we used to be. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3575.84s)]
*  I mean, I think most of us have this attitude [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3577.84s)]
*  that when there's something strange in the data, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3581.08s)]
*  there must have been something that went wrong [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3583.08s)]
*  or we missed it, the Hubble Tents. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3585.1600000000003s)]
*  I think many people have that attitude. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3586.84s)]
*  They're obviously missing something [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3588.84s)]
*  that's supernovae, complicated systems. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3590.44s)]
*  They haven't modeled it correctly. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3592.44s)]
*  Standard cosmological model is fine. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3595.04s)]
*  And if you always have that attitude, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3596.96s)]
*  you'll never discover anything. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3598.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3600.28s)]
*  So what is the new result? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3601.76s)]
*  So the new result is coming from DESI. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3603.8799999999997s)]
*  And then there's sort of consistent information [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3607.7599999999998s)]
*  coming from DES and from various supernova measurements [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3610.68s)]
*  that show that the dark energy density evolving with time. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3615.52s)]
*  And in particular, they show that it is, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3620.9199999999996s)]
*  or has in the recent past been increasing with time. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3624.48s)]
*  So it's a complicated result. It's not hugely [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3628.8399999999997s)]
*  statistically significant, but a little more statistically [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3633.28s)]
*  significant than it was a year ago. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3636.2400000000002s)]
*  But it suggests that the dark energy density [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3639.8s)]
*  was smaller early times, became larger with time, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3642.6400000000003s)]
*  and then fairly recently started to decrease in energy again. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3647.0800000000004s)]
*  So it's a very unusual result. So I would say [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3652.84s)]
*  it's unusual in several ways. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3658.5600000000004s)]
*  The first is that if the dark energy density [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3661.2s)]
*  was evolving with time, that is instant Nobel Prize. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3663.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3667.52s)]
*  And we've been looking for this. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3669.2799999999997s)]
*  So we shouldn't say, can't be right. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3670.6s)]
*  But as we just discussed earlier, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3673.8799999999997s)]
*  the preferred fit suggests that the dark energy density [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3677.3599999999997s)]
*  was increasing with time, which I just learned [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3681.04s)]
*  violates the weak energy condition, which I already [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3683.7599999999998s)]
*  knew is creating energy out of a vacuum, which [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3687.08s)]
*  I'm supposed to keep an open mind to, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3691.0s)]
*  but it's really very, very, very strange, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3692.64s)]
*  from the point of view of theoreticals. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3695.92s)]
*  One has priors. That's OK. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3697.6s)]
*  Your priors are never zero, but they're bigger [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3699.64s)]
*  on some possibilities than others. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3701.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3703.4s)]
*  So I mean, another way of saying it's a sort of higher order [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3704.08s)]
*  in discovery space. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3709.52s)]
*  You know, learning that the dark energy density evolved [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3711.68s)]
*  with time is spectacular enough. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3714.4s)]
*  But then learning that it increases with time, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3717.24s)]
*  like even beyond that. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3719.2s)]
*  So I think the bar for that is even higher than it would be [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3720.8799999999997s)]
*  just for dark evolution. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3723.52s)]
*  What are these experiments? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3725.96s)]
*  What are they measuring? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3727.2s)]
*  So the principal experiment for this [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3729.3199999999997s)]
*  is the DESI collaboration, which stands for Dark Energy [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3731.9199999999996s)]
*  Spectroscopic Instrument, I think. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3735.7599999999998s)]
*  It does. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3738.64s)]
*  That's right. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3739.16s)]
*  I looked it up. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3739.72s)]
*  So this is really a spectacular project, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3742.16s)]
*  where they measure the redshifts and therefore the distances [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3745.68s)]
*  to millions of galaxies over a huge volume of the universe. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3748.92s)]
*  And with these measurements, they [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3753.28s)]
*  can determine the, they can measure [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3755.88s)]
*  the baryon acoustic oscillation feature [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3759.6800000000003s)]
*  at a variety of different redshifts or distance spin. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3762.88s)]
*  So they can measure the angular size of this bump [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3766.16s)]
*  in the clustering, the galaxy clustering. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3772.16s)]
*  They can measure the angular size [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3774.84s)]
*  at a variety of different distances. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3776.48s)]
*  And in that way, they can figure out the expansion rate [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3778.84s)]
*  as a function of redshift or as a function of time. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3784.0s)]
*  And so they can actually see the expansion rate [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3787.2400000000002s)]
*  changing with time in this. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3790.7200000000003s)]
*  So I mean, some of the issues are [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3794.2000000000003s)]
*  that they're splitting all of their galaxy survey [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3796.28s)]
*  into a bunch of different distance bins. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3799.28s)]
*  And so they have bazillions of galaxies, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3801.36s)]
*  but they have six or seven different distances and so on. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3803.4s)]
*  It's been, it's a bazillion divided by six or seven. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3806.56s)]
*  And then the other things that you [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3812.32s)]
*  might be concerned about is that the universe is actually [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3814.68s)]
*  evolving with time. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3817.4s)]
*  And maybe there's something about the properties [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3819.28s)]
*  of the galaxies that they're looking at [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3821.28s)]
*  that are evolving with time. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3823.2s)]
*  And you can read the papers. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3824.88s)]
*  They've got hundreds of pages. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3826.68s)]
*  They spent a huge amount of effort [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3827.96s)]
*  checking for all of these obvious things [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3830.24s)]
*  that you would check for. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3832.28s)]
*  And none of these obvious things that you would check for [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3833.64s)]
*  has shown up. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3835.76s)]
*  But with a result like this, that's so unusual. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3837.7200000000003s)]
*  You really require a higher level degree of scrutiny. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3842.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the way I look at it, I mean, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3847.2000000000003s)]
*  the other thing I should say is that there are also supernova [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3849.0800000000004s)]
*  measurements that are sort of like those, like the genus. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3851.36s)]
*  But they look at supernovae out to larger distances. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3854.6000000000004s)]
*  So they're interested not so much in the expansion rate [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3858.0s)]
*  today, but how it evolves with time. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3861.28s)]
*  So they're doing sort of complementary measurements. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3864.2s)]
*  They're sort of doing the same thing that DESI [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3867.96s)]
*  is trying to do with the baryonic acoustic oscillation, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3869.72s)]
*  but in a slightly different way. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3872.56s)]
*  And then there's the dark energy survey, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3874.48s)]
*  which doesn't have distances quite as well, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3876.3999999999996s)]
*  but they have tons and tons of galaxies. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3879.12s)]
*  And their measurements are sort of consistent as well. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3882.0s)]
*  Consistent with the DESI results of the time-dependent dark. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3887.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they can't really determine the time evolution [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3891.24s)]
*  of the dark energy quite as well, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3894.64s)]
*  but there are other places where their observations overlap [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3896.04s)]
*  with DESI's observation. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3899.64s)]
*  And in places where they overlap, there's consistent. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3901.3599999999997s)]
*  So I think the way I look at it is [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3905.4399999999996s)]
*  that DESI has shown that these galaxy surveys can [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3908.52s)]
*  be extremely powerful. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3912.9599999999996s)]
*  They can work. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3914.4399999999996s)]
*  And the other thing that's important to notice, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3916.68s)]
*  that DESI is not the last such project. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3918.64s)]
*  We've got the Rubin Observatory that's [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3920.96s)]
*  going to start taking data any day now. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3922.92s)]
*  And they're going to do analogous things [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3925.56s)]
*  over huge volumes. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3928.7200000000003s)]
*  That's a big ground-based telescope. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3929.84s)]
*  Ground-based telescope. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3931.4s)]
*  There's then the European Space Agency [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3932.76s)]
*  last year launched Euclid, which is a space-based. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3936.12s)]
*  They're going to do a space-based galaxy survey. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3939.16s)]
*  And there's then NASA's Roman Space Telescope, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3943.08s)]
*  which will also be launching soon. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3946.36s)]
*  And that's going to also do a huge galaxy [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3947.88s)]
*  survey from space. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3950.32s)]
*  And all these projects have some overlap, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3951.84s)]
*  but they also have complementarities. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3953.8s)]
*  They check different things. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3955.6800000000003s)]
*  They will be affected by different types [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3957.0s)]
*  of systematic artifacts. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3958.6800000000003s)]
*  They have different ways of observing [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3960.0800000000004s)]
*  the same galaxy populations. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3961.7200000000003s)]
*  And they also have access to slightly different galaxy [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3963.44s)]
*  populations. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3965.52s)]
*  And also two weeks ago, NASA launched [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3966.96s)]
*  a project called Spheerex, which is going to have [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3969.2000000000003s)]
*  some galaxy mapping capabilities. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3971.6400000000003s)]
*  And so the way that I look at it is that these projects can [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3974.7200000000003s)]
*  work. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3977.96s)]
*  They do work. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3978.72s)]
*  The level of precision that we're getting from them [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3980.64s)]
*  is absolutely stunning and was unimaginable just even 10 years [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3983.8799999999997s)]
*  ago. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3989.7599999999998s)]
*  And the other thing is the DESI results are new. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3992.24s)]
*  And we've always found with new telescopes, projects [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=3995.52s)]
*  in cosmology and astronomy, when you build a new telescope [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4000.48s)]
*  to make new observations, you're learning about the universe [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4004.04s)]
*  and the telescope. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4006.68s)]
*  At the same time. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4008.44s)]
*  And so I think it's going to be really interesting, important, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4010.48s)]
*  and interesting for us to really look [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4013.64s)]
*  at the telescope and the detectors and the analysis [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4016.64s)]
*  pipelines simultaneously with our scrutiny [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4021.32s)]
*  of the cosmological implications. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4025.84s)]
*  And I think that in the process, we'll [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4028.36s)]
*  understand better what's going on. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4032.48s)]
*  And even if it's not time-evolving dark energy, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4034.44s)]
*  it's definitely going to feed into our ability [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4038.04s)]
*  to do these measurements even better in the future. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4039.72s)]
*  I'm sure some people are going to want [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4042.2799999999997s)]
*  to know why we need to build so many different telescopes. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4043.8s)]
*  Why can't JWST do this? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4046.7599999999998s)]
*  But these are experiments designed [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4048.8s)]
*  for different purposes. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4051.16s)]
*  Yeah, so JWST is an absolutely phenomenal instrument. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4052.56s)]
*  Actually, got to see it in the high bay at Lockheed Martin [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4057.44s)]
*  in December of 2019. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4061.4s)]
*  And I was looking at it and watching the videos [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4064.8s)]
*  of how it was going to unfold and unpack. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4067.44s)]
*  And I was thinking, there's no way it's going to work. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4069.44s)]
*  Like, oh my god. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4074.84s)]
*  It was like crazy. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4076.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, as a fact. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4077.96s)]
*  You can't fix it. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4078.96s)]
*  You can't go up and repair it. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4079.76s)]
*  I mean, the fact that it worked and actually worked better [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4081.44s)]
*  than they anticipate in many ways, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4084.96s)]
*  it's actually spectacular. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4087.2400000000002s)]
*  And the images, the things we're finding with it, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4088.6s)]
*  absolutely amazing. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4091.2400000000002s)]
*  But the thing is, JWST is a narrow field of view. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4092.28s)]
*  It's really good for looking at a very small number of objects [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4094.84s)]
*  at very large distances or very faint objects. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4098.6s)]
*  But if we're trying to do cosmology, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4102.12s)]
*  we want to map the distribution of galaxies over as large [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4103.68s)]
*  a volume as we can, so over as much of the sky as we can. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4107.12s)]
*  So it's a different type of telescope. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4109.96s)]
*  And one of the things about the DESI results [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4112.400000000001s)]
*  is it brings home, at least my very, very casual looking [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4116.92s)]
*  at the papers, brings home the fact [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4120.6s)]
*  it really does depend on your model [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4122.5199999999995s)]
*  that you think you're testing when you come across and say, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4124.84s)]
*  here is our result, right? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4127.5599999999995s)]
*  Because if you just fit to there's [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4128.88s)]
*  a constant dark energy, et cetera, you get one result. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4131.639999999999s)]
*  If you say, well, I'm going to let it vary linearly with time, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4134.76s)]
*  you get a different result. If I'm [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4137.36s)]
*  going to let many things happen, you get a different result. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4138.76s)]
*  Is it possible that there's different levels of confidence [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4141.84s)]
*  in the dark energy used to be increasing result [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4145.88s)]
*  and the dark energy is somehow changing result? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4149.6s)]
*  Or do they go hand in hand? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4152.64s)]
*  I'm still trying to understand that. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4156.320000000001s)]
*  So yes, what we do is we construct models. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4158.84s)]
*  And then we fit for the parameters in those models. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4163.72s)]
*  And one of the things I'm trying to understand [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4166.400000000001s)]
*  is that if you take the DESI results [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4168.200000000001s)]
*  and you model them with the standard lambda CDM model, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4171.04s)]
*  my understanding is that actually gives you [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4176.84s)]
*  a pretty good fit. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4178.4s)]
*  And I don't know whether it's, I mean, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4180.44s)]
*  if there was something that was desperately wrong with lambda [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4183.04s)]
*  CDM, then when you tried to fit it with lambda CDM, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4185.679999999999s)]
*  you would get a result that was not, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4189.96s)]
*  that you would not get a good result. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4192.08s)]
*  But my understanding is that they do get a good result [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4194.599999999999s)]
*  with lambda CDM. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4196.759999999999s)]
*  But then if they expand the model parameters, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4198.639999999999s)]
*  so instead of lambda CDM, they have this time evolving dark [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4202.679999999999s)]
*  energy density. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4205.5599999999995s)]
*  So this is a model that now has two additional parameters. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4206.72s)]
*  It has the time evolution. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4209.72s)]
*  And then they have a second parameter, which [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4211.6s)]
*  is the time evolution of the time evolution. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4213.360000000001s)]
*  And when you do that, that model seems [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4215.8s)]
*  to provide a better fit than lambda CDM. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4218.08s)]
*  But I have not yet really understood [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4221.68s)]
*  whether it implies that lambda CDM is not a good thing. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4223.4400000000005s)]
*  And my understanding is also that if they just [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4227.320000000001s)]
*  try to fit a model where you have dark energy that [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4230.04s)]
*  is evolving with time, but has just one parameter model, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4234.32s)]
*  it's just evolving with time. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4238.28s)]
*  You don't have any evolving with the evolving. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4239.48s)]
*  But that also gives you a fit that [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4242.08s)]
*  is consistent with the standard lambda CDM. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4245.28s)]
*  OK. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4248.08s)]
*  Is there any relationship between this result [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4248.92s)]
*  and the Hubble tension? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4253.04s)]
*  Yeah, that is a great question. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4255.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, as I said earlier, we're always looking for consistency. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4258.32s)]
*  There is no obvious way in which this [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4263.76s)]
*  connects with the Hubble tension. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4265.92s)]
*  I mean, I think it would be much more exciting if there was. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4268.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4271.64s)]
*  But it turns out that when you change or expand [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4273.280000000001s)]
*  the model parameter space this particular way, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4276.4400000000005s)]
*  it does not change the Hubble constants [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4279.320000000001s)]
*  inferred from the measurement. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4281.360000000001s)]
*  It does change the upper limit to the trinomas, which [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4284.84s)]
*  is sort of something that has been, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4288.320000000001s)]
*  I think, one of the most exciting things [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4290.360000000001s)]
*  from these results that people have not been paying [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4292.12s)]
*  a whole lot of attention to. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4294.12s)]
*  What is that? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4295.5199999999995s)]
*  Where does that go? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4296.2s)]
*  What does a neutrino have to do with this? [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4297.5199999999995s)]
*  You haven't even mentioned neutrinos yet. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4299.36s)]
*  I haven't even mentioned neutrinos. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4300.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4302.44s)]
*  No one's been mentioning it. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4303.5199999999995s)]
*  So in the standard model of elementary particle physics, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4304.76s)]
*  there are three different types of neutrons, electron, muon, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4309.0s)]
*  and tau-neutron. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4311.64s)]
*  And in the standard model when it [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4312.44s)]
*  was constructed in the early 1970s, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4314.2s)]
*  the neutrinos were thought to be massless. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4316.5199999999995s)]
*  And in the standard model, they are massless. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4318.96s)]
*  They don't weigh anything. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4322.52s)]
*  But then about 20-something years ago, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4324.4400000000005s)]
*  it was discovered that neutrinos actually [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4327.76s)]
*  have a small non-zero mass. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4330.2s)]
*  And so we know now that neutrino masses are not zero, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4333.64s)]
*  but we don't know what they are. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4336.84s)]
*  They're very, very small. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4338.92s)]
*  So we know that they're bigger than zero, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4341.12s)]
*  but they're smaller than some upper limit. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4342.88s)]
*  Those upper limits come from a variety [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4344.72s)]
*  of accelerator experiments and laboratory experiments [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4346.32s)]
*  and beta decay experiments. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4349.400000000001s)]
*  But it turns out that neutrinos, the standard cosmological [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4351.8s)]
*  model predicts that there should be neutrinos running [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4357.4400000000005s)]
*  around the universe, just like there's light and baryons. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4359.6s)]
*  And if the neutrinos have a mass, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4363.2s)]
*  then they would actually contribute something [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4364.88s)]
*  to the cosmological energy density [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4366.84s)]
*  and affect our cosmological models. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4368.72s)]
*  And the measurements that we have now in cosmology [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4372.4800000000005s)]
*  are so precise that the fact that neutrino masses are non-zero [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4374.68s)]
*  actually has to be taken into account. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4380.28s)]
*  And in fact, with our cosmological measurements, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4382.679999999999s)]
*  we now have upper limits to neutrino masses, which [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4385.08s)]
*  are complementary and in some ways better than those [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4388.12s)]
*  that we have from laboratory experiments. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4391.08s)]
*  And one of the things that was really interesting about DESI [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4394.04s)]
*  is that it improves the sensitivity [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4397.84s)]
*  to a non-zero neutrino mass over what we had before. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4400.24s)]
*  So to be clear, are we saying that they have detected? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4405.12s)]
*  If we didn't know that neutrinos had mass, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4409.28s)]
*  would this tell us that they did? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4411.32s)]
*  No, but they have. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4412.92s)]
*  So what they have are upper limits [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4413.96s)]
*  that are starting to distinguish between the two [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4416.5199999999995s)]
*  different neutrino mass scenarios. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4421.12s)]
*  So there are three neutrino masses. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4424.0s)]
*  We've got good reason to believe that all three of them [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4426.32s)]
*  are non-zero. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4428.639999999999s)]
*  We know that two of the masses have some small mass splitting, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4431.24s)]
*  and then another pair of masses has a larger mass splitting. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4435.5599999999995s)]
*  So we don't know how those masses are assigned [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4439.12s)]
*  to the electron muon or tau. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4442.8s)]
*  And we don't know whether there's [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4444.96s)]
*  two lighter states and one heavier state, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4446.599999999999s)]
*  or two heavier states and one lighter state. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4448.84s)]
*  And the DESI results are starting [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4451.28s)]
*  to say that the inverted hierarchy, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4454.08s)]
*  the system with two heavier masses is ruled out. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4457.32s)]
*  OK. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4462.88s)]
*  And this is kind of super useful. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4463.72s)]
*  It's kind of gone under the radar [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4465.92s)]
*  in terms of popular press coverage of the DESI results. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4467.32s)]
*  But it's a really, really impressive accomplishment [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4470.96s)]
*  and could be very important for elementary particle physics. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4474.2s)]
*  So it's a tradition late in the podcast. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4477.8s)]
*  We always get to let our hair down and explore wilder ideas. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4480.28s)]
*  So you've already said that the straightforward fitting [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4484.84s)]
*  the data implies this dark energy increasing [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4488.76s)]
*  for a while in density and then decreasing. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4493.6s)]
*  That's already a very, very wild idea. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4495.92s)]
*  Are there wilder ideas that could fit the data? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4498.120000000001s)]
*  So I'll just tell the audience, back in the day, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4502.200000000001s)]
*  when we were younger than we are now, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4505.0s)]
*  you were involved in a couple of papers [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4507.56s)]
*  establishing the idea of the big rip as a possible future [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4509.8s)]
*  for the universe, right? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4513.240000000001s)]
*  With the dark energy density just going crazy upward [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4514.240000000001s)]
*  in the future. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4517.04s)]
*  And friends of mine and I wrote papers saying first, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4518.52s)]
*  so the technical language we use for increasing energy density [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4522.68s)]
*  is W less than minus 1. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4527.280000000001s)]
*  W is a little parameter, right? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4530.200000000001s)]
*  And if W is less than minus 1 for dark energy, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4532.0s)]
*  then the density goes up. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4534.200000000001s)]
*  So I wrote a paper saying, can W be less than minus 1? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4535.400000000001s)]
*  And we argued probably not. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4539.72s)]
*  But then we wrote a follow-up paper saying, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4541.04s)]
*  could you be tricked into thinking [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4543.0s)]
*  that W is less than minus 1 if gravity were changing [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4545.8s)]
*  its strength over cosmological time? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4549.92s)]
*  And we said, maybe, but it doesn't look very pretty. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4553.6s)]
*  Are people exploring ideas like that, gravity [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4555.88s)]
*  changing its strength? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4558.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know, in the sense that I haven't seen much. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4561.0s)]
*  So in the dark energy literature, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4566.92s)]
*  they're sort of like the early, simplest type dark energy [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4569.320000000001s)]
*  models, which we called, I think you called them quintessence. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4573.12s)]
*  No, that was called the fight. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4575.92s)]
*  All right, you had quintessence in the rest of the whole thing. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4577.72s)]
*  I did have that. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4579.92s)]
*  So there was quintessence, but then there [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4582.32s)]
*  was sort of a wave of alternative gravity [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4583.96s)]
*  models for dark energy. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4586.32s)]
*  I have not seen many of these alternative gravity [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4588.92s)]
*  models showing up in connection with the DESI result. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4592.5599999999995s)]
*  But I don't know if I haven't seen them [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4595.76s)]
*  because they're not there or just haven't noticed. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4597.6s)]
*  They haven't had that long. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4600.5599999999995s)]
*  We like to think that people took a week [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4601.84s)]
*  to write a good paper. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4603.28s)]
*  Well, the DESI results were also around last year. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4604.5599999999995s)]
*  That's true. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4606.8s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4608.44s)]
*  I mean, the crazy idea that I like to think about [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4610.96s)]
*  is oscillating dark energy. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4615.16s)]
*  So there's sort of, I mean, we know [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4618.84s)]
*  that there's a cosmological constant now. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4620.72s)]
*  We have very good reason to believe [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4624.04s)]
*  that there was a period that we call inflation [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4625.4800000000005s)]
*  in the very early universe, which was powered [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4628.12s)]
*  by a non-zero cosmological constant [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4630.24s)]
*  with a very large magnitude that then decayed away. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4632.44s)]
*  And early dark energy also, the early dark energy models [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4636.0s)]
*  also surmise that there's a period [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4641.36s)]
*  of cosmological constant domination half a million years [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4643.28s)]
*  after the Big Bang that then dies away. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4646.92s)]
*  And so people have, over the years, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4649.6s)]
*  considered the possibility that every few logarithmic times [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4652.04s)]
*  in the history of the universe, for some reason [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4658.28s)]
*  there's a cosmological constant that shows up for a little [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4660.52s)]
*  while and then disappears again. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4663.56s)]
*  A cascade of dark energies at different times. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4666.160000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4668.64s)]
*  So there were papers where you would just [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4669.400000000001s)]
*  have essentially just one quintessence model, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4671.320000000001s)]
*  but instead of rolling down a smooth hill, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4673.320000000001s)]
*  it rolled down a bumpy hill. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4676.280000000001s)]
*  That would do that. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4678.0s)]
*  And then there was also this idea called the string axiverse, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4679.68s)]
*  which was quite popular about 15 years ago. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4683.240000000001s)]
*  And the basic idea there is that in string theory, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4686.4400000000005s)]
*  there are, in addition to the fundamental fields responsible [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4689.240000000001s)]
*  for electron and muon and quarks and photons, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4692.88s)]
*  there are many, many, many more fundamental fields. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4697.16s)]
*  And there could be hundreds of them [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4699.4800000000005s)]
*  that they call axion field. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4700.8s)]
*  And it is conceivable that in these scenarios, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4702.84s)]
*  you could have different axion fields sort of randomly [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4706.72s)]
*  becoming dynamically important at different periods [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4709.12s)]
*  in the history of the universe. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4712.72s)]
*  So that's the thing I kind of like to entertain. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4715.8s)]
*  And it kind of fits in to some extent with these DESI results, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4718.36s)]
*  because these scenarios suggest there [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4722.6s)]
*  should be some type of cosmological constant [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4724.56s)]
*  domination that then decays away. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4726.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, in these scenarios, whatever [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4728.88s)]
*  we think is a cosmological constant now [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4730.400000000001s)]
*  will then decay in the near future, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4732.92s)]
*  several billion years from now. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4736.400000000001s)]
*  And the universe will then proceed [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4738.160000000001s)]
*  as if there's no cosmological constant once again. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4740.56s)]
*  And so with DESI, you look at the, I told you, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4744.0s)]
*  the dark energy density is increasing, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4748.4800000000005s)]
*  but now it's decreasing in time. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4750.360000000001s)]
*  So it kind of fits in with that scenario. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4752.5199999999995s)]
*  The only thing that doesn't fit in [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4754.28s)]
*  is the increasing density, which we can't fit, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4755.5599999999995s)]
*  or has not yet been explained. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4758.599999999999s)]
*  But the idea, this is an important one [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4760.5599999999995s)]
*  that we should mention. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4762.44s)]
*  String theorists never liked the idea [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4764.32s)]
*  of a positive cosmological constant. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4766.679999999999s)]
*  That's hard to fit into string theory. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4768.16s)]
*  But zero or negative, they could make their peace with. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4770.799999999999s)]
*  And if the dark energy is evolving, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4775.0s)]
*  and if it's decreasing right now, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4778.0599999999995s)]
*  that is back on the table. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4779.879999999999s)]
*  We could have a big crunch in the future. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4781.2s)]
*  We could have a negative vacuum energy at the end of the day. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4783.36s)]
*  Yep, that is definitely on the table. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4787.04s)]
*  I don't think that those allow for the increased intensity. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4790.44s)]
*  No sensible person allows for that, which is, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4794.76s)]
*  so obviously this motivates people [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4797.599999999999s)]
*  to really get that right. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4800.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4802.28s)]
*  And the final thing then, I will give you a chance [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4803.28s)]
*  to wax eloquent on birefringence, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4806.08s)]
*  because there's been a couple of hints [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4810.32s)]
*  that maybe there is something funny going on [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4814.5599999999995s)]
*  with the polarization of light from the CMB. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4817.2s)]
*  That's the last anomaly that'll lay in front of you. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4819.92s)]
*  Okay, so the cosmic birefringence. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4823.639999999999s)]
*  I learned about from a 1998 paper [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4827.0s)]
*  by Sean Carroll and collaborators, is that right? [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4830.28s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4833.38s)]
*  So your listeners should know [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4834.219999999999s)]
*  that you wrote this spectacular paper in the late 1990s, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4836.0599999999995s)]
*  where you pointed out that there may be some physical models [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4840.0s)]
*  in which light that has a right circular polarization [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4846.16s)]
*  could travel at a slightly different velocity [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4851.72s)]
*  than light with a left circular polarization. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4853.92s)]
*  And if so, a light wave that was linearly polarized [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4856.48s)]
*  would have a linear polarization that rotated [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4860.72s)]
*  with time as it propagated. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4863.2s)]
*  And that is called cosmic birefringence. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4864.84s)]
*  And I wrote a paper a few years after that, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4867.76s)]
*  or the year after that, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4870.76s)]
*  that showed how you could test the scenario [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4871.88s)]
*  by looking at the cosmic microwave background. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4873.92s)]
*  The cosmic microwave background, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4876.52s)]
*  we're looking at light that's been propagating [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4877.72s)]
*  for 14 billion years. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4879.22s)]
*  And so if there's any subtle effects, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4880.4800000000005s)]
*  it would have more time to accrue [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4882.280000000001s)]
*  in the cosmic wave background than anything else. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4883.72s)]
*  And people have been trying to make these measurements [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4886.360000000001s)]
*  with cosmic microwave background experiments since then. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4889.18s)]
*  And there has been some hints in the data [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4892.400000000001s)]
*  that the rotation, that the linear polarization [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4896.72s)]
*  actually does get rotated by 0.3 degrees [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4899.64s)]
*  over 14 billion years. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4903.04s)]
*  I think it's very exciting, very interesting. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4907.320000000001s)]
*  It's a very, very difficult thing [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4910.22s)]
*  to measure from the data though. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4911.68s)]
*  And the primary reason is that it's hard to calibrate [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4914.12s)]
*  the linear polarization. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4919.0s)]
*  So they can measure differences [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4921.0s)]
*  in linear polarization very well. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4923.240000000001s)]
*  If I give you two rays of light that are side by side [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4925.96s)]
*  and ask you what's the difference [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4930.08s)]
*  in the linear polarization, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4931.52s)]
*  you can measure that very well, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4933.3s)]
*  but the absolute linear polarization is harder to get. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4934.8s)]
*  And that's once again, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4938.06s)]
*  because telescopes are complicated things. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4938.9s)]
*  Yes, because telescopes are complicated. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4940.88s)]
*  I mean, it's not, it's a fairly, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4942.88s)]
*  it's just easier to measure the separation [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4946.48s)]
*  often between two points that are nearby [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4948.36s)]
*  than it is to measure the separation [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4951.08s)]
*  of two points that are really far away. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4952.52s)]
*  Okay, that's fair enough. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4954.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's the same thing with polarity. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4955.879999999999s)]
*  But did you notice that ACT, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4957.839999999999s)]
*  the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4960.599999999999s)]
*  also has a tiny little detection of birefringence? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4962.919999999999s)]
*  No, I had not noticed that yet. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4966.5599999999995s)]
*  So the result that you're talking about was from Planck, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4968.36s)]
*  you know, this beautiful all-sky thing. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4971.44s)]
*  And it's like marginally statistically significant. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4974.4s)]
*  And like you say, it's very difficult. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4977.16s)]
*  So people didn't get too excited. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4978.759999999999s)]
*  But the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4981.0s)]
*  which is a ground-based thing, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4982.96s)]
*  you know, they had a recent data release [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4985.16s)]
*  where they said everything fits Lamb's EDM perfectly well, [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4987.04s)]
*  but there is like a two point something sigma detection [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4990.28s)]
*  of birefringence. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4993.92s)]
*  So I hadn't looked at those [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4994.78s)]
*  because I was studying the DESI papers [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4996.32s)]
*  really, really carefully in preparation for this podcast. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=4997.9s)]
*  So I haven't had a chance to dig down deep [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5001.52s)]
*  in those papers yet. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5004.52s)]
*  Well, yeah, I don't know. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5006.16s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5008.2s)]
*  It's interesting, yes. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5009.24s)]
*  I'll have to take a look. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5011.28s)]
*  What are your feelings? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5013.6s)]
*  What are your, this is where we close up. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5014.4400000000005s)]
*  Your final thoughts, like 20 years from now, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5016.04s)]
*  what do you think we'll have landed on? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5019.08s)]
*  Most probably. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5021.08s)]
*  Most probably. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5022.72s)]
*  I think 20 years from now, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5027.56s)]
*  we'll know much more, with much more certainty [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5029.64s)]
*  whether the Hubble tension is real. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5033.6s)]
*  I'm guessing that 20 years from now, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5037.12s)]
*  there'll be new ideas from elementary particle theory [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5039.68s)]
*  and theoretical physics that make a phantom energy [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5044.200000000001s)]
*  much more palatable. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5051.04s)]
*  Phantom energy is the increasing density. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5053.96s)]
*  Yes, WS, increasing energy density, more palatable to us. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5055.68s)]
*  And I'm guessing that we will see dark energy evolution. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5061.52s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5065.92s)]
*  Bull. 20 years. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5067.400000000001s)]
*  Because 20 years, I picked that [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5068.36s)]
*  because we might both still be around. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5069.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5072.4s)]
*  50 years, it's easy to make crazy predictions. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5074.2s)]
*  Well, not only will we still be around, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5076.16s)]
*  but this podcast will still be around. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5077.5599999999995s)]
*  If you're able to turn it on and say, look. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5078.96s)]
*  It's less likely. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5080.799999999999s)]
*  We might have to have a revivification [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5083.16s)]
*  if that's the case. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5085.28s)]
*  All right, well, that's a lot to think about. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5088.16s)]
*  It's kind of good because for a while there, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5090.88s)]
*  it was possible to believe that cosmologists [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5095.4s)]
*  figured it all out, right? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5097.72s)]
*  That we had a theory that fit the data too well, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5099.04s)]
*  but now we're in a more normal science area [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5101.72s)]
*  where there are anomalies [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5104.08s)]
*  and we got to bang our head against them. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5105.64s)]
*  It feels good. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5106.92s)]
*  Yep. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5108.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think the frustrating thing is I've been, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5110.88s)]
*  as you know, I spent a lot of time [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5112.4800000000005s)]
*  working on early dark energy. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5113.52s)]
*  And then I go and give talks. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5116.16s)]
*  I was invited to give talks all the time. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5117.64s)]
*  And at the end people would say, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5118.96s)]
*  well, was it early dark energy? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5120.04s)]
*  And I'd say, well, the measurements we've done [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5121.68s)]
*  in the next few years, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5124.4800000000005s)]
*  if it's really dark energy, we'll know. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5126.360000000001s)]
*  But now, we're like, so what's going on? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5129.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know what to say. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5132.4800000000005s)]
*  I have no idea what's going on. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5134.240000000001s)]
*  It's good for the young people out there. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5135.92s)]
*  There's still a room for a really good idea. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5137.240000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5139.8s)]
*  All right, get to work. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5140.8s)]
*  All right, Mark, Kim, and Kelsey, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc59qzvjRgQ&t=5141.84s)]
