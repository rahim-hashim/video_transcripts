There is an image, especially in Western cultures, of the rugged, authentic, self-made individual choosing how to navigate the intricacies of the social world. But there is no mystical soul within us, manifesting as the immutable essence of self. What we think of as our "self" is shaped by our environment and our genes, and most of all by our interactions with other people. Psychologist Brian Lowery argues for a strong version of this thesis, positing that our sense of self is largely a social construct. We talk about the implications of this idea, and what it means for shifting notions of personal identity.

Brian Lowery received his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of California Los Angeles. He is currently Walter Kenneth Kilpatrick Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford University Graduate School of Business. His new book is Selfless: The Social Creation of "You."

# Mindscape 239 | Brian Lowery on the Social Self
**Mindscape Podcast:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2viJzPDDU8Q)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  Longtime listeners will be aware of my personal point of view on questions of emergence and
*  fundamentality. There are things that are supposed to be fundamental to the universe,
*  ideas, concepts that you cannot do without in discussing the universe at the most comprehensive
*  level. And then there are emergent concepts that are useful to us at maybe a macroscopic
*  level or some other version of analysis. The word useful being very, very important here.
*  You don't just make things up. They have to serve some purpose. Typically in a scientific
*  discussion, the purposes are you can make predictions, they have causal relationships
*  to other things in the world. A table is an emergent concept. It's not anywhere in the
*  standard model of particle physics or anything like that. But by saying there's a table here
*  that conveys a lot of information. I know things like I could put a cup of coffee on it or sit down
*  and read a book in front of it and so on. So when it gets to human level questions like the self,
*  that's something that is a little bit trickier to think about where it is. A more traditional way
*  of thinking about the self would have been that it's very fundamental to what nature is, how the
*  universe works, is that there is an essence of each human being and maybe it changes with time or
*  it evolves, but it's part of them. There are plenty of cultures which think it survives after you die
*  and so forth. I of course do not want to say that. I don't think that the self is fundamental. I think
*  it is very much emergent. But that's not the end of this discussion. When you say okay, something is
*  emergent, there's a lot of questions that get raised by that. Out of what does this concept emerge?
*  Why is it useful? What are the boundaries? How can you improve the definition of it or your
*  understanding of it? With the self, that's going to be an especially tricky thing. So we're going to
*  think about that today with Brian Lowry who's a social psychologist at Stanford University.
*  He's the author of a new book called Selfless, The Social Creation of You. And not to give too much
*  away of it, but his idea, not coming from a physics background of course, kind of comes from the
*  psychology angle here, is what we think of as the self is not immutable. It is not fundamental.
*  It is not absolutely there in some way that can never be changed or our concepts of it
*  can never be updated. Not only, he says, is the idea of the self
*  constructed and emergent, but it is really dependent on other human beings.
*  And so we're going to think about that today. And I think that's a really good point.
*  It is not only dependent and emergent, but it is really dependent on other human beings.
*  It does harken very much back to our recent discussion with Hugo Mercier who says
*  that the reason why we invent reasons and giving reasons for our actions
*  is because we want to offer them up to other humans as reasons to believe something.
*  So what Brian is saying is that our notion of self necessarily
*  involves ideas of other people and how they think about us. If you say
*  you are a physics professor, you attach meaning to that by assuming
*  that your audience knows what it means to be a physics professor, what a professor is, what physics is
*  and so forth, and all the expectations and all of the presumptions that come along with that.
*  And this view gives us the ability to imagine changing
*  the notion of the self. If you want to change your identity, for example, or if you think
*  that your identity is misunderstood and you want to correct those
*  misunderstandings, that is allowed, but communities matter.
*  You can't just do it by yourself. That's the interesting implication of Brian's way of thinking. So we're going to get into it.
*  Occasional reminders, you can support Mindscape on Patreon by going to
*  patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll. Those are the people who get ad-free versions of the podcast

*  Brian Lowery, welcome to the Mindscape
*  podcast. Thanks for having me, Sean.
*  Great to be here. You know, we will get into the issues that you study for a living
*  that you talk about in your new book, Selfless, but I got to start out
*  talking like a physicist, just like you do. I'm a physicist, I'm a physicist, I'm a physicist.
*  Just for a second, because we're talking about the self.
*  The first question is, should we think of the self as part of the fundamental
*  architecture of reality, or is this something that human beings
*  use as a concept that they invent to make sense of the world?
*  Oh, I think of it as a concept they invent to make sense of the world.
*  But who knows, you know?
*  No, that's the right answer. Don't break don't back down that you gave the right answer
*  What I mean is you know back in the day we might have been cartesians and thought that there was uh,
*  You know an essence of our minds that was not our bodies that somehow communicated with it
*  But we're these days were more emergentist constructivists, right? Like somehow this arises out of a whole bunch of things
*  Right. Yeah, I think it's um, I think the self is a social creation and I think that we still
*  underappreciate the extent to which we exist because we're embedded in the social network and the we have there is
*  The self as we understand it
*  Ourselves as we understand them
*  Right. So we even if one didn't think that even if one was not a cartesian dualist
*  You might still have thought that you could think of the self as just
*  Things going on in your brain, but your point is that we need to take the rest of the world into consideration as well
*  Yeah, that I don't think that even if you're a hardcore materialist
*  It's just going on in the brain that without the social interactions without the interactions among
*  Different people you don't get selves is what i'm saying. Yeah
*  Okay, and the the the craziest physics question I have is I mean maybe this isn't even a question
*  But there is a place where this question of what the self is and how it evolves comes up in hardcore physics
*  Which is in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is something that I study for a living
*  You know when you measure a spinning particle many worlds says that if it could be spinning clockwise or counterclockwise
*  There are literally two worlds
*  One of which a version of you sees it spin one way and the other one it sees it spin the other way
*  And there are people who don't like this on the basis of saying yes, but which one is me
*  As if you know, there's an essence of them that has to flow through
*  Somehow and I want to say neither one of them is you we have to update our notions of personal identity in a world
*  Like that, but that's okay
*  Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, you know, I used to be really into
*  theoretical physics too as a lay person part of this reason because it's
*  It's this interesting intersection between
*  the physical world
*  Our understanding of consciousness that's kind of what when you think about the perception the consciousness and the more complex
*  Concept of self they kind of all intersect in what you just described, right?
*  so there is the you know, there's the
*  I guess the ontology the reality of the world
*  Who's to it could be spinning in both ways in one way in one world and one way another world
*  And you could be observing it spin each way in these different worlds
*  But when you say you observe it, what are we talking about? That's when this conscious observation
*  Kind of intersects with this concept of self because now you want to personalize that observation and say it's me or not me
*  Now which me is real like now you're going from
*  conscious
*  You know perception to something deeper which is like personal identity. Yeah
*  now you're saying that people right that's what that's a kind of a leap that people don't understand like
*  Conscious perception to people is not those are not it's not I mean, there's a step between
*  Yeah, that's what I want to say people who want to say, you know
*  The many worlds point of view doesn't comport with my notion of personal identity
*  I want to say your notion of personal identity was never that good
*  Being tied that is I completely agree. Yeah, right good and good
*  So that's thank you for indulging me with that now. We're gonna move much on much more onto your territory here
*  I like the you know how you begin the book or in the book early in the book
*  Talking about the very basic idea of where the self is. I talked recently with
*  Andy Clark who is a philosopher and cognitive scientist who works on the extended mind hypothesis, right?
*  That you know our our notebooks and our computers and our wristwatches are part of our minds and I did ask him
*  I said, yeah, but like I think that I live right behind my eyeballs
*  And you actually have something to say about that. Yeah, you know, it's interesting most healthy individuals have that experience
*  They're like in there and then right behind that with you and just maybe three or four inches behind their eyeballs looking out
*  you know
*  Controlling the machinery of the body. Yeah
*  Obviously, that's not true, right?
*  I mean any anybody listening to this podcast like yeah, that cannot be true
*  Then you have to say like then what is it and as science evolves?
*  I feel like our answers to that have evolved but they still end up being some version of still an essential self in there
*  It's just is the essential self, you know some soul
*  Is the essential self?
*  No brain architecture is it neural pathways?
*  But it's still that's just a way I think for most people to still say the same thing
*  Which is like i'm in there as a soul
*  Um, and and it can extend beyond this physical being too, right?
*  it's something more than this so you get that a little bit with this kind of desire for immortality like uploading the
*  You know your neural pathways your neural network to the cloud as if that would be you right? That's an interesting assumption, right?
*  Are you saying that it wouldn't be you or you're open to think it would not be you would not be you
*  Actually, this is a diversion but this is that's okay
*  That's why we're here
*  I I am fascinated by this idea because I also think it would not be you
*  I have a reason set of reasons for thinking that why would you say it would not be you if you upload yourself into the cloud?
*  Well one I think that you only make sense in the context like your sense of self your identity only makes sense in the context
*  Of other people so you'd have to upload your whole social environment, right?
*  And for that to work and you could argue do that too
*  But you know, there's these interesting philosophical games you're like what if you upload your brain
*  But you don't die you still exist also physically are there to use is that right?
*  And you'd say like that that doesn't sound right. There's something there's something wrong, right?
*  Something is you've got something wrong and the question is what have you got wrong?
*  I think what you've got wrong is the assumption that you exist
*  As a pattern of neural firings or something like that. I don't think that's how we exist
*  Because you want to say that we exist more socially or in a more embodied sense
*  I think I want to say we exist more socially
*  But I also I also think this is a separate issue from I mean a separate point from the point that I make
*  But I also think we exist in an embodied way, too, but that's a I think a separate compelling argument, but it's not my argument
*  I mean, let's go back to the right behind my elbow eyeballs question. Is there a
*  Good reason why I tend to think that I live literally in my head if i'm going to locate myself
*  Is that is that pan cultural is that universal does every human being think that way or do different kinds of people?
*  Think that there is a self that lives somewhere else
*  You know, that's a really good question. So
*  I don't know in terms of the
*  Phenomenology how how much that differs i'm not sure what I what I know that psychologists have studied what differs is how people will
*  How embedded people think they are in the social network how much they think that constitutes who they are that varies?
*  by society
*  Um, but this phenomenology of am I in there?
*  I don't I'm not sure how much that varies
*  But you do mention that there are out of body experiences for which we don't need to violate the laws of physics. It's a
*  It's our brains
*  Giving us the impression that we're not inside our bodies
*  Yeah
*  What I love about that is it also suggests the opposite that our brains might be giving us the perception that we're in there and that
*  might not be true exactly
*  You know, there's these studies where I don't maybe you know these studies where you can create you can reliably create the out-of-body experience
*  um a simple way to do simple but the way one way to do it is to put a vr headset on someone and have
*  Them look at themselves from the backs. They see an image of themselves and you know outside of their body through vr
*  And then you stroke the person's physical back
*  While you stroke the avatar that they're looking at back at the same time and they will start to have a sense that their self
*  In that avatar that's outside of their body that they're looking at
*  so this is a an example we don't need drugs or a sensory deprivation tank you can just
*  Induce the feeling that you're located somewhere other than inside your brain
*  Yeah, and this is the one that people know my guess is if your listeners know
*  Are interested in this they might know of the rubber hand. Oh, yeah
*  I know that one but let's assume we don't yeah
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, so that one is um
*  So you put a hand you put someone's hand kind of below a table that you put a rubber hand where their hand would be
*  Okay, and then you stroke the rubber hand and you see them their rubber hand
*  They have a rubber hand being stroked at the same time. They see they feel their real hand being stroked
*  Right, and then after you've done it for a little bit
*  You go to smash the rubber hand with the hammer and people
*  Yank their hand back because if their hand was going to get smashed because they experience the rubber hand as their hand
*  It's called the rubber hand to lose. Yeah
*  Um, and you can do that with the whole body which is amazing
*  So it suggests that there's a way in which we come to understand
*  our physical body or ourselves being in a body or our body being ours
*  Through these perceptual experiences that it's not just how it is. It's something that our minds have to
*  Learn what strikes me is actually how easy it is to give ourselves the impression that we're
*  Outside our bodies or that our bodies are something else like I would think that that would be
*  Possible but difficult and it's like yeah, it just takes five minutes with a flat with a feather and a hammer
*  Yeah, you know the funny thing is the one I love most is not even these is the
*  Embasement effect where you get people to incorporate someone else's face into their own sense of self
*  How does that work? That one is where you um, it's the same kind of effect except instead of
*  Um, i'm me stroking my hand and a rubber hand or looking at an avatar i'm looking at someone else
*  So we're sitting across tape it from each other. I'm looking at your face your face gets stroked
*  At the same time that I feel my face gets stroked and then later
*  I show you photos
*  And the photo is either a photo of you a photo of me or a photo of us more at differing levels
*  And I ask and I ask you just let me know
*  When you see it when the photo is mostly you versus not mostly you
*  And if you've had simultaneous stroking when the photo is let's say, I don't know. Let's call it
*  50
*  You know 2% you and 48%
*  Me you get it's mostly you but when it's 52% me
*  And 48% you you still think it's mostly you
*  Only if I face have been stroked simultaneously so you start to incorporate the other person's face into your sense
*  of self
*  I see so so there's there's two things going on here. One is just the photos and there is sort of a natural
*  I guess implicitly in what you said, we're pretty good at picking out what it's mostly us if you don't prime us in some way
*  But then you you do this physical action and and it starts blurring a little bit
*  Correct and I just suggest that it's possible to blur right?
*  Like you would think you would never confuse your face with someone else's face and this stroking thing if I stroke you
*  There's a sense that there's some confusion happening if I don't stroke you you've just been looking at this person
*  Then you don't you don't see that effect
*  And all of this the ease of out-of-body experiences and things like that is
*  At least nudging us in the direction of thinking that this the self is something other than absolute and objectively out there in the world
*  Yes, I think so all these things suggest that there's a way in which we are
*  Constructing the self right? It just it's it's not just it isn't just there
*  There's something that's happening right? There's some kind of process by which is being created
*  and I think that you mentioned in the case of the
*  morphing into other people that there might even be a reason why that is the case having to do with
*  closeness to other people empathy something like that
*  Yeah, so they're social psychologists who talk about closeness as figure itself and other
*  Like you can think about like take put aside the stroking and just think about someone who's really close to you in your day-to-day life
*  You spend so much time with them. You get to know them like it at some point closeness is about
*  Incorporating that person's self into your sense of self
*  Right and this sounds and you know in the extreme it seems
*  um
*  Really hard to believe but you can honestly start to confuse yourself with someone else's self, right? You could confuse for example
*  Something happened to someone else you might think it actually happened to you right if you're close enough
*  those sorts of confusions can happen and in some sense because
*  Your cells are being entangled in a particular way. They are coming. They're becoming merged
*  That's one way to understand it
*  Is this related to the very basic psychological phenomenon of people being over sharers or having boundary issues?
*  And maybe maybe all he wants to have balance issues maybe that's what makes humans humans maybe
*  My cat's definitely a boundary issue. So I don't know. I don't think it's exclusively human
*  Okay, so the lesson like you say the the self
*  Maybe it's not only not as objective as we think it's also there's another aspect of that. It's not as immutable
*  as we think the self changes over time and
*  How should we think of ourselves at one time versus another time? Is that something that
*  The psychologist has figured out that question
*  I love that question because my answer is so it's so ridiculous. That's why I love that question
*  I love that question because I think
*  That the self is fluid. This is the most extreme version and I haven't been
*  I'm not the first one to say say this by a long shot like
*  Hume argued there is no self. There's just the illusion of continuity of self, right?
*  That you know, another there is no self we put too much stock in in its continuity for sure
*  The self is constantly shifting. You just don't experience it that way
*  And there are good reasons not to experience it that way. So it's it's useful to have the sense of stability
*  But it could just be wrong. It could just be that's just not true. It's only an illusion
*  I don't know if you know lori paul who is a philosopher we had on the podcast and she studies
*  transformative experiences so the question is how do you make a rational choice if
*  Choosing a certain thing is going to turn you into a different person who has different values
*  Whose whose values should?
*  Rule there. I don't think there's a clear answer there, but it's clearly a fascinating question
*  It is and and you get an easier one too. You don't even need the transformed experience
*  You just need time right there people who do work saying like how how nice are you to your future self?
*  Okay, you don't know who that self will be but you make decisions right now
*  They get to that will affect your future self, right? How do you think about that? What's your responsibility?
*  So that that person that you're not right now, is there a right answer to this question
*  There is please tell me okay
*  Well, I did I heard a talk once by philip zimbardo who famously did the stanford prison experiment and so forth
*  Um, but it was about how people have different attitudes towards time
*  Some people are past oriented present oriented future oriented and his claim was that you could easily test this
*  Psychologically to figure out which one you are and it correlated much more strongly than other
*  psychology test results with
*  Outcomes in life careers you choose things like that and you know, it kind of did
*  Make sense to me like I do care about my future self more about my past self
*  But I think there are definitely people who are the other way around
*  Yeah, you know I
*  Asked a question. I I mean a good thought like how do you think about?
*  How much you value the past versus the present version of your self?
*  Yeah
*  um
*  Yeah, you know, it's an interesting I hadn't thought of it as an individual difference
*  But it is I think that does make a really interesting individual difference
*  so let's move on to the where the rubber hits the road here for you this claim that um
*  The self is very social very created by a community. Um, I mean, let me i'll let you
*  Lay out the basic idea here. I mean
*  I think that intuitively I might have said the self is inside me and there's other things which are interactions with the rest
*  Of the world you want to you want to update us a little bit there?
*  Yeah, I want to say that um
*  I'm gonna say it's a strong social constructionist argument basically
*  So for those of you don't know that it's just the idea that the self is a social construction by which I simply mean
*  that who you are is
*  Created by the interactions you have the relationships you have the people around you
*  um, and so there's not it it pushes against the idea that most of us
*  probably
*  feel or the way we experience ourselves as
*  Essential essentially they are like a soul. I think that's how most of us experience ourselves
*  Like again going back to in there the self but more important like there's a core us
*  Yeah, that was somehow imparted to this physical vessel. I don't know at conception at birth or whenever you think that
*  happened
*  um, and
*  I am pushing against that. I don't think that exists at all. It's not genetics. It's not that doesn't make the self the self. It's
*  The story you were born into
*  Story that came before your birth the culture you exist in the the networks and relationships and people who construct that culture
*  the people who
*  Raise you the friends you've met the relationships you've had all those things are what?
*  End up constituting your unique
*  individual self
*  Is there's is that an extremist version of something for which there's a more wishy-washy version that says that
*  There is something that is purely me inside me and also how that react interacts with the community around me matters
*  yeah, I think that most people probably have some version of there's a
*  Me and interacts with the environment and it's changed by the environment. I think that's that's the most most
*  People's kind of like
*  Reasonable understanding of how it works and I push against that simply because i'm like, okay, tell me that me part what is it?
*  Because if you keep pushing hard on it just starts to I think it starts to crumble a little bit
*  And I think you end up falling back on something like a soul which they don't they would never start with they were like no
*  This is scientific. Like what is it then?
*  It's temperament or it's genetics and you know these these kind of things where i'm like
*  Is that really what you mean by the self and genetics is I think um
*  Oh in particular
*  I think lazy because genetics don't determine what we are
*  I mean, it's maybe it's potentials made. I mean certainly has some effect
*  It's not like i'm denying the importance of biology of genetics, but it's not determinative, right?
*  It's not enough to tell you who a person will be you killed reasons genes that you know
*  Conception of birth and know who they are like that clearly is not how it works
*  So but if you want to say the self then really is socially constructed, you know, how do I?
*  What is the definition of self that we're using here like as opposed to for example identity, you know
*  I might people might want to want to say that their social identity is socially constructed
*  But there's still something inside me that i'm making up
*  Yeah, and I guess again, this is where I I like to ask questions as much as make claims
*  I'm like what tell me what that self is like when you take away all those social identities
*  Like what are we talking about? Like so I just never know what we're talking about. Are we talking about?
*  Even when people say temperament, i'm like you only really mean how that temperament is understood or experienced
*  Right, like you don't you don't mean that temperament per se you mean how it
*  Manifest how it makes you you there's some there's some other there's some interpretation necessary, right?
*  that's what I think anyway, this is my this is this is not i'm not gonna make this as a
*  Um a claim about truth. I'm gonna make this a claim
*  This is like my view of what people actually mean so I could be wrong. Yeah. Oh, we could all be wrong
*  But it does remind me. I hate to keep bringing up old podcasts, but it does remind me of
*  Hugo mercier who we recently had on the podcast who wrote a book with
*  Daniel sperber about
*  Reason and reasons and reasoning and their claim is that the idea of having a reason for doing something
*  Rather than just doing it
*  Uh is uniquely human and uniquely because we want to offer reasons to other people it is uniquely social
*  It's not if we lived completely by ourselves that we would not attach reasons to our actions
*  Yeah, that's that's interesting, you know what I love about
*  These ideas that they they contact so many other ideas, right? So this is like when it's it really is I think we're coming to see
*  the importance of
*  Our social nature and it may be in a different way and I feel like there's something
*  In the air around this a little bit
*  um, and and maybe it's these like huge these big
*  He societal level issues like climate change or the rise of inequality effect on
*  Governance like democracy, right and you look at these big issues now that affecting the world and they seem to revolve around
*  How we engage with each other as human beings, right to some extent. So
*  What do we owe each other?
*  What what do we what role do we have in in affecting other people's lives? It's like moving away from
*  uh rugged individualism
*  Like it just cannot account for or help us solve some of the biggest issues we face today
*  It just doesn't work. I think and so I think we're starting to look and see and understand
*  the degree
*  The depth of the interdependencies
*  Among human beings so you want to say that not only is this sort of more accurate
*  Prescript description of the self but normatively thinking of ourselves this way is going to make us better human beings
*  I would hope so. I mean, you know, I don't have a lot of hope for human beings
*  You know I think
*  If you accept this view
*  That we are
*  Constructing each other
*  And are constructed by others
*  It should change the kind of questions we ask in the kind of society we live in okay is what I would say
*  But there's not this is I don't i'm not utopian
*  I mean in the sense that if we got that there'd be we'd have tons of problems to address and the society would have
*  To shift in so many significant ways that it's hard to even know what problems would arise
*  Right, but I do think that that way of thinking is more
*  Accurate like I do think that that we are the idea that we are
*  individuals who can
*  Make choices that don't affect others. It's just on the face of it not reasonable
*  Well, the other point you made which which I thought was a great one is that the moment we're born
*  We have identities we're embedded in a social matrix and it wasn't our fault, right?
*  Like, you know who we are in many ways is already there and we can't really claim credit or be blamed for it
*  100 I think um, we're trying to
*  What I say is like we're born to a story that's already ongoing
*  Like I think you have the sense like i'm here and now the story starts, right?
*  It's like clearly there was a lot going on before you showed up. You just stepped into something you didn't understand, right?
*  Um, and it's and it's not that's not your responsibility
*  Like you can't you know, you don't determine what's going on before you get here
*  But while you're here, it seems like an interesting
*  Thing to imagine how you can participate in the story
*  and
*  It it becomes operationalized when you just imagine
*  Being asked the question who are you and what are the answers that we give to that? So
*  What what are the answers that people actually give as a psychologist and what are the ones that matter to you?
*  Yeah, so, you know, this is where there's cultural differences
*  So there's a there's studies that look at these questions like I am and you get blanks and and more
*  Individualistic society will say things that are like I am six feet tall. I am, you know, I am
*  Basketball player or whatever is these things that seem very individualistic and then in other societies people say things like I am a son
*  I am a mother, you know
*  I'm a caregiver so things that seem to have more of the social aspect those things that I care about
*  And I think the social ones
*  And I think those are the ones that make us who we are
*  I think
*  saying
*  For example, even when you say something like if I said like i'm six foot tall
*  I think the reason you're saying that is not just to list your absolute height is to say something about your height relative to other people
*  Even there even things that don't seem social. I think really are
*  Capturing something about people's relationship to other people
*  When you think about this stuff, I think you're thinking about others
*  I guess one way to make this real is I've been told that if you're at a party and you meet somebody
*  You're not supposed to ask them. What do you do for a living? That's a boring question
*  There's other questions you should ask but I don't know. I I think that's the most obvious one to ask
*  What are your professional opinion about this?
*  You know, I want to use the thing about it. I think that it's nothing
*  necessarily wrong with the question, but I do think they're more they're
*  More interesting questions to ask
*  Mostly because I think people
*  Separate their professional lives from the rest of their lives in a way that makes the question
*  Makes the answer that people give less interesting right and makes them less interesting to talk to
*  But wait a minute say more about that
*  Because I think that when people think about their work they again because they separate it from their lives and you ask the question
*  What do you do for a living? What they're going to do is like click into this other person that is
*  Um in some sense
*  Separate it from who they believe themselves to be right?
*  Like they're going to tell you about their work life and if they're not excited about that, it's going to be a boring conversation
*  Do you not say that you're a psychology professor when people ask you who you are?
*  Uh, I certainly don't most people are weird when you tell these like that's true
*  Physicist also works for that by the way
*  Um
*  Yeah, you know, I like that, you know, I like that's what I like to ask
*  What are you excited about right now? Okay, that's the most exciting thing going on right now for you
*  Okay
*  That that's that's the kind of question. I like to ask people and and that could be work
*  You know, most people don't respond with that, but it could be work
*  Well, I think and again, this is my physicist training kicking in but I think of this in terms of coarse graining, right?
*  Like if you ask a person who they are
*  There's literally an infinite number of two things they could say and they boil it down to a few pat answers and
*  And what you're aiming for is to give answers that convey the most information in in the fewest words, right and and maybe
*  Thinking of ourselves as socially constructed selves would alter our choice for which
*  Aspects of ourselves really matter
*  Yeah, and I guess the question is like what kind of information do you want? Right? I mean
*  If you want what i'm looking for usually is an opportunity to close the social distance
*  When i'm when i'm meeting someone
*  Right, and by that I mean like I want the opportunity to for them to have an experience of being closer to me
*  Right, and it's got I think that's just a more interesting interaction
*  um, and so it's not necessarily the most information but I would say the
*  I would say the
*  from their perspective
*  The most intimate information they're willing to give me as someone that does okay
*  That's a tricky one. I'm going to start thinking about that. Um
*  I hope no one asks that it might ask me anything episode. What are the most intimate facts about you?
*  If you want to give that you want to give that i'm willing to give yeah
*  They don't have to be that intimate I suppose but but so when I asked about your background for example
*  Right
*  That was a that was an entry point is for you to tell me something about your life or about your music
*  right that that is what i'm doing is saying like how can I
*  Create a sense of closeness quickly, right?
*  How again how does it make it comfortable for you to ask me something personal? I see you're revealing your you're revealing your tricks
*  For the audience listening over audio by background he doesn't mean my personal background
*  He means the the video of the of the office that i'm in right now that we chatted about before we started recording
*  So this is great, I know you I know you move from california to baltimore you do know I know that you're an aspiring bassist
*  I know that you're married. I would probably did not have an office in your previous
*  Your podcasting office in your previous place did not just had one little tiny room that I use for everything
*  Yeah, I know the the the deprivation of it all it was terrible
*  But yeah, okay, I mean it uh
*  I don't know. I mean when I when I think about myself when I give the answers at the party when someone says tell me about yourself
*  To what extent are the answers that i'm going to give?
*  really ones that society has
*  Suggested to me over the years versus things that i've come up with myself
*  Um, I think you're going to give the answer that you feel is most culturally appropriate in that moment
*  Right and so that in that sense it's going to be the that not so much what society tells you you are
*  But what society tells you you should say what matters? Yeah, what society says matters, right?
*  Yeah, because i'm talking to another person I I have an idea of what they would care about and
*  That's going to affect what I tell them. Yeah
*  100 like you're trying what you what human beings are really good at is trying to have smooth interactions with other human beings
*  Are they're good at that really? I've not noticed
*  Yeah
*  I feel like you're really good at this like you have a podcast you're like you're a very personable guy
*  It's like you try to you want to make it work, right?
*  You don't like you don't have to be tough to have a conversation and you want to go smoothly
*  That's what people like that's true. I just it's true. All right, but okay, let's let's uh, raise the stakes a little bit
*  I mean i'm it's a little bit hard for me because I always want to like play the devil's advocate
*  But i'm totally on your side about many of these things
*  So it's always fun to see how it affects how we actually think about issues in the world so
*  Gender is that something that the community just made up?
*  Um, this was a really interesting one
*  This is the one this is the one I love to talk about gender because it's so it's so interesting and it also is the one
*  It's most likely to get me in trouble. Exactly. That's that's
*  Those are ratings cold
*  So look, I think that again biology like humans reproduce sexually
*  So there's just there's just a there is a biological reality underlying sex
*  Gender as I think about it is not that gender is not the biological sex. It's
*  Meaning that we layer a top usually a top biological sex
*  And I think that is a social construction which is different from saying it's not important. It's not saying it's not real
*  And it's not saying that it's um
*  That there's no
*  There are no parameters that have to be respected in the construction of gender, right?
*  But it but I do think that it's much more flexible than most people experience as as being
*  Um that it varies more than people imagine it does and that as societies evolve
*  Our understandings of gender evolve
*  And what does it mean to say that gender is something that society?
*  Uses as a role that you know, what do I have a gender when i'm just by myself or is it only when i'm out there in the world?
*  Um, I think you have a gender when you buy yourself to the extent that you have a self when you buy yourself
*  um, I think that gender is
*  One of the most important ways that society organizes
*  um
*  So yes, well, I think that you have a I don't I think you have a gender when you buy yourself because you have a conception
*  Of self when you're biased when you're by yourself, but that is a function still of your your relationships and interactions you have
*  um
*  I think but I do think
*  Your community constructs gender. So there's a societal construction, but i'd like to be a little bit more nuanced and say a community construction
*  for gender
*  Well, it's it's very
*  Compatible with again bringing up previous podcast conversations with sally hasslinger
*  Who the philosopher who talks a lot about social construction and we talked about gender and her point is just like you said
*  It doesn't mean it's not real, you know when you socially get together and you build a bridge
*  Uh, the bridge is real but you could have built a different bridge, right?
*  You decided to build that bridge rather than a different one and and our notions of gender and other things are similar to that
*  Yeah, i'm the example. I like to use the metaphor i like to use is more money
*  Okay, like it's real. I don't think most people when I say money is not real but money is only it exists as an idea
*  Right, you don't you don't have there's not there's nothing physical. It doesn't require anything physical
*  Um, it's really like it's it's in our interaction and our expectations of each other our beliefs in each other, right?
*  I believe in how others will behave. That's what makes money powerful. It's incredibly powerful, but it's a construction gender
*  I think is like that
*  I love that example because it really relies on sort of a shared set of beliefs and expectations and agreements, right?
*  Like there's and and we don't ever sign a contract, you know, you're not like asked when you're six years old
*  Please agree that a dollar is a dollar or something like that. But like you say you're
*  You have no choice. You're born into this society. There are certain rules and you do play along for the most part
*  And it's I mean it's again
*  Yeah, you come into a story already being told and you understand it's important so you learn its importance and people
*  Teach you what it's important, right? It's not just you just and it's from nowhere. It's like people engage with you in a way that
*  you learn what it means to be a man or a woman I I guess one of the
*  things that people who are on the more
*  socially conservative side of things worry about is the idea that
*  People can just decide what they are they can just decide i'm gonna i'm gonna identify as a dragon
*  or whatever and how
*  Is that just okay? Or is that?
*  So unrealistic that it happens very much. We don't need to worry about it
*  Or what's the give and take between me deciding what I am and society deciding what I am?
*  So this is where it's something for everyone to be mad at me about so
*  So
*  conservatives don't like this idea which I think is funny like being if you're
*  Six two with a beard and a lot of muscles you could be a woman like that
*  That's not problematic from my perspective how the world operates the way the world works
*  At the same time, this is where liberals will be upset with me. No one you just can't just decide
*  That's just not from my perspective. That's just not you don't have to worry about it because it's not possible
*  I can't decide like right now. I I present as a man
*  I think of myself as a man most people I engage with understand me believe me to be a man
*  So it's fine if tomorrow I said I was a woman that would not make me a woman
*  Right. I can't just decide on my own to be a woman, right?
*  This is what it means to be socially constructed and they exist within the community
*  So my community has to accept me as a woman for me to be a woman
*  I'm not a woman until my community accepts me as such
*  I see so that that kind of makes sense to me. I guess
*  one possible loophole there is
*  Uh, what if there was a trans person who identified as a woman but nevertheless still passed as male?
*  Yeah, is that it would be what I don't know seeing when they're passed. This is less important
*  This is we can talk about race too here if they pass as male
*  They're still a man from my perspective
*  Okay
*  Okay, but there but there is another perspective that says inside they're psychologically
*  Identifying as female. Yeah
*  Okay, so this is this is this is where this is the nuance
*  This is where it gets complicated in the i'll give an example about race and then come back to gender. Yeah, good
*  So rachel dolezal the people remember she was this person who was born as a in a white to a white family
*  It's a white girl
*  Identified as black from her
*  What she says like most of her all of her remembered life
*  She thought herself as black and so she started to present as black as well
*  I think was in spokane
*  Really committed to a black community
*  issues of the black community
*  Represented herself as black understood herself as black and then the community saw her and accepted her as black
*  But they didn't know that she was born into a white family as a white girl
*  And then at some point it was discovered that she
*  Born a white person and then the community rejected her claims that she was black
*  Okay
*  So what I say about that is
*  She this is now
*  Psychologically, she was born white so she was white
*  She then became black. She was black
*  And then this is the important part. I'll come back to gender now then she became
*  A white woman that wanted to be black. So she became a not black woman
*  So I wouldn't say she was a white woman. I'd say she's a not black woman
*  and this is important because for my the way I think about it is that's both the your view of yourself and the
*  community view of you when they
*  When they align that that determines what you are not what you would like to be not what they think you are
*  But from our all intents and purposes again, it is a social construction what you are
*  and so when you talk about someone who's like say a trans person who
*  Passes as a man but thinks of themselves as a woman
*  I would say that they they exist in some liminal state when they're in communities that don't see them the way they see themselves
*  They're not really they're not really either one of the things
*  You know on the interontology at that moment. So yeah, I mean it makes perfect sense if we're moving beyond the
*  naive
*  Essentialism about these categories that there are going to be liminal cases edge cases complicated things
*  And and that's fine and it's not a flaw, right?
*  Yeah, like there's you know, there's a place where it's like, I don't know
*  There's monopoly money money people say no what it is in the context of monopoly, right?
*  I mean, it's just like it's a there's a way in which there's these things that are
*  Complex cases if what you require is the
*  Agreement between the conception of self and the internal not internal. This is another thing that gets complicated
*  I don't know how much more what you want, but I want all the details
*  I see that as like
*  Not as a disagreement between yourself
*  and
*  The community but a con of some kind of conflict between communities because that conception of self has to come somewhere
*  Okay
*  right, and so there's a way in which
*  there's some sort of
*  disagreement between
*  Communities that's how I think about it
*  That's a very good point. So we all live in more than one community. So I I keep sometimes saying society, but you are
*  Politely correcting you by saying community and and it matters because
*  We can be different selves in the context of different communities
*  100% this is easy to see right but then you just have to push it once you see the easy case
*  You have to push it to harder ones, which is you're at home for your parent
*  Like that's a very particular identity
*  But if you go out, I don't know you go out for vacation and you leave the kids with your your parents their grandparents
*  It's a different you right or
*  If you're out having drinks with your friends, that might be a very different than you than you at the office
*  The people can understand that that's easy to see
*  You just have to push it a little bit harder to see the point i'm making right
*  but in the
*  social media
*  era
*  Sometimes we cross boundaries as far as the communities are concerned and that gets us in trouble
*  100% I mean
*  We I think we've always crossed boundaries, but they haven't necessarily come into contact as much as they do get in social media
*  um
*  You know people some people live in very different lives in different different communities, right?
*  and social media
*  Has a way of in terms of broadcasting all these lives to similar audiences then you get it you can get in a little bit of trouble
*  And I mean how
*  Prescriptive or normative can we be here?
*  I mean is it is are there right and wrong ways to identify and and shape ourselves?
*  Given what the community is trying to tell us like at some point
*  Can we just say the community wants me to be this but i'm just not going to go alone
*  I don't know
*  This is that's this gets into another really
*  Hairy issue of like free will and I I try to I lied that a little bit we can talk about it
*  but
*  I think let's stay with the gender for a second. I think
*  you can
*  Move between communities and be different selves in those different communities
*  Right, so you might exist in a community that you feel like you don't have control over
*  They refuse to accept your the conception of gender that you prefer
*  And so you you you move into another community will accept that and and you feel more at ease and there are many people who?
*  have that kind of experience so
*  Um, I think we we all move between communities and have different levels of you know comfort in different communities or
*  comfort on different dimensions in some communities than others
*  How does this jive with the idea?
*  Of authenticity. I'm going to bring up yet another recent podcast
*  I don't know why i'm talking so much about the self on these podcasts. Maybe maybe it's an important idea
*  but um, I just talked with sky cleary who is uh,
*  As a historian in some sense of philosophy and she wrote a biography of simone de buvoire
*  Who argues that?
*  We'll find meaning and mattering in our lives by getting in touch with our authentic selves
*  And everything you're telling me calls it to question the idea that there is any such thing or doesn't it?
*  Yeah, it does. I don't I don't know what authenticity means
*  Like I this is one of those things where I I get it. I mean people love the idea of i'm i'm me
*  I'm like my authentic self, right?
*  Well
*  There's a version I just I truly just don't know what they mean. I'm not saying that there's no such thing
*  but the way
*  People talk about it the license of authenticity. I think is is probably
*  not coherent
*  I remember when I took an english class as a sophomore undergraduate and I think we were reading
*  Eugene ianesco or something like that and our professor was talking about the masks that we wear in different situations different social situations and
*  I was you know, I was young and naive at the time
*  I figured that he was going to go on to say
*  So we should remove those masks and be our authentic selves
*  But his actual lesson was you just got to pick the right mask for the right situation
*  There's there's nothing under the mask. It's just a matter of which mask you're putting on that day
*  Yeah, I was gonna you know, I said this in that I also I said this in a recent podcast somewhere
*  It's like it's masks all the way down all the way down
*  Um
*  But but maybe I can
*  Well, let me ask it rather than then state it
*  Is it a coherent thought to say I can choose which mask to wear?
*  That has eye choosing in there and I know that's the free will question, but what you want to do the live, which is fine
*  um
*  I want to say yes, but I think the right answer is no
*  You know, I want to okay
*  I should say this like I experienced like like most people I think in that I have an experience of living behind my eyes
*  too, I have an experience of making all these choices in life and
*  Thinking that my outcomes are affected by the choices I make and feeling constrained by this situation and that if only they'd let me
*  Be my true self. I'd be happier like I have all those experiences. I just don't
*  When I examine them
*  I just don't think that's right. That's certainly how it feels to me
*  Okay, yeah, I don't think that's right
*  But okay. I mean maybe I think it's fine. Something is finally sinking in to my thick skull here
*  So I think I am getting something it might be okay to talk about
*  Desires that I have or wants or aspirations without necessarily connecting them to the idea that they reflect a true self
*  Underneath. I mean I could absolutely say I am not happy in this situation. I would like to change my situation
*  Yeah, I mean like you have experiences you have feelings
*  The question is just like what's the source?
*  Right, and when you locate the source is like some true essential self. I'm like that's probably wrong
*  Hmm, right. That's that's what I'm saying
*  It's I'm not saying you don't have these experiences or you don't have these feelings or you don't have these wants and needs
*  I just think it's really really hard and may be impossible to truly identify
*  Some singular source of those things and certainly if there's a singular source, I don't know as a as a materialist
*  I don't think it's the soul. Yeah. Yeah
*  Is the temptation to
*  Identify some singular source or even just talk about a coherent self
*  More or less a Western slash modern invention or I mean, I know that some people talk about
*  Capitalist societies as being more
*  Individualistic and other societies as being more communal etc
*  I have no way of judging whether that's true or just you know a fun story to tell
*  Yeah, so, you know in the book I talk a little bit about about this that they're
*  Professors of classics who argue that our conception of self is a relatively recent creation that and say
*  classical Greece
*  That there wasn't this sense that that things
*  Emanated from your you know immortal soul, right?
*  Like that you'd have an experience you could say like the gods breathe that into you or what what something something moved you
*  But it wasn't necessarily located in a self
*  And then you look at literature those people point out that there wasn't really a
*  Long after literacy and writing there wasn't a tradition of writing from like a first-person perspective into very very late
*  Like people point to st. Augustine's confessions as the first major
*  Work that takes on a first-person perspective on the world
*  And all that to say they're like no it's not clear that our conception of self is the only one that humans have
*  Have focused on as we look through history
*  So, no, I don't I don't know that this is the only way for us to think and some people also suggest that
*  That this conception of self is individual conception individualistic conception of self is necessary
*  Possibly for a capitalist society. I don't know that you would say the capitalists produced it
*  But they certainly go hand in hand and that if you believe in
*  Free markets as we discussed them now you have to kind of accept or really have deep faith and individual choice
*  And freedom of choice. Well the idea of standard
*  Utilitarianism is that each person has a utility and you add them up and you know
*  There's no sort of nonlinear effects that people can individually be muddling along with society is going great or something like that
*  Yeah, yeah, and this is all right, right and they and the capitalism depends on that as well, right?
*  This is like the the the best for me my own personal greed will somehow
*  End up producing the best output of society
*  And that's the way I see it. I think that's the way I see it
*  For me my own personal greed will somehow
*  End up producing the best outcomes if everyone else asks them their own self-interest as well and self-interest is understood very narrow
*  So I did after while reading your book
*  I googled when was the first first person narrative and of course people don't agree right? There's different claims they never do
*  They never do but at least one of the interesting candidates is the song of songs in the old testament
*  Uh
*  Which interesting it was very interesting to me. I'm not a really an old testament scholar by any stretch
*  But I went and read it. It's like really racy poem. He's two people
*  Like you can see why they don't talk about it very much
*  But it is also
*  In the voices of a man and a woman there's a chorus in the background, right and they're
*  expressing their desires in no uncertain terms and it's uh
*  It's always hard for me to imagine what it was like to be a person living back then like was that considered shocking?
*  Was that you know that that way of talking unusual or was it just an oral tradition that we just don't have any access to these
*  days, I don't know
*  That's the interesting one. I hadn't I hadn't seen that one, but that that makes sense
*  um
*  And also it's hard to know exactly what like I haven't read it
*  I actually read it a long time ago. I've read it recently so I have to go back and look and think is this
*  Is this really first person? Yeah
*  Those details matter like there are people who say that shakespeare invented the concept of a character in literature, which yeah
*  I don't know. That's that might be a stretch but okay. Um, but again one of the ideas that I thought was
*  Provocative that you put forward is that the idea of a self
*  Limits your personal freedom in some way like it
*  Circum scribes certain things that you either can do certain capacities certain privileges you have in the world
*  Tell us about that a little bit
*  Well, i'm curious why I was provocative because once I think I mean sometimes that one seems to me to be almost
*  So obvious is to be uninteresting
*  So the idea see i'll just say the idea and then you can tell me why why it strikes you as provocative the idea is that
*  When we say what we are when we say who we are
*  When we give any definition definition has to include what is inside and what is outside
*  Right, like you have a definition has to exclude as well
*  Even if it does that implicitly and whatever we exclude when we're talking about ourselves is by not by definition
*  A limit on what we are or what we can't be
*  Okay, that makes perfect sense actually when you put it that way
*  But I guess the the provocative aspect of it would have been
*  in my mind that you're sort of attributing these limitations to
*  Selfhood rather than other aspects of our
*  Existence in the world like I don't know it depends on what we I guess if if
*  The self is entirely socially constructed then maybe they all count
*  but I mean obviously how much money I have or
*  My status in society my job those limit what I can do in the world. Yes, but
*  Are those is is the argument going through those being aspects of what is myself?
*  No, not necessarily. I mean sure we could but if you think of yourself as like
*  a dad
*  or if you think of yourself as a man like take gender like by
*  By definition you're accepting limitations, right? And you can see them in your life
*  Like it's not it's not just an abstraction
*  Right, like if you think of yourself a man as a man and you're behaving as a man because that's what in part
*  It requires to understand yourself in that way that there are things you do or things you don't do right now
*  You might have more or less stringent by some people's
*  you know, um
*  Conception ideas of what it means to be a man, but you once you say you're a man you are accepting some kind of
*  limitation
*  I guess the flip side of that is that one reason why people
*  like traditional roles so much
*  Is that it gives them a set of clues as to how to treat people?
*  And and yes it does and how to behave as well, right?
*  I mean, I think I have the chapter called hugs and straitjackets and and this is kind of the point which is
*  We when we think of who we are
*  It's really important for us to maintain that sense of clarity about who we are
*  We think about authenticity people care about it just even though I said, I don't know what it means because it's really like
*  integrity of self it's right like this is who I am it matters to me and
*  That suggests that
*  Those boundaries those limitations are comforting
*  They they give you a place in the world. They tell you what the world looks like. It's a
*  It's a perspective. It's a place to stand. Yeah, it's a place by which you can a
*  Location from which you can make a judgment
*  um
*  About who you are and what the world is and your place and and there's something deeply comforting about that
*  but in that is also
*  limitation, right? Right. I I like that a lot because
*  even though I don't agree with them it helps me understand the
*  Anxiousness on the part of people who really want certain old roles just respected forever
*  I mean it makes your life easy
*  You know the decisions you have to make the way you treat people things like this if there's a if there's a script
*  You can just run and it never deviates
*  Then a lot of your decision making is is made much easier
*  Yes, I mean it's it's it's um
*  It's your decision making is made
*  Much easier and the world is made more sensible
*  Yeah
*  Right, like it's easier to have it's hard to have meaning in a world where you don't where you don't understand your own place in it
*  And when people start to disrupt the nature of that meaning this is this is why I think there's not a live and let
*  live on issues of significant identities, right when people care about
*  Other people being able to change their identities because it says something about
*  Their their their own place in the world, right? I mean people are really committed to having
*  Clarity in terms of how the world operates and their place in it and these identities play a significant role in that
*  Is that something that we should strive?
*  In your in your personal view to get better at to to have a little bit more relaxed point of view with how other people
*  Construe their own identities
*  I think yeah
*  I mean my attitude toward this is like look if someone asks to be something I personally like be saying if you tell me
*  Right now like I think myself as a woman. I'd be like, I'm I'm if that's important to you
*  I'm with you on that like that. That's my personal view. I think it's important that we understand that we are in this together
*  That's what I think is important and
*  That when you ask to be a thing
*  Whatever it is if you think of your when you ask to be a podcaster, right?
*  Like that it's a request that you also understand that request has
*  Consequences for me, right?
*  It's not just what you want to be like what you want to be does affect me
*  And I think there's a loss of or insufficient
*  Understanding on all sides. I think there's a symmetry
*  I think we when we when there are people who are really committed to being a certain thing when we deny them that in some sense
*  We're denying them their sense of humanity. I think that's a bigger
*  Burden to place on someone but it's not the case that it's no burden to ask someone else to accept identities that are
*  Don't align with the way they experience the world
*  Okay, yeah, that's I think that's a perfectly fair point I mean one I don't know this is a trivial or profound example, but
*  Some people get upset when they see other people walking outside in public wearing a mask
*  They think that it is somehow insulting to them
*  which you know
*  I I kind of get it right because it's kind of what what they think is that they're being judged, right?
*  Like they're just walking down the street not wearing a mask and this other person is wearing a mask
*  You might say well let them do whatever they want
*  But in their minds this other person thinks less of them because they're not being as socially conscious or safe by
*  By adopting this practice
*  Yeah, yeah
*  I mean everything that you do is being interpreted by someone else right and
*  In a way that's meaningful from their perspective right not from the world the world is you experience it
*  and so if you wear a mask and
*  I
*  See that as like questioning me like or an easy example
*  It's like your vegetarian go out to eat and you're like, oh I don't eat meat people will feel that it's like questioning
*  Their their their choice to eat meat and yeah, you know, sometimes people will feel uncomfortable with that. Yeah
*  I mean we're all connected in these ways, right?
*  Your choices and your decisions are not somehow irrelevant to mine
*  but but maybe
*  It's getting better in some sense or maybe like we're still struggling to work through these things
*  Another thing I think of which might be a trivial example is that certain conventions or meetings now will have name tags
*  That are color coded, you know, the certain code means
*  I'm happy with physical contact. Give me a hug. Another one says, you know, we can shake hands
*  But don't get too familiar and another color says don't touch me
*  and
*  Some people really get upset at that. They like they mock that they're like, you know
*  Why are you trying to be so explicit about these cultural norms that are supposed to remain unspoken and universal?
*  Yeah, you know, I think there might be differences in the degree of clarity that people want and the degree of
*  Conformity so clearly and I would separate those things like clarity because you can get clarity by having the badges
*  But it suggests a lack of conformity to just like people are making different decisions
*  and
*  um, I think that lack of
*  Conformity can be discomforting as well
*  So let's since we're winding up near the end of the podcast here
*  The other big topic that you sort of just drop in there in the book
*  That I kind of love is the fact that human beings are really aware of our own mortality
*  Yeah, we're gonna die. Yeah, and and we have a
*  understanding of that in a way that at least arguably other animals don't and that affects
*  Who we are and who we want to be and what what we want our legacies to be because we we
*  Unlike other animals have the concept of a legacy
*  So, how does that feed in what what is yeah, what does that have to do with the self?
*  Yeah, so I think of the self is like if you want to have a sense of meaning in life that the self is critical
*  um, and i'll give you quickly a psychologist think about meaning is needing three things one
*  Is coherence?
*  Right, you have to understand the way the world works and a sense of your place in the world
*  It has to make sense world this needs to make sense coherence
*  Another is purpose means like you get up in the morning. You have to have something to do like this purpose
*  The third is significance. Sometimes it's called mattering like you need to you need to believe that what you do
*  Matters beyond the present moment, right?
*  It can't just be it matters now and it's it doesn't matter any any any burden of that
*  And I think the self is critical to the first and the third
*  The self is a way in which we create coherence the world. It's a way that we understand ourselves
*  Which is what obviously is embedded in the word
*  it's almost tautological like we understand a sense of
*  ourselves in the world like who we are
*  Where how we're related to other things and other people?
*  So the self is I think in large part
*  The way that we make sense of the world it's coherence
*  Um, and then in significance and mattering I think is the most interesting because
*  Suggests the self is it's kind of like a time machine
*  So the self allows you to think about how the past is connected to you
*  Right, like the past is not just the past like you could think in terms of your ancestors your history
*  The story of your parents how you came to be all these things are connected to you
*  And it also allows you and this is the part that's really important for
*  Meaning like allows you to project yourself into the future
*  Mm-hmm, right think about how the things you do right now will reverberate even past your death
*  and it allows you to
*  Connect to larger things for example
*  Um, you can feel connected to the nation include that in yourself
*  And then when you physically pass if the nation persists or you believe it will there's a way in which you believe that you will
*  Persist okay, so it allows for this
*  symbolic immortality and so and this is the kind of what the research focuses on the research is
*  Theory called terror management theory focuses on this concept that human beings are where they're all mortality as such
*  They they seek ways to
*  Experience symbolic immortality and one of the ways they do that is by connecting their sense of self
*  to
*  groups ideas that will
*  Live beyond their physical being and you can do things like in experiments where you're about people of their death. They will
*  Tell you that for example their nation will last thousands of years longer than if you don't remind them of their death
*  right these sorts of things where it's it looks like death
*  commits people to
*  Concepts communities that extend their extend their lives symbolic looks like I like the name
*  terror management theory it makes it seem it maybe it's even just true that
*  whenever self-awareness
*  Sneaked into you know, the human mind and psychology
*  It's just so terrifying the the existence of ourselves the existence of embarrassing past events the the existence of our future demise that most of our
*  Most of what we have to do is just manage that terror somehow and live productive lives. Nevertheless
*  Man this that that isn't that isn't that the
*  You have to I don't know what it is you have to learn how to play bass
*  Yeah, something something, you know keep keep our vibrations out there in the cosmos
*  Exactly. All right, right last question then. Um, I always ask this question of psychologically oriented people in the podcast
*  so do you think that
*  your
*  Research your academic work in this area has changed
*  Your own psychology or how you behave or think about yourself
*  Oh, that's a really good question. Um, you know whenever I
*  Talk about this book and i'm sure it's what happened now the so that self selfless the book. I
*  I feel
*  more
*  aware of
*  How my engaged other people affect them?
*  Um, and i'm much more sensitive to interactions I have with other people
*  um
*  and
*  I feel
*  like
*  So I think about a person. Mm-hmm. That might sound that might sound strange. Um,
*  and that um
*  I've tried to engage more deeply
*  Um, I try to be more thoughtful about the experience of the other person not just with me
*  But like where they where they're from what their experiences are outside of the interaction with me
*  and
*  And I think it makes it makes when I do that
*  It makes my day-to-day experience much better because it's surprising how much it affects what they reflect back to me
*  And the way they engage with me so it really
*  Changes my interactions and um, I feel like that's changed me, right?
*  And this is this is the way the kind of that because I believe in the book, right? I think i'll be differently
*  um
*  People interact with me differently and i'm a different person because of it and I hope that they are better people
*  For the interactions as well
*  No, I love that and maybe the flip side of what we've been talking about most of the podcast which we haven't
*  Said out loud is that if ourselves are constructed by our communities?
*  Then we are part of other people's communities and we're constructing
*  Theirselves and that is something that we should keep be mindful of as we interact with other people
*  Yes, I mean I think that we should definitely be mindful of that is being interactive with other people
*  I think there's something to be gained when we when we do that like we gain something ourselves and we we
*  Provide something to others and I think
*  society will be better off if we really thought hard about the degree of
*  Of connection among us. I'm like all of us. I think that's good advice brian. Lowry
*  Thanks so much for being on the winescape podcast. Thanks for having me. Shout. I really appreciate it
*  you
