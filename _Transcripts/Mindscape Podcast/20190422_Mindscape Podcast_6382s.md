Some people never drink wine; for others, it’s an indispensable part of an enjoyable meal. Whatever your personal feelings might be, wine seems to exhibit a degree of complexity and nuance that can be intimidating to the non-expert. Where does that complexity come from, and how can we best approach wine? To answer these questions, we talk to Matthew Luczy, sommelier and wine director at Mélisse, one of the top fine-dining restaurants in the Los Angeles area. Matthew insisted that we actually drink wine rather than just talking about it, so drink we do. Therefore, in a Mindscape first, I recruited a third party to join us and add her own impressions of the tasting: science writer Jennifer Ouellette, who I knew would be available because we’re married to each other. We talk about what makes different wines distinct, the effects of aging, and what’s the right bottle to have with pizza. You are free to drink along at home, with exactly these wines or some other choices, but I think the podcast will be enjoyable whether you do or not.

Mattew Luczy is a Certified Sommelier as judged by the Court of Master Sommeliers. He currently works as the Wine Director at Mélisse in Santa Monica, California. He is also active in photography and music.

# Episode 43: Matthew Luczy on the Pleasures of Wine
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 22, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPZvgvIdm6k)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and this is
*  another special episode of Mindscape. We're having enough special episodes that you might begin to
*  think that every episode of Mindscape is special and you might be right about that. But this one is
*  a departure. I've always wanted to get into not only sort of academic kind of things but also
*  the realm of ideas out there in the real world involving things like music, which we've already
*  talked about, movies, and also food and drink. So I always thought it would be fun to have an
*  episode of Mindscape devoted to the idea of wine. Now wine obviously is a huge topic. There are many
*  many things you could talk about but ideally we'd be able to sort of start at the beginning, give
*  useful information to people who knew nothing about wine or even you know had had some and hated it,
*  but also give some useful insight to people who are experts and connoisseurs. I think that we have
*  achieved that. This is a very fun episode. Happily I happen to know Matthew Lutzi, who is today's
*  guest. He is the sommelier at Melisse Restaurant here in Los Angeles. For those of you who are not
*  locals, Melisse is two Michelin starred restaurant, probably the most sophisticated traditional fine
*  dining white tablecloths French-American cuisine restaurant that you can find here in Los Angeles.
*  There's really not that much competition in fact. So Matthew's job is both to curate the wine list
*  at Melisse and then to serve the wine in the restaurant. So you know he's a very influential
*  person in the Southern California wine world, as you'll see, at quite a young age. He's also
*  very approachable, very knowledgeable, and very much of the opinion that everyone should enjoy wine
*  in their own way. So when I asked him to be on the podcast, he was very enthusiastic and he said,
*  of course I have to bring wine. So yes, we will actually be tasting wine in real time here on
*  this episode of Mindscape. And because we did that, I thought it would be fun to do another experiment
*  and bring in a third person for the podcast. My lovely wife, Jennifer Willett, who is a science
*  writer and who I know from drinking wine with her, is much better at tasting wine than I am. She is
*  one of these super tasters who is especially sensitive to cruciferousness and bitterness and
*  so forth. So we have some overlap in our tastes, but it's a little bit different, so that's a new
*  perspective. And of course, she's also written articles about the science of taste and smell
*  and climate change and how it's affecting wine and so forth. So we have a lot of fun. We start
*  at the beginning, we taste both California wines and French wines, and we compare them and we go
*  from everything like what you should serve with truffles to what you should serve with cheese
*  burgers. And I think that it's an eye-opening experience. Matthew has some, he has opinions,
*  which is good. That's what you want in a podcast guest. His opinions are not the same as everybody
*  else's, which is also very good. So you're going to learn something, you're going to have fun.
*  I recommend, if possible, that you have this podcast on at home with some wine in front of you,
*  if you could. And if you're in the car listening, then that's also fine. But be sure to remember
*  some of the things we say, bring them back home, because this is definitely one of the more
*  educational and useful episodes that we have here on Mindscape. So let's go.
*  Matthew Lutzi, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you so much, Sean. Honor.
*  This is going to be an unusual episode of Mindscape for a variety of reasons. One,
*  because just the topic is a little bit different. I say there's no such thing as what we talk about,
*  but we often do a lot of science and philosophy and things. There will be science and philosophy,
*  but mostly we're talking about wine and food and a kind of aesthetic experience that we don't often
*  get to here. So that's great. Second reason why it's different is we're going to be tasting wine.
*  Sadly, the audience is not going to be tasting wine along with us. I think probably half the
*  audience listens in the car, so they definitely shouldn't be. Not recommended. Not recommended,
*  but yeah, look, if they're doing that at home, I will list the wines on the website and they
*  can buy and taste along with us. That would be awesome. Highly recommended. Highly recommended.
*  Third reason is because we have a special guest, Jennifer Willett, famous science writer. Say hi,
*  Jennifer. Hello, everybody. Jennifer is also, as many listeners will know, my spouse, and we brought
*  her here to give us a little bit of an extra opinion about the wines that we're tasting.
*  Famously, her palate is much more refined and sensitive than mine. So don't listen to what I
*  say, but listen to what she says. Of course, I hope that part of our lesson will be that everyone's
*  palate is different, so that'll be good. Anyway, Matthew, thanks so much for coming. Tell us a
*  little bit about who you are, how you got here. What's it mean to be a sommelier?
*  Well, okay, so a sommelier is one that looks after and serves wine in a restaurant. That's how I
*  would define it. There's a lot of definitions to it, but I think the restaurant aspect of it is
*  crucial. I got into it young. I definitely had three-year head start as far as-
*  On the legal age.
*  On the legal side of it. Yeah, just to make sure-
*  Are you from local California?
*  I'm from central California. Yeah. Maripos of California, right outside Yosemite National Park.
*  Yeah, I got a head start just to make sure I could do all the testing as soon as possible.
*  Very good. Cheating ahead of time. And so, I mean, wine is a specific thing. Why were you
*  drinking wine rather than the cheap beer that most kids that age would be drinking?
*  Well, I've just always been interested in and fascinated by things with a lot of variables
*  and understanding why things work and always been into music also, so kind of an artistic side. And
*  it sort of instantly clicked with me that wine seemed to be the most artistic way to go about
*  drinking, essentially. And like I said, from California, most of my friends are older than I
*  am. And my early mentors were into California wine, and that's where I started. And that was
*  kind of in the formative years while working in a restaurant. And not disliking it. A lot of
*  people are working in restaurants while doing something else, especially in Los Angeles.
*  And I was like, this isn't bad. It's a fairly easy way to make a solid amount of money. And how do I
*  just deal with wine? How do I just isolate that? And I went to Mélisse on a total whim with my best
*  friend, and we just had our minds absolutely blown. He got super into the culinary world,
*  bought the Elenia cookbook and the French Laundry cookbook, and spent eight hours making one course.
*  But he was the food side.
*  And then I forked off and was like, OK, how do I be a sommelier? And specifically,
*  be really cool to be the sommelier here. And that literally happened.
*  That never works. That's awesome that happened.
*  And so yeah, I did the testing, the first two levels of the quarter master sommeliers, as it's
*  called, when I was 22. And went to Mélisse over the course of a couple years trying to get hired.
*  And I was obviously young and at that point didn't have any fine dining experience. And
*  it's one of those things where how do you get experience without having experience?
*  How do I break in? Well, go somewhere a bunch of times and bug them until they say,
*  yes, you can work one day a week. And then that becomes two. And then
*  that becomes you're an assistant. And then someone leaves and you're the wine director.
*  I mean, for the people, I think that we have an audience where some people are going to be wine
*  experts and some will never have tasted, let's say, good wine, wine at all. What is it that makes
*  wine, wine? What is it that makes it so special? What differentiates it from, on the one hand,
*  you know, gin or scotch, but also for that matter, apple juice or diet coke?
*  Well, you know, certainly gin and scotch
*  reflect a place. I don't think they do it to the level that wine does. I really think that
*  there's an intrinsic locality, specificity of locality to wine, as in like this vineyard,
*  not going across the street to the next vineyard, like hyper, hyper zoomed in, combined with
*  that it's from a vintage, it's from one year and it changes over time. You know, some liquors do,
*  but not in the same way that wine does that there's a lifespan and a trajectory to it that is
*  fascinating. And again, with so many variables that go into it, there's a lot of BS that goes
*  into it, unfortunately, and it is also, unfortunately, can be a easily pretentious topic.
*  I've never noticed that.
*  And I really don't like that. And wine is fascinating and wine is cool. And some people
*  make it not that way. Is there any way to, I mean, put that in the in the in terms of the actual
*  product? I mean, there's something complicated about wine. I mean, that in the good way,
*  not in the bad way. There's something about wine that lends itself to endless variety in a way that
*  bourbon does not. Yeah. Well, so without being a biologist, but from, you know, what I do understand
*  about the way wine works. So the grapes that make up wine are called vitis venefra. That is
*  everything that you produce wine from forks off of that. So Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Merlot,
*  Syrah, Nebiolo, Tokai, Fruiano, whatever it is, it's all vitis venefra.
*  It's a type of grape.
*  Yes. And their berries are about a third of the size, I want to say, as of like table grapes,
*  like Concord grapes. They're much harsher if you just eat one like in a vineyard, I mean,
*  especially red. I mean, there's the, if you don't understand tannin, you ever get a chance to go
*  walk around a vineyard, coastal harvest, you will understand it better. So it mutates easily and
*  splits off into, you know, different, not forms, but like Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, those are linked.
*  You know, the Sauvignon Blanc and Cabernet Franc are the mother and father, respectively,
*  of Cabernet Sauvignon. They were crossed, that's why it has its name. So there's a level of
*  complexity from the biology standpoint, as I understand it, that is, I don't know, unique to
*  wine. It seems to be like spread out wider with wine. So sorry, just the basic facts that grapes
*  come in more varieties than wheat or barley do is an important part of it. There can't just be one
*  form of wheat. I don't want to say that. I'm sure, but... Any good brewer is going to like kill you.
*  Someone in the comments is going to destroy me. But, you know, I think that part of it,
*  when you're dealing... Okay, so in either hemisphere, basically the band of 30 degrees and
*  50 degrees is the Goldilocks zone, as it were, of where you can successfully ripen
*  vitis venefra to have sugar levels compatible with fermentation. You know, below 30, they're just
*  getting baked above 50, although this is changing, above 50, they're struggling to have the
*  physiological ripeness for the yeast to ferment. And they're all... There's nowhere that makes wine
*  that isn't pretty. It really is like any wine region that you want to go, even if you're not
*  into it, like just go and eat there and hang out there. It will be a good time. I think that one of the things
*  that gets in the way of people who are not wine experts is that it is complicated, right? I mean,
*  this is a benefit. This is the wonderful thing, but it's also intimidating. So, I mean, besides
*  red and white, what are the basic ways in which we should classify different wines in our heads? Like,
*  you know, high alcohol, low alcohol is an obvious one. Full-bodied, less full-bodied. What else is
*  going on? Well, so I do think about this in a binary way, and I think it's helpful for understanding,
*  especially if you're beginning. So let's take red just for now. You mentioned alcohol content.
*  That definitely is a factor. That's really more of a factor of climate and winemaker decision,
*  which we'll get into. But with red wine, the way I look at it, the first fork in the road is,
*  is it thin-skinned or is it thick-skinned? Okay. So thin-skinned varietals are Pinot Noir,
*  Gamay, Grenache, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, and Nebbiolo. Those are the main ones. There's other
*  funky ones, but those are the six main ones. And then everything else is thick-skinned. So Cabernet
*  Sauvignon, Merlot, Petite Verteau, Syrah. And this is strictly a matter of what grape varietal it is.
*  Yes. Okay. If you know the varietal, then you know whether it's thick or thin.
*  Yes. Grenache is the funky one that people don't think is thin-skinned, but
*  depending on where it's from, it can kind of seemingly wear both hats. But anyway, so thin-skinned,
*  thick-skinned. And how does that transform into a feature of the wine that you're drinking?
*  Thin-skinned makes a lighter wine, essentially. Thick-skinned will make a heavier wine.
*  There's another one of the weird thin-skinned grapes is Nebbiolo. That's the only one where you,
*  it's basically like, I call it, it's like Pinot Noir wrapped in fine grit sandpaper.
*  It's tannic, but light. Usually the thick-skinned grapes are going to have more tannin structure.
*  But Nebbiolo is this funky one, amazing one, but that's kind of an outlier. So thin-skinned,
*  thick-skinned. And then the other really major thing to look at is earth versus fruit. And that
*  is a function of where it's from. And the wine world is roughly divided into, not quite halves,
*  but two parts, the old world and the new world. Basically the old world is Europe,
*  the new world is everywhere that's not Europe. A Eurocentric choice of language, but that's okay.
*  Blanket statement, wines from the old world are grown in a cooler climate. Wines from the new
*  world are grown in a warmer climate. So they tend to be riper and the riper grapes are getting,
*  the more fruit-driven they tend to be. If the grapes aren't getting as ripe, they tend to
*  reflect more of the surroundings of the vineyard, the soil type, and you're tasting more of the
*  earth flavors. That's a generalization. There's exceptions to like anything we could talk about
*  here somewhere, but basically old world, new world, that's how it shakes out. So those matrix,
*  the matrixes of, is it light or heavy function of the thickness of the skin?
*  Is it more fruit-driven or more earth-driven? Within that, you have the variables of what
*  the alcohol content will be. And the other thing that plays into that, or that's a function of all
*  of that is acidity versus tannin. So again, the binary way I describe this is acid makes your
*  mouth water, tannin dries your mouth out. That is the easiest way to think about it.
*  I like that. Over steep a teabag and taste it. That's tannin.
*  Or just over steep your tea. Whereas lemon juice is that is acid.
*  Makes your mouth water. Yeah. Now in the context of wine, acid, I hesitate to call wines acidic
*  because it just doesn't sound great, but like acid-driven, bright, racy, high-toned, those kind
*  of descriptors tend to be describing wines that have a higher level of acidity, which makes them
*  brighter, makes them more refreshing, if you will. Would a chemist go along with this? Would they say
*  that what you are calling an acidic wine actually is more acidic versus basic in the pH scale?
*  Yeah, because the pH level you measure. So it's objectively measurable.
*  Yeah. Yeah. pH, I mean, like a low pH wine is, if it's three even, that's acid-driven. And then
*  you're going up to like four, that's over four. That's a high pH. Yeah. High more tannic then?
*  No, not necessarily because they're different. And they come together. So they work together.
*  So the tannin level, I don't know if there's a way to really measure it from a chemistry standpoint
*  like there is with pH. But as we get into these wines, we can sort of talk about how they
*  intermingle. But basically acid and tannin, you kind of taste them one on top of each other.
*  And if you could magically take away the acid from a wine, you would notice
*  how much less spine it has. It's called structure, what acid and tannin imparts into wine.
*  But they're two separate sort of properties that kind of do opposite things, right? Like so the
*  tannic removes the moisture from your mouth and the acid adds it. But in principle,
*  you could have a wine that was both very tannic and very acidic. Yes. Again, nebbiolo. That's it.
*  Nebbiolo is raising a tan somewhere. Go on. That's me. So we've had four things to keep in mind.
*  Yeah. Light versus heavy, earthy versus fruity, level of acidity, level of tannic-ness.
*  Just level of tannin. And that's red grapes, white, you get to just take out tannin.
*  Because so the juice of all grapes is clear. The only thing that makes red wine red is contact
*  with the skins. Now there is what's called orange wine, which is white wine made like a red wine
*  that's gaining in popularity. A lot of like funky bars and stuff will pour wine. They're
*  fun for food pairing. You see a lot of them in like Croatia and the Zura and that part of Europe.
*  But white, you still have the acid. You don't have the tannin. You still have body, although it sort
*  of manifests differently. Light white grapes, sauvignon blanc. All this is depending on how
*  it's made too. I mean, you can make a sauvignon blanc into a really rich, like oaky style of wine
*  or you can not. So just grape, varietal makeup, things like mousquadet,
*  vermentino, sauvignon blanc. Those are light, zippy, bright, zesty white wines.
*  Marsan, Rousan, those are big, oily, fatter, punchier styles of white wine. Vignier,
*  really oily, also really floral. So white kind of has a whole other,
*  you need a different way of thinking about and describing white wine.
*  Chardonnay is one of my favorite topics because it's one of the most misunderstood
*  things ever. And this applies to all wine. Like I had this conversation at the restaurant, you know,
*  nightly, you know, oh, are there things you like, things you don't like? I do not want
*  Chardonnay. Is it because you don't like quote oaky buttery wines? Yes. Okay. And I always equate
*  this to good will hunting. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. People
*  have been exposed to a lot of bad Chardonnay, right? It's not Chardonnay. People also get exposed
*  to a lot of bad Chablis. I mean, I had a lot of bad white Chablis in college and it's turned me
*  off white wine for a very long time. Yeah. Well, a lot of that, the California Chablis as it was
*  called, that is not Chablis. That is, that is not the, from the Appalachian origin,
*  control Lee in the Northeastern part of France, not far from champagne. Chablis is a place just
*  like champagne is a place. And, uh, like there, uh, you, you see old, uh, bottles of California
*  wine that say like California, Saturn, California, Burgundy, California Chablis, uh, before that
*  AOCs were formed in 1936 and it became, you can't, you can't do that, but I want to, you know,
*  we have this beautiful, lovely wine in front of us and now we have a little bit of vocabulary
*  for understanding. But I know because we do have a heterogeneous audience, let's, I want,
*  I want some take home messages right away. You know, what should someone do if they're not a
*  wine expert and they kind of want to be more like they want to investigate, you know, what are the
*  steps they should take in a wine store or restaurant or whatever, to sort of get the basics and find
*  something they like? I would say find a local wine shop, get a couple of friends and be honest.
*  And go in on a few bottles that have their in opposite styles and start down in what it is
*  you do or do not like. So by one chop, you mean not super, I mean not super market. Yeah. Not to,
*  you know, a place where they know and like, yes, you know, the money will almost always go farther.
*  You will have a staff that's specifically trained to talk about and sell wine and also usually love
*  wine. Minorly helpful. And, um, so get something light body, get something full body, get something
*  earthy. Exactly. Yeah. And, uh, split them up, get what you might think. Maybe it might be too
*  many glasses at the house, but you never have enough. Never. Yeah. And, um, just start learning
*  and pay attention to it, which, you know, I don't mean that to sound like sharp, but, you know,
*  think about what it is that you're tasting and think about how you would try to articulate it
*  and try to articulate it. Don't just, if you don't know what to say, that's fine, but make notes,
*  go back to that wine shop. Hey, this is, this is what I thought. Um, what do you think? Where do
*  we go now? I didn't like that wine that really dried all the, they took all the saliva out of
*  my mouth. What does that mean? Um, that, that Chardonnay that I thought was going to be oaky
*  and buttery, that was like razor blades. Like what happened there? Like what, you know, just, um,
*  be honest, be, uh, inquisitive. And I really can't stress enough, like do it in a group,
*  do it with at least, you know, one other, one other person, but just to bounce off each other.
*  And, you know, people are going to pick out things that you wouldn't notice and vice versa. And,
*  you know, they're rising tides, right? So it's possible to do okay at the $20 bottle level.
*  Yes, absolutely. I'd say I'm, I'm glad you brought that up because I think there is somewhat of a
*  break there just as far as what it costs to do well at the 10. Yeah. Um, you know, the exception,
*  if you're in Europe and you ask for the table wine, it'll be, you know, sometimes like six euros
*  for a carafe and it'll be awesome sometimes, but your chances of it being awesome are way higher
*  there than they are here. You're dealing with the tariffs and all that stuff. Um, but 20,
*  like you gotta be able to spend 20 bucks on a bottle of wine and it's five drinks. Like,
*  would you complain at a bar if you were paying that for cocktail? Like, you know, it's 20 bucks is
*  where you reasonably should start. And, um, you, yeah, there is no quality price ratio
*  in the wine world. There are a lot of ways to waste money. I'm really fortunate to work where I do.
*  I've got to taste a lot of crazy wines and a lot of them that are really expensive are absolutely
*  worth it. If you could afford them and not feel it. And a lot of them, I like, are just a waste of
*  money. So, I mean, just for the people who might never actually experience this themselves,
*  is there a difference between a thousand dollar bottle of wine and a $10,000 bottle of wine?
*  It depends what they are. But there can be. Oh yes. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, this seems,
*  I think to a lot of people for whom a $50 bottle of wine is expensive, the idea that once you're at
*  a thousand dollars, and it is exactly so, but the idea might very well be that at some point,
*  there's a point of diminishing returns. Oh no, you're paying for micro percentage increase
*  at that point. And you're just paying for what it is. I mean, it is what it is. Like literally,
*  I mean, if you know the most famous winery in the world that tends to basically most of the most
*  expensive bottles of wine sold, the Domaine de la Romany Conti and Burgundy, they're insanely good.
*  Yeah. Sorry. They are. I think of it, you know, as a, in my physics analogy sort of land, it's kind
*  of like the large hadron collider. Okay. Like it's very expensive. Is it worth literally a million
*  times what you can do for a thousand dollars? No. But if you don't spend the billions of dollars,
*  you get nothing. Do you find the Higgs boson without it? Yeah, you don't find it at all.
*  Right. You don't find a thousandth of the Higgs boson, you find nothing. Yeah. So if you want to
*  play that at that level, then that's what you cost. Yeah. And no, DRC is not whatever percentage it
*  is better than whatever you want to compare it to, but there's only one DRC. Right. And there's
*  a lot of things in the middle of that price range and things that are equal to the kinds of money
*  you can spend on those kinds of wines that are one dimensional and you're tasting the investors
*  and the winemakers ego. You're not tasting this like historically consistent place that is just
*  renowned for a reason. And everywhere across that spectrum that exists, I mean,
*  more and more and more of my favorite wines are like, I call them the beautiful babies from the
*  great producers, in places like Burgundy, where there's a classification system of the vineyards,
*  where you have vineyards that are classified as regional. It's from Burgundy somewhere,
*  or then it's from a specific little village in Burgundy, or it's from a specific vineyard in
*  Burgundy. And then it's from a really, really good vineyard in Burgundy, the four different levels.
*  What's called Bourgogne, the most simple of them from the great winemakers is a fraction of the
*  price of the expensive stuff, but you're still getting that expertise in a simple wine. And
*  that's the golden place to be. Now, some of those can be 50, 60 bucks to start, but you're
*  drinking $50, $60 wine from people who are making six, seven, eight, nine, $100 bottle of wine.
*  You know, speaking of drinking wine, now you've got four different bottles of wine here and you
*  have a theory. I mean, there's a, there's a system for why there's four. There's a reason. Yeah.
*  There's a lot of reasons. So, um, they're all red, red. That's cause I said, yes, yes. Sean
*  requested red. That's fine. No, no episode two, we'll do all white. So, um, yeah, I wanted to
*  talk about the thin skin, thick skin thing that I talked about. And then also the old world versus
*  the new world. So the only way to do that successfully is to have four wines. So excellent math skills
*  from a physicist, everyone heard that. Uh, so yeah, I have a Sonoma coast, Pinot noir versus a red
*  Burgundy. So I've talked about Burgundy a couple of times, but, uh, without explaining what that
*  is. So that is a region in the central Eastern part of France, not far from the Swiss border,
*  that makes Pinot noir and Chardonnay a couple other grapes. They grow Aligot and Gamay,
*  but for the most part Pinot noir and Chardonnay and that's it. And pretty much the greatest
*  examples of them, uh, that is changing. There is competition that is mounting all the time, but,
*  um, the competition is still bounced off Burgundy. It's just, it's the reference point.
*  It's the standard. Yeah, it is. Um, okay. So the California Pinot noir and the Burgundy also Pinot
*  noir. Yes. Yeah. Uh, if it's red and it's from Burgundy, uh, it's Pinot noir, no blending.
*  Everything here is, is just one varietal. There's no blends. Um, the California Pinot noir is made
*  by a winery named Cobb and he's in the Sonoma coast. So the Sonoma coast is, uh, this big place.
*  It's like saying, Oh, where do you live? LA County. Okay. It's kind of helpful, but it could mean a
*  lot of things. So, um, Sonoma coast, but specifically the vineyards that Ross Cobb is working with are
*  in this little undefined sub region of the Sonoma coast that they're working on getting passed through
*  as an official sub region called freestone Occidental. That's just a few miles inland from
*  the ocean, meaning that the grapes are socked in a marine layer a lot of the time. And also in these
*  coastal regions, you have a really wide, what are called diurnal shifts. So that's the difference
*  between the hottest time of the day and the coolest time of the night. And pretty much categorically
*  across the wine world grapes want that they want to be stressed. They want to be bouncing around
*  temperature wise, but Pinot noir specifically is kind of a nightmare. Uh, it's really finicky,
*  hard to grow grape requires just perfect, perfect conditions to not be either shrill if it's under
*  ripe or flabby and sort of no longer a silky, pretty sexy textured wine, if it's getting too
*  ripe. So, um, this specific little pocket of the Sonoma coast is great for it. Uh, Ross has a really
*  kind of deft touch, very hands off winemaker as I call him. And any great winemaker. I don't want
*  to taste what you can do with a wine. I want to taste the wine, the wine. Right. So I, I, I want
*  to actually taste this one. Let me just, just so, uh, this look forward a little bit so that our
*  audience knows where we're going. These two, the first ones are Pinos old and new world. And the
*  next two are second to our Sarah. Uh, so again, California and France, um,
*  that'll be the thicker skin. Yeah. Yeah. Fuller bodied. Um, especially the, the California
*  iteration, the French Sarah really is not much heavier than the red Burgundy is going to be, but
*  I'm going to do that on purpose. There's a couple kind of almost backwards things in this flight
*  that I always like to illustrate that, you know, these wide brushstrokes are not always accurate.
*  So, um, or there are exceptions to them, I should say. Um, so two pinot noir is both from the 2015
*  vintage and then two saras both from the 2010 vintage, um, 15 in California, you know, coming
*  out of drought, a string of drought vintages, um, warm, but not really warm, uh, not to the level
*  of 13, 14. And then in, in France, 15 is really, really widely acclaimed. It's a little bit of a
*  riper rounder vintage. Uh, 2015, 2015. Yeah. Yeah. But the yields are down as they've been in
*  Burgundy for the past basically 10 vintages in a row, um, which we'll get into later while that's
*  happening. But, um, basically the California pinot noir, which typically you again, broad stroke
*  California versus France, you're going to get a more fruit driven, heavier style of wine from a
*  warmer climate. And then the European wines typically are more earth driven, uh, and more
*  rustic. And here they're kind of backwards. Neither of them is necessarily rustic, but the
*  Burgundy is a little bit more svelte and kind of slick, um, due to the warmer vintage and different
*  winemaking styles between them, but both master master winemakers. The Burgundy is from a producer
*  named Bruno Claire, uh, from a specific little village in Burgundy called Sauvignon Le Bon and
*  then one vineyard called La Domino and Domino was planted in 1908. So the oldest vines, uh,
*  in this vineyard date back to then. And basically as vines get older, they produce less
*  juice. So the juice they do produce is more concentrated, tends to give you more complex wine,
*  tends to give you more age worthy wine. And it's literally the same vines. It's like,
*  you take a snip from a vine and replant. Uh, you can do that. Uh, these, I mean, there's a point
*  where some of them stopped producing altogether. So there's always less and less and less and less
*  of the old vines and they're replanting other parts of the vineyard. So not every vine in this
*  is from 1908. That's the arrow of time at work. I didn't, you know, we think of individual animals
*  as having a lifespan, but we don't really think of plants as having a lifespan, but they do give
*  up at some point. Anyway, yeah, let's taste the new world. Okay, good. So this is the California
*  Pinot Noir. Rice beback vineyard. All right. Sonoma Coe's Pinot Noir.
*  And what should we be looking for when we're tasting this?
*  So what I do is I always smell first and it first, it sounds obvious, but a lot of people don't. A
*  lot of people just go into the glass and just go right in. But, you know, obviously our sense of
*  taste and sense of smell are linked. And part of, especially when you're dealing with Pinot Noir,
*  I mean, it's just, it is like lacy, pretty, feminine, understated, floral, exactly. Um,
*  I want to smell all that and this wine smells gorgeous and, um, more and more.
*  I'm smelling it right now.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That, you know, um, and this, I always get like kind of like pomegranate, like lavender,
*  again, that racy high tone, bright, um, acidity that you'll see on the end. You feel it in your
*  tongue. You feel it everywhere really. Um, but the way that the finish like sings and keeps going,
*  um, that is why you need wine that has a fair amount of acidity in it. If you, if you don't
*  have that, you just don't get the same level of kind of width and breadth and depth.
*  Yeah. I'm actually very surprised. This is a 2015, uh, Sean knows that I don't like younger wines
*  because I don't like super, super fruity wines. And I feel it's the acidity here that makes this
*  so pleasurable and so drinkable. It actually allows those, those lighter floral notes to come out. And
*  it kind of softens the fruit component a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you just have a really,
*  really integrated wine and for it to be integrated this well, this young, this wine isn't even
*  technically released yet. This producer's, uh, really adamant about holding the wines back
*  two, three, four years longer than most wineries do just because he wants them to hit when they're
*  killing it. Not that this isn't, but, um, but it's going to age in a couple of years. It's
*  going to be perfect. Uh, it'll be better. I mean, this is a, I would, this is a 30 year wine easily,
*  easily. Um, and the other thing here that I love is the salinity. And that's another thing that's
*  a common thread through the wines that I love is here. It's coming from, like I said, that Marine
*  layer. Um, you know, imagine it, like you're eating a perfect dish at a great restaurant
*  just cause nothing tastes salty. Does it mean that there's not salt in it? If you could take it out,
*  notice it's gone. So I think of wine, uh, musically and, and base middle treble on an equalizer. So
*  acidity is kind of likens to the, to the treble. If listening to a record and you turn all the
*  trouble off, you can't hear it. There's no definition. The precision is gone. All about
*  that base. No treble is not good. Um, this is a great example of a perfect high end in a,
*  in a great record. When you say something like pomegranate. So I would not have said that,
*  but when you say it, I can sort of recognize it after the fact. Do you think that, uh, right. So
*  there's a psychology experiment going on also, but do you think that there are literally molecules
*  that would be in a pomegranate that are also in here? There are. Yeah. Uh, when we get to the
*  straw, we'll talk about rotundan. So that's the thing that makes black pepper, black pepper,
*  Sarah. If it doesn't smell like black pepper, got messed up somewhere. And presumably there's
*  advanced scientific research going on, trying to deconstruct a wine like this and try to make it,
*  try to make us understand why it tastes recreated in a Petri dish. Yes. Yes. But we can't, I mean,
*  we're not successful. We can make an impossible burger, but we cannot make a fake wine yet.
*  It's coming. It's coming. I mean, as you know, I mean, it's Adams. Yeah. It is. There's nothing
*  else. It is. Yeah. It is a finite number of period as much as I, oh man. Yeah. Me and friends,
*  like talked about this a lot over a lot of bottles of wine and the moral conundrums of a sommelier.
*  Um, yeah, I mean, imagine you could tune whatever wine you wanted. That would be kind of,
*  Oh, I've, I've imagined it. Yeah. Yeah. The chemistry is very, very complicated,
*  but there is in fact a lot of ongoing research, correct? Yeah. UC Davis, for example, but other
*  places around the world are very much looking at the chemical composition of these for just that
*  reason. The better you understand the chemical components and what's going on in the chemistry,
*  not just, you know, in space, but until over time, the more you can tailor the flavor profiles to
*  your liking. Yeah. Well, and the more you'll learn about if we're, if we're not making wine in a
*  Petri dish, the more you can, uh, you can better farm. I mean, wine is farming slash gardening,
*  however you want to look at it, but somewhere in the middle of those things, uh, you know,
*  everything you're doing has an impact. It's all, you know, prior causes, everything, it's all
*  happening in a vineyard. And, uh, at the end of the day, you can only make great wine from great
*  grapes. You can go the other way, you know, you, you can, you can mess it up, but you can't just
*  like take subpar, lazily farmed kind of lifeless grapes and turn them into a complex head spinning
*  beverage. It just doesn't work that way. Um, so there's a lot of reasons why that happens. There
*  are variables that we do know about, uh, you know, like vine age is a big one. I mentioned that with
*  the Burgundy of the old vines, they make less juice, but they tend to just have a wine that's
*  a little bit more concentrated. And I look at the, uh, the structure of a wine again, like,
*  like I mentioned, which is acid and tannin, uh, and then vine age plays into that as like the
*  charging of the batteries of the wine, like how long, how long will the charge last essentially?
*  Um, and you mean over years, not over since you opened the bottle and started drinking?
*  Uh, well, both, we can talk about that too. I'm more talking about in the bottle, but, um,
*  good wine can take way more oxygen than people realize. I mean, let my, like, I have a couple
*  litmus tests for how much I really like a wine. And one of them is how is it on day three? Um,
*  some wine, some styles of wine are absolutely better on day three and the impairings at the
*  restaurant, all open wines on my way out the door for the next night kind of thing. And some are
*  vinegar after day three. Yeah, exactly. Um, that's that has to do with structure. Um, and then also
*  the aging of the, uh, of the wine in the bottle, you know, the wine that last 40, 50, 60, 70,
*  a hundred years, you know, there has to be, if we're talking reds, like there's some level of
*  tannin in there, there's some level of acidity. Um, the grapes have to have structure, which I
*  equate to our skeleton. I mean, there's a reason we can sit in these chairs and walk around and,
*  uh, you know, that is the equivalent of that in wine is the intermingling of acid and tannin.
*  What's the oldest wine you've ever had? Uh, well, I have two answers to that. One of them is a
*  Madeira says fortified wine from the tropical cheating. Cause it, it can't go bad from, uh,
*  late 1700s. I forget the vintage on it, but
*  Holy smokes late what?
*  What? Yeah. So drove a lot of the
*  Hold of America. Yeah.
*  It's like the billionaire's vinegar with Thomas Jefferson's wine. Correct.
*  Yeah. The fake wine, the fake one had a couple of those too. That's the whole thing.
*  Okay. But non fortified,
*  Uh, not fortified. Late 1800 vintage is Bordeaux like, like opry on from like 1898, Lafite, uh,
*  holding up. Yeah. Uh, you've got like 20 minutes at most. Um, you know, I'm tasting like two out,
*  like two ounces if I'm lucky, uh, an ounce here and there. And that dries out really quick in
*  the glass. But so sorry, but that's an important lesson, right? A lot of people think the older
*  the wine is, the more you have to decanted and let it air out. And that there's a point
*  of diminishing returns there. Definitely. Um, so yeah, oxygen helps till it hurts, right? Like all
*  the way across the spectrum. So, um, and again, like if you have a, what are called good or great
*  vintages, and I, I dislike the way of describing them, which we can talk about later, cause you
*  have to say what that's for good or bad for what there's quote, poor vintages when they come out,
*  that are better to drink young and then quote, great vintages. Usually don't drink well young
*  cause they're very primary and they're meant to go the distance, like Energizer bunny style down
*  the road. That's when they're meant to be drank. But, um, in those ripe quote unquote, great
*  vintages, um, those wines take longer to unpack. So if you're going to open them young, decaying
*  them is helpful. Um, I decant more white wine than I do red at this point. Uh, that's another thing
*  I think a lot of people misunderstand. White can handle way more oxygen than most people give it.
*  And I am a bigger fan at this point of just letting red wine slow, slow ox, as they call it,
*  like slowly come up in the glass rather than trying to like fast forward it. Um,
*  so enjoy how it changes over the meal. Yeah, exactly. Um, and part of that is I'm like pretty
*  OCD about not crossing pores as I call it. So especially if you're dealing with an older wine,
*  um, you know, you pour two to three ounces, never more than that. Take note, you don't, you know,
*  you never want six ounces of wine in a glass if you can, unless you're just ordering wine by the
*  glass. But it is, uh, just not helpful. You get less out of it in the long run. Um, that's
*  interesting because of course, you know, America, there's kind of a, like, we want to get our money's
*  worth. Oh, sure. And this is a very different kind of aesthetic where, you know, to get your money's
*  worth means you want the wine to be as good as possible. Yeah. And that's not a quantity
*  question. Yeah. Yeah. Basically I, I want, you know, roughly 25 ounces of wine in a 750
*  milliliter bottle to turn into as many wines as I can possibly let it turn into. So if I'm dealing
*  with this, that happens more usually with older wines, but if I'm pouring two people, two ounces,
*  they get 10 wines if you're playing along. Um, and also how the empty glass smells is a beautiful
*  thing. Uh, and that actually is helpful with young wine. If, if, if something's had maybe like
*  too much oak put on it or, uh, there's a little bit too much treatment, that's oftentimes what
*  you smell in the glass. I call it the finish of the nose. So people talk about the pallet and the
*  finish of the pallet and just the nose, but it's not technically the finish of the nose, but I think
*  of it that way. Like what are the remnants all about? Okay. So we've enjoyed this. Yeah. 2015
*  California Pinot. It was, I mean, this is a high level one, relatively speaking, but, uh, this is,
*  uh, more fruity than earthy because it is new driven than earth. It's very acidic, bright,
*  you know, light on the pallet. And now we're moving to the old world. Yes. To the Bruno Claire. Um,
*  and I won't lead the witness. I'll have you taste. Okay. We're going to taste it and who knows what
*  can happen. Anything really. That mindscape, the wine edition. Ooh, it's very different.
*  Six and a half thousand miles. Well, but that's, it's more in the way they handled the acidity,
*  I think, because here the acidity is very front and center and very, very pronounced.
*  And here it's more blended and smooth and a little more gentle. Bam. I yep. Yep. That's,
*  that's a relatively warm vintage in a place that doesn't have a ton of them.
*  And definitely to do with the fact you're dealing with an old vineyard.
*  So the, the, this is the one where the actual vines are from 1908. Part of them. Yeah. A blocker.
*  I forget exactly like what the split is, but they're being, you know, there's 1908 planning.
*  There's plannings in the fifties. I mean, there's no, like, usually if vines are in this part of the
*  world, if they're under 20 years old, they're not even, they'll like sell it off. Like,
*  is this a wine that will age more than the first one? Hard to not say yes.
*  Although I truly, we don't want to say anything against the first one. No, I don't. It's not even
*  the first one is a lovely wine. I'm surprised that they're both 2015. I would have, and if I was,
*  it did not know would think that the second was older. Right. The first one tastes like an
*  excellent 2015. Yeah. It's like one tastes older, right? Right. Yeah. Absolutely. I would drink this,
*  you know, it's wonderful, but there's just something a little extra. Um, it, the edge is off,
*  I guess is the best way. Yeah. That's a good way to put it. Um, yeah. And you know, they're both so
*  you can sort of put wine into three timelines of like primary, secondary, tertiary, as far as their
*  lifespans go. And let's like roughly say, let's take the Bruno and Claire. Like I say, primary is
*  probably the first, you know, they say in the first 10 years of Burgundy, you taste the winemaker.
*  And then after that, you start to taste the terroir, the T word, the infamous.
*  So let's say 10 to 15 years is primary, maybe 15 to 25 is secondary. And then once you're past
*  25 or 30, you're into tertiary and you're shedding fruit flavors as you go and exchanging them
*  for, you know, earthy soil, spice, yeah. And like leather in like, like old, like I was,
*  I was seeing an old library. Like I think it's like the must easiest way to, to.
*  Oh, you were speaking my language. Yeah. As Sean can tell you, I love these older leathery,
*  smoky wines. Oh, it's amazing. And, and it's okay. So to circle back on, you know, what makes wine,
*  what's different about it, the time capsule of it. I mean, yeah, you know, when you're drinking
*  whatever vintage it is, like think about what's going on in the world at that time. It's
*  mind blowing and just cool that you can do these parallels to draw. And it's a whole nother
*  conversation piece. And it doesn't need to be old. Like I'm not just, I'm not, I'm not alienating
*  young wines. Like those notes can be there in the young wine. Yeah. Like, oh, this is from when we
*  fill in the blank or when this happened, or do you remember that time when, you know, this is that,
*  that's definitely a factor in wine. So the first seems noticeably more acidic to me. They,
*  neither one of them seems especially tannic or. Yeah. So these, thank you for, for saying that.
*  So these aren't tannic. Pinot Noir doesn't, isn't a tannic grape. If you had a Pinot Noir that was
*  tannic, it would be from oak tannins. So oak, new oak barrels can impart their own tannins,
*  which are different than grape tannins. And these wines are both made from winemakers that
*  don't do that, which I think is, but Pinot Noir doesn't really want to be made that way typically.
*  So wine is generally aged in oak, but some of it's new, some of it's old.
*  Yes. There's, I mean, you can use cement, you can use stainless. And then in oak,
*  there's French, American, Slovenian, Hungarian, but yeah, everything on the table is French.
*  When we get to the co-roti, they use barrels that are about three times the size of the
*  barrels that every other wine here is using, which are 225 liter. If you just think of a
*  wine barrel, the first thing that comes to your mind, that's 225 liters. And the bigger you go,
*  the less surface contact with the wine. So the less oak is imparted. And on, I think both of these
*  are actually pretty similar. They're about a third new oak each. The Bruno Clair might be 20%.
*  And then the rest of the oak that's being used has already been used one other time. So it's,
*  not like old, old oak, but some of these sellers, man in France, like they like, yeah,
*  it's, you know, 20, 30 year old barrel. Like they have Cooper's they employed just to,
*  cause they do not want new barrels. And like you walk into these places and you're like,
*  oh, that's why Bruno Clair smells the way it does. I'm in, you know, they're smelling it.
*  You're like, oh yeah. The mold on the walls is from every fermentation that's happened in here.
*  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Let's move on to our sorrows.
*  Okay. So the next wine is from Favia wine. So this is a husband and wife team to like really,
*  really acclaimed winemakers in California. Annie Favia is the viticulturist. So she's doing all the
*  work in the vineyard. She's married to Andy Erickson, who's the winemaker. And if you combine
*  their resumes, it's basically every top culty hard to get Cabernet Sauvignon, predominantly out of
*  the Napa Valley. I mean, they have friends that own this vineyard in Amador County,
*  not far from where I grew up and they make it in Napa. And this is a really good example of a
*  fairly full throttle, fuller bodied style of California sorority. It doesn't go over the top.
*  It's, you know, we've jumped up in alcohol content here. The first two wines were about 13, 13, five.
*  Now we're at 14, eight. And we're in thick skin, varietal with Sarah. It's like a completely
*  different beverage, really. It really is. Yeah. Very even I would be able to say, oh yes, this is
*  a California wine right away. But see, still there's lift, still there's persistence, there's energy.
*  It doesn't just go away. And that is really the structure. That's what I want in wine. It keeps
*  you coming back to the glass. It makes it infinitely easier to pair with food. Wine doesn't
*  have acidity. Food pairings become difficult or just not possible at a high level. Right. I'm
*  getting a very strong like olive-y note. It almost a prunish note here. Okay. Yeah. So I mean, think
*  of what a prune is. Think of a ripeness level of, you know, we're dealing with riper fruit here.
*  And olive, you see that in soror often. I don't know the name of that compound, Sean, I'm sorry.
*  But I do. I am a theoretical physicist. It's not overpowering, but it's very noticeable. It's
*  in there. It's prominent. Yeah. It's overpowering. It's the most prominent note for me.
*  I like, I always like saying, I'll remember you said that when we get to the Jame, the Cobo tea,
*  which I find olive in two in a different way. And I would say a more integrated way.
*  Well, even though this is a high alcohol wine, relatively speaking, you don't get that burning
*  that you get in the sort of the cheap high alcohol wine. It's still balanced. It's still balanced.
*  And it's still young. I mean, you know, this is 2010. I don't know if I said that both the sororities
*  are 2010. This ties into how wine ages, but I explained that, you know, the alcohol is never
*  going to change. Everything else in the wine can shed and change and evolve and congeal and whatever,
*  but you always have this pillar in the middle. So sorry, that's like, unless your bottle is not
*  corked correctly or whatever the literal amount of alcohol in the bottle never changes. That's
*  not a chemical reaction. There's many other reactions going on. 14.8% ethanol that's there
*  for the long haul. And that becomes, if the wines out of balance, that becomes more obvious,
*  the older they get. You see this a lot. There's really acclaimed vintage in the Napa Valley, 1997.
*  The wineries dealt with huge yields from the vineyards, larger than they could physically
*  handle. So they had to pick like half the fruit, start dealing with it while the other half is in
*  the vineyard getting too ripe and then bring in the other half. And it got just rock star scores,
*  left and right. Parker's just dealing out hundred point scores. And now most of them do not show
*  well. And you put your nose in the glass and it's like porty. Child prodigies. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So that never changes. And then when you have lower alcohol wines, they're just more
*  seamless. And if you're more seamless, when the wines, you want to be seamless all the way through.
*  Right? So you don't notice it. And if there's a young wine that's high alcohol, it's better young.
*  I just categorically disagree when I look at these drinking windows of some of these big,
*  massive wines. Like, oh, it'll age 35 years. I don't, like it will, like it will physically
*  be drinkable, but I don't know what it will taste like then. If you're, if you dig that,
*  just dig it, drink it. But they're, I think better young. So for our non-expert listeners, like the,
*  the best wines in the world, like the classic Bordeaux's burgundies and whatever, what alcohol
*  level have they traditionally been at? I say 13 is, is like a good Goldilocks. Basically if you're
*  below 11 and a half percent, your, the grapes aren't right. There's just not enough energy.
*  There's not enough food for the yeast to ferment into alcohol. There's a sweet spot. Definitely.
*  Now you see, I should say that this is for dry wines and most wines produced in the world are dry.
*  If you have dry, meaning low sugar. Yes, yes. And there's no what's called residual sugar. So
*  leftover sugar from the fermentation. Like, you know, there's Rieslings from Germany in the Mosel
*  that are 7% that are delicious, but they're sweetness. There's also a city to balance it out.
*  They're like deceptively not sweet when you drink a lot of them. But so those are like outside of
*  what I'm talking about. If you're fermenting a wine to dryness, it's basically got to be like 11,
*  11 and a half or else it's going to just be razor blades. And then once you get over 14 and a half,
*  let's say that's where you're even in the 15, depending on what the style of the wine is,
*  that's where it starts to be noticeable. And I start to kind of get off the train. There's a place
*  in there's a sub region in Provence called Bandol whose wines I love. And they just overlooked
*  right on the Mediterranean and back to the diurnal shifts, huge diurnal shifts. So it's a warm part
*  of France, but then you're on the sea. So they come way down in temperature and those wines can
*  be 14, five all day and you'd never notice it. There's just the integration that they have.
*  But yeah, I'd say like, like I said, the two burgundies we're drinking are 13.
*  The lowest alcohol is going to be the fourth wine, the Domaine Jemé Corotille, which is 12, five.
*  But you look at like old Bordeaux and even old Napa cabs, like from the golden era of
*  right when Napa was starting to blow up late 60s to the mid 70s, even late 70s, those are 12%
*  alcohol cavernous and they age incredibly well. Some of my favorite wines. And then now those,
*  some of those same producers, a lot of them are in different hands, but you know, they're making
*  15, 15, five. But there was a thing. That's high. It's high. Yeah. I mean, claiming that they have
*  wiggle room too. They can lie about it to a degree. They can be like 16. And there was a thing not too
*  long ago for like big alcohol bomb wines like Zinfandel and kebs from California would be very
*  high alcohol. And probably that's partly because the American palette was not that sophisticated
*  and they like their booze. Yeah. You know, so there's a lot of like geopolitical things going
*  on in the wire. Maybe that's not the right descriptor, but there's a lot of outside factors
*  with that. And I think so critics are a big part of this. It's just impossible to not talk about it.
*  And, you know, basically when you see the alcohol levels go up and the right, like let's take Napa
*  as like a really good example of it. Like I just said, you know, late sixties, seventies or 12,
*  12, five in the eighties, they started irrigating. So everything was dry farm before then. And like
*  in most of Europe, it's illegal to irrigate. So the irrigation, if you're making wine, yeah.
*  Yeah. It's considered cheating or okay. Yeah, no cheating. And it raises the yield. So basically
*  the lower the yield, typically the more concentrated the wine, typically the more complex the wine and
*  therefore in quotes, better the wine, the higher the yields, the more dilute, typically the flavors
*  are going to be. So in the eighties, they start irrigating. And then right after that,
*  uh, something called phylloxera hit Napa, which hit the whole
*  wine world basically in Europe in the mid 1800s, wiped out the vineyards in Europe.
*  So it's a disease. Yeah. It's a little like microscopic, uh, like pests that dehydrates
*  the roots and, uh, is, yeah, this is interesting. So American root stock is impervious to it,
*  but it was introduced into France from American or it was brought over, but American,
*  it like traveled with the roots and then, but it's impervious to it. So 99% of the vineyards
*  in Europe are planted onto American root stock. Okay. Uh, and that happened in the, uh, mid 1800s
*  Phylloxera hit. It took them 50, 60 years to figure out how to fix it. In that time, a lot of the
*  vineyards got poisoned. Um, that's actually part of why you see a lot of organic and biodynamic
*  viticulture happening now is undoing what happened then. So it's pretty, yeah, like really macro,
*  like farming stuff. But so, um, that happened in Napa. There's a specific kind of root stock
*  that was, uh, susceptible to it that funny enough, UC Davis like recommended everyone use. And then
*  before they knew that Phylloxera loved it. Sorry. Uh, science is messy sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. We're
*  learning. We're learning. Um, so you have irrigation then Phylloxera. So, uh, basically a reset
*  button happens and then vineyards get replanted. So now you have young vines and, um, going into
*  the early nineties into the mid nineties, this is when like the Colt Cabernet thing happens. This is
*  when scores are becoming more and more of a thing. Spectator, Robert Parker, all that. And not that
*  that didn't exist before, but it really more into the mainstream getting into the.com boom. So there's
*  money coming into this part of the world. It wasn't there before to that level. And people like wind
*  at own a winery. Um, and you have, you know, the way a lot of these tastings happen when they're
*  doing the scores, they're tasting a hundred wines in a row. So the only things that pop and get high
*  scores are big high alcohol wines, just because physiologically that's what you will go. Wow.
*  Two. Um, and it created this thing that I, I referred to, I, I correlate it to the loudness
*  wars, which is something that happened in the music industry, really in the same time, which is
*  interesting where basically like just as humans were sort of wired to think that louder is better.
*  It is obviously, obviously it is. Yeah. Um, you want your song to be the loudest. Exactly. Like,
*  oh, this song is banging and then, Oh, Nope, here you go. Oh, here you go. And, uh, it,
*  you're also crushing the dynamics out and you're crushing the nuance out. So there you paying,
*  you don't get something from nothing. Like you are paying for it in one way or another. Um,
*  and same thing, like is totally app corollary to wine. Uh, you know, the bigger, the bigger,
*  the bigger, the bigger is not better. Um, and you see the pendulum is definitely evening out. I was
*  just up in Napa like a month ago and tasted a lot of the 15s up there and they're really pretty
*  and tastes some 16, tasted some 17s out of barrel. And I think that things are,
*  it's being reeled in definitely. There's probably a whole other podcast episode about
*  the relationship of aesthetics and things happening on different levels, different scales,
*  right? Like, you know, the human mind and I, and, and palette apparently are, are attracted to
*  complications in all these ways. You know, the simplicity gets us first,
*  but then we want to get something more interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So this one, let's see,
*  we, we, this is our California, Sarah is clearly fruitier than the pinos, both of them.
*  Well, it's, it's, um, it is, it's, it's also heavier. I mean, you're taking a big step in
*  body. Yeah. You're like, there's a concentration fruitier per se. I mean, the, the, uh, the,
*  the pinos are half a little floral quality to you, which I think offsets the fruit. So maybe
*  that's it. Um, it doesn't seem especially either acidic or tannic to me. This, uh,
*  yeah, it's, it's again, I mean, these are all like balanced wines at the end of the day. So
*  nothing's like poking out is that's totally what I'm going for. But it's less acidity. Um, so I
*  would say that it is actually pretty similar level of acidity, but okay, it's the same amount of
*  trouble, but there's more base. Right. There you go. So if I, again, you take out the trouble,
*  like you would notice it, this is same thing I touched on with, with German Riesling, how
*  some of them can be like have sugar levels that would shock you, but you still go and you still
*  pucker at the end of tasting it because there's acid to balance it out. Right. So, I mean, it
*  almost certainly is like the pH is probably higher than the cobs, but you know, or the cobb and the
*  Bruno-Clair, uh, there's just more oomph to it. All right. And the, uh, and we should, yeah,
*  so let's go into the Jame. So this is truly one of my favorite wines that exists. Uh, domain Jame
*  Corotille, the 2010, um, 100% Syrah from the Northern Rhone. So Southern part of France,
*  uh, the Rhone is split into two parts. I can't call them halves. Uh, the Northern Rhone is really
*  only like the top 20% of the valley, but, um, these vineyards are planted on these really steep
*  precipitous terraced slopes, um, that the Romans did a lot of the terracing. We've been keeping
*  it up since then. Um, and you have this fairly windy place. So you're a fair amount South from
*  where Burgundy is, which you think it'd be warmer and it's a little bit warmer, but only a couple
*  degrees Celsius. So you have winds blowing through here, which cool down the grapes.
*  And anytime you have water, uh, in the direct vicinity of vineyards, especially when the
*  vineyards around the water are on steep slopes, it acts like a solar panel. So it's bouncing
*  sunlight back into the vineyard. So you get a level of ripeness without the heat, uh, that you
*  think would be necessary. The best way I've heard it explained, uh, is this Burgundian winemaker.
*  He said that the sun ripens the grapes, not the heat. Yeah. And I'm not sure if that's scientifically
*  accurate, but I get it. It's far. Yeah. Getting the point across of like, you know, this,
*  the things that are making up this wine and the ripening process, it does not need to be hot nor
*  like really should it be. Um, and this wine, especially on the nose, nothing else smells like
*  Jamie. It has this like peppered beef, jerk. Pepper is the thing I get. So the Rotund done,
*  this is what I was talking about with Roach. So it was amazing. Rotund done is a chemical,
*  uh, compound flavor compound. Yeah. And it's just lights out and it's floral and it's in pepper as
*  well as in this one. Yeah. So there's another, like the other big, uh, like compound that gets
*  thrown around is purezine that's in bell peppers and jalapenos and also in Sauvignon Blanc.
*  And so like you see it often in New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, like is notorious for you just,
*  I mean, other than smelling sometimes like cat piss, which it is famous for. I'm not just talking
*  down on it. That's a well, it's a phrase in common usage. You can use that in wine scrabble. Yeah.
*  But there's a bell pepper jalapeno thing oftentimes in that. Um, and especially,
*  uh, you see it there, you know, Sauvignon Blanc also makes up Sancerre in France,
*  but something about the way that Sancerre, when it grows in the soil types in the Loire doesn't
*  like produce it in this high level. So you, it's like in like the sommelier exams when you're
*  blind tasting Sauvignon Blanc, you just like praying for a Marlboro, New Zealand Sauvignon.
*  It's like nailed it. Bam. Um, but yeah. So it's interesting because I mean, I mentioned the,
*  the, the strong olive note and there's a slight olive note here, but I feel like,
*  you know, it's not overpowering in the same way. I mean, I'm getting, you know, like a, kind of a
*  leathery at a smoky kind of finish here. Um, in addition to the pepper, and I think it kind of
*  balances out the olive. So it's not as overpowering. Yeah. I would say like the way I would articulate
*  that is that, you know, I love Fabia and I meant to say that the Fabio, Fabia, Corso Serra, that is
*  literally the wine that got me into wine. I had a buddy that like convinced me to part with $40
*  11 years ago, uh, that I had to think about for two days at the time.
*  And now I'm sitting here recording a podcast with you. So that, that, that is, yeah,
*  as a good investment, but that is the wine that started at all. And then GMA is the wine that got
*  me into French wine. It's funny that they're both Serra's. So it's hard for me to say Serra's not
*  my favorite grape, I guess, but there's a subjective element here, right? Because Sean can tell you,
*  I'm very sensitive to things like olive. Um, there's an Amarone that I find absolutely
*  undrinkable because it's like an olive punch to the face. Um, but if you balance it out,
*  it's a wonderful note. Right. Um, like, you know, let's say that in the Fabia, the olive is maybe
*  one of three or four things that you smell. And the GMA, if I sit here for 10 minutes, I mean,
*  there's like 10 or 12 things I could probably pull out of this. So it's in there, but it's just
*  integrated, diluted, integrated. I think that's a better word. What I love about,
*  and not just, I mean, other co-routines have this, GMA, I think has it in spades is that it's also
*  floral. So it sort of calls back the pinos and the weight class is not much heavier than pinos.
*  And again, I mentioned it, that this is the lowest alcohol. This is 12, five. Um, and you wouldn't
*  guess. No. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I, it's funny. I don't think about it because I guess
*  I just, the balance, if you're drinking balanced wines, you're not thinking about it. You know,
*  I mean, I, I, they're all great and I don't want to say anything against any of them,
*  but I'm getting the feeling that the old world wines are a teensy bit more sophisticated and
*  structured than the new world wines. Yeah. It's more going on per sip in my experience.
*  Right. Um, you know, I, so I think about this a lot and doing what I do and, you know,
*  we're having this conversation in 2019, right? And we're dealing with roughly 2000 year chasm
*  of experience difference in Europe versus let's say California in this case, but at the same time,
*  in a way, not really like I talked about phylloxera, like there's been these reset buttons
*  that happen and, uh, you know, the first winery in Napa, yeah, first winery in Napa. I don't know
*  if it's the first winery in California. Had to be one of them. Uh, Charles Krueg that's 1861.
*  So it's a while ago. Yeah, it's a while ago. And then, you know, you have prohibition, uh, you have,
*  you know, a couple of world wars to deal with. You have the depression, you have these setbacks
*  that happened in California wine. And then not until the mid seventies with the, in the wine world,
*  infamous judgment of Paris, which I could touch on really quick just to give some context where,
*  um, there was a tasting organized, uh, in 1976, where basically the top Bordeaux producers were
*  sort of pitted against, uh, this hand-picked lineup of California Cabernet producers, mainly
*  Napa, but one from Santa Cruz mountains and, uh, California one. Now, California, California.
*  Now what they don't tell you is that, um, France is lazy at this point and California is hungry.
*  So there's just these other factors. It's not as easy as like, yeah. Um, you know, and, and like
*  I mentioned with the phylloxera thing, France is like reeling from that, dealing with that. So those
*  vines that those wines were made from in the French wines in the judgment of Paris, those are all
*  really young vines. So you've, yeah, there's Mouton and there's Opryon, but it's, it's in this kind of
*  like dodgy era of French viticulture. Um, when you have California just trying to like, just
*  kill it, you know, so that hunger factor is huge. Um, so I, I agree with you. Um, although I, I like,
*  um, it's super important to like, to not just like talk down on the new world. I'm not saying
*  you are, but I love it. And I think one of the things that is very clear is how much fun it is
*  and how enlightening it is to taste wines like this next to each other. Yes, that's huge. That's why
*  yeah, first thing I walked in, how many wine glasses have Sean? Uh, cause we all need to
*  have four. Turns out we have enough. Yeah, we have enough. Um, see, you can never have too many. Uh,
*  yeah, the context is huge. Just being able to go right back and forth between them, not have one
*  and then, oh, taste this. Okay. Dump it or spit it or not, or whatever. Now here's another one.
*  It's not, it's not the most educational way to drink wine. And that is really what I'm
*  passionate about among many parts of the wine of wine service is that look, this stuff is really
*  cool. It's fascinating. And some people mess that up unfortunately, but like it's, it's objectively,
*  there's a lot going on and there's, there is a wine out there for everyone. Absolutely. It was
*  like, I can't drink wine. I don't like wine. It's like, well, let's, let's, let's go in on that.
*  You know, it's interesting. I used to be one of those people that said, I just don't like wine.
*  I was never a big drinker. And then I realized it was just that I was drinking really bad wine.
*  Yeah, it's out there. You can get it. Yeah. I want to touch on this on the, on the glasses,
*  because you've picked very different shape glasses and people can't see them, but we have sort of
*  rounder and more bowl like glasses for the pinot and more the classic, you know, the narrower wine
*  glasses. And why is that? And why is it important? So, so the glassware things kind of gotten crazy,
*  uh, you know, like Riedel now makes like an Oregon pinot noir glass, a California pinot noir
*  glass, a red burgundy glass. It's like, I totally, I get it. I want them all. Um, but you know, the,
*  the answer goes standard answer is, you know, with the back to thin skin, like more, let's say more
*  delicate styles of wine, you typically want to put in a bulb, um, because that bulbous shape helps
*  contain the aromas versus a Bordeaux glass. So basically it's like burgundy or, or Bordeaux
*  glass. Um, the Bordeaux glass is kind of funnel out more powerful wines. So they kind of emphasize
*  them more. That's roughly the way it breaks down. Um, you know, I, I definitely use different kinds
*  of glassware. You see more and more companies just making like the one glass. I think there
*  literally is a company that that is the name where it's like all wine should go in this one.
*  And I don't necessarily disagree with that. Um, I'm kind of somewhere in the middle.
*  I think I could definitely run a whole wine program on three glasses, just one, like almost
*  like a smaller version of the Bordeaux glass for, you know, bright, clean, crisp, zippy white wines.
*  I would use this exact same glass that we have the pinot noir in for Chardonnays,
*  whether they're rich and toasty or mineral and clean, um, and like more Sainte-Roussane,
*  those bigger whites. Um, and I also use these for champagne. That's a huge thing. If I have to go
*  people ask me, what's your favorite wine region? I definitely, it's hard not to say champagne,
*  but this sounds like sacrilege to put champagne in a pinot and the burgundy glass.
*  Yeah. Cause aren't you supposed to either use the flute or the Marie Antoinette glass?
*  Yeah, I, I, uh, I vehemently disagree with both of the two, the two most popular champagne glass
*  choices. Uh, you know, the flute helps you see the bubbles and that's cool, but that's what
*  you're into. Yeah. And then the coupe, I mean, has the legend that's hard to divorce from it.
*  Uh, the coupe is a great martini glass. I will say that's better. You see the legend out loud.
*  It's supposed to be based on the shape of Marie Antoinette's breasts. Yes. Cool. I dig it. I,
*  I like it as a martini glass grown up. Um, so it's a great glass shape, but it gives all the bubbles
*  away, right? Well, so the, so let's talk about that. So, um, the balls aren't going anywhere,
*  right? Like just cause you can't see them streaming. So, so champagne is a wine that is
*  also sparkling, but it is a wine first and foremost. Uh, it's also logistically
*  either the hardest or maybe the second hardest, however you want to view dry Sherry production,
*  but basically it's a nightmare to make. And, um, in a really like precipitous climate,
*  it's becoming less and less so, but, uh, the grapes they use predominantly are Chardonnay,
*  Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Those are the Burgundian varietals. So to me, uh, champagne
*  goes in a burgundy glass cause I want to smell it. Again, the nose is like maybe not everything,
*  but it's at this point for me, I mean, I could just smell all these for a couple hours and be
*  all good. Um, and great champagne. I think a lot of champagne is not enjoyed to the level it could
*  be enjoyed solely due to the glassware and that people serve it way too cold. We can talk about
*  serving temperatures. Um, it's actually a very good point. Yeah. Um, so, you know,
*  most people serve whites too cold and reds too warm. Uh, we definitely had a lifestyle upgrade
*  when we got a little refrigerator for our red wine lifestyle upgrade. Yeah. Um, because they were,
*  they're meant to be stored in dank cold French cellar. Yeah. Which is the average, you know,
*  is around 54, 55. And we're in California. Yeah. Right. Um, it never gets that cold here.
*  And so here, so, so what goes along with that storage temperature and service temperature
*  are two different things. Uh, storage temperature, you know, the caves in champagne and the caves in
*  Burgundy and the caves in Bordeaux. And I'm sure there's some difference, but at the end of the
*  day, let's call it 53 to 55. Um, you know, typically you see lighter, brighter, cleaner,
*  white wines served cooler, and then richer white wines served warmer. You know, there's these, like
*  the charts you see, especially in like the sommelier exams, when you get grilled, you know, like,
*  oh, what, what's the proper serving temperature at this point? I would just fail all that.
*  Well, forgotten slash like don't care because to me, um, if it's balanced, if it's bright,
*  if it's complete, then I can drink it at, I can drink champagne at 55 and get way more of a nose
*  off it and taste it more like a wine than the people that are drinking it when they put it in
*  their fridge, which is legally has to hold dairy, which is 42. Um, so to me, that's a great example
*  of like mastering the rules. So you know how to break them. I love it. Thank you. Thank you,
*  Jennifer. I'll, I'll take that with me. Um, yeah, I just, I want to enjoy each wine as best I can.
*  And you know, temperature, you can mess with temperature and you know, if there is a,
*  like, let's, let's take a hot, like alcohol wise red wine. If I put it into canner and spin it in
*  an ice bucket for five minutes and then pour it, you will notice less of the ethanol. There's like
*  tricks that temperature can be used to help wines along maybe, especially if I'm like in a food
*  pairing, like restaurant setting. Um, but, uh, what's going through your mind when you do that
*  food pairing restaurant setting and like, so you, you are working at a restaurant, like as you
*  already said, a sommelier should do. Um, I think that part of the intimidation factor with a lot
*  of people is feeling like they need to know which wines go with which foods and they don't, and they
*  don't have vocabulary to articulate what they want. Yeah. So let's, let's touch on that real quick.
*  And then we'll go right into pairing about the vocabulary. So we were talking earlier, like,
*  how should people get started? And I recommended you go to a shop, get some friends, put it up,
*  talk about it, learn, be honest. Um, I would say the goal is to be able to go to a restaurant and
*  say to a waiter, bartender, sommelier, whatever. Um, hi, yeah, we, we would like a clean, crisp,
*  dry, mineral driven white wine and a medium body earth driven red wine. It doesn't have too harsh
*  of a tannin level. Could you help us with that? That is a dream. You are killing it. Yeah. Uh,
*  you know, they're like, not speak that language. Yeah. Um, and it's not that far away to be able
*  to like, you know, that, that, that's like maybe three trips with a couple of friends to a wine
*  shop. You could get at least half of each of those sentences constructed successfully. And
*  that helps everybody and you, I mean, it will, it will only help you right at the end of the day.
*  Well, you have to figure out what you like. I mean, it took me a couple of years to figure out that
*  I could go into a restaurant and say, I want like a medium to full bodied red, not too fruity,
*  probably a little on the older side, not too young. And I want like kind of these leathery,
*  smoky, long finish kind of elements. You're like 95th percentile right there. I mean, that is
*  killing it. And I'm not an expert, but I basically said, here's a vocabulary. I need to learn to
*  communicate with my small a exactly. Um, so yeah, not knowing how to say it. And, you know, a lot
*  of actually, well, this just came to me. And when you're asking about the food and wine pairing
*  thing, a great way to learn, if you go to a restaurant and they offer a wine pairing, do the
*  wine pairing. Yeah. Don't make it, let someone else. I always call it the, I don't want to think
*  about it option. Yeah. And take an Uber because you're going to be really plastered. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Especially lift Uber is evil, but that's okay. Especially if you're coming to Mali's
*  or, you know, if you're in the airport, go to the Vino Volo and get a flight of different things.
*  Done. Yeah. Totally. I'd much rather have, you know, three, two ounce pours than one six ounce
*  pour. Um, so what do you look at when you're looking at pairings? Because that's difficult.
*  Yeah, that's a whole episode. But, um, basically, so I'd say the number one thing I like to explain
*  to people is that the protein doesn't necessarily drive. Uh, it's oftentimes the last thing I look
*  at. So it's not a white wine with fish and chicken and red line with meat. Yeah. That's all we've
*  been taught. Yeah. Well, that's not like untrue. There's just like good exceptions to that. Uh,
*  like the fish one, like salmon is always the blaring example. I always describe salmon. It's
*  a ribeye that swims, uh, cause it's got fat content. And if it's cooked properly, it's
*  like medium at most even like medium rare. And yeah, there it is. Okay. So then we're in
*  champagne or dry reasoning at a sushi bar, but, um, you know, like, and, and, you know,
*  pinot noir to take a classic, a quote classic pairing that I don't like get with only a couple
*  exceptions is like pinot noir and salmon, uh, got really popular and it makes like, I theoretically,
*  I get it. Cause you have a lighter, usually brighter red wine with, you know, this,
*  the richest of the fishes, shall we say. And, but, you know, even when it's, even when it's,
*  uh, from Burgundy and even older, there's still a fair amount of fruit to it and fruit and fat
*  butt heads. I would think you want acid, right? You want acid, but I want tannin. I want to hug,
*  I want to like, like the gritty grainy, like if you tasted it on its own, maybe like your
*  saliva is gone. You're like, this is dry, man. Like, I don't know if I dig it, but then you have
*  the salmon and the ribeye or the ribeye of the sea. Uh, it works really well. Um, that's one
*  example of it. You know, I, like, I look at limiting factors, like, is it spicy? Like for real,
*  like actual heat, the bandwidth gets pretty narrow as to what you can use. And you want sugar to
*  counterbalance that. You also refresh the food that way. Uh, and, you know, I'm,
*  for the most part, dealing with pairings on, on long, like at least four courses, but sometimes
*  seven or 10. So I'm trying to keep your palate alive the whole time. You know, you're taught
*  that you go sparkling into light white, into rich white, into light red, into medium red,
*  into heavy red, into dessert, and then you're done. And I don't agree because by the time you're
*  two thirds of the way through the trajectory, physically you're tapping out and you're, you're,
*  I mean, I'm affecting how the food tastes. It's not just like, what does the food taste like?
*  What does the wine taste like? I'm like, you should be able to go to a great restaurant and
*  have a menu like that. If you don't drink alcohol and be happy, theoretically, I'd, you should be
*  able to sit down at a table and just have 10 wines in a row and be happy. And then when the two come
*  together and when the food is no more than ever 50% of the equation and the wine is no more ever
*  than 50% of the equation and everything is killing it, that's the optimal situation. So,
*  you know, I'll start with, you know, a light white or a champagne maybe to start off and then go
*  right into an off dry wine. If the course merits it, I like going right into a red wine at the
*  beginning and then right back to a white, cause all the, that, um, then if I'm using acid driven
*  wines, which I typically am that cleans the red wine out of your palette, uh, on the 10 course
*  menu, oftentimes at Malice, I look at it, it's like two, five courses back to back. So I'll have
*  champagne in the middle. Um, so I'm just trying to like, it's a good sales pitch for Malice right
*  here. Just the, the, the philosophy of, of how to like bounce around. I mean, it's not, and people
*  don't expect it. And you know, if again, the, I don't want to think about it option, uh,
*  this, this, I view it, the stakes are high on that, you know, I mean, it's, it's important
*  to be able to do the pairing thing well. And, um, so that that's like, you know, how I try to
*  structure long menus, but there's a few things like, like beef, let's take beef, especially
*  since we have two saraz in front of us, like this is beef. This is like definitive. This meaning
*  the two saraz. Uh, what is it about the sera that makes it good? Well, that like, you smell it,
*  that like peppery, like, especially the jam. I mean, there's like an animalistic roasted
*  thing to jam a and what you see all the time is, you know, steak and cab steak and cab. And that's
*  cool. But I like kind of preach the sera gospel a lot of the time that I think that that is a lot
*  of times the, the, uh, sera seems to me comes to me as more spicy. Yeah. Overall, typically,
*  and it's easy for it to get out of the winemakers hands with ripeness. So unbalanced. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Um, and then that's where wine stopped being food friendly, right? So like things that are still
*  bright and not a big, heavy, cakey, oily style of sera, but that with beef is great. Chicken's fun
*  because chicken is kind of like the coin flip. Um, I literally just serve white and red side by side,
*  white burgundy, red burgundy have fun. Um, depends on, you know, is this skin on, is it herb,
*  do they're like truffles involved? And, you know, we're talking about, obviously Mike,
*  the context of this is I, I'm fortunate to work in a high-end restaurant. It does not like pizza
*  and burgers and, and either the great wines of the world or entry level wines. That is a great
*  sport. There's a really fun thing. I mean, is there anything specific I should have in mind
*  if I know I'm getting a nice pepperoni pizza? Uh, I'm allowed to have wine. I know that I've done it,
*  but, uh, what should I look for? I mean, it's obviously sort of fatty, cheesy. Yeah. Well,
*  you know, there's this, there's this kind of cheesy saying, no, no pun intended with that,
*  uh, of, uh, you know, if it grows with it, it goes with it. You hear so like,
*  that's why I like Barolo and like, um, the Piemontese truffles became popular. They're
*  from the same place. Um, so like medium body, but still bright, fairly earth driven, but still
*  fruit to glue it together. That works well with that kind of pizza. Uh, good white burgundy and a
*  good burger. I love, I like doing, I use more whites than reds with pairing. Uh, which I know,
*  you know, I can imagine a white, I've not done it, but I can imagine a good white burgundy with a
*  burger with cheese burger, cheese burger. Yeah. There's cheese involved. A lot of people do cheese
*  and red and I, there's only a couple of times it works to me. Cheese is a, is a red, is a white wine
*  part of the, of the meal to me. Um, and especially some sweet wines, if they're, if they are red,
*  like harder styles with like really succulent, juicy, bright red wines are fun. Um, that's also
*  a cool, uh, application for like the funky orange wine thing. Like I mentioned, um,
*  yeah, cheese is a whole, whole parent. And it's like, when we say cheese, like, I mean, that is,
*  there's a lot of cheeses. Yeah. It's like wine. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. There's some cheeses that
*  go beautifully with reds. Yeah, totally. Um, yeah, I guess I'm just, I'm trying to like refresh
*  always. I like, I like when things go up when the trouble is there. You know, it's interesting. A
*  couple of years ago, um, I did a piece for Gizmodo where we did a Girl Scout cookie and wine pairing.
*  They actually have worked this out and it actually was a lot of fun and educational. It was
*  extremely educational. It works less well for Halloween candy. I don't recommend it. Um, but
*  because too much sugar, candy corn though, with white wine or a shampoo, you know, that white wines
*  go very well. We found with like a short bread or a fruit, we found that a very like plummy
*  Zinfandel went great with a peanut butter cookie. Cause like eating a peanut butter sandwich.
*  But the thing is the thin mints, those Girl Scout cookie mints didn't go with anything. They paired
*  it with an Amarone, which it was dreadful. Was that that olive laden? That olive laden heavy
*  Amarone. Very sugary, almost, you know, it was, I don't like Amarone as Sean does. I'm with you.
*  Apologize to anyone listening. I think it's, it's, it's a palate difference. There's, there's,
*  wine is very subjective. And for me, Amarone is like a punt, is that olive punch to the face.
*  And we combine that with a thin mint, which I normally love. And it was just like, you know,
*  Kung Fu fighting in your mouth. Yeah, I was gonna say that sounds like wrestling. Yeah. Pairing
*  shouldn't like wrestle. Part of loving what you love is not love. Is there anything that goes with
*  mint in the wine? I mean, I was going to say Madeira, although I said with candy corn,
*  that would probably work. So like chocolate, right? Yeah. Yeah. So chocolate and like specifically
*  Tawny Port or old Madeira. But the mint seems to be what makes it hard to pair. Well, I would want
*  to pair. I'd want to play acid off mint. You could do, that might be a fun, man, I wanted,
*  can we do this? I wanted like a dry one. Were they all, were they, was anything sweet that you used?
*  Or was it all dry wines? No, we didn't use any dessert wines. Were they all white, any white wines or no?
*  There was some white, we didn't pair that. We didn't try that with the mint.
*  See, I almost think, I must think like something like a really good, pretty Sauvignon Blanc could
*  attack that with a bit of acidity. Yeah. A bit of acidity. Yeah. I mean, someone suggested a beer
*  would go well with a mint, but it seems to be a very difficult pairing. And that struck me as very
*  curious. So yeah, it's hard to like get your hands on, but like old Cabernet, because there's always
*  a minty, there can be like a eucalyptus kind of thing going on with that. Interesting. Old Bordeaux,
*  old Bordeaux with a mint old scout cookie. I love it. Like, okay, this is what I'm talking about.
*  Yeah, exactly. That's perfect. Old world, new world. Yes. Yes. And old Bordeaux with a high brow and low brow and everything.
*  I mean, it is just like totally all over. That's what I'm about. That is, I mean, yeah, I love that.
*  If it's red, if it got to be old, I would say you're going to want fruit. You need like the fruit to
*  be shed, which I think was other than the olive problem. Was probably the problem there. The olive
*  problem. That like concentration and kind of cakey, almost like viscous nature that a lot of
*  Amarone has. I mean, there's a lot of Amarone, it's like 16 and a half percent. I mean, that is.
*  I don't like that. Yeah. I'm not a huge fan of Amarone, to be honest. More than you, but still not.
*  Anyway, there's two big looming questions here that I got to get to before we finish up. Yeah. One is,
*  you know, there's a bit of mystery not only with wine, but this process of being a sommelier,
*  being a wine expert. You can forget about the certification and so forth. A lot of people like
*  to make themselves feel better by telling themselves that all of wine tasting is a bit of a hoax.
*  Right? I mean, what in your mind goes into, like, how accurate can you be identifying a wine in a
*  blind tasting? How much of it is expertise? How much of it's luck? How much of it's reality? How
*  much of it's perception? Okay. Well, so the blind tasting in the context of wine tasting in an exam
*  setting, let's say, it's deductive. What is it not? What is it not? What is it not? What is it not?
*  Until if I've done that four times, my world is small enough to where, you know, I have a pretty
*  good idea of what's going on. So like, let's take the reds in front of us. Like, so I have two,
*  again, thin skin, thick skin, thin skin, it can only be one of so many things. So I can just,
*  before I've smelled it, like I'm walking up to the table and sitting down, I
*  know that it's not a fair amount of things. Also, you're basically saying you're looking at it and
*  you go, oh, that's thinner. Yeah. Yeah. Thin tend to be lighter, thick tend to be heavier. Like I
*  said, there's like that granache that can straddle both. Zinfandel can be kind of screwy too, but
*  and then age factors into this. But so I haven't tested at the high levels. I don't really care to.
*  I just sort of. You have your job. You have your dream job. I have my gig and I like French wine
*  and I like California wine. And I just straight up don't want to like end up hating wine. And I don't
*  want to like have to memorize all these things that I like really passionate about what I do.
*  And I defend that. So what I was going to say is that, you know, when you're dealing with old wine,
*  things get kind of screwy with the color, like because red wine gets lighter and white wine gets
*  darker. But basically I'm sitting down and OK, thin skin, bright, like ruby, almost magenta kind
*  of color. OK, it's almost certainly not a Syrah. It's basically anything thick skin I can throw out.
*  Smell it. Is it fruit driven? Is it earth driven? And these are broad strokes, but just to illustrate
*  the process, if it's earth driven, it probably is from the old world, from Europe. If it's fruit
*  driven, it could be, but it's probably not. So right there in two steps, I've yanked out a lot
*  of things it can be. If they're white wines, I immediately taste and see if there's residual
*  sugar, because if there is, then my world is really small. Or smell. I hope it's that Marlboro Sauvignon.
*  But and, you know, to go back to what I was talking about with the acid level, the tannin level,
*  the balance between the fruit and the earth flavors. I mean, you can triangulate a lot of
*  things through that, and they're not trying to screw with you. They're not trying to like,
*  they're not going to serve you Santa Barbara County Tempranillo. Like they're serving you
*  classic examples. Yeah. They want to test your actual knowledge, not just the trick. Yeah,
*  yeah. It is hard because, you know, like you asked about, like you mentioned vintage, like that's,
*  you know, oh, is it 78? Is it 61? You know, that is part rote memorization of like classic vintages
*  and just how vintages function in different regions. And that's definitely, there's a learning
*  curve to that. And it's really hard to taste those wines. You have to either have a trust fund or you
*  have to be a sommelier basically. Or be an expert in super expensive. Or work. Well, but not even
*  just expensive, but like getting your hands on old wines that have been stored well, that are going
*  to show like they should show, like, which they tend to go up in price. But I'm not even talking
*  about the astronomical stuff. It's just, that's a hard thing to come across and hard thing to
*  have an extensive mental Rolodex to be able to dial through and go, okay, I think it's, I think
*  it's 30, 40 years old. I think it's Bordeaux. Okay. So what's 70? I got, you know, 75. That's classic.
*  Showing more tertiary flavors than something like a ripe 82 would. I don't think it's 82.
*  Could be 86. Weird, funky. You know, you're going like that. Like you're jumping through
*  the hurdles. But, you know, if you, with the deductive process, you can get pretty close and,
*  you know, you got to show your work, right? It's, you can't just like show up and like,
*  bam, like I drank, you know, I'm killing it. I had this last night. It's, you know, 1990 domain
*  Jameco Roti. Boom. Why? You know, a lot long division. So, and it is useful. It's humbling.
*  Oh my God. But it's real. I mean, it's real. Yeah, I know it is. Yeah, of course. I mean,
*  people who are good at it and people who are not good at it. Yeah. And so what I, so I love,
*  so this makes me think of, I get this a lot at the restaurant, like,
*  oh, you must have a great palette to do what you do. It's like, well,
*  I can, I think I have my mind, I split hairs well, right? So, and it's like the palette,
*  like if you do it enough, there's a scene in the Psalm documentary where they taught the best
*  way to describe it. No one's a natural board samurai sword maker. Like you had a teacher
*  that had a teacher that had a teacher. And if you taste 20, 25 wines a night, five days a week for
*  even a month, much less a couple of years, and you're paying attention to the amount of wine
*  a couple of years and you're paying attention at all, your palette will exponentially quote,
*  improve. You just have more things to play off. Right. You know, Sean mentioned the sort of
*  backlash against wine that it's all BS that, you know, there really is no difference. And there's
*  a famous example where, you know, people like to cite that, you know, sommeliers were blindfolded
*  and couldn't tell the difference between red, white and white wine. And that always bothered
*  me because to me the sensory experience of wine is not just the taste or rather taste is smell,
*  it's vision, it's everything that goes along with it. It's a much more complicated thing.
*  And the minute you blindfold somebody, you're tying both their hands behind their back.
*  Yeah. I mean, I just think like, okay, what are you trying to do? A like what, what happened to you
*  that you're like really against this? Yeah. Like what is the problem, man?
*  And I mean, a lot of people take this way too seriously. Yeah. Let's be having fun.
*  Let's be having fun. Let's not forget. I mean, it is a fascinating subject matter.
*  No one ever is going to know everything about it. It's the chasing the horizon of, you know,
*  trying to learn, have this perspective on it. And it's people screwed up. Yeah. People
*  don't know that or insecure about it and want to. I mean, having said that, okay, let's be fair.
*  Yeah. It makes, we've been in restaurants where there have been better and worse sommeliers.
*  Totally. And that's partly an ability to distinguish wines, but it's also
*  sort of a human interaction. Like what do they want kind of thing?
*  It is hospitality before it's anything else. And it's entertainment, especially that when you're,
*  you know, actually not even, I was going to say at the level of, you know, these Michelin star
*  fancy restaurants, no, it's, I resent that statement at every level. It is entertainment
*  and going out to dinner should be fun. And if you are privileged enough to get to say that you make
*  your money from being a sommelier, you, there is a like ideological philosophical weight on your
*  shoulders to not be a douchebag. Yeah. Please. Right. Please. It's true.
*  Probably incompletely satisfied by the set of sommeliers in the world.
*  I mean, I always say, I think the Psalm documentaries have done a lot to help it.
*  Good. I always say like being a cosmologist should make you humble.
*  Yes. Compared to the universe, you're very small. And yet there are plenty of cosmologists who don't
*  really fulfill this expectation. Yeah. Like let's figure out how little we know.
*  Yeah. That's right. That is the, like at the end of the day,
*  you know, there'll be a last time you taste wine and like it's not something that
*  is this competitive thing. Is this lord it over people, like culture that I unfortunately
*  see just from clientele or not even client from sommeliers, you know, like, oh, I'm drinking this,
*  I'm drinking that. It's like, cool. Then be humble. Right. And you're privileged. Right.
*  And, you know, a lot of us get to drink wines that like kings of countries are never going to taste.
*  So it's like, cool. Like fortunate enough to choose, or to choose his path and fortunate enough to get
*  to pull it off. You have to wield that with, with humility and, and, and empathy for you. It is not
*  your dinner. Yeah. It is your two dinner. It is the guest dinner. It is not like, what do you want?
*  If you want Barolo and oysters, like, let's do it. I, if that's what, if you were in Pemonte and you
*  had this Barolo that lit your whole world on fire and you were eating oysters and you want to recreate
*  that. And I'm just going like, Whoa, that is nothing. Nothing is going to work about that.
*  Everything works about that. If you're sitting there with your, like all the systems go,
*  everything firing, like this is about having fun. And let's not forget, like you're consuming
*  alcohol. Like, why are you becoming more of a douche? Like everything is, everything is all good.
*  Except that the world is falling apart. So the final issue that I want to talk about is the idea
*  that, you know, our climate is changing. Why we've already indirectly hit upon the fact that it is,
*  it is changing. This is not up for debate here at Mindscape. How does it affect it? I can see at
*  least two possibilities if there isn't a fact, which I'm sure there is. One would be like wine
*  throughout the world gets worse because we're growing it in climates that we're not used to.
*  But then there's the more optimistic possibility that, you know, wine just changes. We make champagne
*  in Britain rather than in champagne. Make sparkling wine in Britain. Sparkling wine, yes.
*  But, you know, maybe the wine will change, but be just as good. I don't know. How should
*  be optimistic or pessimistic here? Well, I mean, I don't, after having said what I just said,
*  I think I have no choice but to be optimistic about it. I don't know what the point would be.
*  I mean, it's good. It is changing. It's already changed. I've been involved in wine and interested
*  in wine, loving wine for 11 years. And even in that amount of time, it's changed. You know,
*  looking at like we talked about alcohol levels in regions, like they are going up and it's not
*  just due to like the critic thing, like I mentioned, as part of it, but like just
*  things are heating up and vintages, especially in the kind of marginal places become more erratic.
*  Like you see that in Burgundy, you see more hail in like spring and in the summer, which they
*  deal with a fair amount, but that reduces the yields. So there's less wine. That's a whole other
*  thing that doesn't get talked about a lot with what climate change is going to do. You know,
*  everything's heating up. Riteness levels are going to go up, but each vineyard, like there needs to
*  be vintages that let the vineyards like reset. Like in times I was at this producer in Volnais
*  in Burgundy, the Marquis d'Andreville, this amazing winery. And the proprietor was talking about how
*  they're situated in this specific place in Volnais where these basically valleys cut into the hill
*  that makes up Burgundy called Combes and winds come through there and cool down the vineyards
*  on the edges, but then also bring in storms. And he said that there's a lot of cyclical storms,
*  like they'll get hit one year at one time. They're like, oh, okay. So the next two,
*  so that's happening more yields going down while things are getting riper. So that right there,
*  just the straight math of that I think about, because I've been mentioning how wine ages and
*  older wines are beautiful. Well, okay. So there's obviously time is ticking the arrow of time.
*  Someone I know said, the wines are being made now are going to take, let's say the top, top level
*  Burgundies and Bordeaux from like 2015 vintage. Those are at least 20, probably 30, 40 plus year
*  wines before they're really firing on all cylinders. And those are being made in a time where we know
*  more about viticulture than we ever have. And there's less of them. And because they're riper,
*  they're more accessible young. So people get trigger happy. So like the allocations that used
*  to be cases are now bottles and people are popping them. So when you extrapolate this out,
*  the amount of people that are really going to know what 2015 Richebourg is drinking is smaller.
*  And then you combine that with the way that markets have gone crazy. The prices have just
*  gone through the roof. It's this unsustainable in certain regions. I don't know if there's a
*  correction that's going to happen or just things are like, talks about how these, the marginal
*  places, not even the marginal places, but what are now like in the Goldilocks zone, you fast forward
*  the clock, the grape makeup might have to be replanted. This sacrilegious sentence of like,
*  so like is Pinot Noir really what should be in Burgundy in 15 years?
*  Are the winemakers really facing up to this, you think?
*  Well, you're also doing what they're really in places in certain times, certain people,
*  like a kind of dogmatic way. It's a traditionalist occupation.
*  The European wine world works. But yeah, there's a couple of like avant-garde people like that are
*  experimenting with Syrah and Burgundy and things like the Willamette Valley in Oregon,
*  that will be good for a minute. But then like maybe some Syrah there wouldn't be a bad thing.
*  But then you look at like Napa, like you're already at Cab, you know, like where do you go?
*  There's water to some degree.
*  Can I say Cab is just that really hot?
*  Cabernet Sauvignon, sorry.
*  Yeah, Cabernet.
*  Oh yeah, it handles warm climates well.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get at here.
*  Yeah, it's a resilient grape, can handle a lot.
*  The way that canopies are trimmed is another thing I've heard people talk about, where
*  you know, depending on which way, like if you're in the northern hemisphere, for example,
*  the vineyard faces south, you get better exposure to the sun than the vineyard faces north.
*  So people are planting north facing vineyards and not trimming the canopy as much so that you have
*  more cover, things like that. But that's a band-aid if you're really looking at this macro view.
*  Another thing that no one knows what's, you know, how to deal with it all the way.
*  There's these, you know, experiments going on, but it's already much different than it was
*  if you even just take the 21st century.
*  It sounds like, you know, people are doing things, there's reasons to think that there
*  will be changes, but not, you know, the end of the world kind of changes, yet it would be nicer if
*  we did not destroy the planet.
*  Yeah, no, it's true. And, you know, the reality that, I forget what the exact stat is, but like,
*  you know, just take like gasoline cars, for example, like you just snap your fingers and,
*  you know, no more made and everyone's electric, you're still 25, 30 years out before those are
*  in the junkyard. Like, you know, like trains obviously left the station. So I think that,
*  you know, it's not as simple as like, oh, so we like pick earlier. Well,
*  you also have to physiologically ripen the grid, like, again, band-aid, like it won't,
*  it's not sustainable. Yeah, it's, you already see it. The main way I see it is in the production,
*  which is ironic because you're like, oh, it's getting warmer. Like the yields can be higher,
*  but not necessarily, especially since I'm dealing with mainly European wines, the erratic nature of
*  the finages is the kicker. I mean, it's a, I always like to end the podcast on optimistic note,
*  but I will make a slight exception here. We've had plenty of optimism. There is plenty of
*  optimism, but also, you know, we have to face up to the reality that this is part of the complexity
*  and joy and pleasure of wine compared to other things is the ancientness of it, the tradition
*  of it, the fact that so much knowledge is just empirical. We're not exactly sure why we can't
*  point to the right chemical compounds and say, this is what makes it good, but we know that
*  growing it and making this way makes it good. And that's changing. And that's kind of a shame.
*  We're doing everything people, people are doing things to make it better, but there's a possibly
*  something will be lost. And so again, more reason to enjoy it while we have. Yeah, definitely. Well,
*  and, you know, I mean, something, something will be lost, but, you know, again, like being optimistic,
*  we know more now than we did when these storied vintage legendary wines were made. So the best
*  wines being made are being made now. Yeah, we're drinking better wine than Thomas Jefferson ever
*  could have made. Yes. Yes, totally. And that's not stopping. So there is adaptation, there's evolution
*  that, I mean, will happen, you know, like by choice or not, basically. And what are we going to do?
*  Yeah, we got to, I mean, also Thomas Jefferson never appeared on a podcast once in his life.
*  So that is true. Too bad for him. Really. All right. Matthew, Lucy, thanks so much for being
*  here. Thanks for bringing the wine. Thank you, Jennifer, Willette for joining us. Cheers.
*  Cheers. This is a great experience. I'm looking forward to my next trip to Melisse. All about it.
*  Thanks, Shawn.
