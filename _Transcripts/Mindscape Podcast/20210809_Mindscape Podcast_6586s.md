Blog post with audio player, show notes, and transcript: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2021/08/09/159-mari-ruti-on-lack-love-and-psychoanalysis/

Neuroscience has given us great insights into how our brains work. But there is still room for purely humanistic disciplines to help us think through our thoughts and emotions, not to mention the meaning of our lives. Mari Ruti is a professor of English literature, with expertise in critical theory, gender studies, and psychoanalysis, especially the work of French theorist Jacques Lacan. We talk about the psychological drive that is motivated by what Lacan calls “lack,” which is related to “desire.” We use this as a way to think about such essential human experiences as mourning, creativity, and love. (We don’t talk about love enough here on the podcast.)

Mari Ruti received her Ph.D. in comparative literature from Harvard University. She is currently a Distinguished Professor of critical theory and gender and sexuality studies at the University of Toronto. She is the co-editor of the Psychoanalytic Horizons book series for Bloomsbury.

# Mindscape 159 | Mari Ruti on Lack, Love, and Psychoanalysis
**Mindscape Podcast:** [August 09, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK6rpDBywSQ)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Longtime listeners
*  know that we do a lot of different kinds of topics here on the podcast, but there is a heavy dose of
*  things like physics, biology, philosophy. But if you think back, the very first episode was with a
*  psychologist, Carol Tavris. We've had a couple of psychologists on since then, Lisa Feldman Barrett,
*  Scott Barry Kaufman. What we haven't talked about on Mindscape is psychoanalysis. Psychology is just
*  a general study of how people think, how they behave, and so forth. Whereas psychoanalysis is
*  the specific set of ideas, a school of thought, if you will, founded by Sigmund Freud. It's
*  actually weighed down by association with a lot of Freud's ideas that, let's just say, aren't fully
*  baked. Freud was not right about everything. He was dramatically wrong about some things. So there's
*  this sort of caricature of psychoanalysis with things like the Oedipal complex that men want to
*  sleep with their mothers, penis envy that women have, and things like that. Things that haven't
*  held up over time. And in fact, I think it's safe to say that in psychology circles, there aren't a
*  lot of psychology professors who are in the psychoanalytic tradition these days. But psychoanalysis
*  lives on in literary and certain philosophical corners of academia. Not as a way of necessarily
*  being a clinical practice, although there is that, but as a way of thinking about human beings and
*  how they behave in a way to sort of understand ourselves better. And that's what we're going to
*  be talking about today. And to make things worse, today's guest, Mari Ruti, is a professor in the
*  English department at the University of Toronto. She's the only person in the world who I would
*  trust to talk to you, my audience, about these topics we're going to be talking about today.
*  Because it's not just psychoanalysis. It's the particular kinds of psychoanalysis that are
*  influenced and thought about by French theorists, most especially Jacques Lacan, a famous French
*  psychoanalyst and literary critical theorist, etc. And these ideas, you know, again, I'm pretty
*  sure that most of the folks here in my audience are not by nature sympathetic to these kinds of
*  ideas. Isn't that like postmodernism and all this anti-science, anti-real world stuff? So what I ask
*  you is to listen to the podcast that is in front of you, because Mari is the best in the world at
*  taking that set of ideas and making them clear and helping us understand which subset of that
*  ideas are actually worth listening to. And you might not at the end come away buying it. That's
*  completely fine, right? I don't ask you to buy it. The idea of Mindscape is that I don't even buy
*  everything that people who I have on are going to be talking about, right? I don't buy everything
*  that Lee Smolin or David Chalmers actually says, but I respect what these people have to say. And
*  if I don't understand something, I want to give it a charitable, careful listen before I make my
*  decisions. And if you are at all interested in understanding the set of ideas better and would
*  like to think about it carefully and know enough about it to make your own judgments, you've come
*  to the right place. And actually, I'm even being too negative to say that. I think there are really
*  good, really important ideas here that can influence how we think about ourselves in interesting
*  ways. In the middle of this episode, I asked Mari to indulge me a little bit, and I made an
*  extended analogy between Lacanian psychoanalysis and entropy in the arrow of time and out of
*  equilibrium physics. And it may or may not stand up to higher scrutiny, but it's the kind of thing
*  I think is interesting and worth thinking about. And so with that in mind, let's go.
*  Mari Rudy, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Well, thank you for having me. It's really an
*  honor to be invited. I'm very grateful to have this conversation with you. Sure, I think it's
*  gonna be a lot of fun because it is a bit of a departure. You know, I ended up saying at the
*  beginning of half of my podcast, this is a departure from what we usually do. So maybe it's a
*  little bit, maybe I should just qualify the boundaries as wider away than they really are.
*  But anyway, so let's just dive into perhaps the most, the thing that's gonna happen to the
*  minds of the audiences when they hear what we're talking about, which is the word psychoanalysis,
*  right? I mean, this is a fraught word in the modern age. We instantly think about 100 years ago,
*  Sigmund Freud, patients on a couch, Freud telling them that if they're guys, they want to have sex
*  with their mother, if they're women, they have penis envy or something like that. And a lot of
*  this has been the subject of enormous criticism over many, many years. And so much so that many
*  people have abandoned it. But there's a bunch of people who want to say that there are valuable
*  insights there. When we take some of these ideas and put them into a more modern context, you're
*  one of those people. So I mean, how about just starting with the general sales pitch for why we
*  should take psychoanalysis seriously here at the first fifth or first quarter of the 21st century?
*  Okay, so the entire time you were talking, I had to suppress my laughter, because I didn't
*  want to laugh over you. Everything you say is right. I can just imagine your listeners already
*  rolling their eyes at the very word psychoanalysis. And I'm very used to this resistance because I
*  teach the topic to undergraduates every year. So I get a new bunch of people every single semester
*  who have only heard snippets about psychoanalysis and usually not the good parts. So they know
*  things like Freud used cocaine and they know about penis envy and stuff like that, but they
*  don't really know much about it. But then I have to admit that, or I guess I should say I'm proud
*  of the fact that within three weeks, I will have re-inculcated them. I will have indoctrinated them
*  to the point that my colleagues in the hallway start telling me to stop talking about some of
*  the concepts, because apparently the students who are in my classes can't stop talking about
*  the psychoanalytic concepts that I have introduced them to in their other classes, which then drives
*  my colleagues crazy. So I know how to break the resistance, but I'm not sure I'm able to do this
*  during this very podcast. But I will just start by saying that there are actually a lot of academics
*  on the level of professors and graduate students who are combining psychoanalysis with, usually
*  with continental philosophy and contemporary theory. And in some ways, it's difficult for us
*  to think about a time before the current version of psychoanalysis took over the humanities and to
*  some extent, even the social sciences. There was a period when it was like a complete no-no.
*  Serious academics did not take it seriously. But these days, a lot of people in the humanities and
*  even some in the social sciences do. But it's a very specific version of psychoanalysis.
*  I'm going to mostly be drawing on a French thinker, a post-Freudian psychoanalyst and
*  theoretician called Jacques Lacan. His last name is spelled L-A-C-A-N in case no one has heard of
*  him. But he's among the, I would say, top like 10 most famous French thinkers of the 20th century,
*  which is saying a lot. You can compare him to people like Sartre or de Beauvoir,
*  Derrida, Foucault, people like that. And he was part of the revolution that happened in the American
*  Academy in the humanities during the 80s and 90s when French theory kind of took the American
*  Academy like a big wave, like a storm. And there was a lot of resistance, but also, like I said,
*  there's like kind of no going back to the pre-psychoanalytic moment because it did
*  transform so many fields. Sorry, I know that you're right in the beginning of this, but let me just
*  again so we can orient the audience. And I've resisted this, but I think that there's a lot
*  of people out there who maybe don't know about the resistance. But there's this feeling, this
*  caricature, that that exact wave of French influence of sort of postmodernism and post-structuralism
*  that came to the US in the 80s and 90s is all about just denying the existence of reality and
*  saying there's no such thing as truth and you can't do anything. I think that is not where you're
*  coming from, but maybe point that out or tell me that you are coming from there. Yeah, no,
*  thank you so much. That's an excellent clarification to ask for. One reason that I'm
*  attracted to psychoanalysis specifically is that it's the one component of that so-called
*  post-structuralist theory that did not give up on a lot of things that I did not want to lose.
*  I feel like post-structuralism, say Derrida and Foucault, those people, they got rid of
*  things like truth and also like in some ways psychological complexity and psychological life,
*  it became all about power and signifiers. It became very, very cold. The human being just got
*  taken out of the equation as did any understanding of truth. The psychoanalytic understanding of
*  truth is very different from your understanding of it, but at least in Lacanian theory, there is
*  such a thing and it has to do with the truth of desire, which I can talk about later. But
*  that's probably not the best place to start right off the bat. I do want to talk about desire,
*  though, so we'll get back to that. Psychoanalysis drew me specifically because it did not take away
*  all those things that the rest of post-structuralist theory did. It's only really
*  specialists who understand that there's a distinction between someone like Lacan and
*  someone like Jacques Derrida. A lot of people lump them together, but those of us who study
*  the field understand that they are coming from very different places.
*  Well, and again, that sounds perfect. Thank you very much for that clarification.
*  The other thing that people are going to be raising their hackles about is don't these people
*  intentionally try to be impossible to understand? I know that your whole thing, the thing you're
*  famous for is making these impossible to understand things understandable, which is why we have you on
*  the podcast and not the ghost of Jacques Lacan. Yes, I do have the reputation for being
*  the one lucid Lacanian, the one person who can, well, there are others, but people often email
*  me and say, oh, wow, I read your book and this is the first time I ever understand Lacan. He's
*  one of the most incomprehensible, he's probably the most incomprehensible of all of the incomprehensible
*  thinkers in French theory. He is like when I asked my graduate students to read one of his
*  books, they will come to class and say, I didn't understand any of this. I literally did not
*  understand more than 5% of this. And that was my own experience also when I started reading him,
*  but over the years I've gotten pretty good at deciphering what he had to say. And okay, so the
*  short answer to the question that you're asking, it kind of has, well, it has two components.
*  Poststructuralism, broadly speaking, was interested in subverting the idea that meaning is
*  transparent. So they started writing intentionally in this completely incomprehensible, aggravatingly
*  opaque way to make people struggle with the idea that they could understand everything that they
*  read. So that's one component, kind of a political, ethical component. And that had to do with taking
*  down Western epistemological models that were centered around a certain type of clarity and
*  certain type of logical reasoning. But then when you come to Lacan himself, it also has to do with
*  the fact that he intentionally wanted to speak the language of the unconscious, which is basically
*  gibberish, which is why many of his lectures sound like complete gibberish. So you have to kind of
*  allow yourself to enter into that space of the unconscious to understand anything that he's saying.
*  It's very intuitive. And if you're trying to kind of go at it with logic in mind, you're never going
*  to, you're not going to get anywhere. But yeah, that's a really good question. Okay, I'll let you
*  resume the psychoanalysis glossary. Okay, so I wanted to say right off the bat that I am not
*  interested personally, I'm not, I'm not interested in things like gender and sexuality and the
*  oedipus complex and penis envy and stuff like that. I think that those are outdated concepts.
*  I'm also not interested in claiming that psychoanalysis is some sort of a science.
*  Because I mean, Freud was a neurologist before he became a psychoanalyst. And I know that there's
*  some work in contemporary neuroscience that is drawing connections to Freudian thought in
*  interesting ways, but I'm not an expert on those. For me, psychoanalysis is kind of a
*  philosophy of everyday life. It's a mythology of human ontology, what it is that makes us
*  who we are, what causes us to behave in the ways that we behave. So think of it as a
*  mythological thing, rather than an attempt to give you a scientific basis for anything,
*  take it with a grain of salt. At the same time, it has incredibly, like, in my opinion, really
*  insightful points to make about human beings and everyday life. And I'm just going to mention
*  three points really quickly. And then hopefully you can prod me with further questions. So the
*  things that most interest me about a Latinian theory specifically, and also more broadly
*  psychoanalysis, but he does have a specific take that I can also talk more about in a bit. But
*  the three things that I take from his theory specifically are, first of all, the fact that
*  he understands human ontology to be based on this sense that we are lacking something, that there is
*  this emptiness or hollowness or nothingness within our being. And as you know, people like
*  Jean-Paul Sartre had the same idea. I mean, his famous book is called Being and Nothingness. So
*  Lacan is not the only person to think in those terms, but he had a very good explanation for why
*  we feel like that, why we feel like we have lost something kind of unfathomably precious,
*  that we cannot get back. And then the idea is that because of that lack, we have desire.
*  And because of desire, we try to seek all kinds of ways of filling that lack, including things
*  like writing books or creative endeavors or other intellectual endeavors or whatever it is that makes
*  human life sort of meaningful to people. Hosting podcasts. Sorry? Hosting podcasts is what makes
*  life meaningful, I think, here in 2021. That's a really good... Okay, so that's your way of
*  filling your life, but you also have done it in many other ways, like writing a gazillion books,
*  as I have. So we have that in common. But that's definitely... I know that that's like my pathology,
*  that's my symptom. Writing books is my symptom. It's the only way I can deal with the ontological
*  nothingness. Okay, that was the first point. Second is that Lacan came to the conclusion that,
*  unlike during Freud's time, we are no longer living in a society of repression. So Freud talked
*  about sexual repression and how we become symptomatic when our sexuality is repressed
*  in various ways. Lacan was like... Because he was writing in the 50s, 60s and 70s, and he was like,
*  that's no longer the case in our society. Our problem is actually the opposite, meaning that
*  we are inundated with enjoyment, what he called enjoyment. And we have just like almost too many
*  sources of enjoyment available to us. Like every possible kind of porn is available to us
*  on the internet. So it's not like our sexuality is repressed. Rather, we're kind of overwhelmed by
*  the abundance of possibilities for satisfaction. Okay, so that was the second point. And then the
*  third, and I'll say this quickly, because there's a lot here to unpack, but I think that psychoanalysis
*  really excellent at explaining, Lacanian psychoanalysis specifically is really excellent at explaining
*  various components of everyday life, such as desire, love. This is how I hook my students
*  right away. I start talking about desire and love, and they're like, oh, please give us more.
*  Trauma, loss, alienation, mourning, melancholia, depression, and also importantly, the way in which
*  we tend to repeat hurtful patterns of behavior, even when we really don't want to repeat them.
*  We keep doing it anyway. We tell ourselves that we're gonna change our way of doing things,
*  but somehow we can't. And psychoanalysis is good at explaining that through what Freud already
*  theorized as the repetition compulsion. Okay, I will pause there and give you a chance to speak.
*  Applying for jobs can be incredibly stressful, but hiring people can also be stressful. Getting
*  the right people into your organization can make or break whatever it is you're trying to do.

*  Go to Indeed.com slash Mindscape. Yeah, no, I mean, there's a tremendous amount there and I
*  hope we're going to get a chance to go through all of it. But before we dive into these specifics,
*  with those points in mind, let's say a little bit more about the general angle that we're taking
*  here. I mean, I like it that you said very explicitly you're not pretending to be a
*  scientist, right? That was one of the criticisms of Freud in particular is that he really, really,
*  really wanted to be taken seriously as a scientist. And the fellow scientists are like, eh,
*  predict something that I wouldn't have been able to predict otherwise. Otherwise, I'm not going to
*  take you too seriously. But if you reformulate the approach as more of a, I'm not even sure if
*  it's a philosophy of life, but as a set of insights that are relevant to the philosophy of life,
*  then it seems to make more sense to me. It is, and that's maybe one of the reasons why it was very
*  popular in literature and English departments as opposed to philosophy or neuroscience departments.
*  And it actually, for other reasons, I've been reading, don't take me too seriously here,
*  because it's not very deep reading, but I've been reading some early Chinese philosophy.
*  And, you know, these people are very brilliant and the warring states period and Confucius and
*  Zhuangzi, etc. But they're not the sort of setting up systems of logic or political ethics that we
*  think of as the standard Western version of philosophy. It's much more like living your life.
*  And maybe part of this is just reclaiming the idea that understanding how to live your life is a very
*  valuable endeavor. Absolutely. First of all, I should say that Lacanian theory has very
*  deep connections to Eastern philosophy, the whole idea of being built around a void or nothing.
*  That's central to a lot of Eastern philosophy. But yeah, I do like to think about it as a
*  philosophy of everyday life. And when cab drivers inevitably ask me what I write on or what I teach,
*  I tell them that I work on the meaning of life. And then they ask me, what is the meaning of life?
*  And I say, well, the meaning of life is that there is no meaning. So that's usually how the conversation
*  goes. However, even though in some ways, there is no meaning, there is a lot of like bits of
*  meaning to be drawn from this particular way of looking at the world. And one thing I forgot to
*  mention in my introductory comments that I do want to get out is that when Lacan started writing in
*  the 1950s, and he also started giving annual lecture series, and they went on for like 30 years.
*  And initially, he had a very tiny audience that was composed of such just specialists. But he very
*  quickly developed a reputation in Paris. So in the 1960s and 70s, when Paris was really like the
*  Parisian intellectual community was generating a lot of really interesting ideas, philosophical
*  ideas, and in their view, psychoanalysis was part of philosophy. So during those two decades,
*  pretty much anyone who was anyone in the Parisian intellectual scene in the humanities and some of
*  the social sciences attended his lectures, which became huge. And so he had an impact on a whole
*  generation of French thinkers that came just slightly after him. Like he was kind of
*  pittering out in the late 70s. And people like Derrida started writing in the late 60s. So
*  he influenced the whole generation of thinkers. And that influence had a lot to do with that
*  notion of lack that I keep referring to. Do I remember correctly the anecdote that Lacan
*  at some point came to give a lecture and then once everyone was assembled, he just stood there
*  silently for an hour and then he left? Is that a true story? Yes, absolutely. So he has a reputation
*  for being a troublemaker, a maverick, just kind of a crazy person. He would also do things like
*  throw items at the audience members, like books and pens and pencils and stuff like that. And
*  towards the end of his life when he was becoming very interested in math, and you'll laugh at this,
*  and I know that this is a part of Lacan that I don't really touch except for the content,
*  because I don't understand any of his mathematical equations, but his very late work is full of math,
*  mathematical equations. And when I talk to specialists who actually understand math,
*  they claim that they don't really make any sense, which I understand because also his written
*  text doesn't make any sense. But the reason I'm talking about this is that he came to New York
*  City, I think it was New York, to give a major talk and he stood on the stage playing with knots
*  because he was interested in knot theory and math at that point. And so he didn't say anything. He
*  was just standing there and playing with these knots with like ropes and stuff like that.
*  And finally his audience just kind of gave up and left. So yeah, he was an eccentric.
*  A brilliant eccentric.
*  It does remind me, this is completely non-substantive and just silly, but it reminds me
*  of the story about Derrida, who gave a talk at some point. It was in the United States,
*  so he was speaking in English, not his first language, and he was always apologetic about
*  his English. And he, for some reason, he was given this entire talk about cows. And the whole
*  audience is like, why is he talking about cows? Like, I don't know what cows have to do with what
*  he's saying. And then he ends the talk and then it's the question period and he talks to the
*  organizer or whatever, the moderator, and then he comes back to the microphone and says,
*  I'm informed it is pronounced chaos.
*  That's perfect. Makes perfect sense.
*  Yes. So you have to do some exegesis. You have to do some little work here. But good. So yeah,
*  two more points. I wanted to sort of use sort of big picture points before we get into your more
*  details. One is the idea that even though you're not claiming to be a scientist and you're not
*  following Freud in that way, there clearly is science that is relevant here, right? We've
*  learned a lot more about neuroscience than we have learned before. And the specific point that you
*  raise that reminded me of that was the repetition compulsion instinct, whatever it is. What do I call
*  it? The repetition compulsion?
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Okay. That's something that is absolutely based in neuroscience. And in fact, I had a very
*  interesting podcast with Robin Carhart-Harris, who uses psychoactive drugs, uses LSD and other things
*  to help treat those kinds of things. So I'm a believer that sort of both approaches are valid.
*  I mean, if we understand these things qualitatively and can sort of come to grips with what's going on,
*  that's valid. And if we understand what is going on in the neurons, that's also helpful.
*  Yeah, that's really great. And so now I'm going to go back to Freud because I mean, one of his
*  groundbreaking ideas that I think is still relevant today is that he had this idea that
*  our bodies or our drive energies have been wired in specific pathways. And it's possible for those
*  pathways to become really fixed. And that's part of what he meant by symptomatic behavior. And
*  that's partly what he meant by the repetition compulsion. You're going to mentally hardwire to
*  repeat certain kinds of actions, but also on a physical level. I'll use myself as an example.
*  You know me pretty well. I've always been someone who has an excess of energy. Lacan calls this
*  jouissance. It's just a French word for like pleasure, but it can be pleasure that is so
*  intense that it's kind of painful. And so basically, Freud already had this idea that
*  our pathways of energy, jouissance, whatever you want to call it, are configured in specific ways.
*  And the whole point of psychoanalysis as a clinical practice, like when people go to analysis for
*  years and years and years, is to reconfigure those pathways, is to break the usual pathways
*  and create new ones. And that absolutely has to do with neuroscience. And I wish that I knew more
*  about the current research that is being done in the field, because I know that there is a lot that
*  is being done that is explicitly comparing psychoanalytic findings to current neuroscientific
*  findings. And I know that they are finding interesting overlaps. I just don't know enough
*  about neuroscience to be able to speak to any specifics. But I do know that the breaking of
*  those patterns and the breaking of those kind of pathways through your body and your psyche was at
*  the chest of what Freud was trying to accomplish. Yeah, no, it sounds like there's a lot of fruitful
*  things to be thought about there. Okay. And the final big picture question or point I wanted to
*  raise was when you talk about the existentialist sort of angle here, and I don't know, it's not
*  really nihilism or despair, but it's a search for meaning when meaning has been lost to us. So this
*  circles back to questions of atheism and religion and things like that, right? I mean, is part of
*  the need for this analysis that we now live in a world where God is dead and we need to, I mean,
*  I'm certainly a big proponent that we need to construct not only purpose and meaning,
*  but also morality and ethics and things like that. And this is part of that overall project. Is that
*  fair? Yeah, that's really fair. I mean, I agree with you on everything that you just said.
*  And I think that on some level, what at least Lacanian Psychoanalysis is trying to do is to
*  allow us to figure out how to deal with that lack within our being without resorting to some sort of
*  a theological or otherwise sort of otherworldly explanation or an attempt to cope with it or even
*  cure it. Okay, so if we start from the premise that he gives us, meaning that we feel like there's
*  this void within our being, then you can see how religion would be an incredibly selective
*  ideology, the idea of an afterlife where you kind of reward it for your present suffering. It's an
*  incredibly seductive way to deal with that lack. And I think a lot of people do deal with it that
*  way. However, what is distinctive about Lacanian analysis, and this is why he's beloved by a lot
*  of academics in America, but he's not really popular with a lot of American clinicians because
*  he basically argued that the best way we can handle this sense of lack is to acknowledge that
*  there is no cure for it, that we just have to learn how to cope with it. And the idea was that
*  as soon as you acknowledge the impossibility of a cure, you could actually start devoting your
*  energies to things that make your life meaningful. And I mentioned writing books, you mentioned
*  podcasts, but not everyone is an intellectual or an artist, painting paintings and writing books
*  and stuff like that. People have various ways of finding meaning in their lives that are sort of
*  more everyday than what we intellectuals do. But the point is that he was trying to give his
*  patients and also his audience members the ability to think about how to make their lives
*  meaningful without resorting to the idea of God. That said, he was very knowledgeable about
*  Christianity and I think was born Catholic, but he was still an atheist. So it's a complicated
*  relation to religion, but definitely like a secular attempt to deal with this nothingness
*  within our being. And to understand this nothingness as a kind of a springboard for
*  everything that is meaningful about human life, including desire and love and our capacity to
*  connect with other people. I can explain all of that in more detail if you want, but it was kind
*  of like this idea that the lack was not our enemy, it actually was the foundation of everything good
*  about human life. So actually, that's exactly what I do want to hear you expound on a little bit more.
*  But if you will indulge me for a minute, I want to propose an analogy or maybe it's even an
*  equivalence with physics concepts here because just now I'm really scared about the world.
*  But I'll creep up on it by talking a little bit about Antonio de Masio, who was a previous
*  guest I had on the podcast, he's a neuroscientist. And so his way his big words are homeostasis
*  and feelings. And what he means by this is, so when I translate that into physics terms,
*  what he means by this is this, you know, if you have a box of gas, this is a typical physicist
*  move, you have a box of gas, you let it reach equilibrium, it becomes comes to a temperature,
*  and it'll just sit there forever. Like if you seal the box away from the outside world, it's fine,
*  it's going to stay in exactly that condition for all time. But we human beings are any living
*  being. We're not like that. We're not equilibrium systems that we can seal off. Like if you seal
*  us off, we will die. And at the very fundamental physiological level, we need food and we need air
*  and we need things like that. And then so this is what de Masio is talking about homeostasis is
*  the attempt to more or less regulate our physiology into its proper zone. But it's something that needs
*  to be an active process. It won't you need to get fuel, you need to get the right kinds of
*  stimulation, etc. And to me, the psychological version of that, sorry, there is a psychological
*  version of that also. And this is where feelings comes in. He you know, he his word for feel,
*  the reason why he cares about feelings rather than emotions is he thinks of feelings as the sort of
*  more primitive impulses that your body and brain are giving you to saying something's not quite
*  right. Let's fix it a little bit, right? This deviation from homeostasis. And so like so the
*  physics lingo is human beings are out of equilibrium systems, we have some more or less steady state,
*  but it's like in my analogy, it's like you're a surfer riding a rate away. It's not like you're a
*  rock on the beach, you need to continually do little adjustments, right to make sure you don't
*  fall off. And so that's why so coming back to what you've said, sorry for the for taking over
*  a little bit. But that's why I like this emphasis on the fact that we shouldn't be seeking the once
*  and for all cure. That's like saying we should be seeking the state of being where we don't eat
*  anymore, right? We are constantly going to be lacking something driven to sort of fulfill some
*  extra desire. We're not we're not reaching a state of perfect happiness. And that's okay. That's part
*  of the process once you realize that human beings are out of equilibrium systems. So
*  what about that? That's my question.
*  Well, okay, once again, I agree with everything you said, if I understood it correctly. And that's a
*  really interesting way of thinking about the matter. I mean, so to translate this into like
*  psychoanalytic terms, when when people go to analysis, it's usually because they feel like
*  they are off balance, they are out of equilibrium in one way or another, and they are seeking to
*  figure out how to fix that. I mean, most commonly, they go in because they feel like they're not
*  being loved, or they're not being loved in the right way. But anyway, something is off kilter.
*  And so a lot of the process, psychoanalysis, it's not the most efficient, I was gonna say this when
*  you talked about neuroscience, because I know that the neuroscientific solutions and like cognitive
*  behavioral adjustments are much faster and more efficient. Psychoanalysis is very inefficient in
*  the sense that it takes years. But the point is precisely to gradually make sure that you maintain
*  a degree of or at least first, first of all, you introduce a degree of equilibrium into the patient's
*  kind of psychic and bodily existence. And that then you kind of, I think in the process, what's
*  supposed to happen is that the patient, the client learns how to self regulate. So the end of analysis
*  is basically when you're able to do it yourself, you don't need the analyst's help to to reach a
*  certain degree of equilibrium in the understanding that you're always going to lose it, you're never
*  going to be able to hold on to it permanently, like you just said. And the trick is precisely to
*  be okay with that and to give yourself the permission to be fine with that at the same time as
*  you seek as much as you can a certain degree of like comfort zone or equilibrium. Like I mentioned
*  earlier that I have this huge excess of energy and my struggle is constantly to contain it and like
*  kind of tame it to a certain degree. And going to analysis actually is like a non analysis,
*  helped me learn how to do that in a better way, which then did things like reduce the amount of
*  physical pain that I was in, which was a symptom of like this over agitation. And so yes, that all
*  of that makes perfect sense and has obvious like analogies with second analytic thinking.
*  This over abundance of energy is just not the problem that I'm faced with in my life. I'm sorry
*  that you know, that's a good reminder that people are different from each other, we have all of our
*  own little issues. But so good. So then I want to hear more about these lacks, you know, so I
*  understand the abstract idea. I mean, there's the danger that it's just too general and too broad to
*  be useful to say, well, there's something you don't have and you want it. Okay, I mean, that's
*  a pretty, that's a pretty general thing. Like, how much more specific can we be about the kind
*  of lacks or the origin of these lacks that are relevant to typical people trying to get through
*  the world? Okay, okay, great question. The first thing I want to say is that I, in my own work,
*  which is different from the work of this is one of the differences between my work and the work
*  of some other lacanias is that I tend to focus on two very different levels of lack. I want to
*  distinguish between what I'm calling ontological lack, kind of constitutive foundational lack that
*  is supposedly universal to human beings. That's on the one hand. And then on the other hand,
*  there are all kinds of context specific, context specific or circumstantial forms of lack that
*  people like wounding that people suffer from various kinds of injury that may be systemic,
*  like racism or poverty or sexism, or maybe like idiosyncratic to you having to do with say your
*  upbringing, your family, maybe you have a traumatic upbringing as a child, stuff like that.
*  And that's a different level of lack from the ontological version that Lacan usually focuses on.
*  So that's kind of the preface. And then I guess if it's okay, I'll dig a little deeper about how he
*  comes to that understanding of lack as the foundation of existence. I mean,
*  this is just like the Cliff Notes version of the Chist of Lacanian Theory on human ontology.
*  The idea is that when the infant is born into the world, it's born into a world of signifiers,
*  of meaning. When I say signifiers, I don't mean just language, but also like nonverbal cues,
*  smiling and how people hold the infant and stuff like that. But a lot of these meanings pre-exist
*  that, I mean, almost all of them pre-exist the infant's arrival in the world. And the one good
*  example is gender, where sometimes parents, unless they are very forward-looking, they
*  paint their nurseries different colors, depending on whether they are expecting a boy or a girl.
*  They will buy different toys, depending on whether it's boy or girl. So that's a really
*  clear example of how signifiers in some ways determine the child's being on some level,
*  even before it arrives into the world. And then the idea is that once the child starts to learn
*  how to speak and starts to understand language, language is key here. Language is really key for
*  Lacanian Theory. His idea was that once the child starts to speak, it quickly comes to realize that
*  it's actually not the center of the world, because before language, there's just no distinction
*  between the world and the child. The child is sort of the entire universe, the entire world.
*  But once there's language, there's suddenly me and there's you and there are objects in the world.
*  And that is what he thought was the source of the feeling that we have lost something unfathomably
*  precious, that we have lost this sense of plenitude, of being whole. Suddenly we are no longer whole.
*  And once that happens, the desire to feel that void kicks in and you start looking for various
*  ways to feel that void, feel that nothingness. And as I said earlier, his idea was that the best
*  thing you can do is to just learn to live with it rather than try to heal it. So that's the really,
*  short version of why he thought that we are the way we are. And that immediately makes us different
*  from other animals. I think that Lacan would have agreed that humans are animals on various levels,
*  but because of this sophisticated usage of language and signifiers that we have, he implied that we
*  are, and I'm using wording from a fellow Lacanian, Todd McGowan, who says that human beings are
*  distorted animals. And that has to do with the idea that language has somehow meddled with our
*  biology in such a way that we are no longer in a kind of pure biological state, but we have been
*  distorted by the culture that we were born into. And that our feeling of like, okay,
*  we're missing something, there's like a piece of me missing, is a part of that distortion
*  that other animals presumably don't experience. We all spend a lot of time writing online,
*  whether it's applying for a job or just sending something out to social media.
*  And we're not always at our best when it comes to the wordsmithing. That's where WordTune comes in.
*  WordTune is the first AI-powered online writing tool that actually understands what the words mean.

*  Part of that makes a lot of sense to me. And part of it I can't quite sign on to, but maybe I just
*  don't know enough about it. This distinction between humans and other animals, there's something to
*  that because, you know, I mean animals can be happy or sad, they could be frightened or whatever.
*  They don't get embarrassed that much, or they don't feel social anxiety in quite the same way
*  that we do. They don't worry about the future in the same way that we do. And I've sometimes
*  discussed it not in terms of language, but in terms of our imaginative capacities to think about
*  the future, which is wrapped up in the whole language thing. So I think that there is something
*  there that is very interesting and worth diving into even more. What I'm more skeptical about is
*  the story about the baby coming into the world and being surrounded by signifiers. I mean, clearly
*  that's true. Let's put it this way, which aspects of my current or someone else's current
*  psychological makeup can be traced to that occurrence in my infancy seems to be almost
*  impossible to know. I mean, it's a good story, but how would I know if that were true? And how
*  would I know that there's some other story that isn't just as good? I mean, is that part of the
*  story crucial to the later insights, or is it more like it's all part of a package and we can
*  take and leave some different parts of it? Yeah, that's a really good question. I think that it is
*  pretty foundational to Lacanian theory specifically. And I think that a lot of it is actually kind of
*  intuitive in the sense that a lot of people would come to analysis and complain about the fact that
*  they feel like something is missing from their being, that they are feeling this emptiness or
*  some sort of alienation or existential malaise or dissatisfaction. And so I think he was looking
*  for an explanation for that because other animals don't have like existential, I don't know, but it
*  looks like it seems like they don't have existential anxiety and all of these worries about this and
*  that. And so he was trying to figure out why. And like I said earlier, philosophers were writing
*  around the same time as he was writing and thinking, came to the same conclusion that there is this kind
*  of a feeling of void that human beings seem to share, but they weren't really able to explain it.
*  And so one of the things that Lacan was trying to do through that theory of language acquisition
*  had to do with that attempt to explain why this that we end up like that. And yeah, so
*  I like I said at the beginning, this is I take all of this with a grain of salt. It is a mythology to
*  me. I acknowledge that there could be all kinds of other explanations. But it also seems feasible
*  that once the child begins to speak, it loses something. And one another way to think about this
*  is that because of the cognitive distinction between very young children and adults, a lot of
*  times children don't really understand what it is that adults want from them. So Lacan talks in terms
*  of like enigmatic signifiers. The signifier that is coming at the child is enigmatic. The child
*  can't process exactly what it is that the other wants, the other being the parent or the caretaker
*  or whoever, what it is they want from the child. And so that itself can lead to a certain degree
*  of kind of unease or being off balance or in this equilibrium that you described earlier.
*  But yeah, I'm not asking anyone to believe this as some sort of a scientific fact. It's definitely
*  a theory. And there are other psychoanalytic thinkers like Mellon de Klein who worked with
*  very young children and infants. There are like child psychiatrists and child psychoanalysts who
*  arrived at similar conclusions using different vocabulary from Lacanian theory. And those
*  observations were based on actually like looking at how young infants react to stimuli coming from
*  the outside world. Again, I'm not an expert on this, but I know that infant psychoanalysts have
*  arrived at some of the same conclusions. Interesting. But again, not a science.
*  Okay, that's okay. Okay, good. So we have this lac, may or may not come from...
*  It's sort of... Look, I completely think it's plausible that childhood experiences, imagination,
*  language are somehow wrapped up in these feelings that we have of lac and so forth. And it's good
*  to have sort of a preliminary framework on which to hang our ideas about it with a footnote that
*  it's subject to being updated, right? I mean, that's always going to be true. But there's this
*  extra twist that you're going to put on it that says that following the advice of Beyonce, we
*  should make lemonade out of these lemons that the world has given us. And that the lac is not just...
*  This idea that we're driven by our lacs is not a purely negative thing, that it leads to
*  things like creativity and expression. Yeah, I mean, that's... I have to admit that that's
*  particularly my way of reading Lacan. There are other people who are much more interested in the
*  more destructive sides of his theory. And I have kind of built my particular reputation on
*  this tendency to go in a more affirmative and kind of, I don't know, sublimitatory
*  direction. So I think that you can read Lacan in different ways. And the way I have chosen to read
*  him is that he's basically saying that because we do have this sense of lac. And I want to
*  reiterate it, maybe reiterate it in one other way so that it's maybe more convincing to the skeptics.
*  You can think about it as a form of wounding. You could make the argument that pretty much all
*  children are in one way or another wounded. Like no one ever feels like they are loved enough, even
*  if they had great parents, like the best parents in the world. You can never feel the child's need
*  for love. So there's always a certain type of wounding. And then some people have been much
*  more wounded than others. So that's one way of understanding this lac. But anyway, so the idea
*  is that if you take it for granted that the lac exists, then the obvious sort of next step would
*  be to say, okay, well, what happens to human beings after that? And Lacan came to the conclusion
*  that from lac comes into being the desire to fill it with various activities. And there are basically
*  two ways of filling it. We can either go into the world and find things like people. And of course,
*  falling in love is one of the, we can talk about love if you want to, because that's one of the
*  topics I've written a lot about. So you can fall in love. You can find a person who seems to feel
*  that lac. That's really effective. That's one of the most effective ways of doing it, which is why
*  a lot of people seek, I mean, if you take this theory seriously, this explains why we're so
*  drawn to the idea that there's like a soulmate who's going to complete our being and all that.
*  We can find people or objects in the world or even like ideals that we hang on to as a way of like
*  dealing with this lac. The other route to dealing with it is to invent something.
*  Do any kind of creative labor, intellectual labor, or I don't know, like be a carpenter or something.
*  Use your skills in such a way that you can kind of either forget about that lac or at least cover
*  it over. And the idea is that a lot of us are really good at just like ignoring it most of the
*  time. We make ourselves very busy and don't want to think about it or don't really have space in our
*  lives to think about it. And something like poverty would make it very difficult to actually focus on
*  this sort of existential type of lac. But if we, the idea is that if we are suddenly faced
*  with something very difficult in our lives, like if something traumatic happens to us,
*  we often become very aware of it. So let's say you fall terminally ill or you have a horrible
*  breakup or something happens to you professionally that's just terrible. Then it's difficult for you
*  to avoid looking at that lac kind of in the face. And you can think all the way back to Nietzsche,
*  who talked about staring at the abyss. So this is not a new idea. He had this notion of staring
*  at the abyss and having the courage to do so. So in some ways, Lacan is just kind of rearticulating
*  this already Nietzschean idea of like, you just have to have the guts to look at the abyss in the
*  in the face rather than trying to find these ways of avoiding it. At the same time as he very much
*  advocated the idea that there are productive, meaningful, creative ways, sublimitory ways of
*  coping with it so that it doesn't overwhelm you and take over your existence and put you into a
*  paralysis. What was the platonic dialogue that talked about the souls being separated and then
*  you're trying to find them again? Was that the symposium? Yes, the symposium. And Lacan actually
*  has a whole lecture series, a whole book on the symposium. So was Plato the first Lacanian because
*  he emphasized this lack that we have that we're all looking for to find our soulmate who's been
*  wrested apart from us? Yeah, pretty much. Actually, that's kind of the gist of one of my books. It's
*  called Summons of Love. And so it's about love. And one of the arguments I make is that basically
*  Lacan is kind of plagiarizing Plato. And this whole idea that Zeus divided those round beings
*  like an egg with a hair. And then they were separated from each other for the rest of their
*  lives and yearned for a reunion with their missing half. And then were like super happy, filled with
*  this exuberant happiness when they found each other. That's basically the Lacanian story,
*  except that he's very skeptical of the ending. He's very skeptical of the idea that you can
*  find your soulmate and everything will be just golden after that. So he doesn't buy that part of
*  the story, but the rest of it is just directly out of Plato. So good. So I'm on Lacan's side
*  in being skeptical about the ending. But as marketing advice to would-be myth builders,
*  the idea of Zeus and eggs and hairs is awesome. You got to have that extra bit of fantastical
*  apparatus to really catch on and become popular, I think. But I do want to get to love because I'm
*  no better than your students who are going to be fascinated about this. But I want to get other
*  things out of the way first. You touched on this fact that when we do talk about searches for
*  ways to fill our lives, ways to address the likes that we have, writers and intellectuals,
*  when they tend to be the kinds of people who write about searching for meaning in life. And guess
*  what? They always say, well, you should do writerly intellectual things. But I want to suggest,
*  what I hear whether you agree or not, there's an infinite number of ways that we can address this.
*  And some of them might be very highbrow and some of them might not be highbrow. I mean,
*  you could be a fan of a sports team or you could like gossiping with your friends or just going to
*  McDonald's or whatever. I mean, there's different sort of activities I can imagine that are perfectly
*  valid that are part of this, to attach too much grandiosity to them, part of this human search for
*  meaning. Absolutely. And that's one of the things that I always emphasize when I teach psychoanalysis,
*  because I think the popular understanding of the Freudian understanding of sublimation has to do
*  with very highbrow endeavors, such as writing books or painting paintings or writing songs or
*  other kind of really culturally revered activities. And I always tell my students that
*  that's just the tip of the iceberg, that very few people actually deal with their existential crisis
*  or their lack or whatever you want to call it in those ways. And I mean, there are all kinds of
*  ways in which you can fill your life. You can exercise, you can have children. They are very,
*  very, very good distraction from your lack. I mean, they take up a lot of space, very distracting.
*  You can watch Netflix for days at end, which I do sometimes. You can numb your feelings with
*  alcohol or drugs or whatever. So there are more or less productive ways of coping with it. And I
*  guess the idea in psychoanalysis is to get people to use avenues of filling their lives that are not
*  pathological in the normative sense, like are not self-destructive, are not bad for you.
*  So instead of day drinking, doing something that is a bit more, I don't know, I don't want to say
*  productive because it sounds like psychoanalysis is trying to normalize people. And this is one of
*  the big distinctions between other forms of psychoanalysis and Lacanian theory that I should
*  have actually mentioned earlier. And this is why he is not so popular with American clinicians,
*  because most American clinicians are invested in making the patient more functional, making
*  the person happier, more adaptive, social demands. Whereas the goal of Lacanian analysis
*  was to allow the patient to just like come to terms with the idea that they will never feel whole
*  and also to question everything, question norms, question social rules and restrictions.
*  Basically, and I hope that it's okay for me to work, can I use the F word?
*  Go ahead, we'll just mark you as explicit, no problem.
*  Because I've actually used this in writing. The most succinct way to explain what Lacan was
*  hoping to do with his patients was to teach them to say, fuck you to like societal demands. He was
*  not trying to normalize anyone. So I don't want to say that he would have been invested in making
*  sure that people are not day drinking, that they're doing something more useful with their lives.
*  But nevertheless, I guess I still have a little bit of an investment in the idea that there are
*  more or less productive ways of coping with dyslack or malaise or traumatization or wounding,
*  whatever you want to call it. Yeah, I mean, maybe you just said everything you have to say about it,
*  but I just want to push harder on this because I haven't thought about it that much myself and
*  I don't have the favorite answer. But on the one hand, one wants to not be overly judgey about the
*  different ways people have of dealing with the existential horror of reality. And especially,
*  one doesn't want to just valorize or privilege my own ways of dealing with things so other people
*  can have their things. But at the same time, you want to be able to say that within each individual
*  and their situation, presumably there are, in some sense, better and worse ways of coping, right?
*  Being a fan of a sports team is probably better than just drinking to forget your problems,
*  you know, at least if you don't become too fanatic about it. So what is that judgment? What is that
*  hierarchy that we're putting it on? I mean, what is the good versus bad way of addressing our lacks?
*  Okay, so now I'm going to open a total can of worms. You started this whole podcast by
*  talking about truth, which of course I would expect from you as a scientist. And my answer to
*  this is that Lacombe was very invested in this idea that there is a truth to your desire. And
*  he was hoping that analysis as a clinical practice would help you access this truth,
*  which is often buried under kind of layer upon layer upon layer of societal expectations.
*  And so when he taught his patients or tried to teach his readers to kind of resist societal norms,
*  his objective was to get to something deeper about your desire. And so the idea is that if you can
*  kind of locate the thing that most fulfills your desire in the hope that it's something that is not
*  destructive to you, like day drinking, if you can locate that one thing or a few things that are
*  most meaningful to you, then that would be the way to kind of organize your life. It's a kind of a
*  way of thinking about self fashioning. Like Nietzsche had this idea of living your life as poetry.
*  Lacombe had the idea of like figuring out what it is that you truly want. And then like following
*  the thread of that desire. Now, you can obviously, it's like obvious that there are like huge problems
*  with this because I mean, if your desire is to be a serial killer, you're kind of in trouble.
*  So you don't really want to pursue the truth of that thread of desire. But kind of beyond those
*  kinds of extremes, he had this idea that if you could figure out what it is that really appeals
*  to you. And he had actually like a term for this. He called it the objet A in French, the object A,
*  like the cause of your desire. If you could figure out what the object A of your desire is,
*  like the kernel of your desire is, then you can perhaps live a life that feels better to you,
*  feels more meaningful to you. Not in the sense that you feel healed, but in the sense that you
*  feel like you're living the kind of life that you want to be living. So that is sort of the
*  existential component, philosophical component of this. So indeed, okay, so I get how it does
*  come down to truth that in some way, when you're trying to deal with your lack, there are ways to
*  truly address it. And then there are ways just to sort of mask it and hide away. And so we're gonna
*  count, we're gonna value those ways that are a little bit more truthful. Is that fair?
*  That's very fair. And this is, like I said, when we started talking about truth,
*  I say that Lacan had a very different understanding of truth from what I assume is your understanding.
*  Because rather than looking for the universal truth with the capital T,
*  which in some ways he actually was, because I mean, he theorized the whole notion of lack as a
*  universal human condition and all of that. But when it comes to like specific people, individuals,
*  his understanding of truth was actually really, it had to do with the singularity of your desire,
*  the singularity of the person. And here I want to distinguish between identity, which is sort of
*  socially constructed. It's your social persona that you present to the world. And then what I,
*  in my work, have called the singularity of your being, which has to do with like a combination
*  of your psychological life, but also your bodily drives and how you are in the world. And so for
*  him, or at least in my interpretation of him, the idea was to access something about the truth of
*  the singularity of your being. And the closer you got to that, the closer you got to some sort of a
*  truth about yourself. But that's completely different from truth in the scientific sense
*  of the word, because it implies that everyone's truth is specific to them.
*  Well, I can imagine that. I don't necessarily think it's incompatible. I mean, there's a truth
*  about the fact that electrons and protons have equal but opposite charges, and there can separately
*  be a truth about individual people. I mean, individual people are going to have something
*  that is different from person to person, but nevertheless true about them. I think that's
*  completely compatible. But the slippery thing here is, it's not your fault or LeCan's fault,
*  it's the fault of what is to nature to be a human being, is that on the one hand,
*  yeah, in me right now, there are things that are true about me, and maybe I can try to sort of fulfill
*  the desires, etc. But those are also malleable, in some sense, right? Like part of me can change
*  another part of me. And so it's not completely clear which parts I should hang on to, and which
*  parts I should work to change, right? Well, that's really a great way to think about it.
*  Because I don't think that this truth of being, the singularity of being that I'm talking about,
*  is meant to be a static notion. I said earlier that the goal of analysis in some ways is to get
*  you to the point where you can, quote unquote, do it yourself, you can kind of keep analyzing yourself.
*  And so there's a process to your way of being in the world and your singular way of being in the
*  world. And I've written a whole book, I guess most of my books actually talk about subjectivity as a
*  process that never comes to an end. You're always fashioning yourself, you're always reinventing
*  yourself, new understandings of what it is that is important to you come to existence,
*  repeatedly, like continuously. So it's definitely not a fixed truth. And I guess one way to think
*  about it psychoanalytically or clinically is, again, to get the client or the patient,
*  analyzad, to the point where they are okay with the fact that they are in constant process of
*  becoming something that they don't even yet understand themselves. You don't know what
*  the end point is going to be. And that's really hard for some people. They're looking for stability.
*  And this is a destabilizing theory in the sense that it wants you to become comfortable.
*  I guess it's in some ways stabilizing because it wants you to become comfortable with the fact that
*  you are not going to be a stable creature, that you are always in the process of becoming something.

*  Which reminds me that I wanted to ask about, despite the fact that we want to not be too
*  hoity-toity about overly valuing intellectual or writerly sort of activities, there is a sense in
*  which I think you say that this initial impulse of lack of trying to fix something that we don't have
*  or some desire that we have for something can be a creative impulse, can actually be seen to be at
*  the heart of our more creative moments if such moments are what we seek to have?
*  Absolutely. I mean, that for me personally is what is most important or precious about this theory.
*  I mean, like any theory speaks to me theoretically, but it also speaks to me very personally.
*  I was hooked onto it for absolutely personal reasons and it had to do with this kind of a
*  jump from a feeling of lack and alienation to the ability to create, to write. I mean,
*  I used to have a huge writer's block in grad school. You probably even remember it. We knew
*  each other back then and for a long time I couldn't write. I went to analysis in order to
*  be able to break that and it actually did work in the sense that I was able to start writing and
*  I haven't stopped writing since. I'll give you an anecdote from one of Lacan's books
*  because it will sort of illustrate this really concretely. He's actually talking about
*  another analyst's text and ultimately he says this is a completely crackpot kind of way of
*  thinking about things, but nevertheless there's something that we can learn from this.
*  This other analyst that he's talking about had a patient who had a brother-in-law who was a
*  talented painter and had filled her walls with his paintings. Then one day he came and took away one
*  of the paintings. This woman was left in her apartment with this empty spot in the wall.
*  And she was in analysis. Apparently this other analyst claims that what happened was that
*  she went and bought some paint and started painting herself and miraculously actually
*  was able to paint a pretty good painting. Now Lacan says that's ridiculous. There's no way that
*  this woman would have ever been able to paint a good painting from having never attempted to paint.
*  But the gist of it, the fact that she was kind of compelled to go out and buy paint and attempt to
*  replace the empty spot on the wall was something that he could get on board with. He's like okay,
*  emptiness, we want to fill it. So we find if we have the intellectual or creative capacity,
*  we can find creative intellectual ways of filling that void or actually at least coping with it
*  better. What's the programmatic advice that we have to people who would like to be more
*  creative? Like lack more? I'm not quite sure how we get... I'm just laughing at that programmatic
*  advice because I was so antithetical to everything that Lacan stood for because as I said,
*  he basically spoke gibberish. But okay, go ahead. Yeah, so I'm a person on the street.
*  I don't know what my feelings about Lacan are, but I get this idea that we're driven by our
*  lack, even unconscious. Can I attach the word unconscious to many of these things?
*  But I'm also writing a novel. I'm working on my novel finally and I want to be creative. I want
*  it to be fun and new and inventive. Is there a way to use this mythology as you set up to help me
*  release my inner creative energies? I'm just laughing because I have just co-authored a book
*  on this very issue with a novelist. It's in dialogue format. Me and the novelist,
*  her name is Catherine Quittenbrower. Complicated last name, Quittenbrower. Catherine. So we
*  wrote this book in dialogue format and we talk about the kind of logistics of creativity and
*  we're both coming from a Lacanian perspective. She's trained in the theory as well,
*  even though she's a novelist. And so the conclusion that we both came to independently of each other,
*  and I invited to do this project with her partly because I knew something about her writing process
*  and I realized that it was very similar to mine. So I was like, okay, there's something that we can
*  talk about here because I have written 14 books, which is a lot. I know you have also written a lot,
*  but in my field, 14 books is a ton. And so a lot of people ask me, what is it that drives you?
*  How is it possible that you can write all those books? And I realized that Catherine had the same
*  predicament of almost over productivity. And so we both came to the conclusion that
*  what needs to happen is that we somehow managed to, at the opening stages of starting to write,
*  we're talking about writing specifically, but this could also apply to other arts.
*  At the opening stages of writing, we purposefully kind of banish our egos to a different room or
*  different mini universe, which is tell that ego to just go away. And that allows space for
*  these sort of physical energies and psychological energies that I've talked about,
*  that I've labeled as Jusans that are kind of coursing through our bodies to interact with
*  the signifier, with the word in such a way that the signifier is filled with a certain type of
*  new energy. It's filled with a creative, innovative energy that is able to create something,
*  hopefully something new. So the kind of quintessential example is someone like
*  James Joyce, who also wrote Jibberish. And the idea is that, the Lakenian idea is that
*  when James Joyce wrote, he was filled with this energy, this Jusans, that was kind of
*  carrying his signifiers, carrying his words in such a way that he actually kind of demolished
*  usual language and was able to invent his own kind of language. Now, usually we don't all want to do
*  that. We don't all want to write like James Joyce and write like Jibberish, but I think that there's
*  a way in which we can release that energy in our bodies and in our psyches that allows our writing
*  to kind of flow and allows us to kind of fly with our words. And that's something that I definitely
*  experienced, Catherine experiences, we kind of lose track of, even lose lack of our surroundings,
*  we can lose ourselves in that for like hours. I mean, I know that people who have called this
*  place like the zone or the well that you go into and stuff like that, and that feels very visceral.
*  And so part of the Lakenian theory around lack has to do with that ability to bring the Jusans of the
*  body, the energy of the body together with the signifier in such a way that something new comes
*  into being. And you can only do that if you're able to banish the ego that is sitting on your
*  shoulder and telling you that you are not going to succeed, you're not going to be good enough,
*  your prose sucks, you're just like a horrible writer. It basically means that you allow
*  yourself to write whatever comes to you. I mean, sometimes I sit down and I write,
*  I put my fingers on the keyboard, and things just start like, sentences just appear and I don't even
*  know where they come from. And of course, the first draft is a complete mess. But I have come to
*  be able to live with the fact that it's a complete mess. And then that allows me to
*  just write and write and write until I have a whole book length mess. And then I can take that
*  mess and rewrite it into a book. And then the rewriting process takes like months and months
*  and months because it is such a mess. But eventually it turns into a kind of a pristine,
*  pristinely written book. But the initial kind of rush of writing has to do with just like giving
*  up control, getting rid of the ego. So that yeah, actually, that is some kind of programmatic advice
*  there. And I hate to be the scientist, but it reminds me of at least an analogy I mentioned
*  before, the neuroscience of psychedelics, and you know, what effects these drugs have on the brain.
*  And one of the one of the single most fascinating fact I learned about about reading about these
*  things is, you would think that if you take something like LSD, and then you see all these
*  colors and whatever, that it is firing off neurons in your brain, right, that it's causing these
*  things to be fired. But in fact, it depresses certain activities in your brain. It's just that
*  what is depressing is the gatekeeper, like that these these sounds and light shows and whatever
*  and ideas were bubbling beneath the surface all the time. And there's parts of your brain that
*  sort of zero them out and keep them silent and the taking the psychedelics lets them flow free. So
*  maybe that's at least analogous to this, you know, drug free version where we learn to let our
*  subconscious thoughts flow a little bit more freely.
*  Yeah, no, I think that first of all, you're totally allowed to be a scientist, because that's where
*  you are. In addition to being being a philosopher and, you know, just a Renaissance man. But yeah,
*  that makes perfect sense. It's precisely I mean, you you kind of nailed it. It's about getting rid
*  of the gatekeeper or getting around the gatekeeper, neutralizing the gatekeeper somehow. And
*  there was something about the clinical practice of psychoanalysis that, at least for me, worked. But
*  that's probably because I had the right kind of neurosis. I am definitely not going to argue that
*  psychoanalysis as a clinical practice is going to work for everyone. It works for certain types,
*  it can work for certain types of symptomatic behavior. I mean, in Freud's opinion, we were
*  all neurotic in one way or another. And psychoanalysis was not able to reach certain types of neurosis or
*  pathologies like schizophrenia, for instance, or psychotic behavior. But it was very good with
*  hysteria, which most of us are. And so it's going to work for certain types of neurosis and kind of
*  take away the rigidified kind of pathways that we talked about earlier, relax the ways in which
*  energy flows in our bodies and in our psyches, and just kind of neutralize that gatekeeper that has
*  been kind of instituted as the moral compass. Of course, we need that in other aspects of our lives.
*  I don't want to get rid of ethics or anything, but we don't necessarily need it when we're trying to
*  write a book. So getting rid of that superego, that would be the psychoanalytic term, getting
*  rid of the superego gatekeeper is exactly the kind of practical advice. But as to how you do that is
*  a complicated question, and it's idiosyncratic to the person who is trying to accomplish that.
*  Okay, good. I have two other topics that I just wanted to touch on. I was going to say briefly,
*  but it might not be brief. We don't need to be brief. The airtime is more or less free,
*  because they're big topics. One is you've written a lot and thought a lot about mourning,
*  mourning with a U in it, the sense of being sad when something bad happens. And so,
*  I mean, a lot of what we've been talking about is sort of implicitly individualistic,
*  like I'm working on my own shit. I can say shit now because you already said fuck so.
*  But then the external world imposes on us also, right? Like bad things happen, people we love and
*  care about die or whatever, disasters happen. How does this view of our inner mental landscape help
*  us think about those or even cope with those incidents in our lives?
*  Okay, so that's really a great question. I will talk on two different levels. I said earlier that
*  in my understanding, there are kind of two different levels of lack or
*  wounding or traumatization, the first being the ontological. And I kind of
*  hesitate to call it traumatizing because, I mean, if it's the human condition, I'm not sure that we
*  should call it trauma, but a lot of people in my field do, because it's likely to this idea that
*  you have somehow been injured or wounded or something in you has been murdered by the
*  signifier. Zlavo Zizek, who has popularized Lacan, often talks about the murder of the thing,
*  and by the thing he means like something almost like biological. That's a complicated concept that
*  I can certainly talk about, but we don't need to. But okay, so talking on the ontological level,
*  when you think about the idea that there is this lack in our being, a void, then the conclusion,
*  which someone like Julia Kristeva explains really beautifully, is that actually to be a human being
*  is to be a being who mourns. We are always already mourning something. We are mourning this loss that
*  has happened to us at a time that we can't recall. You're right, there's no way of actually going
*  back to that time when this loss supposedly happened. But the idea is that we on some level
*  mourn it all the time. And so Kristeva has this great quote, where she says something like,
*  do not look for the meaning in mourning. Understand that there's only meaning because we mourn.
*  So she's making the point that we are only able to make meaning. We are meaning making creatures
*  because we do have this lack that we are mourning, and we make meaning in order to try to fill that
*  lack. So that's one level. But then your question was more targeted to the other level, the second
*  level, what I earlier called context-specific or circumstantial, when something really horrible
*  happens to you. And Freud already had a very famous essay called Mourning and Melancholia,
*  where he distinguished between what he called normal mourning. Like if someone dies, or
*  your lover leaves you, or something bad happens to you, of course you're going to be sad,
*  potentially for a long time. You could mourn, let's say the loss of your partner, your lover,
*  you could mourn that loss for years, potentially. But then the idea is that under normal circumstances,
*  eventually you will get to a point where you're able to redirect your desire to a new person,
*  you're able to fall in love again, and find a new relationship. But then with Melancholia,
*  which he took to post to mourning, the idea is that you get stuck in your state of mourning,
*  you're stuck there indefinitely, so it's mourning that doesn't come to an end.
*  So he thought that that was the more pathological as a two, at the same time as he also said,
*  people who are depressed. I think the contemporary term for melancholia would be the kind of
*  depression that doesn't have a clear cause. We can be depressed because of a specific reason,
*  or we can be vaguely depressed for no clear reason. So when he talks about melancholia,
*  I think he's talking about that type of depression. So the idea is that you can get stuck in that type
*  of depression that doesn't go anywhere, doesn't leave. So then the idea is, the psychoanalytic,
*  again, clinical idea is that when a patient comes in with that type of paralysis of mourning,
*  where you're not able to move from your loss, the idea is to get you from a place of melancholic
*  depression to a certain type of movement that would allow you to start the process of mourning
*  that loss that you have experienced, and then over time come to a place where you can actually
*  start doing something with your life so that you're no longer stuck in that,
*  what Kristeva calls the crypt of melancholia, so that you can actually get away from that
*  trap of depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy, I know is one way in which people are
*  dealing with this. Obviously drugs, antidepressants is the go-to version of how to deal with this kind
*  of depression in North America, and that's fine. I'm not opposed to medication at all,
*  but psychoanalysis is the other way to deal with it. It's just a much slower way of getting there,
*  but the idea is you go in as someone who can't complete the process of mourning and hopefully
*  through analysis you come to a place where you can start the process and eventually
*  come to an end that allows you to then live your life more freely.
*  Maybe part of it is just the realization that if something terrible has happened to you,
*  the immediate instinctive reaction that it's all terrible, life is worthless, I can't go on living
*  this one thing that was making me go is no longer there, and moving from that perspective to that,
*  well, I have a reaction to what happened that is that, and there's reasons why I'm having that
*  reaction, and it's a feature of who I am. Let's see about how I can adjust things to deal with it
*  in a more productive way. Is that close? Yeah. I think that at the gist of it is this idea that
*  Freud called it reality testing. When you're in a state of melancholia or this kind of
*  depression that doesn't go away, you basically don't want to acknowledge the fact that this
*  loss has happened to you. You keep testing reality and your test is not very accurate
*  in the sense that it gives you back this sense that somehow you're still linked to whatever it
*  is that you have lost. Let's say you talk about someone you loved, whom you have lost, you may
*  fantasize that person into existence. You might actually hallucinate them, see them on the street.
*  Imagine that you see someone who vaguely resembles them or something like that.
*  But the idea is that gradually you keep testing reality and bit by bit reality tells you that
*  this loss is real and that you have to deal with it. Mourning is a process of decathecting yourself
*  from that object or that person. Catexis is just a fancy term for being bonded to something
*  or being invested in something. Psychoanalytically, when you are mourning, you're gradually
*  decathecting yourself from whatever it is that you have lost. The successful process of mourning
*  ideally gets you to a place where you can reinvest yourself, your energy, your psyche, onto a new
*  person or new object or new interest, new ideals, even a new country, whatever it is.
*  A gradual kind of decathecting so that you can re-cathect.
*  I can see why this is going to take a long time, the psychoanalytic version of fixing, but it might
*  be the healthiest way to really reorient. I guess now I'm just way out of my depth and I'm going to
*  get in trouble talking about things I know nothing about. I also am completely open to
*  using medication when things go wrong if it's very, very helpful. For some people, there's no other
*  way or there's something wrong in their balance of endorphins or whatever it is.
*  Like we said before, even the singularity of the individual is not set in stone. It can change.
*  If you can reorient who you are in a way to be more accepting in dealing with these terrible
*  tragedies, that might be a more long-lasting, robust way to cope with them. That's definitely
*  the idea. Again, I'm not opposed to medication and I do think that there are certain circumstances
*  where people absolutely need medication, but the idea is that analysis again can get you to a point
*  where for the rest of your life you have the necessary skill set to deal with any subsequent
*  tragedy or loss or whatever bad things happen to you. If you figure out how to deal with it once,
*  you in some ways possess the toolbox for doing it again when something new happens to you.
*  It doesn't always work. In some instances, a new traumatizing experience can only
*  deepen the wounds that you have from previous experiences. I know from my own experience that
*  having been traumatized and having figured out how to overcome that trauma,
*  can help you deal with new traumatization. I've made this argument strongly in my writing.
*  In a popular cultural understanding of traumatization, there's often this idea that
*  the traumatized person is very brittle or fragile and can be very easily retraumatized. I always
*  argue that that's not necessarily the case. In fact, the people who have been very traumatized
*  at various points in their lives often possess the right tools for dealing with new trauma so that
*  they're actually more agile and more capable of coping with new forms of traumatization.
*  Ideally, psychoanalysis would give you those tools. I'll very quickly cite a non-Lacanian
*  psychoanalytic theoretician from UChicago, Jonathan Lear, who conceptualizes this as
*  the rewiring of your whole system, the rebooting of your whole system that will redefine your
*  entire destiny. If you think about breaking the repetition compulsion, really getting down to the
*  level of the unconscious and breaking your habitual way of thinking, you're not going to be able to
*  deal with things when they happen to you. You're really talking about reconfiguring your entire
*  destiny, not in the sense that you are in control of everything that happens to you, but you
*  reconfigure how you respond to what happens to you and in so doing, you reconfigure the rest of your
*  life. That's one way to think about it that I have found useful. I said we had two topics
*  left and I was going to do the sadder one first, the more melancholy one, which was mourning,
*  and then we're going to move on to love, which would be the happier one. Now I'm not so sure
*  that love is going to be the happier one, but let's do it anyway. Have we solved love? Plato told us
*  this very fake story about each one of us having a soulmate and we have to find them and then once
*  we do, we'll be eternally happy. That seems very different than most people's experience.
*  So what do we learn about love? You can say not love of art or anything like that,
*  but love of another person. What is the insight we get from that?
*  Okay, so there's so much that I could say about that and I will try to keep this brief, but
*  I feel like I should have just led with this because this is, as I said, how I hook my students.
*  So there are bad news and good news. I think Lacan had a very complicated understanding of
*  romantic love specifically and that's the kind of love I'm going to be talking about.
*  And there are post-Lacanian thinkers who are very famous like Zizek and Alain Badiou
*  and Todd McGowan who have written a lot about love from a Lacanian perspective. And so
*  I'll give you the bad news first. So the idea is that before that kind of warning that happens,
*  and here we are again in the realm of mythology, the idea is that before the warning that happens
*  to you as a result of language acquisition, you are kind of symbiotically attracted to the
*  thing. You are kind of symbiotically like a one being with this thing that Lacan called
*  the thing with the capital T. He took it from German dusting and you can think all the way back
*  to Kant, the thing in itself. And the Lacanian version of the thing actually has direct resonances
*  with the Kantian thing in itself and the Heideggerian thing also. Something like
*  fundamentally ontological but also something that has to do with sublimity in the Kantian sense,
*  the sublime thing. But in this case, the sublime thing is within your being.
*  So what supposedly happens, and this is completely hypothetical and completely mythological,
*  but so the idea is that what happens to you is that you kind of lose contact with this thing.
*  And then the thing that you are, oh that is, it's the thing and the thing, the thing and the thing.
*  The thing that you're looking for for the rest of your life, the object of your desire, the object
*  are, is sort of a piece of this thing with the capital T. And Lacan didn't really have great
*  things to say about this because he basically said, this is the narcissistic scenario where
*  you're just looking for the piece of yourself that you fantasize that you have lost. And I left out
*  a really big point earlier, which was that he did not think that we actually ever lost anything.
*  When he talks about that lack that we feel, he's very clear about the fact that we haven't actually
*  lost anything in reality. That is the fantasy that we retroactively create about supposedly having
*  lost something really precious. So he's saying, okay, so when you fall in love in this way where
*  you're looking for the little piece of the thing that you think that you have lost, then basically
*  you're just trying to fill your lack in a narcissistic sense. You're just looking for
*  a reflection of yourself so that you can feel whole again. So he was just like, no, no, no, that's
*  not how we should think about love. But then he had this other version, which contemporary theorists
*  have distinguished from what I just talked about. They have called, but I just talked about romance,
*  like what we understand when we think about romance in the conventional sense. And again,
*  like Lacan, they think that that's a bad kind of a narcissistic endeavor that doesn't really get you
*  anywhere. Ultimately, you're going to be disappointed. Your partner's going to let you down because,
*  of course, they're never going to be able to be that mirror for you for the rest of your life.
*  You're with a person for a year and suddenly there's a little crack in that mirror and you
*  start questioning that relationship and eventually you'll fall out of love because it was never based
*  on anything that had to do with the person. The other person, it had to do with your desire to
*  to fill your lack. So bad, bad, bad. But then the good version of love is linked to what I have
*  characterized as this kind of a semi-unconscious energy that is coursing through our being.
*  And Lacan had this idea that when you come across a person who is able to kind of activate your
*  desire on that level, on a level that is deeper than your narcissistic quest for self-fulfillment,
*  then there's something quote unquote real or the real is like any concept. I will rephrase.
*  There's something quote unquote truthful about that desire. And one way to understand that is
*  that, and Todd McGowan is great at explaining this, one way to understand this is that
*  you are basically falling in love with whatever it is that the other is lacking, all the ways in which
*  the other feels dislocated or distorted or alienated or lacking or not enough or whatever,
*  the wounded or injured or whatever, you basically connect into the injury in the other.
*  And there's something within the Lacanian theory, theoretical world at least, there's something about
*  that type of love that actually is like the real thing. And Alain Badieu, who's a contemporary
*  French philosopher, theorizes the so-called love event. He talks about falling in love in this
*  particular way as an event that completely reconfigures your life so that there's no way
*  for you to go back to living your life the way that you used to live before you met the person
*  that kind of derailed you. And it's very much a derailing kind of a moment. It's not a happy,
*  cool, lucky kind of like, I really like this person type of an experience. It's like a completely
*  derailing, like lightning strikes you type of experience. And it can actually be traumatizing
*  in some ways. But once it happens, there's kind of no coming back from that experience. And that
*  person is going to have a certain hold on you potentially for a very long time, which also means
*  that they have the immense capacity to hurt you if they decide to leave you or otherwise wound you.
*  If you're like, if you're connected, bonded on that very deep level, then someone can really
*  destroy you. And you have to be open to that happening. Yeah. So ideally, if you want to have,
*  quote unquote, true or real love, you would have to be completely open to this happening.
*  If you're afraid of getting hurt, you kind of can't get the good part. So yeah, it's a difficult
*  dilemma for many people, which is why a lot of people stay on the level of kind of like safe
*  romance that has been sort of socially almost pre-programmed for them. Like, you know what to
*  do, you go on a date, and then you buy a certain kind of gift, and then you do this, and then you
*  do that. And it's kind of a safe model of love. And eventually, after a year and a half, you get
*  married or at least engaged or whatever. And that's very different from allowing yourself to be
*  derailed by this encounter with utter otherness in the sense that you can never really access
*  the interiority of another person completely. You'll never know exactly what it is that you're
*  dealing with. Like yourself, the other is always in the process of evolving and mutating and coming
*  a different person. So you also have to keep up with who they are coming at the same time as you
*  are becoming something else. So it's very complicated and not necessarily at all reassuring.
*  I just want to get on the record here that I'm very fond of my narcissistic quest for
*  self-fulfillment. And I don't want you bad enough on that. This is an important part of my life.
*  But the other thing was, that was just a joke, the thing that fits in very well with my experience is
*  I know people who have, it's even possible I've done this myself, but paper it over the memory of it,
*  people who have failed in romance because they were too rigid in what was supposed to happen at
*  what moment in time. This thing we're doing is supposed to happen on the third date, not on the
*  fourth date or whatever it is. And that's clearly not a very healthy way to go about it. I mean,
*  when we were emailing back and forth to get ready for this, you made the crack that
*  Lacanians think of romance as just a capitalist plot in some way. It's not really getting at the
*  essence of love, right? Exactly. So again, Todd McGowan theorizes this beautifully because he's
*  very interested in capitalism. He has a whole chapter on love in his book, Capitalism and Desire,
*  which is a recent book, highly accessible to non-specialists. I really recommend it.
*  But yeah, he argues very convincingly that in our culture, we have this notion of romantic love
*  that follows very particular types of steps that are linked to basically capitalistic modes of
*  generating profit. So it's premised on things like fancy dinners and nice gifts on Valentine's Day,
*  bouquets of flowers and boxes of chocolate, and eventually a really fancy engagement ring. And
*  then the wedding dress that costs thousands of dollars, and then the fancy wedding and all of
*  that. And he's just basically saying, yeah, this is like a romantic love that's going to be
*  how capitalism has co-opted love. And real love actually has nothing to do with this. Real love
*  is something that will completely derail you. I mean, I'm not saying that there's anything wrong
*  with having a wonderful, beautiful wedding like you had, but the idea would be that you will not
*  necessarily need that in order to feel that the love that you have for another person is
*  real and genuine and enduring and all of those things. So yeah, it would be a derailing experience
*  rather than this kind of, let's follow the steps kind of thing. And for a lot of people, it can be
*  very difficult to get away from the step type of thinking insofar as they have been sort of socialized
*  into a specific way of being a person. And of course, the whole point of Lacanian thinking is
*  to destroy how society has taught you to be a person and be open to other ways of experiencing
*  life and love and relationships and yourself and your lack and all of that.
*  So if I were to try to dramatically oversimplify what you said, so you can tell me how wrong this
*  is, but the message I'm getting is that there is a sort of mistaken or doomed way of thinking
*  about love in this kind of platonic sense where you have a lack, so you find someone who fills
*  the lack. And there's this more rewarding version of love where we both have lacks,
*  but our lacks are complementary and work together. Like let's find the successful couple is the one
*  who lack together. That's a really good way of putting it. Absolutely. Yeah. So even though I
*  have like throughout this podcast, I have valorized this notion of lack in some ways. I want to be
*  very clear about the fact that Lacan was very, very critical of the idea that you can use another
*  person to sort of plug your lack and make yourself whole. He was not happy with that idea and tried
*  to get his patience away from that way of thinking. And also, I mean, as part of doing that,
*  and this is why also another reason he is not very popular with American clinicians, he wanted
*  to destroy your ego. That's a long story, but he really did not like the ego. So he wanted to get
*  away from narcissistic ways of being in the world. And I understand your defense of narcissism. I
*  think that all of us need some of it. I certainly am kind of pro-narcissism in the sense that I feel
*  like I started my life in a place where my narcissistic understanding of myself had been
*  completely destroyed and then I had to rebuild it from scratch. So I'm in the camp of the people who
*  believe that we all need a certain healthy degree of narcissism. But Lacan really hated
*  narcissism. So he was really not keen on the idea that you use another person to fill your lack.
*  But you're absolutely right about the complementarity of two different singular lacks. And
*  this is why one reason our genuine desire is so idiosyncratic and so specific, that only very few
*  people in the world can really truly fulfill our desire. In one of my books, I say something like,
*  when I walk into the subway car, say in Boston, the really crowded subway car, there's rarely
*  anyone I want to sleep with. It's really hard to find a person I really want to sleep with. I can
*  go through thousands of people and not want to sleep with any of them. And then one person comes
*  along and suddenly it's like, oh, yeah, this person, this person will do. And there's something,
*  yeah, there's something, some complimentary, something going on. And I don't understand it
*  myself. It's enigmatic. And Lacan very much emphasized the fact that this object, the cause
*  of your desire is very enigmatic. You don't necessarily know what it is in the other person
*  that is calling upon you or is like summoning you to do this relationship. But there is something
*  there. It's just that you don't know what it is. And if you allow yourself to follow the thread of
*  that, you might get to something that would be very genuine and very derailing and difficult,
*  but also very genuine and kind of growth inducing. You know, I always like to end the podcast on an
*  optimistic note. And despite all expectations, I think we reached it right there. Something
*  genuine and growth inducing and dealing with our disequilibria in various productive ways. So
*  Mari-Rudi, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape podcast.
*  Thank you, Sean Carroll. My good friend. Thank you so much. This has been fun.
