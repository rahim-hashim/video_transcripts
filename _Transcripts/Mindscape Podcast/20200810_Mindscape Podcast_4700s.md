It’s easy to foresee that technological progress will change how we live; it’s much harder to anticipate exactly how. Self-driving cars represent an enormous technological challenge, but one that is plausibly on the way to being solved. What will be the unanticipated consequences when autonomous vehicles become commonplace? Jason Torchinsky is a fan of technology, but also a fan of driving, and his recent book Robot, Take the Wheel examines how our relationship with cars is likely to change in the near future.

Jason Torchinsky is a senior editor at Jalopnik. His writing has also appeared in venues such as Boing Boing, Muck Rack, and Mother Jones. He is a producer and occasional guest star on Jay Leno’s Garage, and has been the host of the YouTube series Jason Drives.

# Mindscape 109 | Jason Torchinsky on Our Self-Driving Future
**Mindscape Podcast:** [August 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nohjl0dF9zI)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. As
*  longtime listeners know, we like to mix it up here at Mindscape. There's a lot of
*  different topics we cover, but many of them are a little bit serious, academic,
*  high-brow kind of things, but we also like to have some fun now and again. We'll
*  talk about cooking or TV shows or whatever. Today is one of those podcasts.
*  We're gonna have a little bit of fun. Now the topic you wouldn't guess is one of
*  the weird ones because the topic is very mindscapie, autonomous vehicles, the
*  future of technology and self-driving cars. But it's not going to be about the
*  technology itself. We're going to talk about the human side of what this means,
*  what this means, what it will mean in the future, what it is meaning right now to
*  give up our control over our vehicles from ourselves to the artificially
*  intelligent robots. So our guest today is Jason Torchinsky.
*  Jason is not a PhD at Stanford designing new radar systems for cars. He's a writer
*  and illustrator, a good friend of mine that I've known for a long time. Jason
*  actually did the illustrations for my book From Eternity to Here. But more than
*  anything else, Jason is a car lover. He's a writer for jalopnik.com and his most
*  recent book is called Robot Take the Wheel, The Road to Autonomous Cars and
*  the Lost Art of Driving. So what we're talking about here in today's podcast is
*  what will it be like for us human beings to live in a world where cars drive
*  themselves? A lot of it won't even be driving ourselves. If you have autonomous
*  cars, there's no reason to have a person in them at all. They'll be delivering
*  things. At one point in the podcast, Jason fantasized about driving one of his cars
*  that is liable to break down at any moment, but he has another car trailing
*  behind him carrying spare parts. I should also warn sensitive listeners,
*  this is another podcast where we have naughty language being used. Last week
*  with Karl Bergstrom, it was right there in the title. We were talking about
*  bullshit. Here it's just for colorful slice of life kind of purposes. So I
*  think that you'll enjoy this one. It's both something that will make you think
*  because the autonomous cars are coming, but also something we can have fun with.
*  And with that, let's go.
*  Jason Torchinsky, welcome to Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thanks for having me, Sean. I'm very excited.
*  Well, you've written this wonderful book full of profanity. I'm saying that right
*  out loud so that we know listener wise, this is going to be rated explicit in
*  podcast listings rather than a clean episode, but not egregiously so, only when
*  called for. So your book, Robot...
*  Yeah, I'm a big fan.
*  Yeah, exactly. But it's a tool in the toolbox, right?
*  Exactly.
*  Robot, Take the Wheel is about autonomous cars, but it's not either a book full of
*  predictions or a little predictions are there, nor is it really a book mostly
*  about the technology. Is it too much to say it's a book about our attitudes
*  toward this oncoming thing that we're going to have to face pretty soon?
*  Yeah, I think that's a lot closer. I mean, there already are books out there that
*  covered the tech aspect of it, and that's changing so rapidly. The idea of writing a
*  book about that just wasn't appealing to me. And frankly, I'm just not that
*  qualified, really. And as far as raw predictions go, they rarely turn out the
*  way we think they will. And I feel like so many of the things that I see
*  predicted are usually coming from the companies themselves that have a vested
*  interest in these things, and I find them wildly optimistic. And I think they tend
*  to downplay how complex and interesting a problem this really is. So I just wanted
*  to avoid all that and make something... People are hearing a lot about it. I wanted
*  to give them some perspective and get them thinking about it in a broader sense
*  and not just in an automotive sense, because they are robots. This will be a mass
*  deployment of robots into society like we've never had before.
*  You make that point very clearly, and we will get there. But I think we have to do at
*  least a little bit of predicting here. I mean, there are probably people who think that
*  within 10 years, most cars will be essentially autonomous, and there's probably other people
*  who think that within 100 years, they won't. So what is the landscape in your mind that
*  you're using to sort of feel around what the important questions are? What do you think
*  it's going to be like 20 or 50 years from now? I think actually the most important thing as
*  far as that goes is, before I get into 20 or 50 years, we have to talk about what people
*  think right now at this moment, because there's actually a lot happening right now that's
*  extremely dangerous. And that is there's a lot of people right at this moment who do believe
*  that autonomous cars are already out there and you can go buy one. And that I think is the biggest
*  issue we have to overcome even before the predictions. I think we're a ways away. We're
*  probably a good decade away from these things becoming actually usable and safe enough to just
*  generally have in the road and maybe 20 years away before they're actually common. And I think even
*  then there's still going to be a lot of restrictions. But the biggest issue right now is that they don't
*  exist at this moment. Not really, not in the way everybody likes to think of them. And companies
*  like Tesla is the I think the biggest offender here are doing a lot to muddy the waters. You know,
*  their autopilot set up they have on their website, it says, you know, full self driving, that's an
*  option you can check when you're buying yourself a new Tesla. And that's dangerously not the case.
*  That's the label that they give it. Those are their words. Yeah, those are labels they give it. I mean,
*  it's called autopilot, which is a confusing name for most people. Autopilot. When people hear that,
*  they think autopilot, the car will drive itself, they think maybe about a plane autopilot or
*  something like that. And, you know, these the level of autonomy that you're that a Tesla has actually
*  that any, you know, Volvo has systems, GM has a system, Tesla has systems, Nissan, they've all got
*  autonomous like systems, but they're just level what would be known as level two autonomy,
*  which means the driver has to be aware and in control, or at least ready to take control
*  at a moment's notice it is not it is not fully autonomous by any stretch. And that confusion
*  is why you see news reports of people in Tesla's on the highway sleeping, and you know, reading or
*  something like that. And there's a number of wrecks that have happened, where these cars have
*  been on autopilot, and encountered a situation that they didn't know how to deal with that normally,
*  you would as a driver in the car should be ready to take over. But people believing these things
*  were more than they are, you know, weren't able to. Well, also, even at the best of times, I mean,
*  that just sounds like a very difficult position to be in to be in a car that is mostly driving
*  itself. But you are nevertheless expected to stand ready to jump in like that's harder than
*  actually driving in some sense. 100 I absolutely agree. In fact, there's a whole chapter in my book
*  I have about how semi autonomy is stupid, which is by semi autonomy. I'm referring to the level
*  two systems that cars like Tesla and GM's supercruise use right now. And I think it's
*  fundamentally stupid, because it's incompatible with how humans actually work. Like if something's
*  doing 80% of the work, and they it's there's a demand on the person who's in this system
*  where a machine is doing 80% of the work to be alert and ready to take over any moment. That's
*  just not how humans operate. We don't work that way. Like if something's doing most of the work,
*  once it shows us that it's probably basically okay, we relax, we turn off. That's why there are
*  people reading or watching movies behind the Tesla because it is on a clear open highway,
*  it's doing about 80% of the work of driving. And that's kind of enough for an awful lot of
*  highway driving. But crucially, it is not absolutely everything. And it is not enough to go on and
*  people just, we just don't work that way. And it is it is I find it harder. Like when you're
*  driving, like just driving, you go into like a kind of this state of where muscle memory takes
*  over. It's something you've been doing for years. And you know, so you react before even thinking
*  about it. Like when you drive, and something jumps in front of your car, you don't immediately have
*  to do like math and process where it's going your body just does it your car is very much a prosthetic
*  and that it's an extension of you, you make a motion very quickly and instinctively, you turn
*  the wheel, you hit the brake, and you move. If you're in a system where the car is expected to
*  be handling most of that, and you're kind of you have to have your hands on your wheel, but you're
*  also not supposed to be steering. It's a weird space to be in. It's an unnatural state. And I've
*  driven in these cars, and I hate it. I hate being on this autopilot mode, I would if my hands have
*  to be on the wheel, and I have to be sitting and looking and paying attention, I may as well just
*  drive the damn thing. Just fucking drive like you're already there. You don't get to sleep,
*  just drive the damn car. And I bet that there is actually a neuroscientific explanation for this in
*  terms of you know, both sort of system one versus system two are unconscious versus are conscious,
*  but also the map in our heads of what constitutes our physical self that we can use to explore the
*  world. Like there, like I think it's more than just a metaphor. When you say that we're in the
*  car, we think of it as an extension of our body, like we get sensory input from it, and it reacts
*  to us and so forth. And if you break that connection, it's a different kind of interaction.
*  It's much more cognitive, much more system two, and that's way harder to maintain over long periods
*  of time. I think that's a really good point. Yeah, because when you're just normally driving,
*  I actually talk about car as a prosthetic, as a body extension in here a lot, because that's what
*  driving does become. You wear a car in a sense. You are physically doing things, and they have
*  direct actions. You push your foot down, you push down your right foot, and you go faster. You know,
*  you push the brake or the clutch or the other foot, and you feel something happen immediately.
*  You move your arms. It's all, and your body gets used to these reactions. And I think you're right.
*  You're not, it is much more of, you know, system one kind of thinking. You're just doing things,
*  and they happen, and it's physical. Yeah, but the semi-autonomous space is a completely different
*  thing. You're managing a system in a stepped back way, and you're not going to have the
*  immediacy of reaction. It doesn't feel natural, and I don't think it's a good way to fundamentally
*  pilot a moving thing. So just so, because I've never really followed up or followed these news
*  reports very carefully. I mean, there are stories of people in Teslas or other vehicles getting into
*  trouble, but on the other hand, there are many stories that don't get published of people driving
*  cars getting into trouble. Right? Like, is there some feeling for whether at the current state of
*  the art, these actually are safer or less safe than just driving a regular old car?
*  Well, it's tricky because car driving is dangerous. No question about it. People get into accidents
*  all the damn time, every bit of the time. I mean, I've met people, and I'm incredibly surprised that
*  people don't die even more often than they do. Like the idea of just giving people a ton of
*  metal moving at very fast speeds and hoping for the best is a little bit crazy if you didn't
*  already have it established in the world. Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, if you were to be completely
*  right. One of the things is the reason I'm a car, an automotive journalist, and the reason I love
*  cars is because they are fundamentally irrational things in every possible sense. If you were an
*  alien and landed here, and you went to explain to this alien how the personal transportation system
*  works in the world, they would be stopping you after the first five minutes and go,
*  whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell are you guys doing? Why would you do it this way?
*  I mean, if you think about the way we choose to buy cars makes no sense. The fact that cars,
*  like for example, I drive a car, my daily driver is this little weird Japanese market Nissan pow.
*  It makes 53 horsepower. It's fine. I get everywhere I need to go just fine. I can go on the highway.
*  I could do 75 miles an hour. But the audience, our audience needs to know that you are special.
*  In this particular way, you are not representative of the car driving public in any way.
*  No, I am not. And that's going to be linked to my point, which is that most cars today have
*  two to three, not even like three to 10 times the power of this car. We don't buy cars for
*  rational reasons. We don't drive rational vehicles. If it all made sense, it was rational.
*  They would be like five different kinds of cars. Parts would be interchangeable.
*  Styling wouldn't matter. But cars aren't like that. There's something much more human about them.
*  They're closer in some ways to fashion than they are other things we buy. You can have a refrigerator
*  for 30 years and when you get rid of it, you don't care. But pretty much everybody I know
*  has either shed a tear or come close to shedding tears when they've gotten rid of a car they've
*  had for a long time. I did. I recently changed cars and it was a heartbreaking experience.
*  Was it the Jag you used to have? Did you get rid of your Jag?
*  I did. Yeah. I traded it in for a little electric BMW i3, which is like the opposite end of Car Land
*  from my V8 convertible Jaguar. But fun in its own way. But either way, there's a strong emotional
*  connection. And you also spend a lot of time in it. A lot of people half an hour or an hour
*  commute either way. That's a lot of your life that is spent in that vehicle.
*  It's a big deal. And even people who claim they don't care about cars. There's plenty of people
*  say, oh, I don't care what I drive. I guarantee you we can find a vehicle that they do not want
*  to be seen in. If they say they don't care about cars and they say, okay, great, I'm going to loan
*  you this Hummer with gold wheels that I'd like you to drive around for a day. They would go,
*  I don't really want anyone to see me getting out of that thing.
*  Like you say, it's much more like wearing clothes. It is definitely part of who you are,
*  even if you just claim that. Exactly. You are making a statement about who you are
*  with your vehicle. And now I've kind of forgotten. We're trying to get to whether or not they really
*  are safe right now compared to the terrible lack of safety in regular cars. Yeah. I mean,
*  look, driving's not safe. Driving's never been 100% safe. It probably never will be 100% safe.
*  You're moving a human body at speeds far beyond the warranty. Like we were never meant to do any
*  of this crap. We were good at running in fields and chasing gazelle or whatever the hell we did.
*  But this is all outside of the warranty. So it's not safe. Now, autonomous cars, the big argument
*  that's always made in the hardcore Tesla stands and the people who get mad at you on Twitter,
*  whenever you say anything bad about Elon Musk, one of the things they always come back to is that
*  he's saving lives. And if you're not 100% behind these autonomous vehicle plans, then you're killing
*  people. But maybe that'll be true in the future. At this moment, that's not true at all. And
*  even for all the miles that I mean, we don't, there hasn't been a deployment of 100% autonomous
*  vehicles on the road yet. I mean, there have been tests and Google has fleet and things like that.
*  But it's all under pretty controlled circumstances. Really, there's people in there watching and
*  guiding. And even though they may have millions of miles racked up, it doesn't even hold a candle
*  to how many just person miles happen every day in the world of millions and millions of people
*  driving cars everywhere. Yeah. And it's at this moment, we're not there yet. I mean,
*  look, okay, you could argue somebody falling asleep at the wheel of a conventionally driven car,
*  it's going to end badly, no matter what. But it'll end badly quickly, you know, it will end badly,
*  probably within minutes of them really falling asleep at the wheel, you're not going to drive
*  very far before you're going to run into something or hurt someone or hurt yourself.
*  In something like a Tesla or another vehicle with level two autonomy on like an open highway,
*  you can fall asleep. And there's a chance you'll be okay. There's a chance you'll be okay. There's
*  a chance you'll go two hours of driving before you wake up and realize, holy crap, I've been asleep.
*  There's also a chance you could drive for a half hour and then run into a much bigger group of
*  people. Like, at best, I think where we are right now, you have maybe a buffer, maybe there's a
*  bigger buffer of safety that you're allowed. Because there's some compensatory work that the
*  vehicle is doing. But I don't know if we're really at the point where I can 100% say you're
*  absolutely safer. Because, look, it could be you fall asleep at the wheel of your car, you run off
*  the road almost immediately, it's done, you fall asleep at the wheel of a Tesla, you could end up
*  going from an area of sparse population and traffic density into one that's higher, like,
*  causing even more trouble. And people have been killed behind the wheel of cars that were, you
*  know, like Tesla's driving themselves in level two. Like, it's happened. It's not like a hypothetical.
*  So it's a complex situation. It's complex. And right now, I don't think we're at the point where
*  we can 100% say the cars are doing a better job of not killing people. We're not there yet. They
*  could, but not yet. A great way to keep extending your knowledge base is to look at courses from
*  The Great Courses Plus. The Great Courses Plus is an extremely convenient streaming service,
*  offering you very simple access to a wide variety of courses taught by professors of The Great
*  Courses Plus. It goes from the depths of the ocean to the history of Egypt to the study of DNA,
*  and new courses are being added all the time. So there's something for everyone. If you're
*  interested in the kind of thing we're talking about on the podcast today, Automation in the
*  Future, there's a good course by Tim Chartier called Big Data, how data analytics is transforming
*  the world. It gives you a little bit of a peek into the nuts and bolts of artificial intelligence
*  systems and how they're being used in modern technology. And now, Mindscape listeners can

*  That's fair. I mean, the other thing is you have been using this phraseology level two,
*  and I don't know if that's just your classification system or if that's universally accepted,
*  but why don't you let us in on what the classification levels are? Sure. Yeah, so that's
*  from the Society of Automotive Engineers is where this comes from. It's a basically a five
*  level setup. So yeah, this is a good thing to explain. So level one is completely manual car,
*  like there's no, no autonomy features at all. Maybe level 1.5, you could say cruise control,
*  because the car is handling, you know, the throttle aspect, you know, a little bit and then dynamic
*  cruise, or probably edging on level two, where it keeps the same distance. Level two autonomy is the
*  highest you can buy commercially right now. And that would be like Tesla autopilot, GM supercruise,
*  that kind of thing where the car can do things like it's basically a combination of lane keeping.
*  It does some visual cognition where it like has a camera feed, it reads lines, it can see if
*  something's coming in front of it and it can slow down or stop. It does dynamic cruise,
*  where it keeps a set distance between another vehicle. So it does some but level two also means
*  it can fail at any moment with zero warning. That's why it's in that weird space we were talking
*  about, where you have to be ready to take over at any moment. And that's why Teslas require people
*  to have their hands on the steering wheel. While the system is active, although people have done
*  things like you can shove an orange in the wheel and that could override it. And somebody was
*  actually selling this thing called an autopilot buddy that you just hung on the steering wheel,
*  and it mimicked the weight of hands the wheel. So there's all kinds of really stupid ways.
*  GM is doing something different where they have a camera pointing at your face,
*  where they're watching your eyes and if your eyes deviate from the road then it sets off warnings
*  and stuff. And I think also I bet if they ever go to court that they would use that in their favor
*  or something like that too. I don't even know, are these supposed to be able to also park the car,
*  stop the traffic lights and start and things like that? Level two could encompass stopping
*  at traffic lights and things like that. Tesla just, I think the recent beta just allows for
*  traffic light stopping. Actually it's funny because they added in a thing for it to read
*  stop signs and traffic lights and things like that. And somebody was recording where it was
*  reading a Burger King sign as like a traffic slowdown thing and it was slowing down by this
*  Burger King sign and then Burger King used that in some ad campaigns. So if you were in a Tesla
*  and you could prove that your car automatically stopped at a Burger King they'd give you a whopper.
*  And actually like the traffic sign recognition shows up on a lot more cars that even don't have
*  these systems. There was, Mazda uses it and then on their little heads up display, if there's a
*  stop sign they'll show an icon of the sign that shows up. And just with magic marker, I drew a
*  sign that said slop and it put it up and it fooled the system. So these are, there's all
*  kinds of potential for shenanigans with this stuff because it's very easy to fool these things.
*  Artificial intelligence is still pretty stupid when it comes to a lot of things.
*  And can it park? Can you in principle do that? Like if you were just throwing caution to the wind,
*  could I get into the car in my driveway, tell it to drive to someone else's driveway and not
*  touch the wheel the whole time? Is that current technology? I don't think you can go driveway
*  to driveway but you can, there's a bunch of cars have self-parking systems where they can go into
*  parallel parking spots or other spots. Tesla even has a summon mode where you can be in a
*  parking lot, like a big parking lot in front of like a supermarket or something, and you could
*  summon the car to come out of the parking lot and then come to you tracking you by your phone.
*  Which actually that, it kind of amazes me that this is allowed to be done at all because it's
*  insane if you think about it. Oh yeah. Because okay, a parking lot is not technically on the road.
*  This is just a beta system and they're letting people do it and this is, and when it came out,
*  a number of like mid last year, there are people putting all kinds of videos of these things going
*  the wrong way down these sections. It's very impressive technology but at the same time,
*  it's not really finished and they're basically beta testing this in public life. Like if I had
*  a 2,500 pound remote control car and I said, hey, I want to play with this in the parking lot of a
*  target and just fuck around with it and see what would be fun, I would get arrested in seconds.
*  They wouldn't let me do that but that's literally what you're doing with this Tesla summon mode.
*  It's not different but somehow they do it and no one's been killed or anything but there have been
*  plenty of close calls and it's a remote controlled car but a big one. Yeah. Anyway, it's a full-size
*  car. So then what's level three? What's that? Level three. Level three. So level three is
*  very similar to level two but it can fail safely. So level three means you can, it can
*  basically drive on its own but if it encounters a situation where it fails or it gets bad input or
*  it can't deal, where level two would require the driver to immediately take over, level three will
*  have some kind of system for it to fail over in an elegant way. Either pull over carefully to the side
*  or something similar. I don't think a bunch of companies have come pretty close to level three.
*  I know Volvo was playing with the system that they claimed could safely pull over but if you're on a
*  highway, this is still a difficult problem. If you're on a highway and you don't have a good
*  shoulder, being able to fail over safely is still tricky. You can't just stop. So if something
*  happens, like remember because these things are relying on LiDAR sensor, well I guess Tesla doesn't
*  use LiDAR but cameras and some of them are using LiDAR. If mud gets flung onto a camera lens and
*  you can't see, where humans are pretty good at squinting through the wipers and kind of, we have
*  millennia of evolution to make us good at figuring out what we're seeing. These things don't have that
*  and if they lose most of their vision, they don't have a lot of choice. They just kind of have to
*  stop safely. So level three is like level two but you don't have to take over. It can handle
*  stopping without everyone ending up dead. And this is, it recalls a couple of conversations we've
*  had here on the podcast before on, about artificial intelligence and its struggles and shortcomings.
*  We don't have the ability yet to teach computers common sense or a feeling for the world around us
*  that somehow takes into account what we all are born knowing about solid objects and how they
*  behave. I remember seeing one demonstration of a machine learning program that was really,
*  really good at telling the difference between dogs and wolves but it turns out that it wasn't even
*  looking at the dogs and the wolves, it was just looking at the background and you know the wolves
*  are always in nature and in the snow and things like that and the dogs are in backyards and so
*  take a picture of a husky out there in the snow and it's like that's clearly a wolf.
*  And sure you can put a wolf on a couch and it's gonna say dog. Yeah and that's very,
*  that's a bit worrisome. It is because a lot of these are black box kind of systems. We don't
*  really know what's going on in those weird brains in there. Honestly, artificial intelligence is
*  always a term I found questionable because it's not really, it's not even artificial intelligence,
*  it's more like mimicry of intelligence or something like that. The processes are so different and I
*  think in driving we get this even more because there's so many human aspects to driving which
*  after I go through these levels we should talk about all those subtle things because I think
*  that's what makes it really fascinating and I think if you want to say like okay the first
*  20 years of autonomous driving development got us to like 70 percent. This last 30 or 20 percent
*  is where the really strange and subtle stuff is going to happen and I think that's what's
*  going to really take a while. Yeah that's true with everything but good. Level four is, it can
*  basically do anything drive just like a person you get in say go wherever I want to go but it's in a
*  geo-fenced area. Like you've basically established a corridor of a situation where you know you can
*  kind of control the circumstances but the car in that circumstance can pretty much do anything.
*  I've been in a system like this, a test system where they basically had a retirement community
*  in these little golf cart like vehicles that were autonomous but it was an extremely controlled
*  situation. After we were in there we took it out into, this was outside of Boston,
*  we took it into Boston traffic and the thing freaked out immediately at the first roundabout
*  we went to because it's programmed to be extremely polite and part of driving involves taking risks,
*  risks you don't know the output of. Like whenever you go on like in a roundabout there's always a
*  point where a car is coming at you and you just have to decide I'm just gonna go you just hit the
*  gas and do it and you take a little bit of risk. Hopefully they can deal with it. What's that?
*  Hopefully they can deal with it, the other driver. Exactly and you are relying on the other driver
*  to not panic and all that stuff and most of the time it works fine occasionally it doesn't. But
*  this system used to its geo-fenced area in like a retirement community surrounded mostly by other
*  vehicles like it that were friendly and polite. It got along there fine but once it got in the
*  real world it freaked out. It's like a kid who'd been homeschooled and then you throw them into like
*  a brutal high school situation and you know the first day is gonna come home in tears and...
*  To be fair I kind of freak out when I'm asked to drive in the Boston area also as someone who was
*  there for many years. It's a little bit anomalous. Yeah it's not easy but I mean there's plenty of
*  cities like that and then level five is the hypothetical platonic ideal of just the complete
*  robotic car. You get in, say where you want to go and it figures everything out.
*  And for even at level four we could imagine, I mean maybe one of the steps along the way is we have
*  specialized highways that only autonomous vehicles are allowed to go on and the speed limit is 250
*  miles an hour and we don't expect them to sort of stop at traffic lights or anything like that. But
*  do you think that that's a reasonable stepping stone along the way to autonomous vehiclehood?
*  I think that definitely could happen. I think you know and I cover this in the book too kind
*  of from a perspective of someone who wants to keep driving as a human because I feel like that's
*  that kind of compromise offers a you know is that's the biggest threat to human driving in
*  the sense like there may come a point where the tipping point is that more people would rather
*  have their cars drive for them than drive themselves and then all of a sudden I could
*  see human drivers getting forced out of highways that get turned into autonomous vehicle only
*  highways which are you know marked and designed for autonomous vehicle travel, relying on the
*  car-to-car communications that would be happening. You could have very high speeds. I mean in a lot
*  of ways it becomes something close to a mass transit system really just with independent
*  pods or cars because that's kind of what makes the most sense for highway-like corridors. All
*  these things should be ganging up together and communicating with one another to form basically
*  mass transit kind of setups and then people still have individual ability to break off of the main
*  group and then go their own separate ways but that would necessitate no humans around. Yeah well no
*  humans controlling anything yeah and you also you invented your own level six to this list of levels
*  right? Oh yeah that's right my level six what was level six? Level six is where the car decides where it wants to go
*  oh yeah that's yeah it actually decides where to take you right where you don't even have you don't
*  even tell the destination anymore level six is where you just trust the car for anything because
*  you just assume it's going to know better than you where you should be going and then you're done.
*  We laugh but that might be coming up who knows. Okay I mean I think also I do want to get into
*  the human aspects of driving and interfacing maybe maybe even driving isn't the right word but
*  we should also share with the audience a little bit about the technology that that enables these
*  things we mentioned AI I mean you mentioned the cars talking to each other is that I take it that
*  is not part of most current systems. Not to the extent that a lot of people are saying it should
*  be they usually call this car to car or c2c sometimes but the thinking is for this to work
*  really well every like there has to be a constant web of communication between vehicles we do it to
*  some degree now I mean turn signals are a version of this and even looking you know if you ever well
*  you you're you live in LA so you know in LA only has its own few unspoken rules about driving.
*  I remember when I lived in LA if I wanted to merge into like a line of slow moving traffic or whatever
*  the trick was you got if you made eye contact with the person in the car there was an unspoken rule
*  and it worked 99 percent of the time the person would let you in in front of them but sometimes
*  they would really avoid eye contact because they didn't want to do it but they knew once that eye
*  contact was established it happened and I remember remember staring at one guy once really wanting
*  to get in and he finally broke and made eye contact and he made that kind of exasperated
*  because he knows that's the rule LA also has the rule of three people can turn on turn left at a
*  red light you know about this Sean well I see I've always heard it as two people so you are trying
*  to push the idea that three cars can go through a red light turning left yeah I've always heard
*  three that was my okay but I mean this is it's a lot but I feel like I've consistently I lived in
*  LA like 20 years almost and I feel like I consistently would see three going at the red but
*  it's not a rule that's written anywhere it's just some degree of that rule two or three some degree
*  that you allow some people to go through in the red is an unspoken agreed upon rule among the
*  drivers that's part of what's going to be fascinating to teach autonomous vehicles because
*  they they won't understand this these folk laws that we have are things that they don't get that
*  all the gestures that we make through windows and through you know when we look at each other while
*  we're driving which we do all the time you know all of those are things that these cars won't get
*  and I know I'm getting away from the technology but no no but this is but it relates immediately
*  back to the technology because so if I if I push back a little bit and I play the role of the
*  techno utopian now once the cars are talking to each other and we can let them all sort of do a
*  little bit of deep learning on what happens as they go through the streets the cars will evolve
*  their own ways of signaling and sort of implicit rules that are not written into the traffic code
*  but nevertheless maybe make things more efficient that's I think that is true if you had a system
*  where all the cars were talking to each other we need you know agreed upon standards which is
*  tricky and that also leads this like this is the thing I love about autonomous vehicles is that
*  the more you dig the more complexes gets because we're we're about to enter an even more sticky
*  situate like discussion where if these cars are talking to each other and they're going to come
*  up with their own set of criteria and rules to make for more efficient traffic flow that means
*  there needs to be an overarching set of rules and criteria and you know these are this is edging on
*  azimovian laws of robotics like do do the cars prioritize their own occupants or do they prioritize
*  the good of the people around them how do they make these value calls and there's been a lot of
*  fascinating research done on all this stuff you get into the the trolley problem you know
*  trolley problem yeah yeah exactly that's like it comes up yeah I had to address it in the book
*  because it always comes up even though it's kind of absurd and you're very unlikely to have to
*  actually encounter it but I'm not sure what happened I'm pretty sure that like 10 years ago
*  no one had heard of the trolley problem and now it's just part of pop culture I'm not quite sure
*  how it got there I know it was in the good place but it predates that oh yeah it predates that I
*  mean I think autonomous cars did a lot to popularize it because the rise of
*  because like that's the big thing where people start thinking about it I mean why would we have
*  brought it up before then really oh the trolley problem is hilariously it's kind of a hilarious
*  thing to read about because the various levels of it like there's one where they talk about
*  pushing a fat guy under the tracks to stop the train yeah that's right let me pause for a second
*  to talk about the number one job site in the world indeed.com one of the great challenges you
*  face if you're going to hire people is that you need all the information you can get and also know
*  where to focus with indeed you have access to the largest pool of talent and can hire the right

*  the this is this is worth just saying out loud because i think it is kind of fascinating i mean
*  the trolley problem is not supposed to teach you something about ethics it's just supposed to remind
*  you that we have competing ethical instincts and it's not clear how to resolve them right and i
*  think that it's almost right it's almost misapplied for self-driving cars because hopefully if a
*  self-driving car has an option of killing one person or killing five people it will kill one
*  person and this is probably hopefully very rare that it even has that choice but if you read
*  Asimov's stories about the robots where the real tension comes because all the stories are about
*  how his laws of robotics don't work in some sense right there's some some way in which they fail so
*  what if the completely autonomous vehicle sees a terrorist who's about to do something terrible
*  like does the autonomous vehicle have the positive responsibility of taking out the
*  terrorist to save a whole bunch of people rather than just letting the terrorist do the terrible
*  things that's where things get a little bit freaky i think yeah and actually i i address this directly
*  in the book like should we make them heroic like here's here's a thought okay and i go through this
*  little thought experiment in the book okay if let's say we're at some point in the future where
*  autonomous cars form a population of like they're 20 of the traffic of general life and let's say
*  you know there was that situation in like toronto where that guy drove like a rented u-haul truck
*  into a huge crowd of people if that if what if you could sign up when you register your car in
*  the same way you sign up as an organ donor now you could check a box that says in certain situations
*  my car is allowed to be conscripted for the greater good so if there could be something where
*  like they see a guy in a rented u-haul is going to drive into a big crowd of people at a street
*  fair or something if if say like six cars are in between the path of that truck and the group of
*  people and one of them is yours and you could have said okay what if your cars could be used to form
*  a roadblock to keep that truck from getting to where it wants to go um like that's a thing that
*  we could do um if an ambulance is coming down the street it could be sending a signal to all
*  the autonomous vehicle traffic to either get out of the way or possibly even like a sheepdog heard
*  other traffic out of the way to form a path for the ambulance so it can get to its location quicker
*  there's actually a lot of applications where heroism could be programmed into these vehicles
*  we just have to decide do we want to do it are people willing to potentially risk if it's a
*  privately owned car you know do we let them you know do they want to take that risk or do we mandate
*  if a company runs a fleet of self-driving taxis that they all have to agree to be heroic in
*  certain extreme situations i think it's fascinating concept well and also it does i think it's sort of
*  psychologically illuminating because even without knowing what the answer is when you say uh i could
*  imagine being in a self-driving car that is programmed to get out of the way for ambulances
*  that you think oh yeah okay that's not so bad i could i could probably live with that but then
*  when you say what if all the other cars in the road are self-driving and they are programmed to
*  sheepdog me out of the way when an ambulance comes suddenly you feel like your personal
*  autonomy is being a bit threatened here yeah and i mean it is it would you would be giving up a
*  little bit of autonomy with that if your private property could be destroyed in the service of the
*  greater good i think most of us would probably say they'd be willing to do that but you are
*  giving up some some degree of autonomy and you know the idea of prioritizing the occupants
*  like are we going to have one set of rules or is it going to be like each manufacturer gets to decide
*  like is it just going to be the kind of thing we know if you buy an expensive enough car the people
*  inside will be prioritized more than the people outside or can you make these settings on your
*  own and like uh you know a settings option panel in the dashboard or something like that
*  and how will it work if we allow people to make their own you know if we don't have a hard and
*  fast set of rules for something like that it gets messy fast we live in a country where people have
*  trouble wearing masks in the middle of a global pandemic so i'm not at all optimistic they're
*  going to turn over the autonomy of their cars uh to come i know and when i wrote this book like
*  you know i wrote this book uh i guess like year before last came out last year but when i wrote
*  we weren't in a pandemic nobody was talking about masks and i think i was a little more optimistic
*  but yeah seeing how people react to masks is very disheartening these are not the same these are not
*  the people who are going to prioritize the greater good when it comes to their car if there's a
*  setting for them to kill everyone around them to make sure they get out through okay they will
*  anyway then there's you know fear yeah lidar cameras how do these work how do how do the
*  cars know what's around them and who to hit and who not to hit okay so a lot of different systems
*  in these things um right now the most common way is visual there's cameras and almost every modern
*  new car has a camera set up in it that could be used for semi-autonomy every car that does
*  lane keeping for example which is extremely common now almost any every car maker i think makes a
*  card lane keeping basically behind the rear view mirror on your windshield there's a camera it's
*  looking at the street and it's basically using visual processing algorithms to see where the
*  lanes are on an autonomous car it's using similar kinds of ai to take images from the camera identify
*  what's likely to be a car what's likely to be a person walking lane markings street signs that
*  kind of thing and it uses that to help drive and steer the car a lot of the a lot of the
*  uh images of like cars and people are done kind of proportionally like uh cars tend to be a certain
*  scale and a certain kind of proportion and a guy on a guy walking or a woman walking is another
*  basic you know taller rectangle someone on a bike is a certain kind of rectangle
*  speed and distance all these things are factored in so there's a big visual component and that's
*  a lot of the hardware in the car a lot of the image processing computing power is for the this
*  for reading what the camera's sending and yet i was surprised to read in your car that you know
*  the cameras aren't that great no they're nowhere near as good as human eyeballs and and that seems
*  like an obvious place for improvement i don't know maybe it just is not uh worth the cost i'm not sure
*  i mean they're i think if like the quality is basically like a from a webcam like you know
*  10 years ago really i think if they're doing 1024 by 768 resolution i think that's even on the high
*  side i don't think they do much more than that really um it's the image quality isn't that great
*  and you know it's it doesn't but it doesn't need that much detail really although there have been
*  cases where these things get fooled like if you have a photograph there was a study i think mit
*  did where they had a van with pictures of bicycles on it and that was very easy to fool these
*  autonomous cars uh they would immediately think these were bicycles on the car like they're
*  that's just again these are all things that humans would never be fooled by yeah but that's
*  they're they're trying hard and like like you said before shenanigans right i mean there are ways that
*  people with not completely um noble intentions could make life hard for these autonomous vehicles
*  absolutely i mean it's like having a very competent toddler driving some of these in a way
*  either they can do it but they're easy to fool at the same time um and then there's lidar so lidar
*  famously rejected by elon musk he didn't want to use lidar i think possibly for aesthetic reasons
*  because it usually requires a funny looking dome on the top of the car but it's uh it's like laser
*  based radar it's basically uh it shoots lasers in like a 360 degree um you know well i guess a circle
*  around or dome around the car and it's recording the time to bounce back so lidar is very good for
*  doing distance ranging and seeing things even if the visual conditions aren't necessarily that
*  great so lidar gives a good overall view of everything around the car in a very three
*  dimensional way and it it would be working with um camera input to you know to um approximate that
*  you give the give the car a sense of where it is and then you have things like ultrasonic sensors
*  which are mostly used for close quarters kind of thing parking um reading what's very close to you
*  there's also radar which is usually used for keeping the distance between the car and a
*  in a vehicle in front of it usually those are just front mounted radar emitters um these are
*  yeah that's most of the systems and of course there's all the computing power needed to run it
*  and ideally in the future there probably will be communications equipment um i mean there already
*  are there's gps also i mean it is talking to satellites to know where it is and know where
*  to go gps is crucial for this and it can use gps um and pre pre-existing data about the roads
*  so it kind of knows what's coming up and can predict certain things about the roads and even
*  that could be updated you know if there's systems in place to give it like information and that
*  changes rapidly like there's construction here and it's down to one lane uh that information
*  hypothetically could be sent to cars prior to them driving i think catalac was using a system
*  for a while where they were doing a sort of higher level autonomy on roads that they had vetted that
*  they knew and were in a database that was sent to the car so they could drive them with more
*  confidence but of course that doesn't help for you know random things that could happen other drivers
*  logs that fall on the road you know cattle trucks overturning anything like that i mean these days
*  most of us are carrying around personal gps devices that are in constant communication with
*  the rest of the world uh in the form of our phones i could imagine very easily hooking up the phone to
*  a car and letting it share that info you must have seen the guy who was carrying around a whole
*  bunch of iphones in a little uh toy uh wagon and then google thought it was a traffic jam on that
*  street because all those phones yeah i didn't know yeah that's right which is amazing yeah
*  yeah that guy was awesome yeah it's um so yeah i mean and the other thing is uh some of these
*  other things that don't seem to get thought about very often though um even with all these sensors
*  being really good you have to keep them clean um we're really good as people at driving through
*  hard rain and snow and icy conditions like you most of us driving in cold weather ice we scrape
*  out a hole in the windshield and we're pretty much good to go um it's not necessarily the best way our
*  you know we're driving more carefully we're maybe trying to be a little more aware but a good ice
*  storm will keep most autonomous vehicles from going anywhere unless they have systems in place
*  to heat and melt ice off radar emitters and camera sensors and things like that like
*  you're gonna have to keep these things clean yeah i know that is going to be a thing
*  but so it sounds like a big a big part of the challenge then is uh just like human beings the
*  cars are multi-sensory right you have the lidar and i mean do you personally think that lidar will
*  be part of future autonomous vehicles or will elon be right and you can get away with just cameras
*  now i think i think you're gonna need lidar uh lidar does provide a lot more information than
*  just a camera feed just a better three-dimensional map of what's around you elevation changes things
*  that are also confusing visually lidar wouldn't get fooled for example one of the there's been
*  at least two fatal wrecks of people in tesla's on autopilot where a it's basically been a down
*  open highway in bright clear weather conditions but a white truck has been going perpendicular
*  like coming out of a gas station or across the road and the camera wasn't able to discern the
*  white truck you know body itself you know like a tractor trailer truck yeah the the trailer part
*  it wasn't able to discern it from the sky and the car just basically slammed right into it um lidar
*  would have prevented something like that because it would have read it as a three large three
*  dimensional object in the way so i think the more systems you have more sensory systems you have
*  acting as backups to one another is always going to be better but so what you're saying is future
*  cars are all going to have laser domes on the top that doesn't sound like a bad thing to me i mean
*  that sounds like an improvement yeah i think that'd be kind of cool and i've seen um they're getting
*  smaller and there've been some designs i've seen where they're incorporating them better and if
*  you don't have a central one at the top they've been working on ones at each corner that do
*  you know they just work together to form the full arc they'll figure it out i mean make the styles
*  work a little harder they could figure out how to incorporate these things in there they can do it
*  i mean i think i don't so i i completely appreciate the um worries that you're mentioning
*  with these the difficulties with all these sensory modalities but it it does i'm going to
*  guess that these are solvable problems um a lot of technology i mean it might be cautionary for
*  the time scale that it will take us to solve them i guess what i wonder is uh it sounds like a
*  complicated problem are we do we have like really smart programmers trying to uh write code that
*  will help the car turn uh all this information into a map of its environment or are we sort of
*  doing the deep learning thing where we just train it and uh it the car the the ai system or whatever
*  figures out for itself how to convert uh that data into a map do you know i think well i think it's a
*  combination of both from what i've been able to see the way the industry is moving it seems to be
*  a combination of both there's definitely very clever programs working on these problems but
*  there's also an awful lot of um importance put into the number of miles of training that these
*  cars do tesla likes to talk about how many millions of miles their cars have racked up with their
*  autopilot setup uh google and waymo have been driving cars around constantly mapping and trying
*  and testing and they're doing the deep learning kind of method for that so i think it's a
*  combination and i feel like right now the big players are putting a it seems like they're
*  putting more at least more visible effort into uh the deep learning training getting them to drive
*  just brute forcing as much data in there as possible what could possibly go wrong yeah i
*  can't imagine how this could be terribly disastrous and you know the other thing is like we were
*  talking about before there's so many i feel like there's a lot of things that aren't being
*  addressed like you've driven in new york i imagine like in new york city i have not and i don't think
*  i ever have i've been in new york plenty of times but like you know look i i drive in california i'm
*  a wimp when i move back to the east coast where i'm from like i leave that for other people
*  well driving in new york or any there's a lot of big cities like this it's a different kind of thing
*  um if you're at a intersection with pedestrians around which in like middle manhattan is pretty
*  much everywhere um there's an interesting process that happens so no i haven't even noticed i don't
*  even know if it matters what the light is showing or the walker will not walk lights and sometimes
*  it just doesn't matter but there's a dance where some massive pedestrians will be going across and
*  if the driver has a green light i guess and if they feel like they want to go through they kind
*  of inch forward into the scrum of people and they're basically driving into the crowd of people
*  until there's some breaking point where people decide okay let's let the car through and they
*  back off but for some period of time you're driving into a crowd of people very very slowly
*  but you're doing it how do you program a car to do that how do you program a car to say drive like
*  you're gonna run over a whole lot of people but don't really mean it and the way it works is again
*  there's a lot of communication between driver and people through the windshield you're looking at
*  the eyes of the person in there at some point there's a this kind of negotiation that happens
*  within seconds and you know then one or both goes through so like the driver ends up going
*  or then they pause and then the people go by but there's a constant negotiation that's very human
*  and it's there's communication there human to human communication that i think is going to be
*  really difficult to program into a car and you know also when it comes to like people crossing
*  streets we immediately see like a mom with holding a little kid's hand at the corner of a street like
*  a crazy little toddler and we know because we're people that toddler could do something bonkers
*  at any moment and you're much less predictable or you see someone who's clearly crazy who's just
*  like acting weird and all of a sudden we're like be ready for someone to act weird that's that's a
*  lot to ask out of a computer learning system and that's the part where i think things get dicey
*  well i've also driven in india which is completely bonkers and i have no idea how the hell that would
*  i've been i've been in places you know i've been in i mean paris and london are pretty bad to be
*  honest we don't need to go to very exotic places but i've been in southeast asia also i've not
*  been to india but yeah the the local norms are all different you know la and san francisco have
*  different local norms and for driving and it does matter a lot india is basically brownie in motion
*  somehow it's just if you think of the cars and molecules flowing and things it's somehow not
*  everyone's dead it works but i've driven india and i've been driven in india and it's terrifying
*  like people will drive into oncoming traffic in the other lane because the road is smoother on
*  that side and they won't even move over until you can like read the watch of the guy coming towards
*  you and then i mean i was on this off-road rally there and at the only time in my life i've been
*  driving in like driving this um a hindrathar which is like a jeep in like these sand dune kind of
*  conditions that was actually very tricky to drive and there were brief stretches of road it's the
*  only time where i've ever gotten off a paved road onto dirt and rocks and thought oh thank god now
*  i can relax but it's all because those are not our local conditions like i had a friend in boston
*  who's like it's all the tourists who make it dangerous here because they drive at the speed
*  limit and try to obey rules and it's just not what everyone else is doing they're they're fish out
*  of water exactly but anyway i think yes i do want to get to the the fun part of your book because
*  what you know it's sort of there's a couple of uh not very hidden agendas there and one of them is
*  to think about the design you know the the fact that once you have a truly autonomous vehicle
*  it's not a car anymore and and we're being held back by this idea that we're thinking of autonomous
*  cars as basically cars but they're going to drive themselves and what you're saying is once you're
*  not driving it there's a whole new universe of possibilities for what to do that opens up
*  yeah it's it's a robot i mean that's the thing we have to really we have to stop thinking about
*  them as cars once once we get to these level four or five vehicles that don't even have
*  provisions for a human to drive it's something completely different it's no longer a car it's a
*  transportation robot and really what people want has very little to do with how cars are designed
*  now like if you think about it the way we design cars now it's like a set of bleachers two rows
*  and they're both facing forward why would you want that if you're not driving like you want a
*  little room really yeah you want a little room on wheels and you want to be able to do anything in
*  that little room like you'll want to be able to sometimes have it open windows and sometimes
*  you'll want the you'll want complete privacy because you're doing filthy things in there
*  because people will because it's going to be your own private space you're not going to want to sit
*  facing forward you would want you know like couches or people facing each other maybe you're going to
*  want to sleep in that thing you're going to work do whatever it's just it's no longer a car it's a
*  mobile room that's a robot that takes you where you want to be i was definitely surprised to
*  learn in your book that honda has already made a love car yes yeah oh yeah i love that the honda
*  and what's amazing is that it was it was the smx and it was actually so and you have to understand
*  the circumstances of the japanese market to really get it because it was when it was marketed it was
*  a k-class car which is a special class of small car that you don't have to pay the same taxes on
*  in japan so it's designed to be sold in dense cities like tokyo privacy is a precious commodity
*  in a city like tokyo especially if you're a young person who's not quite out on your own let's say
*  you're 18 to 22 or something like that you have a girlfriend but you still live at home the idea of
*  a small volume of space that is just yours is extremely valuable for all the filthy reasons
*  you're probably thinking of and honda knew this and they actually advertised this car with like
*  love based terms and it was all like tongue-in-cheek everything like it would fold flat into like a very
*  nice little double bed with all the seats folded down and they knew exactly what they were doing
*  and all the advertising was basically mobile love hotel unashamedly the wet when was this made
*  what's that when was this made oh this when it was it was made in the i think this was in the
*  recently like this is a late 90s early 2000s vehicle this man it sounds so 70s to me but
*  what's that it sounds so 70s to me but i guess okay it could be more recent than that well i mean we
*  had that in the 70s too the big van the custom van craze of the 70s yeah the shag carpet that was
*  basically the american version of the same same thing but the love car was like it was a regular
*  car with seats but then the seats you would basically fold into a bed this is this is just
*  what i think is amazing and maybe i'm surprised it didn't catch on i don't know yeah well i think
*  i think they sold a lot of these i mean and the fundamental design is still popular for this class
*  of car in japan which is um they call them tall boys they're basically like little cubes they have
*  like um set restrictions for the length and width of this class of car so they basically just
*  maximize that volume and you just drive these little cubicle cars and they hold a surprising
*  amount of space inside the volume and the interior is great so i'm sure they were used for this
*  purpose long before honda just thought screw it let's just make a car specifically lean in
*  but this is um this is an inspiration when we're thinking about you know how things are going to
*  change if you don't need to worry about driving the car i mean i presume that for the love car
*  the idea was you would park but uh now you're saying that you know the whole idea of engine
*  in front forward-facing passenger compartment then trunk in the back you don't need to think
*  in those terms anymore you can be much more open about what do you want the space inside to be like
*  exactly and i think flexibility is going to be crucial i mean if you if you are actually okay
*  i mean there's a lot of people who believe that autonomous vehicles will be something that people
*  don't own they'll all be like ubers or something like that i think in certain areas that's probably
*  true but i think that's more true for places where car ownership is rare now big cities like
*  new york london you know paris that kind of thing um but i think in places like la having your own
*  car is it's it's different like it's your own like people store stuff in their cars it's like a locker
*  it's you know if you work you know far from home like and you may take a break in your car because
*  it's like your own space i think people will still desire their own private personal car if you have
*  kids you know that this is true because there's so much crap that's associated especially when
*  they're really little that you just have to keep with you and it doesn't it's not feasible the idea
*  of lugging all this crap and kid seats and stuff to put in uber you want your own car so in that
*  sense i think there will still be private ownership of autonomous vehicles i think they'll be very
*  flexible boxy things exterior wise they're gonna because that's just the easiest way
*  to encapsulate the most volume in a given area so and i think the interiors will fold out and do
*  all kinds of different things all kinds of crash protection is gonna have to be figured out volvo's
*  already working on prone seat belts so like you know restraint systems for when you're laying in
*  a bed um maybe we'll decide at some point these things are safe enough we don't have to worry
*  about that anymore um maybe we'll just have more advanced you know supplemental systems like air
*  bag systems just flood the interior with a foams you're not going to move something but people
*  want they're going to want flexibility they're going to want to maximize the time in the car
*  and they're not even going to think about it in terms of traveling it's a room whatever you may
*  do in a room you're going to want to be able to do while you're in motion and i don't really see
*  the point of any other way also the idea of performance changes like why would like doesn't
*  like the idea like performance cars that we know about now we drive partially but because
*  we get a visceral feeling of enjoyment from driving the car and there's a statement that
*  says i can handle this amount of power a car that handles like this if you're not driving
*  who cares that doesn't that's not a thing anymore um so i think status will always be a thing when
*  it comes to how they're styled but i think the the interior space will become arguably more
*  important than the exterior i mean exterior will still be important because people still like
*  to convey things with their cars but these are going to be vehicles designed from the inside out
*  as opposed to today where while the inside is important you know the variants of exterior
*  design are huge right now i think we're going to be entering a an era of vans frankly an era of vans
*  well i think the most basic sort of psychological change is the idea that
*  the front row seats can be facing backwards right i mean and maybe put a little table in there and
*  you know you can enjoy your coffee along the way and uh do the crossword whatever it is we've seen
*  this before in some things there yeah anything and you know work surfaces tables eating whatever
*  you're gonna want to do it like why why wouldn't you if you're not driving there's just no point
*  in staring and sitting facing forward i mean the reason we do it in things like trains and buses
*  is just because of um you know amount of people you can cram into a given area in airplanes
*  i mean if we you know if we had our way and if space wasn't such a big issue you would be able
*  to you know move around and do whatever and you know like um when it came time to move from
*  los angeles and i moved my family to north carolina so for that move to make it a little more fun i
*  bought an rv in la i got like a five thousand dollar rv and it was in actually beautiful shape
*  and it had like a kitchen and a bathroom with a bathtub and a toilet and and you know and i put
*  in a little flat screen tv and hooked up a wee and all this stuff and and so we drove across country
*  and i ended up driving like 99 percent of the time but my wife and kid were just lounging in the back
*  like it was a little room and that's the closest i can think of like in this instance they had an
*  autonomous vehicle i was the computer and the cameras were my eyes but i was basically that
*  and they just had the best time hanging out back there making pizza rolls in the oven and
*  using the bath like when it comes to a luxury vehicle there is no greater luxury than taking
*  a comfortable satisfying dump wherever you feel like it in your own car that's that's far better
*  than any rolls royce and it's you see the appeal of it like a room on wheels is the way these things
*  are going to go but i'm also interested in the how design will reflect the fact if we do have
*  something like the all autonomous ubers model where you don't i mean maybe some people will
*  own their cars for various reasons both romantic and practical but one of the huge weird things
*  about cars right now is there's an enormous number of four-seater cars driven by one person
*  at a time right and if it's just uh you know a set of autonomous vehicles that are basically
*  like ubers or taxis and you can call them then probably it's going to be a lot of one-person
*  vehicles and a lot of uh special purpose vehicles that you can call for whatever reason is that
*  is that a sensible economically feasible model you think i think so because i think i mean it's even
*  worse now if you think about it because not only are there like four seat cars there's usually by
*  and large four seat suvs which is even crazier if you think about one person in a you know 5500
*  pound off-road vehicle with gigantic tires like it's wildly inefficient really so i think the idea
*  that there will be like one or two person little podlet kind of things that are uber style that
*  take you place to place that's very reasonable and chances are most of these vehicles will be
*  electric which means that um you know from a technical standpoint most electric cars right now
*  are being built on this kind of skateboard idea meaning all the batteries are flat in the bottom
*  the motors are actually really small and can just be basically in line with the wheels either at the
*  front or the rear and they're very easy to make modular almost every major auto manufacturer right
*  now is developing a modular uh skateboard type chassis for their vehicles volkswagens for example
*  is called meb and they have basically one fundamental electric platform that's going to
*  be everything from a two-door golf to the new micro bus the electric micro bus that they're
*  planning so this is how it's going to be so the idea that making a small two passenger car or a
*  four even six passenger car for like you know replace like bus replacement kind of things or more
*  they're all modular type systems it will make a lot of sense for them to do that and i think
*  you'll certainly see a lot of it and i think a lot of the dispersion of how many of each size of the
*  car will depend on the particular market like some markets are going to be more communal group type
*  of um you know like buses or subscale buses kind of thing and some places are going to be more one
*  or two passenger thing yeah i think a one passenger one is unlikely i think two is about as small as
*  they'll get because by the time you're building for one it's easy enough to just add a second
*  seat in there and people are as likely to travel in pairs as they are singly so i think you'll have
*  like two two four six eight and then you know bus size things and i think uh it'll be easy enough to
*  build those in whatever quantities make sense well and also zero person things this is something
*  you talked about which i i embarrassingly had never really thought of but there's going to be a lot of
*  autonomous delivery vehicles with no people in them at all yeah yeah and i think actually that's
*  going to be i think that could actually come even quicker than human carrying vehicles and i think
*  this is actually in a lot of ways a lot better because if you think about it all of the well
*  many of the errands we make if you have if an autonomous vehicle is taking you there you really
*  would start to wonder why do i even have to go at all like it might even be better to have an
*  autonomous car that you can't get in just for quality of life like there's no reason why if
*  you had an autonomous vehicle that was basically the size of a pickup truck bed it was like small
*  and it had remote opening uh compartments and you could just tell it to go place like you basically
*  go to the website of a grocery store you put in what you want from your grocery list and then you
*  send your car over and then the grocery store already has a system in place when your stuff's
*  ready the car gets summoned they put it in you maybe get a camera that automatically takes a
*  picture of what's in there and sends it to your phone so you can confirm you hit okay it comes
*  home like you have to go out for tampons at 2 a.m you shouldn't have to do that you you just send
*  the car out with some instructions it goes to the cvs automated pod area it picks them up and it
*  comes back home um there's no reason why this can't happen it's the exact same technology the
*  engineering is even easier because you don't have to worry about the people inside uh these things
*  would be small relatively cheap i've even in the book i even talk about how i would love to have
*  one as someone who has a bunch of old cars you know i've got an old 73 beetle that i drive around
*  a lot and it's getting old enough that you know on trips it would be great if i could have this
*  thing follow me with spare parts in it if i want to take a long trip and even to tow me out of
*  situations if i just get stuck somewhere like it could be a huge boon to people with classic cars
*  these would just be literal errand robots yeah and i think there's all kinds of reasons why
*  these make a ton of sense maybe even i don't i i'm almost more excited for those than i would be
*  just because i like to drive but there's plenty of times i just don't feel like like if i want to
*  drive and that's the other thing like when autonomous cars come if there's human driven
*  cars still they're going to be fun human driven cars because all of the mundane driving you can
*  hand off to a machine either an unmanned errand bot or your commuting machine to go to work but
*  if you like i feel like the only companies that might survive making human driven cars are ones
*  where it's enjoyable lotus perversely may still be around or morgan or these companies that make
*  cars that are all about the visceral enjoyment of driving i think it'll be niche but it'll still
*  be there because i think that's still something people will want well you make that you make the
*  wonderful point that the design of actual human be human driven automobiles over the last few
*  decades has become more and more aggressive looking you know people want their cars to seem
*  threatening and intimidating and for sort of ex post facto obvious reasons designers of fully
*  autonomous vehicles make them just look adorable and cute because they don't want them to seem
*  threatening yeah and i think this is this whole this has fascinated me for a long time i'm
*  personally i'm just someone who is unashamedly loves cute cars i have no no shame or guilt about
*  this whatsoever that's why i always love beetles the little nissan pow i drive is adorable and
*  i've always liked that i've never felt like i don't know there's people who are getting secure
*  about that thing but not me i love it and it's always been a little baffling just everything now
*  gets an aggressive face and they claim there's been focus groups that study this although i feel like
*  psychologically it's got to take a toll everything every almost every modern car now unless it's
*  based on a retro design like the fiat 500 or new beetle or or something like that has a face that
*  looks like it wants to murder you it looks like an angry vacuum cleaner that just wants to gut you
*  and suck up your entrails and they keep making things like this but when google made their
*  autonomous car it looks it looks like a koala bear they made it look like this adorable koala
*  bear things it looks like a freaking cartoon big round eyes looking but it's but they had to do it
*  because once these things are driving themselves do you really want a four thousand pound robot
*  driving around that looks like a murder bot and i i think people would be unsettled by that i mean
*  it's true even the recent models of the prius were styled to look more and more aggressive and
*  threatening looking and as a previous owner of an older version prius i'm like what is the point
*  of this no one is fooled yeah no one is honestly toyota's design recently has i actually called
*  uh i came up with a name for it with a cyber oak because it's like there's so much going on there's
*  like folds and things but it has like a mean angry fish face that just looks like a cruel piranha
*  but okay i mean that's a good segue into i think you know the final topic here which which is i
*  think one of the not so secret agendas behind your book which is that uh safety and efficiency
*  and visions of the utopian future aside there are people out there including yourself who love
*  driving for its own sake and some crazy people even love tinkering with their cars i don't really
*  get that but there are people like that and uh how can we carve out a space for that or is it
*  or is it just impossible i mean probably there were people who loved riding horses 150 years ago
*  and uh too bad for them yeah and i and the thing is i the horse model is something i don't want to
*  have happen i don't want car people to become like horse people because it's difficult to keep a
*  horse it's extremely exclusive and i'm gonna miss driving and i i talk about like one of the things
*  i think i'm gonna miss most i call it like the the death of the journey in here because
*  in an autonomous car you get in at your start location you tell the robot where you want to go
*  and then you do whatever the hell you want for however long it takes and then you get out at
*  your destination it's like flying in that sense or teleportation hypothetically could be in that
*  there's no middle there's just two end points and some amount of time in between that it doesn't
*  really relate to the actual process when you drive though you go on a six-hour road trip
*  you're engaged with your journey the whole time you're engaged with the environment the whole time
*  you see the city fade out into farmland you see the the environment change you see the
*  the landscape change you see things on the side of the road you have chance encounters places
*  you are literally it's it's analog you're taking in every bit of that journey incrementally until
*  you get to your destination if you had an autonomous car you would be on your phone or reading or doing
*  whatever the hell you wanted masturbating or eating in that space of time and it would just
*  be point to point and i think there's something that's lost there the idea of a journey as an
*  actual journey that you experience has value and will always have value and there's there's no
*  place for that in an autonomous future and i think about i talk about ways to like i think we've all
*  just driven sometimes without a destination and how do you do that in an autonomous car the first
*  question when you sit down in an autonomous vehicle is where do you want to go right but i
*  think i don't know anybody who owns a car who hasn't at some point in their life just thought
*  ah let's just get in and drive and see what we see see where we end up or you can go in with like a
*  vague idea of like i've never been to to solvang california let's just drive out there and see
*  what we see but how do you do that in an autonomous vehicle that demands a destination the very first
*  thing you do and you could probably program in artificial ways around it you could probably tell
*  it you know computer wander and then it could wander somewhere but i cynically i feel like
*  like companies would sell bits of their wandering algorithms to put you in places where you'd see
*  certain restaurants or you'd end up in the parking lot of a best buy or some crap like that and
*  i don't want to see that happen either and uh you know i also think about you know potential things
*  for autonomous cars you could download road trips that are like curated road trips from people
*  and all these things are cool but it's still not the same you know the the process of just driving
*  is also meditative and it's the last place we have in society where people will leave you alone in
*  an autonomous car if you know you're on a six-hour trip somebody will be asking you to do something
*  in those six hours but when you're driving you're engaged just enough to not have the burden of
*  productivity on you and yet you still have enough of your mind free to wander to listen to music or
*  a book on tape or a podcast or whatever but you're still can't nobody can expect you to do anything
*  other than just driving that car and we will lose all of that if we lose human driving and i feel
*  like we don't appreciate how important those things still are so basically what you're saying
*  is the danger the real danger of autonomous cars is not uh that they will fail the trolley problem
*  and kill people but that will be expected to be checking our emails and doom scrolling on twitter
*  the entire time that we're commuting exactly like is there any context where you can imagine that
*  that's not going to happen i mean if you're if people know you have an hour-long commute
*  and they know you're not driving of course they're going to expect you to be working
*  yeah those should be productive hours yeah they should be and i don't think we need you know we
*  still need refuges from productivity like we're productive an awful lot like and driving is that
*  perfect mix of this you're doing enough with your hands in your body but enough of that higher part
*  of your brain is still free that's why people it's like you know how people say they come up with
*  great ideas in the shower or something like that i think the driving a car is very similar enough of
*  your mind is freed that you can explore ideas i do some of my best thinking while driving in a car
*  yeah i agree i don't want to do that up you know yeah yeah absolutely well i think regardless of
*  what the predictions are for what the real future is going to be i think that these are important
*  considerations to keep in mind uh in the sense that hopefully we have some influence over the
*  future and we can choose to do things and i do like you hope that there is some space carved out
*  for just driving even in our autonomous future i totally agree and jason torsinski thanks so
*  much for being on the mindscape podcast thanks john this was a lot of fun i really appreciate it
