Blog post with AMA questions and transcript: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2021/12/15/ama-december-2021/

Welcome to the December 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Note that there will be no January AMA, for purposes of a holiday break. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | December 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FNK8oBFzds)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the December 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host Sean Carroll. The podcast episode is being released a little bit before December
*  comes along because it's the Thanksgiving holiday here in the United States. So I'll be traveling
*  for that and then traveling for workshop directly afterward. I wanted to get to your AMA questions
*  before I started traveling rather than waiting until afterward. So you know that, or long time
*  listeners know that I do take vacation for real over the Christmas holidays slash New Year's
*  holidays. So there's two weeks when I will not have a real podcast episode and I will try to
*  do a holiday message, short, brief, you know, thanking everyone for their support kind of thing
*  just before the holidays. And there will be no Ask Me Anything episode for January. So no Ask
*  Me Anything episode with questions asked at the end of December, answers given at the beginning
*  of January. So this is it. This is the last Ask Me Anything episode for this year. The next call
*  will be near the end of January. Again, those of you who are long time listeners know if you want
*  to ask a question for the Ask Me Anything episode, the important thing is to support Mindscape on
*  Patreon. You can go to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll and you sign up there, dollar or whatever
*  you want per episode of Mindscape will get you both ad free versions of the podcast as well as
*  the ability to ask questions for the monthly Ask Me Anything episodes. It used to be back in the
*  old days when it was just a few of us around the fire that everyone who asked a question got it
*  answered. We've grown since then. Can't be quite the same anymore, but I do try to pick the best
*  questions in terms of things I can give interesting answers to. Do not feel bad if you ask a question
*  that I don't get around to it. It's me. It's not you. Don't worry about it. The other thing,
*  of course, is I'd like to remind people we have a web page for the podcast,
*  preposterousuniverse.com slash podcast and all the Mindscape episodes are there. You can search
*  them. There's a wonderful little search tool. You can search not only the titles and my show notes,
*  but also complete transcripts of all the podcasts, transcripts that are paid for by the Patreon
*  supporters we have here. And of course, you can also get links to the people who are talking,
*  their web pages, their publications, whatever it is. And the final thing, which I never remember
*  to mention, but I always remember it when I'm not recording, is that we do appreciate reviews of the
*  podcast on iTunes and elsewhere. Getting good iTunes reviews helps you get more visible to
*  other people who might like to listen to podcasts. So as good as the podcast is, don't hog it for
*  yourself. Share it around. Share the word that Mindscape is a good thing. Let me see. Anything
*  else? Nothing else right now. I have a lot of packing to do. There is a trip coming up
*  and a lot of questions to get to. So let's go.
*  Joy Colbeck says, why are black holes bald? This is of course in reference to the famous statement
*  by John Wheeler that a black hole has no hair, an idea that was semi-rigorized by Roger Penner.
*  And it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
*  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
*  hair, an idea that was semi-rigorized by Roger Penrose into the no hair, what we call the no
*  hair theorem, but a mathematician would not really call it a theorem. It's not been proven yet
*  because of course you don't know the ultimate laws of physics yet. What does it mean to prove
*  something unless you have some good axioms? Now what you can do is assume some laws of physics,
*  like it's just general relativity plus electromagnetism. And then you can prove
*  no hair kind of theorem that says that once you make a black hole, unlike a planet or a star,
*  which has all sorts of interesting features on it, all black holes settle down to a uniform
*  configuration. It's always the same kind of configuration given the mass, the charge,
*  and the spin of the black hole. There's no other hair on a black hole other than that. It's not
*  like you have continents and oceans or something like that like a planet does. So why is is Joy's
*  question? You know, why questions in physics are always tricky depends on what assumptions
*  you're going to start with here. But the way I like to think about the black hole situation is
*  it's entropy. It's usually entropy that is at the heart of these kinds of questions.
*  Black holes have the highest entropy that you can fit into a region of fixed size. They are in some
*  sense local maxima of entropy. And what that means is operationally that they're all going to look
*  alike. That's a feature of high entropy states is that they're not that interesting. Think about
*  blackbody radiation. Think about taking an object, a relatively heatproof, melting proof object.
*  Okay, so an object can sustain some high temperatures, but it doesn't matter what it's
*  made out of. It doesn't matter what color it is. It doesn't matter what shape it is or anything
*  like that. Put it in a tightly sealed oven at a very fixed temperature and let it come to equilibrium.
*  So let the entire object inside come to the same temperature the oven is and then open the oven.
*  What you will see is that the object is glowing, giving off radiation. And the radiation it gives
*  off and the way it gives it off is completely independent of the material it's made out of,
*  of the color it is, of the shape it is, or anything like that. That is because it has
*  come into equilibrium with the thermal bath that it is in and it has a fixed temperature now.
*  Given its shape, etc., it's in a maximum entropy state and that means it's featureless in terms of
*  the radiation it gives off. And black holes are the same way. Black holes, as Hawking taught us
*  back in the 70s, give off thermal blackbody radiation, another sign that they are maximum
*  entropy states. So maximum entropy things, you know, given their macroscopic constraints,
*  like the size, the mass, the charge, the spin, etc., the whatever quantum states are inside the
*  black hole are as uniform and high entropy as they can possibly be. That is why black holes are bald.
*  Now that's a very different explanation than you would have gotten back in the late 60s, early 70s,
*  when they first started talking about this stuff, because they were not thinking about quantum
*  states or entropy, they were just thinking about classical general relativity. And it's a feature
*  of classical general relativity that if you make a black hole, it can have bumps and wiggles,
*  but those bumps and wiggles quickly radiate away. That's what happens, for example, when two black
*  holes in spiral, like we see at LIGO or something like that, all the individual idiosyncrasies
*  of the specific state that went into making the black hole are radiated away in the form of
*  gravitational waves and the black hole settles down very, very quickly. So that's just a feature of
*  classical general relativity, but in some sense, it makes a little more sense to us once we understand
*  the quantum underpinnings of that and the fact that it's evolving towards a maximum entropy state.
*  In fact, this was the inspiration, right? There was a noticeable set of similarities between black
*  hole mechanics and thermodynamics. That's what eventually pushed Hawking and Bekenstein to
*  show that there is an entropy and a radiation coming out of black holes. Preston Justice says,
*  A couple of months ago, my professor called your poetic naturalism pop philosophy. He is a philosopher
*  and did not mean this condescendingly, but what is your response to that? I understand that your
*  books are written for a very wide audience to target those of us who are non-physicists, but you
*  also give us the math and make us work and put in the work for your philosophical inquiries as well.
*  So how would you distinguish real philosophy from pop philosophy? I also follow the work of David
*  Wallace and love your podcast with him and know you have been associated with him for some time.
*  I assume you have him and many other philosophers to consult with whenever needed, right?
*  So I almost didn't answer this question because I don't want to feel like I'm just defending
*  myself or something like that, but I think this touches on a much bigger and really important
*  issue. So I will sort of try to address it directly, specifically, and then go on to the general
*  thought here. Look, I don't care if someone calls poetic naturalism pop philosophy. The book,
*  The Big Picture, in which I wrote about poetic naturalism, is a popular level book. No question
*  about that. It is not a technical philosophical tone. It is not written in the style that you
*  would find professional philosophical writings appearing in. Professional philosophy would be
*  much more careful about not just name checking all the great minds and other people who thought about
*  these issues, which I did a little bit, but nowhere near comprehensively. It would also be much more
*  careful, typically, professional philosophy, especially in these days, tries its best to go
*  through every single possible permutation of the argument in front of you. In fact, this can be
*  frustrating sometimes as a scientist who likes philosophy. Sometimes philosophers seem to be
*  content with just listing every possible answer to a question rather than telling you what is the
*  right answer. As a scientifically oriented guy, I just want to get the right answer. And so that's
*  the spirit, both as someone who just wants the right answer and someone who is writing a book
*  for a popular audience. That's the style in which all that was talked about in The Big Picture.
*  Now, what I do care about is whether it's right or wrong. If the characterization of it as pop
*  philosophy was in some sense meant to imply that it was not serious, that it was wrong somehow,
*  then I would like to know why it's wrong. Then just labeling it pop philosophy is kind of
*  meaningless. That is just then, you know, what Carl Bergstrom in the podcast episode we did here
*  labeled bullshit gatekeeping, you know, making sure that the interlopers from outside your
*  discipline don't come in. But, you know, I did talk to plenty of philosophers while writing the book.
*  I've gotten very good responses from philosophers since then. Some philosophers have used the book
*  as texts in their class. Others disagreed with the book, which is fine. That's what I care about.
*  I care about either people agreeing with it or disagreeing with it, less than whether it's called
*  pop or serious. But the bigger picture question, which this touches on, is, you know, there's sort
*  of two dimensions along which, you know, we're plotting our discourse here. One is the disciplinary
*  dimension. There's science, there's philosophy, there's history, there's etc., etc. And the other
*  dimension is the sort of academic versus popular dimension, right? And so when I'm writing about
*  philosophy, I'm both being interdisciplinary, you know, crossing over a disciplinary boundary
*  within academia, but also writing for a wide audience, not writing a sort of technical thing.
*  And so the big question is, where do we place our trust? You know, forget about me, forget about my
*  book. But when we're reading some book or listening to some source, maybe it's a YouTube video or a
*  podcast or an article in the New York Times, but it's by some person and we're not individually
*  experts in the area that they are writing about. How do we judge how seriously to take them? That's
*  a really hard question. Like we would like to find some simple algorithm for thinking about it, but
*  there is no such simple algorithm. We have to really kind of think carefully in each individual
*  case. Now, certainly you would like to say that if someone is a credentialed expert in a certain
*  field and that's the field they're writing about, then you take them a little bit more seriously.
*  You don't take them just at face value. You don't say, well, they must be right because they're an
*  expert because experts disagree with each other sometimes. But you would put more weight on someone
*  who is writing about exactly their field. But you also know that even people who are experts
*  sometimes say silly things even within their own field. I know physicists who say silly things
*  about quantum mechanics all the time. Some physicists would say I say silly things about
*  quantum mechanics all the time. So you can't use that as a completely reliable guide.
*  I am a huge believer that people in academia should write for both wider audiences and for
*  other academic audiences in different fields, while keeping in mind that the process of doing
*  that is necessarily going to open you up to making mistakes and being criticized, right?
*  So I think that there's some kind of attitude that says that if you're an expert in field X,
*  you just should not talk about any other field other than X. And I think that's a terrible attitude.
*  How in the world are we going to make progress if different fields can't talk about and to each other?
*  But I would take a philosopher talking about physics less seriously than a philosopher talking
*  about philosophy and vice versa for physicists talking about philosophy. So I think you need to
*  really take attempts for people to talk outside their credentialed area of expertise with a grain
*  of salt, but there are techniques we can use to decide who is trustworthy and who is not.
*  And these techniques have more to do with the person talking than the thing they're talking
*  about. Once you know that they're not exactly in their expertise, you shouldn't completely
*  dismiss them, but you should ask questions about how credible they seem. So what does that mean?
*  Well, you can ask, do they seem to be familiar with the field they're talking about, even if
*  it's not their technical area of expertise? When they're talking, do they seem to be overly sure
*  of themselves? Are they very clear about what is known and what is not known? Are they clear about
*  what they're trying to say with confidence versus speculating about? Are they willing to be wrong?
*  Are they fallibilistic or are they just sort of bombastic? Are they clearly trying to be sensationalist
*  or contrarian just for the sake of being contrarian, just to sell books or get clicks
*  or something like that versus are they trying to work through difficult issues in good faith to the
*  best they can, right? So all of these are things that you can think about and try to take seriously.
*  At the end of the day, you have to judge it, whether someone is, you know, next, if you're
*  an expert in philosophy or physics or anything else, when you read my book or anyone else's book,
*  you've got to judge how seriously you want to take that. At the end of the day, that's what
*  matters, you know, whether or not the ideas are worth something, not whether or not they're popular
*  versus academic, philosophy versus physics or anything else. Regular Epistavist says,
*  can you give a very simple explanation about the difference between primordial gravitational waves
*  versus gravitational waves from inflation? I mean, the zeroth order explanation is no, there is no
*  difference, so there's not that much to say, but there is a tiny difference depending on how exactly
*  you want to get into it, namely, gravitational waves from inflation are a subset of all possible
*  primordial gravitational waves. So inflation is this idea that in the super duper early universe,
*  the primordial universe, the universe underwent a phase of exponential super fast expansion,
*  and due to quantum fluctuations, that would naturally generate some gravitational waves
*  that could leave an imprint on the universe. Cosmologists have not found evidence for such
*  an imprint yet. There was a moment a couple years ago when we thought maybe we had, but that went
*  away, turned out not to be right. So inflation predicts that there should be gravitational
*  waves, but it's silent on exactly how strong they should be. So it's very possible that inflation
*  is correct, and yet we don't ever find the gravitational waves predicted by inflation.
*  It is also possible that we do find them, and that would be evidence for inflation. It is also
*  possible that we find gravitational waves, and yet they come from something other than inflation.
*  That's tricky because if you don't know what the specific model is, you don't know whether
*  it predicts gravitational waves or not. So in other words, I can imagine primordial gravitational
*  waves that are not from inflation. I just don't have any specifically good scenario to make them.
*  There are all sorts of bouncing and cyclic scenarios and things like that. I find these
*  generally utterly unconvincing for completely other reasons, so I don't even know personally
*  which of them would predict primordial gravitational waves and which would not.
*  I'm going to group some questions together here. Three of them. Perry Romanowski says,
*  how do black holes interact with dark matter? Does it fall in? Are there dark matter black holes?
*  Adam Berger says, since dark matter has mass and therefore generates gravitational force,
*  can it form heavenly bodies? Can it form black holes? Do we have a short shield radius for that
*  scenario? Chris Chottard says, in the lambda CDM model, could it be that dark matter black
*  holes can form? I don't know why there were simultaneously a bunch of questions about
*  dark matter black holes. Maybe there was a news article or something or a tweet that I missed out
*  there. The short answer is yes, sure, dark matter can make black holes, but in the real world,
*  it's much, much, much less efficient than ordinary matter. The point is that ordinary matter is not
*  dark. It couples to electromagnetic radiation, and dark matter is dark. It does not couple to
*  electromagnetic radiation. What that means is that when dark matter particles come close by,
*  they just go right through each other. They do not dissipate. When atoms bump into each other,
*  they can lose energy by bumping into each other, temporarily getting excited, and then kicking off
*  a photon by radiating. Radiating that energy away, they lose energy. So when a bunch of atoms or
*  individual ions or electrons or whatever come near to each other, they can stick together.
*  They can clump. They can coalesce. Black holes are very, very, very dense. To make a black hole,
*  you have to put a lot of mass, a lot of energy into a very, very small region of space.
*  Even though there's more dark matter in the universe than ordinary matter, it's not condensed.
*  It is thinly spread throughout the universe, and it has no forces acting on it that want to
*  condense it. I mean, there's gravity, but the problem is you have two dark matter particles.
*  They pull each other through their mutual gravitational pull, and they come right by,
*  and they go right past each other because they don't stick because it's only gravity,
*  and gravitational waves are far, far too weak to make that happen.
*  In principle, you can make black holes out of dark matter. In practice, it doesn't really happen.
*  Now, there is a loophole there. It is possible that in the early universe,
*  ordinary matter and dark matter coalesce in the same place.
*  Right? So the dark matter might be a little overdense in a region where the ordinary matter
*  also is, and they both condense together. Even though the dark matter just goes right through,
*  and the ordinary matter can stick, if the ordinary matter is going along with the dark matter,
*  and it gets so dense that it makes a black hole, that will trap some of the dark matter in the
*  black hole. So dark matter can contribute to the formation of black holes in the early universe,
*  and there's some theories that that's actually important astrophysically. But by itself,
*  it would be very hard, you know, if ordinary matter were not helping it along, it would be very,
*  very hard to make a dark matter black hole. Not impossible, but not easy either.
*  Relatedly, here's another question from Marianne Markali.
*  Is the dark matter transparency a matter of scale, energy, or magnitude mismatch in our tools?
*  Similar to the circle and point metaphor, if we only use a point as a probe,
*  we can never find the circle. This is an interesting question. So I think I get it.
*  I think I get what you're asking. Let me try to rephrase it. You know, we say that dark matter is
*  dark, and the easy way for that to happen is that dark matter doesn't interact with photons at all,
*  with electromagnetism at all. It's neutral, right? It's therefore dark. But I think the question
*  being asked here is, can we imagine that for some reason, dark matter is transparent to certain
*  wavelengths of light, but not to other wavelengths of light? I think that the short answer is that
*  in easy models of dark matter that you would write down, that's hard to make work. Because
*  basically, think about it this way, you know, in particle physics, a particle is either electrically
*  charged or it's not. Now, in the real world, we can make condensed collections of particles
*  that are either transparent or opaque, right? We can make a piece of wood or a piece of glass,
*  and one of them will stop light from going through it and the other one will not. But the individual
*  particles, if you just dispersed them, all these particles are charged and they will interact with
*  photons very, very readily. And if they're not interacting with photons, if they're not charged
*  particles, it's hard to make them stick together, like we just said, and form substances, okay?
*  So the reason why ordinary matter can either be transparent or not to different wavelengths of
*  light is because of the sort of chemistry and condensed matter physics of it when they come
*  together to make different arrangements of atoms and molecules, not because of the properties of
*  the individual particles themselves. And we don't think that dark matter does come together in that
*  way. So we think that the dark matter particles are either charged or they're not. If they're
*  charged, they would not be dark, they'd be visible, you could see them. And if they're not charged,
*  then they're going to be dark, no matter what you want. So I don't see any simple way to make dark
*  matter particles interact with certain wavelengths of light, but not with other ones. There might be
*  something more clever that I'm not thinking of right now, like maybe the dark matter particles
*  are not charged, but they have like an electric dipole moment or something like that. I don't know,
*  that would be a more complicated model that I would have to think about. Parenthetically, I cannot help
*  but mention that there is the possibility of dark radiation. So not only dark matter, but dark photons,
*  dark light, right? This is an idea that I wrote about with some students, well, one student,
*  Lottie Ackerman, and one postdoc, Matt Buckley, who is now a professor at Rutgers, and my colleague
*  at the time at Caltech, Mark Kaminkowski, who's now at Johns Hopkins. We wrote a paper, what if
*  there was an entirely different copy of electromagnetism that only coupled to dark matter,
*  not to ordinary matter? And interestingly, it can work, it's possible. So, but still, that would not
*  affect how dark matter interacted with ordinary matter, or the ordinary visible radiation. Sorry
*  about that. Linney Umisyaara says, how can an electron have zero size if it has mass?
*  You know, so the first answer I want to give is why not? Who says that you need to have size,
*  to have mass? Like you're clearly kind of visualizing some very classical kind of lump of clay
*  kind of model for the electrons, but you know, elementary particles are not like that.
*  The better answer is, electrons don't have zero size. I know people say that they do, but electrons
*  are wave functions. And now I'm just going to assume that my version of quantum mechanics is
*  the correct one, my many worlds version of quantum mechanics. If you think that the wave function
*  is really what is going on in the world, whether it's in many worlds or any other version of
*  quantum mechanics, then electrons don't have zero size. You cannot localize the electron wave
*  function to a point. Okay, you can get an approximate theory of how electrons behave
*  by starting with the classical theory of a point particle and quantizing it. That's the reason why
*  physicists will sometimes claim that electrons have zero size. But that's just because they're
*  not taking quantum mechanics seriously, right? I mean, the quantum theory doesn't have any
*  memory that you made it from the classical theory of a point particle. It is in some sense as if,
*  when you measure the electron, it has no spatial extent, right? You can measure it to an arbitrary
*  precision, its position or something like that. But that's a feature of the measurement process
*  of quantum mechanics, not an intrinsic feature of the electron itself. So real world electrons do
*  not have zero size. Therefore, it shouldn't bother you that they have mass.
*  Pete Harlan says, what are your options for typesetting equations in the upcoming biggest
*  ideas in the universe book? Despite Donald Knuth, equations in Kindle books seem to fall into two
*  camps. Static graphics that don't scale and look terrible in dark mode, or inline text formatting
*  as in Susskind's The Theoretical Minimum Books that is unreadable. Is there an option for an
*  author that properly accommodates electronic books? So the only reason I have no idea what
*  the answer to these questions is, they're good questions. The reason why I'm reading it out loud
*  is because I had never even thought about this. But you're right, of course. So implicitly in the
*  question, you're asking about the electronic editions of books. Believe me, it's hard enough
*  to get the paper editions published. You know, the publisher, like my publisher Dutton, who has done
*  all of my books so far, all my trade books so far, and every one of my trade books has like one or
*  two equations in it, right? So they know how to typeset an equation. But this book has a lot of
*  equations in it. The biggest ideas in the universe books coming up. And it's going to be a little bit
*  tricky to make sure that everything is italicized correctly, formatted correctly, numbered correctly,
*  all of that stuff. And I was already fretting just about getting the paper edition done correctly.
*  And you're pointing out correctly that we're going to have to think again about the electronic
*  edition. So I don't know what the answer is. I do know that my publisher tries really hard.
*  They don't brush off these concerns. So they will try. And now that you've put the idea into my head,
*  I will at least make sure they're warned ahead of time about that question. All right. Bjorn
*  Engström says, if Jeff Bezos were to give you all his money, say $250 billion, what would you spend
*  it on? And you can't keep any money for yourself. What project or causes would you fund? I'm very
*  sad I don't get to keep at least $1 billion out of 250 billion. I mean, you know, this seems like
*  you're giving me a lot of work to do and I get no recompense for it at all. But, you know, I don't
*  have a simple answer to this kind of question. I think when you're talking about that scale of
*  question. So here's how I interpret the question. How to be a good global citizen in the case where
*  you have a huge amount of money. Okay. So not just like what is the one single thing you would do.
*  I think there's more than one thing worth doing with all that money. And therefore, you need to
*  sort of set up a system for divvying out different amounts of money to different kinds of causes.
*  And I also think that, you know, it's still worth giving money to some causes, even if they're not
*  the single highest priority cause that you can think of. Like things like solving global poverty
*  or educating people worldwide or just building roads and infrastructure around the world. Like
*  these are the most obvious things to do. Healthcare for people around the world. Like these are things
*  that I probably couldn't get done for $250 billion, but you could make a dent in it.
*  I think that's well worth doing. But then, you know, what about like supporting graduate students
*  in theoretical physics or, you know, supporting local libraries or, you know, blood drives or
*  things like that. Those are also worth doing, even if they might not have a sort of saving lives per
*  dollar kind of aspect. What about supporting arts organizations or other good charitable things?
*  I think that all of these things are worth doing to some extent. So I would want to, you know,
*  have a foundation or something like that. Try to have a lean and mean foundation that did not soak
*  up a lot of the money itself, you know, less than 1% of the total. But with, you know,
*  only a hundredth of a percent of $250 billion, you can still fund a pretty good foundation.
*  Or, you know, maybe, I don't know, put it in the bank and live off the interest,
*  not live off the interest, but give money off the interest. And like I said, I would want to sort of
*  dole it out to many different things at once, starting with the most high impact things in
*  terms of saving lives and making the lives of poor people around the world better, but also
*  setting aside some for other aspects of life, cultural, scientific, educational aspects, and so on.
*  GeekGod says, the scientific method consists of going back to the drawing board with your
*  theory of the data doesn't support it, not to just postulate the existence of supporting data.
*  How does it then make sense to say that dark matter and dark energy exist just because we
*  don't see the amount of matter we expect to see as per the theory? Shouldn't we say instead that
*  the theory is wrong? Well, what theory are we talking about here? I mean, is the theory
*  general relativity? You know, general relativity doesn't make a prediction all by itself for what
*  the rotation curve of a galaxy should look like. It depends on how much mass is in the galaxy. So
*  the theory is the combination of the theory of gravity plus the theory of what is causing
*  the gravity, the mass, the energy, so forth. And when we say there's dark matter and dark energy,
*  it is precisely that the theory is wrong. That is what we're saying. We said we had a theory,
*  namely that the matter that you see is everything there is, plus general relativity is the right
*  theory of gravity. We made a prediction. It came out wrong, and therefore that theory is wrong.
*  But adding more matter, dark matter or more dark energy or whatever, is just as much changing the
*  theory as changing the theory of gravity. And of course, cosmologists have tried to change the
*  theory of gravity. I've tried to do it. It just doesn't work. It doesn't fit the data. So we're
*  very interested in fitting the data and dark matter and dark energy fit the data really,
*  really well. That's why they're the popular way to go in these particular situations. So Michael
*  asks a priority question. Remember the priority questions? You have the rule that I made up,
*  which says that every person gets to ask a priority question once in their lives.
*  And I will always try to answer the priority question. So I can't guarantee I'm not,
*  I answer roughly these days half of the total questions that are asked. I answer half the total
*  questions that are asked. But if you ask a priority question, if you give that one try,
*  I will do my best to answer it. Sadly, there's no follow-up priority questions. So if I don't
*  answer it in a way that makes you happy, sorry about that. I can't really tell you what to do.
*  Anyway, so Michael's question is, how fast are we moving, hurtling through space if we are still,
*  say, sitting in a chair? If we are still, aren't we moving at the speed of the Earth's rotation,
*  while at the same time the Earth is also traveling at a certain speed, hurtling through space,
*  which is traveling through space, which is expanding at a certain speed and so forth?
*  If one were to say something like, how fast are we moving,
*  relative to what? I would then wonder, what is the speed of the expansion of the universe relative to?
*  So the correct answer to the first part of the question is, relative to what? I mean,
*  that's how, that's what relativity says. There's no such thing as the speed with which you're
*  traveling. There just is no such thing. You really have to accept that. It's not just like a fun
*  little motto. There's only the relative speed between different objects. And so there's no such
*  thing as the speed that you're moving at when you're sitting on a chair. You always have to
*  say relative to what? And then you say, what is the speed of the expansion of the universe relative
*  to? But the answer there is that the expansion of the universe does not have a speed. It just
*  doesn't. It has a rate. You can ask in a certain period of time, by what percentage will the scale
*  factor of the universe expand? But that is not a quantity that is measured in meters per second.
*  It does not even have the units of speed. It has units of one over time. And that time is,
*  roughly speaking, the time scale for the universe to double in size. So that's not a velocity that
*  is relative to something else. That is a rate of increase in some quantity, which can be perfectly
*  well defined. So it's a different kind of thing than the velocity with which you're traveling
*  through space. Jeremy Ditman says, I'm wondering about your views on the future of scientific
*  progress, say 100 to 1000 years from now, and whether or not major advances on big problems,
*  quantum gravity, rules of complexity, emergence, etc., would ultimately be taught to the equivalent
*  of high school students in the future? That's a good question. You can certainly imagine what
*  people would have said if you asked this question 500 years ago. And they're like, you might come
*  up with crazy new theories, but they won't ever trickle down to high school students. But these
*  days, we do indeed teach high school students natural selection or Newton's laws of motion.
*  We don't teach them Maxwell's equation. We don't even teach them Boltzmann's equation for
*  entropy or anything like that. So there's plenty of things over 100 years ago that we do not teach
*  them. And so the short answer is, I don't know. I can see it either way. I would imagine that some
*  things that we learn over the next 100 or 1000 years will turn out to be both so fundamental
*  and so readily understandable that it is completely possible to teach them to high
*  school students and we will end up doing that. I can also imagine that the things we learn just
*  remain a little bit too esoteric in the sense that to really understand them, you would need
*  to have a lot of background, you would need to do a lot of prerequisite work to learn how to
*  manipulate equations or some abstract mathematical concepts or something like that. So I think it'll
*  be a mixture of those things. It's hard to be more definite than that because I don't know what
*  the scientific advances are going to be, right? I mean, I don't really think that high school
*  students are going to be doing a lot of tensor analysis or something like that, like you need
*  for general relativity. They could, in principle, I could imagine, but it takes a lot of work
*  to learn the background concepts to get up to that point. So I don't think it's simply a matter of
*  as time passes, we compress these ideas into earlier and earlier educational stages,
*  but there might be some brand new ideas about emergence or about space-time or whatever that
*  are actually simple enough to teach the high school students. I just don't know. Chris Mortlock says,
*  is the process of acquiring knowledge limitless or limited? Do you think it's possible a civilization
*  could ever acquire total knowledge with no further branches of scientific discovery possible?
*  No, I don't think that's possible. I think that it is possible to know the laws of physics.
*  I've said many times that we know the laws of physics that are relevant to our everyday lives,
*  but that we don't know the laws of physics outside our everyday lives. We don't understand
*  quantum gravity or dark matter or what happened to the Big Bang, etc. I think it's possible that we
*  could know them, however. So I certainly imagine that someday we might either know all the
*  fundamental laws of physics or at least have a theory that purports to be the fundamental laws
*  of physics that is both completely consistent and fits all the data. You always want to keep open
*  the possibility you're going to have to revise your ideas later on down the line, right? So even
*  if it is the correct theory, you're not sure. But here's why I don't think you'll ever know all the
*  laws of science broadly construed is because you can always just get more detailed, right?
*  You know, a human being cannot carry in their brains enough information to completely describe
*  another human being because by a complete description you would mean the position and
*  the momentum of every single atom in that other human being. And there's just not enough room in
*  your brain to hold all that information, right? So that's why we coarse-grain and do higher order
*  approximations and things like that. So we might have theories of psychology and sociology, etc.,
*  that are really, really, really good, but still are based on incomplete information. And so I
*  think there will always be more we can learn because there's just, you know, until we are
*  ourselves as big as the universe, there's an obstacle in principle for us to understand
*  everything that is happening in the universe, right? And that's why none of us is or ever will
*  be Laplace's demon. Kundal Menda says, Kundal, I'm sorry, Kundal Menda says,
*  do you tell your guests what you intend to ask them before a podcast? How much have they typically
*  prepared their answers? Very little. You know, look, most people who I talk to, they have a spiel,
*  right? They have something they like to talk about that is kind of pretty obvious. So we don't need
*  to do a lot of negotiations. Sometimes there are people who, you know, have certainly done a lot,
*  like when you talk to Dan Dennett, he's done a lot of different things. You talk to Roger Penrose,
*  he's done a lot of different things. And so you might want to say, well, okay, let's pick this to
*  focus in on. And I do generally say that ahead of time in the invite letter, but I also offer them
*  the opportunity to say, actually, what we should talk about is this other thing. But that's it.
*  It's really just a couple of sentences back and forth. It's certainly not the case that I
*  tell them the questions I'm going to ask, since I don't know those oftentimes, before we even
*  start the interview. Like I have a kind of bullet point outline at best and then try to work from
*  that. But you want the interview to be not overly planned. I think that in my very early days
*  of podcasting, I planned too much. You know, like I really had my questions plot out ahead of time,
*  which is no good way to do it. You know, you want some points you want to hit, but the specific
*  questions and the specific give and take has to come organically out of the interview. And, you
*  know, again, most of the people who I have, it's not their first rodeo, they've done this before.
*  So they're pretty good at offering answers that sort of make sense. I do try to have,
*  you know, as I said before, I like diversity along many axes. And one axis is youth to age
*  and seniority, right? So I have some famous senior people, and I have some younger people relatively
*  just starting out. And unsurprisingly, young people just starting out are less practiced
*  at, you know, hitting the sweet spot of long enough answers to give some meaty details without
*  just giving a little mini lecture every time, right? So that's a skill you develop over time.
*  That's okay. I'm happy to play a tiny role in exposing certain young promising people to a
*  wider audience and giving them a chance to sort of hone their technique at addressing these
*  questions in real time like that. Frank Layman says, Do you think Twitter is a net good or
*  negative for physics and science more broadly? It seems that for every positive interaction one
*  has on the social network, there are 10 others that confirm his reputation as being a hell site.
*  You know, look, I don't know whether it's a net good for physics or science, like that's very hard
*  to tell. You know, most physicists and scientists don't use Twitter. I think that you can get a
*  very distorted view of the world by taking Twitter too seriously as reflecting what is going on in
*  the wider world. Okay, and that's just as true for it's even more true for physics than it is
*  for something like politics or sports or whatever. And physicists are the worst, like physicists don't
*  use social media at all compared to other things. And there's a broader point here
*  that you know, I've said before, but it's worth emphasizing that both the people who come to mind
*  when you say a physicist in the modern world, and the issues that come to mind when you say like,
*  what are physicists care about in the modern world are completely different in the public
*  sphere and in the academic sphere. There's some overlap, but it's kind of small, this overlap.
*  So you know, the things that get talked about in physics departments among physicists,
*  there's a certain set of issues, a certain set of people who are looked up to as, you know,
*  wise voices that we should pay attention to, etc. certain set of questions that we care about.
*  And they're not utterly unrelated to what we talk about on Twitter and elsewhere in public, but
*  they're very different. And so I kind of sometimes got to roll my eyes, you know, when people give
*  their lists of the top five physicists alive today. I mean, look, if I appear on that list,
*  then you know the person is not credible. I'm a good physicist, but not anyone's idea of one
*  of the top five physicists alive today. But people, you know, very naturally attribute
*  slightly more importance to their favorite public figures than they would do to professors who
*  they've never heard of. Anyway, the point about is Twitter good for physics or for science,
*  you know, one thing about Twitter is it's optional. They have not yet made it compulsory,
*  they've not yet made it mandatory. If you yourself find Twitter to be dragging you down,
*  then just don't do it. That would be my advice. Like, I use Twitter and I like it. I'm not trying
*  to make light of the fact that Twitter can be a downer, because there's a lot of people on there
*  who with the best of intentions, I mean, some obviously have bad intentions, but forget about
*  those people. But even with the best of intentions, there are people who use social media to highlight
*  problems in the world, to, you know, point out injustices or mistakes or falsehoods or misinformation.
*  And if you're just being reminded of that aspect of the world all the time, even if you know all
*  the people you're listening to are ones you agree with, it drags you down, it just weighs on you.
*  You need to have some joy in there. My own tweeting, I like to try to, you know, mix in
*  me railing against the injustices of the universe with, you know, more fun, uplifting, enlightening
*  things as well. And you get to pick who you follow on Twitter, right? So if you're constantly being
*  bombarded with things that bring you down, then you have to ask why you're following the people
*  who are doing that to you. And if you just can't avoid it, then you have to ask why you're on there
*  at all. I think it's obvious that Twitter is a wonderful source for broadcasting information.
*  Like, some people like to have conversations on Twitter. They like to go back and forth and
*  discuss things. And I just have no interest in doing that. I don't mean to insult anybody. But
*  when I tweet something and someone responds to it, the chances that I will respond to their response
*  are almost zero, because I just don't think it's useful for that. It's a broadcasting medium.
*  If I want to learn about, you know, what is, when the LIGO experiment found evidence for
*  gravitational waves, that news spread on Twitter faster than anywhere else, right? That is the kind
*  of thing Twitter is super duper useful for, linking to things that are longer, more careful things,
*  but not for having in-depth conversations about things. So I find Twitter very, very useful and
*  helpful for that, but different people's mileage will vary. Paul Torek says, in ever-ready and
*  quantum mechanics, individual branches get thinner over time. Their amplitudes get smaller.
*  So they make smaller and smaller contributions to the total energy of the universe. Suppose we
*  fashion half the mass of a solar system into spaceships and toss a quantum coin. Heads we
*  send out the fleet, tails we set, they a few more decades to improve the ships. We observe tails.
*  Do we expect the local curvature of space-time to be reduced as our other branch siblings fly away,
*  resulting in a lower all branches local mass energy density? So in other words, in case that
*  thought, I edited a little bit, so it's not entirely Paul's fault here, but in case that wasn't clear,
*  imagine we do a quantum experiment where there's two different possible outcomes and in one outcome,
*  we send off a lot of mass and the other one we don't. Would we feel a different gravitational
*  field? No, we do not. Otherwise, I mean, to say that we would is to say that the existence of
*  this other branch of the wave function of the universe would be observable. I mean, that would
*  be great. That would be wonderful. But within each branch, the laws of physics of ordinary
*  classical physics are more or less obeyed. So the matter that is in the branch, you know, when you
*  say the earth, I mean, just do a simpler version of your thought experiment. Say that there is a spin
*  you're measuring, 50-50 chance to be spin up or spin down, and you have a bomb that destroys the
*  earth with 50-50 probability, right? And you live, you find yourself, you do the experiment and you
*  find yourself on the branch where the earth is not destroyed. Does the earth suddenly get half of its
*  mass disappearing? No, that is not what happens, because the mass exists within each branch,
*  and the branching does not change the amount of mass in a single branch at all. Modulo,
*  a little tiny effect, which is what I wrote about in my recent paper with Jackie Laudman, that of
*  course, if the two branches, the two branches can be slightly different in energy, as long as their
*  average is the same as the energy that you had before. But there's a difference, and this is just
*  why it's, it's, this is what the math is, again, completely crystal clear about this, completely
*  unambiguous. There's a difference between the energy you perceive from within a branch of the
*  universe and the contribution of that branch to the energy of the whole wave function of the universe.
*  The energy you perceive from within a branch doesn't change, no matter what's happening on the
*  other branches. Richard Graff says, I'm reading and enjoying Chin Chin's, sorry, I can never
*  pronounce this person's name, I'm sorry, Mr. Liu. Chin Chin Liu's three-body problem series.
*  In it, a character describes a proton in a high-dimensional space being unfolded into a lower
*  dimensional space. One of the results is that the object's size grows immensely large in the lower
*  dimension and increasingly so as it unfolds into even lower dimensions. Does this unfolding
*  concept and the described size increase have any mathematical or physical validity, or is it just
*  a clever literary device? I don't know, is the short answer. You know, whenever you have something
*  like a physics process translated into a science fiction novel, two things are happening. One is
*  the novelist will ignore the laws of physics in favor of telling the story they want to tell,
*  but also number two, even if they're obeying the laws of physics, they're not writing down
*  the equations. They're using metaphorical descriptions to try to give you a feeling
*  for what is happening. So nothing in those words corresponds cleanly and crisply to anything that
*  I know about that could actually happen in the real world. The closest is the idea of living on
*  a brain, B-R-A-N-E, which is sort of a sub space of a larger higher dimensional space. So we see a
*  three-dimensional world around us. It is possible that that three-dimensional world is a three-dimensional
*  brain, back construction from the word membrane. So a three brain embedded in a four-dimensional
*  space or five-dimensional space or something like that. And there are particles, the reason why we
*  don't mention, why we don't notice the extra dimensions is because the particles of which
*  we are made are stuck to the brain. Okay, now as far as I know, there's no sensible theory in which
*  something like an electron or a proton can be stuck to a brain and then escape and then, you know,
*  fly off into the extra dimensions. Particles and fields either are or are not stuck to the brains,
*  but you know, maybe you could, I mean what you can imagine happening is two particles annihilating,
*  two particles that are stuck to the brain can annihilate and change into particles that are not
*  stuck to the brain. And that just appears to us on the brain as missing energy, energy would disappear
*  from our observable universe. Only the observable universe, not the real universe, has nothing to
*  do with quantum mechanics here, but that is a possible thing. So I think that's the closest
*  thing that I can think of that is an analogy to that particular example in the novel.
*  Paul Hess says, can you explain the relationship, if any, between entropy and weak emergence?
*  I began to think about this when Anil Seth described weak emergence as higher level behavior
*  that cannot be predicted from the lower level components without exhaustive simulation.
*  And exhaustive simulation sounds to me like it represents information that is not compressible.
*  And in computer science, they use the idea of entropy to talk about how compressible something
*  is. Does it make any sense for me to think of entropy and emergence as related concepts?
*  Yes, I think that they are related. In fact, I would go so far as to say that we're not sure,
*  or at least I'm not sure, I've done a little bit of work on this. I don't think we can completely
*  articulate right now what the relationship is. Because frankly, I think that our, despite the
*  fact that we babble about it all the time, I think that our understanding of how emergence works
*  is pretty primitive and not very general. We've looked at it in certain cases, but the general
*  theory of when and how one description emerges from another one is very primitive, I think,
*  very underdeveloped. So here's the sense in which entropy does, well, there is a sense,
*  potentially, which entropy is related to emergence. And there's a trivial sense in which that's true,
*  namely the following. What if we were in equilibrium? What if we were in the highest
*  entropy state it is possible to be in? Then there'd be no emergence. Entropy would not be
*  increasing, but also we'd be in equilibrium. Everything would be whatever configuration it
*  would be in, presumably smooth and featureless. And so there'd be no stuff to be higher level
*  objects in the emergent theory, right? In the real world, emergent things like human beings
*  or whatever are constantly increasing the entropy of the universe. Now that's not perfect or exact
*  what I just said, because another example of emergence is the earth moving around the sun.
*  The earth can be described by its center of mass coordinates, and it doesn't need to be
*  increasing in entropy for that to happen. It's true that the configuration of the earth plus the sun
*  is very low entropy compared to thermal equilibrium, but it's not increasing in
*  entropy in any noticeable way. That increase in entropy is not playing an important role
*  in the emergence of the earth as just a point mass going around the sun. So that's why it's
*  complicated. That's why it's hard. And so I do think there is a relationship. One more fact about
*  that, and so if you don't have the general theory, I can just throw out facts and you can make of
*  them what you will. There is a relationship to this word that you use compression. The whole idea
*  of emergence is that there are many, many states that you could imagine specifying in the underlying
*  microscopic theory that look the same, that correspond to the same state in the macroscopic
*  theory. So for the earth moving around the sun, there's 10 to the 50th particles in the earth.
*  There are many, many ways to arrange them so that the center of mass position and velocity of the
*  earth is the same. And so that's a compression, right? The whole idea of emergence absolutely
*  takes advantage of the compressibility of the microscopic theory in some way. And whenever you
*  compress, there's an associated entropy. You can ask about how many ways are there to arrange the
*  microscopic constituents so as to make the macroscopic thing. And the logarithm of that
*  is going to be an entropy. It's not like necessarily the thermodynamic entropy, etc.,
*  but it's related. So I think this is all a very rich vein to imagine mining as we work
*  towards a better understanding of emergence going forward. Brendan asks, how would you apply
*  Bayesian reasoning between a deity and an advanced alien being? If an entity suddenly appeared and
*  performed actions that defied our current understanding of physics, how would you update
*  your Bayesian probability? I think many people would be quick and wait heavily for a deity,
*  but it wouldn't be completely unreasonable to think an alien race millions or billions of years
*  more advanced to perform things that we think are not possible. Yeah, that's a very good question.
*  I think it would depend on the specifics, right? Like is the, well, okay, let me be even more fair
*  than that. I'm not at all sure that the deity concept is even coherent. So I would tend to put
*  low prior probability on the deity idea. Number one, because it requires violating our understanding
*  of how the universe works, right? Whereas aliens do not. Number two, I think that a lot of our
*  ways of talking about godlike creatures come from starting with our ways of talking about ordinary
*  human beings and exaggerating them and exaggerating them so much to talk about them being infinitely
*  bigger or better or more powerful. But I don't really think that move is very rigorous or very
*  easy to make sense of. There's a standard line about God being omnipotent and omniscient and
*  omnibenevolent. And there's standard objections that say, well, you can't be all of those things
*  because if you were perfectly good, you wouldn't let all this bad stuff happen in the world.
*  And there's clever theological moves and maneuvers you can use to get around that conclusion. But
*  the simple conclusion is the whole idea was just half-baked from the first, from the start. So my
*  immediate priors would be mostly on highly advanced technological civilization rather than deity.
*  But I'm willing to update them. Let's talk to these people. I don't see why an infinitely
*  powerful being would talk to me or hasn't talked to me yet but would start. There's a million ways
*  in which the concept doesn't quite make sense to me. But if they claimed that there was some
*  reason that they could demonstrate that they were more supernatural than natural,
*  then I would give them the chance to do that and see what happened.
*  Kathy Seeger says, I read an article on Wikipedia about dark fluid theory in which they aim at
*  unifying dark matter and dark energy. The theory proposes that dark matter and dark energy are
*  strongly linked together and can be considered as two facets of a single fluid. At galactic
*  scales, the dark fluid behaves like dark matter and at larger scales, its behavior becomes similar
*  to dark energy. What do you think of it? So I don't know exactly what is being referred to here.
*  There's sort of more than one idea that has been labeled dark fluid in some sense. It's a natural
*  kind of thing. Look, I already talked about dark radiation and dark photons. Like once you invent
*  dark matter and dark energy, you're going to start inventing a lot of different dark stuff just to see
*  how much you can get away with. I certainly think that any of these
*  more elaborate Baroque theories should be given much lower credence than the simple theory,
*  because we have a very simple theory for dark matter and dark energy. Dark energy is a
*  cosmological constant and dark matter is some cold, weakly interacting or non-interacting
*  massive particle. Those are two very, very simple ideas that fit all the data up to your usual
*  collection of tiny anomalies. Like we talked about with Priya Natarajan before, there's a tiny
*  anomaly there in the gravitational lensing. There's other anomalies here and there. But with
*  astrophysical anomalies, there's a lot of phenomena that you're observing. Occasionally you'll find
*  an anomaly and occasionally it will go away. So there's no super strong killer evidence against
*  that very, very simple theory. So it's worth trying to invent better theories because there's
*  absolutely open questions about the simple theory. But until there's really a very well
*  motivated and empirically successful version of them, I would not put too much credence in them.
*  I know that Justin Corey at the University of Pennsylvania has a very interesting theory about
*  some super fluid dark matter. I don't think he's trying to explain away dark energy and
*  the acceleration of the universe, but he's trying to explain the behavior of dark matter in galaxies
*  and clusters. And he says he can do that in a very specific way. I think that kind of thing is
*  promising. The particle physics behind it is a little clunky and unnatural, but if you can
*  really explain something astrophysically, maybe it's worth it. It's certainly worth at least
*  thinking about it. I'm in favor of work going forward in these directions. Sam Hartzog says,
*  do mathematical functions like integrals, differential equations, etc. have some kind
*  of metric tied to them to represent something like how many independent bits of information
*  are required to carry out meaningful operations? It occurred to me that a notation like tensor
*  calculus allows you to write things pretty concisely and wondered if there was any kind
*  of metric for hidden computational complexity. So I debated whether to answer this question or not,
*  because it kind of violates my rules. It's a good question, but I don't have anything interesting
*  to say about it. The short answer is no, as far as I know. There's not a kind of metric,
*  a metric on the space of operations you need to do to perform a certain operation,
*  to transform a certain function or something like that. There are certain very restricted domains
*  in which you can do something like that, and that's what made me think of it. So in particular,
*  let's say you're doing quantum mechanics, and let's say that you're doing quantum mechanics
*  in a finite dimensional setting. So not finite dimensions of space, but finite dimensions of
*  Hilbert space, so the quantum mechanical space of possibilities. So in particular, let's be even
*  more specific. Let's imagine you have qubits. Let's imagine you're doing something like a quantum
*  computer. So you have a bunch of qubits, and you're going to act on them. And it's very much like a
*  regular computer. You act on bits in a regular computer using gates, and gates, not gates,
*  XOR, whatever. If you've studied computer science, there's a set of things you can do with two bits
*  to turn them into one bit or another two bits or et cetera. Similarly with quantum information and
*  qubits. And so if you have a set of qubits and you have a set of allowed gates, so you have gates
*  that can act on these two qubits one at a time. And so you can't just act willy nilly on any two
*  qubits, but there's a set of qubits, like maybe the qubits are arranged in a line, or they're
*  arranged in a lattice on a two-dimensional plane or something like that. And you allow gates to
*  interact on nearest neighbors. Then you can talk about the complexity of the resulting quantum
*  state or the amount of entanglement in the resulting quantum state. So you start with
*  a quantum state that is completely unentangled, and you act on it pairs of qubits at a time with
*  your allowed gates. And then there's a simple metric on how complicated your quantum state is,
*  namely what is the smallest number of allowed gates that will get you to the state you want
*  to get to from some given starting point. As you might gather from that explanation,
*  it's a very, very specific situation you're looking at there. It's very far away from a
*  general theory of transforming one function into another or one vector into another or anything
*  like that. So I think that's the state of the art as far as I know. Because if you don't make those
*  restrictions, let's say you just start with one quantum state and go to another quantum state,
*  and you say without restricting on the set of gates I can use and whatever, in principle,
*  how many steps does it take me to get from one quantum state to the other? And the answer is
*  always one. One step. If you really cleverly pick your operation, you can always go from any
*  one orientation of a vector in some vector space to any other orientation whatsoever.
*  So I think the general theory there is going to fall short unless you make some other choices
*  about what operations are allowed. And then maybe you can make some progress.
*  Tis Jansson says, you convinced me of ever reading quantum mechanics so much I can't see any problems
*  with it. I listened to the podcast with David Albert twice and read something deeply hidden twice,
*  but I still can't see the problem with probabilities. And then he goes on to explain
*  what his issue is with the problem of probability. So rather than reading your issue with the issue,
*  let me just do my best to say how I interpret David's objection to many worlds. You know,
*  the way that I think about the origin of probability in many worlds is via self-locating
*  uncertainty. Chip Siemens and I wrote a paper about this to try to formalize it, etc., based on ideas
*  that other people used, Lev Weidman, Wojtek Czerach, and others. And the basic idea is when
*  you measure a quantum system, or when a quantum system is measured, it doesn't need to be a person
*  or even an apparatus. But when a tiny quantum system decoheres, when it becomes entangled with
*  this environment, and therefore the wave function of the universe branches into multiple copies,
*  I know I can predict ahead of time with certainty that there will be a version of me on every one
*  of the copies. Okay. And it happens very rapidly. This splitting of the wave function happens far
*  more rapidly than any one of those copies are aware of. So after the splitting, there are many
*  copies of me, or just two or whatever, some number, and none of them know where they are.
*  That's the self-locating uncertainty. So is there a way for those people, those future versions of
*  me, to assign a credence to being on one branch of the wave function of the universe versus another?
*  And Chip and I argue that if you try to answer that question in some sensible way, there is only one
*  possible reasonable answer, which is the Born Rule of quantum mechanics. You assign a probability or
*  credence to being on any one branch that is given by the amplitude of that branch squared.
*  And David Albert would like to say, no, I have another perfectly reasonable possibility, as he
*  says in the podcast, namely, I have no clue. And that's his attitude. He says, you can't force me
*  to say, well, what is the most reasonable probability measure to put on this? Because there's
*  n copies of me. They are all in identical situations. How can they say anything at all
*  about the probability of being on one branch or another, especially because none of them can
*  observe that. None of them can observe the amplitude of the branch that they are on.
*  You can ahead of time predict, you know, you can set up the initial quantum state so that you know
*  what the branch amplitudes will be ahead of time. But once you're on a branch, it's just a branch.
*  You don't know what the amplitude is sitting outside. It has no effect. The amplitude doesn't
*  change the dynamics of your branch once you are on it. So David just says the alternative
*  to choosing this sensible Born Rule set of credences is not to choose credences at all,
*  just to say, I don't know what branch I'm on, and therefore I cannot predict anything.
*  So I think the mistake there is there's two. Well, there's two. It's not even a mistake.
*  It's an attitude. You're allowed to take it. So it's not a mistake. You're allowed to take that
*  attitude. I think it's not the right or best attitude to take for two reasons. Number one is
*  there is an obvious probability measure to use. It's not like we're completely clueless. Like
*  everyone agrees on what the obviously correct one is if you think that there is one. Okay. And that's
*  the Born Rule. Like, as I often say, there's never any possibility that it would be the wave
*  function cubed or the logarithm of the wave function. It's always going to be the wave
*  function squared. That's the set of numbers that add up to one and are conserved over time. Okay.
*  But the other is, more importantly, that there is sort of a normative reason for choosing a set of
*  credences. Normative in the sense of it's a judgmental thing. It's not forced on you by the
*  world, but it's something that you want to do if you know what is going on. And it's the same
*  normative reason that we want to correctly describe physics at all, that we correctly want to have a
*  theory of how the world works. When you are going to jump off of a building, you have a theory of
*  what's going to happen when you jump off the building. You can't say, well, maybe I'll fall
*  down and hurt myself or maybe I'll float off into the sky. Both are possible, right? So who knows?
*  I mean, they are both possible. If you really strictly go by the meaning of what possible means,
*  it is possible that this time you will fly up into the sky rather than go down to the ground.
*  But you don't give it equal credence to the idea that you will go down to the ground because you're
*  trying to understand the world the best you can. You have some experience with the past. You have
*  some rules for assigning credences to different possible worlds that you could live in. That's a
*  kind of self-locating uncertainty. You don't know what the laws of physics are in the world you're
*  in. There's a world, a possible world, where the laws of physics say that gravity is attractive
*  and you will fall down off the building. There is a possible world where the laws of physics say
*  the gravity is attractive right up until the moment you jump and then gravity becomes repulsive.
*  It's possible, right? You assign very, very low credence to that world and there's reasonable
*  reasons to do that. They're not metaphysically certain. You could be wrong, but it's the best
*  you can do under the circumstances. That's how I think about the Everettian probabilities. You're
*  there on a branch. You can just decide not to assign credences at all. I can't stop you. It's
*  a free country, but it's not the best way to do the best job you can do of understanding how the
*  world works and where you are in the world. Once you accept that, then you're going to put the
*  Born Rule Credences on those branches. Okay, I'm going to group two questions together
*  about zombies. Oh, many of you know, I should have mentioned this, but in case you didn't know,
*  I did a podcast, a long podcast with Philip Goff and Keith Frankish. Philip, of course,
*  has been a Mindscape guest before. He is a promoter of panpsychism in the theory of
*  consciousness and Keith is on the opposite side of the consciousness debates. He's also a philosopher.
*  He's a proponent of illusionism. He doesn't think that qualia in the strict philosophical sense are
*  even real. They're just illusions. So we talked about why I'm a physicalist about these things,
*  and it was a useful conversation. We talked about zombies a lot, and I wrote a follow-up blog post
*  on the zombie argument for physicalism, if you're interested in that. So this is partly what is
*  instigating these questions. So one is from Keith. I don't think it's Keith Frankish,
*  it's a person named Keith who says, I enjoyed your blog post on P-zombies for physicalism and visit
*  on MindChat. MindChat is the name of the podcast and P-zombies are philosophical zombies. So for
*  those of you who don't know, a P-zombie is the idea that we could imagine exactly two different,
*  again, two different possible worlds, one of which I have real human beings, and they have all their
*  conscious experiences and all this stuff, the real world as we think and we know it. But I also,
*  according to this thought experiment, could imagine a different possible world made of the
*  same kinds of matter, same kinds of quantum mechanics and electrons and protons and neutrons,
*  etc., obeying exactly the same laws of physics, doing exactly the same things, but no consciousness.
*  And the people who live in that world, I would call them zombies. And so sorry, I'm departing
*  from Keith's question here, but I'm giving you background if you don't already know. So the zombie
*  argument is the idea that because in principle, I can conceive of the same exact physical collection
*  of matter with and without consciousness, consciousness must be something other than
*  some way of talking about the physical behavior of that collection of matter.
*  Of course, I would say that that's begging the question because you can only conceive of those
*  zombies if you believe that consciousness is not physical. If you believe that consciousness is
*  just an emergent thing to talk about describing the underlying physical behavior of matter,
*  then you cannot conceive of zombies because the same exact physical collection of matter,
*  behaving in exactly the same way, would be conscious under that definition. Okay,
*  that is the argument that goes back and forth. So Keith's question is,
*  I followed up the reasoning for most part, but I really get hung up a bit upstream.
*  As a fellow physicalist, I don't really get how a pee zombie is even conceivable, or maybe my
*  notion of conceivability is too strict. And then another question from Graham Clark that says,
*  do you think that a philosophical zombie is actually conceivable? Your arguments against
*  panpsychism seem to indicate that, but I wonder why the zombie concept hasn't been rejected.
*  Yes, so I think you're both correctly putting your fingers on something that I didn't make
*  very clear in my blog post. The answer is zombies are not conceivable. That's what you have to say
*  if you're a physicalist who thinks that consciousness is just weakly emergent. That's
*  just what I said. If you think that consciousness is just a way of talking about the collective
*  behavior and higher level ways of talking about a collection of particles doing a certain things,
*  then there's no way to remove consciousness from that and therefore zombies are not conceivable.
*  So I wrote that in the paper that I wrote. I wrote a paper for the Journal of Consciousness Studies,
*  writing a philosophy paper that was responding to Philip Goff's ideas, but I didn't make that
*  very clear in the blog post because I was in a rush by the time I finished it. It was already
*  too long. So yes, the punchline is that taking the zombie argument at face value, as it is usually
*  given, only works if you assume ahead of time that consciousness is not physical. Otherwise,
*  zombies become not conceivable. So that is the correct way to think about it. Yes.
*  Alejandro Gonzalez says, let us suppose we discover that consciousness is a fundamental
*  property of nature, which I know you're inclined to think is emergent. What could the implications
*  be of that for the current understanding of physics and the model of the universe we have now?
*  Just entertain us with some plausible possibilities if there are any at all.
*  Well, this is hard to do because I don't think it makes sense. I don't think it's true anyway.
*  Part of the reason why I don't think it's true that consciousness is a fundamental property
*  of nature is that I haven't seen even the slightest gesture toward a serious theory
*  of that. I mean, you can attach words to the existing theories of quantum field theory or
*  whatever and say, oh, it's all made of consciousness, but I don't see any operational meaning to how that
*  is supposed to happen. As I emphasized in the podcast with Philip and Keith and in my blog post
*  and elsewhere, either you change the dynamics of the particles and fields we know about or you
*  don't. That is true about anyone's theory of consciousness. You either do that or you don't.
*  And if you don't, then I just don't see what it matters. There's just no implications of that idea.
*  And if you do, show me the equations. Show me exactly how the equations that we think work
*  are wrong. Show me what the additional parts of them are. I mean, that's what you do if you are
*  a physicist inventing a new theory of gravity or new model of dark matter or explanation for the
*  hierarchy problem. You show us the equations and we can work out from them what the implications
*  of those are. And I don't know what those would be for a theory of consciousness as a fundamental
*  property of nature. So I truly don't know. I'm not trying to be coy about it or anything like that.
*  I'm just not even sure how that would work. I think that there's sort of a feeling that people
*  have that consciousness can't be just physical stuff because of their introspection. But I don't
*  know whether that feeling actually leads anywhere sensible in terms of how the universe works.
*  Crather Luca says, regarding your theory on the arrow of time, in last month's AMA,
*  you mentioned something along the lines of, I don't necessarily think my theory with Jennifer
*  Chen is true, but I think that there's a non-zero chance that it's true. However, I know of no
*  better theory regarding the arrow of time. If you believe you have the best theory, isn't the
*  rational thing to do than to regard it as true? We can never truly justify our beliefs. So what
*  other reason can we have for believing something is true besides it being the current best theory
*  of some part of reality? So no, I don't think that's exactly right. I think that for me to say it's
*  the best current theory requires that I should give it, in this case, it's not really a theory
*  of the arrow of time so much as the theory of the arrow of time is entropy increases because of
*  Boltzmann's explanation for what entropy was plus the fact that the entropy near the Big Bang was
*  low. That's the arrow of time. But then the question is, why was the entropy low near the Big Bang?
*  That's what I and Jennifer Chen had a theory of. And I still think it, as far as I know, is the
*  best theory that I've heard of. So I think that what that requires in order to be self-consistent is
*  I give more credence to that theory than to any other theory. However, the total number of other
*  theories might be very large and there might be a large amount of credence I give to some theory in
*  the set of theories no one has articulated yet. It's a little bit different than to say something
*  like my theory in many worlds is, my credence in many worlds is 95% or something like that.
*  That's a situation where we have several competing theories, we know what they are,
*  we can articulate them pretty clearly, and they're all in some ways successful and I can judge them
*  against each other. Whereas for something like this, we have no really good theories,
*  including my own, because there's a lot of un-understood physics that is involved in our
*  own theories about how baby universes could be created or something like that, how you calculate
*  a measure to talk about probabilities and make predictions and all of these things. So there are
*  no great theories. Our theory, I think, is the most promising one among the not very good theories.
*  And in that situation, you should still give a hefty amount of credence to, I just don't know
*  yet, we haven't thought of the right answer. So I would not say that I believe it's true,
*  even if I think it's the best theory currently out there. Tareem Shahab says, what is energy?
*  In high school, they would always say energy is the ability to do work and then define works
*  in terms of energy. I've also heard it described as bookkeeping. Is that all it is or is it more
*  meaningful? Well, certainly not the ability to do work. That's not a good definition because
*  there are forms of energy that literally are defined as the kinds of energy that can't do
*  meaningful work. You know, the heat, the thermal energy in an equilibrium system is in its highest
*  entropy state. You can't do useful work with it. That's what free energy is. Free energy is the
*  energy that is available to do work. Non-free energy is the energy locked up in the equilibrium
*  high entropy configuration. Okay, so it's not that. But what is it? You know, there's different
*  definitions and I think that the favorite one and probably the right one, even though it doesn't
*  make a lot of instant intuitive sense, is the quantity that is conserved because the laws of
*  physics are independent of time. You know, if you think about, and this is easiest to sort of gain
*  intuition for by thinking of the converse. What if the laws of physics were not invariant over time,
*  right? So, you know, that would be like masses of particles or strengths of forces or something
*  like that just changing as time goes on. And as you might imagine, if I have a particle moving,
*  you know, just in a straight line according to Newton's laws, but its mass is changing,
*  then if momentum is conserved, the velocity of the particle would be changing even though its mass,
*  because its mass is changing. Whereas if momentum is not conserved, but velocity is conserved,
*  then its momentum is not conserved over time. And in neither case is the energy conserved over time
*  because basically intuitively, and this might not be exactly correct, but intuitively it's kind of
*  like something is pumping energy into the system by changing the mass of the particle. So because
*  we live in a world where the particles have more or less constant masses, the forces are more or
*  less locked in with their strengths, and so the overall laws of physics are basically constant
*  over time. There's no extra thing, oomph, impetus put into the system, and we call
*  the quantity that is conserved because of that symmetry energy. Now this is a handwavy way of
*  saying a much more rigorous result. Nuerder's theorem, I mean, Nuerder proved that whenever you have
*  certain kinds of classical mechanical systems that have a symmetry, that symmetry is associated with
*  a conservation law. Momentum is associated with the fact that things are translationally invariant
*  in space. You can move in either x, y, or z directions. The laws of physics don't change.
*  So you have three conserved quantities, the three components of the momentum vector, and you also
*  have translations in time, and the quantity that is conserved with respect to that is energy.
*  It's not a very intuitive definition, I know that, but that is what the mathematical definition is,
*  and it matches up with our intuitive definition of some combination of potential energy and
*  kinetic energy and heat and stuff like that. Horst Vorst says, what is your Bayesian prior of finding
*  compelling evidence of biosignatures in the atmospheres of exoplanets in the next couple
*  of decades? Oh, this is a great question because it's specific enough to make sense.
*  Like, one should have a Bayesian prior about this, but it's really hard to know what it is.
*  I'm going to put it low. I'm going to put it at, let's say, 10 percent. And the reason why this is
*  difficult is because, of course, we have a certain, we have two pieces of information. I don't even
*  want to say data points, but two pieces of information. One is life exists here on Earth,
*  right? We're flourishing here on Earth. The other is we haven't seen already, sort of in an in-your-face
*  kind of way, life elsewhere, either elsewhere on other planets in the solar system or aliens
*  flying by and saying hi to us from elsewhere in the Milky Way. So those are two pieces of information
*  you have to reconcile with each other. The easiest reconciliation is that in some sense,
*  life elsewhere is rare. And, of course, as a selection effect, we're only going to exist
*  where life exists. So the fact that we exist here on Earth is not really telling us that much.
*  But there are lots of steps along the way from no life at all to an intelligent civilization on
*  another planet. And any one of those could be a bottleneck that explains why we haven't seen other
*  intelligent civilizations yet. So it might be that there's no life, but it also might be that life
*  is everywhere. It's ubiquitous. It's very common, but it's always only single-celled or something
*  like that, not very technologically advanced. That's why it's very hard to make a good Bayesian
*  prior. So I'm going to put it at 10%. Don't ask me to justify that. I might change my mind if we
*  learn more about chemistry or geology or something like that. Robert Ruxin-Drescu says,
*  a few days ago, Elon Musk responded to a Bernie Sanders tweet about the rich paying their fair
*  share to society by commenting, I forgot you're still alive. So I asked Elon Musk if he thinks
*  living in a world where one man has $1 trillion and the other people die of hunger is a good world.
*  What ensued was a ton of attacks from the sympathizers of Elon Musk calling me all
*  sorts of things from communist to idiot. My question is this, where do you think all this
*  aggressiveness and rich man idolatry is coming from? Why are people so aggressive? Why are people
*  so obsessed with money? And why are people so rude and violent? Well, I'm not going to give you a
*  fully blown theory of why people are rude and violent. I think this is a difficult question.
*  One point to keep in mind is that you have an extremely strong selection effect here. It's not
*  that people are rude and violent, just that you poked a certain hornet's nest that has some very
*  rude and violent people in it and you got a reaction that was kind of predictable, to be honest.
*  Now, why those people exist at all is a more complicated psychological question.
*  The reason why I wanted to address this question is I think that we have a weird relationship in
*  modern society with the concept of super rich people with billionaires or whatever, in part
*  because we have a lot of inequality in society and it's getting to be too much inequality.
*  We have both very ostentatiously wealthy people and a lot of people who are struggling. We have
*  a societal system that makes it really, really hard to climb out of very, very low income
*  situations. It's just too easy to get into debt, to spiral downward. Life is much more expensive
*  for poor people than it is for rich people in a very real sense because as a fraction of whatever
*  income they have, there are fixed costs that rich people can just laugh off and poor people can't.
*  Parking tickets are a big deal when you're poor and what you do is you end up not paying them and
*  then they grow or overdraft fees on the bank. We literally charge you money for not having enough
*  money. Whereas a rich person doesn't care about parking tickets. They can let that off and still
*  go make more money off of their investments or whatever it is. That kind of system that has this
*  built-in stratification dynamics to it is troubling if you don't have a lot of economic
*  and social mobility built in. I think that people are upset for a lot of good reasons
*  and other people are aspirational. Other people want to be those rich people who are very,
*  very successful. I think that the conversation about wealthy people has become too polarized,
*  honestly. They're just people. I know Elon. We're not best buddies but I've met him. I argued with
*  him on Twitter about extraterrestrial life and talking about the previous AMA question. He said
*  nice things about my book so that's good. I think that he's a person. I know lots of people who are
*  quite wealthy and there's good ones and bad ones, smart ones and dumb ones, good ones and evil ones.
*  I think that it's possible with respect to Elon Musk to both say, to criticize him, to say we don't
*  like how Tesla workers are treated or the ability to unionize or something like that or the fact
*  that he doesn't want to pay his fair share of taxes while also recognizing that he has almost
*  single-handedly done more to change the world than almost anyone else I can think of by really
*  converting a whole industry from gas engines to electric cars. That was unthinkable a short time
*  ago and without Elon that probably would not have happened. I think that people are complicated.
*  I think that we should develop the mental capacities to have nuanced views of human beings.
*  When it comes to rich people, that's becoming harder. People either want to worship them,
*  like you say, to hero worship them or to vilify them. I'm not in favor of either one of these.
*  I don't want to hero worship anybody. I have a general theory of not hero worshiping people.
*  I don't worship Richard Feynman or Albert Einstein or Martin Luther King or Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
*  whoever you want to pick. I think that's just a bad idea. You can admire people for what they've
*  done but hero worship involves extending that admiration to a general feeling that they're
*  good people just because they did this one good thing and that's just setting yourself up for
*  disappointment. A person can both change the world and be bad in other ways and you have to
*  be able to accept those nuances there. In fact, Liam Covey-Bright, who was on the podcast,
*  when I first invited him on the podcast, I wanted to talk about this because he has a whole
*  spiel about how we should have no heroes, which is very interesting and compelling. We got
*  distracted talking about truth but you can look that up on his website.
*  I don't want to villainize rich people either. I'm reminded of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, AOC.
*  Remember she went to the Met Gala? This happened a few weeks ago or months ago. She went to this
*  gala full of rich people and she wore a dress and on the back of the dress was written,
*  tax the rich. Do me a favor, just for a moment, put aside whatever pre-existing feelings you
*  might have about AOC or the tax system or the Met Gala or whatever. I want to make one very small
*  specific point. People objected on the basis that it was hypocritical or somehow there was some
*  tension between the fact that she was at a party full of rich people and had a dress that said tax
*  the rich. I objected to this objection. This makes no sense. This is not in any sense hypocritical
*  or even slightly tense. It is no contradiction whatsoever to hang out with rich people, have a
*  party with them and have a good time, and also think they should pay more taxes. Those two things
*  are completely compatible with each other. The only reason why you might think that they're
*  incompatible with each other is if you think that the fact that rich people should pay more taxes
*  is a reflection of the fact that we don't like them, that they are bad or they are evil. That's
*  why we want to tax them more. I don't think that at all. Like I said, rich people are just people.
*  They have the same span of abilities and virtues that other people have. I want to be rich myself.
*  I want everyone else to be rich. That's what I want. I don't want to get rid of rich people. I want
*  everyone to be rich. That's the thing I think that we should be aiming for. I also want the
*  current rich people to pay more taxes because rich people are part of society and benefit from
*  society in very, very obvious ways. Of course, you can inherit money and then we can talk about
*  the justice of that. That's a perfectly good set of questions. But if you made money to become a
*  billionaire, it's not because you worked really hard at your job in Walmart. No Walmart worker
*  ever saved up enough money to become a billionaire. That has literally never happened. What happened is
*  you either invented a system or you participated in some existing system to arrange for a billion
*  people to give you a dollar each, roughly speaking, at the end of the day. Or maybe
*  100 million people gave you $10 each. There's different ways to work it. But the point is that
*  the only way to accumulate a billion dollars is if a lot of people send you their money.
*  It only happens if you're embedded in a system that allows that to happen. A system with people,
*  but also roads and education and commerce systems and the whole supply chain that we talked about
*  with Christopher Mims a couple of episodes ago. It is completely fair for society then to say,
*  in return, give us some of the money. We set up a system that allowed you to make this money. Now,
*  we want to keep the system working. Give us some of the money. Asking rich people to pay taxes is
*  not a bad thing. It's certainly not unnecessary. Even if you think it's a bad thing, you shouldn't
*  mix it up with some distaste for the idea of rich people at all. I think that's just entirely
*  misguided. It's a reflection of this idea that every intellectual disagreement has to become a
*  moral emotional stance. I think that's a bad attitude. Anyway, I got very far away from your
*  question, Robert. Sorry about that. I probably haven't even answered your question, but your
*  question provoked me to say some things. That's how I treat these AMAs these days.
*  Davij Moncad says, I was thinking that borrowing some physics jargon can bypass some of the
*  free will discussion pitfalls, at least among physicists. In particular, do you think that the
*  apparent conflict of the phrase could have done otherwise with determinism can be avoided by
*  separating the off-shell and the on-shell descriptions? I was tempted to think of this way
*  when I read the classic freedom of the will and concept of a person paper by Frankfurt,
*  which I think is essentially formulating the concept of free will as the existence of degrees
*  of freedom for the human will, albeit in a different language. My guess is no, my first
*  guess. Maybe there's a theory to be developed here that you want to go and develop, but that is not
*  the way that I think about free will. Even if I were to restrict myself to physics jargon,
*  I don't think that's the main point. For those of you who don't know the physics jargon,
*  think of a particle moving through the air. You all know the classic example when we learn
*  classical physics, Newtonian mechanics. You throw up a ball with a certain velocity,
*  and given the acceleration due to gravity, it travels on some kind of parabolic trajectory,
*  and you can calculate what that trajectory is. The fact that the ball moves along a certain
*  trajectory, both its position as a function of time and its momentum as a function of time,
*  obey equations of motion. That's how we say it. There are reasons which I'm not going to go into
*  from particle physics that when you obey the equations of motion in that way, we say that you
*  are on shell, you are on the mass shell, you are obeying certain equations. It's more complicated
*  than that, but I'm just trying to get you the essence of it if you don't already know.
*  Whereas off shell means you don't necessarily obey the equations of motion. We can imagine
*  all sorts of trajectories for a particle through space that don't obey the equations of motion
*  that the real physical particles would obey. What Davies is getting at is even given some fixed
*  initial conditions, we can distinguish between the actual behavior of the system that obeys the
*  initial conditions from, sorry, that starts with those initial conditions and obeys the equations
*  of motion from some more arbitrary random kind of motion. I think that that's not the right
*  distinction to make because I think that the point is that we don't know the initial conditions
*  in the real world. If the world were just a simple harmonic oscillator, if that was the whole world,
*  or if the whole world were just a few planets moving around the sun, there'd be zero reason
*  to talk about free will in any sense because you can just see what happens and it's pretty clear
*  and you can predict what's going to happen. The reason why free will, if you believe it is,
*  if you're a compatibilist, if you believe it's a useful concept, is because human beings are so
*  complicated that we don't know their initial conditions. We don't know what they're going to
*  do. We invent concepts to describe both their current state and their possible future actions.
*  Those concepts involve things like reasons and choices and deliberations. This is part of how
*  we talk about human beings. As I've said many times before, even the most devoted free will
*  skeptic uses those words. They can't help but talk about human beings. Free will skeptics are
*  constantly trying to persuade you to behave in certain ways, which is slightly incompatible with
*  their underlying metaphysical view of the world, but that's why it's easier to be a compatibilist.
*  The formulation of free will, as I could have done otherwise, I think is completely consistent
*  with the deterministic universe and everything obeying the equations of motion. In other words,
*  you don't need to go off shell to explain it because the point is you don't know what the
*  initial conditions are. You know some basic macroscopic coarse-grained features of the system,
*  but not all the microscopic details. To me, the question of could you behave differently?
*  The reason why free will skeptics get it wrong in my view is they formulate the question could
*  the system have behaved differently as if we had exactly the microscopic information about the state.
*  In that case, the answer would be no. The system could not have behaved differently,
*  but we don't have that information. The right question to ask is given the macroscopic
*  information we have about the system. In the space of all possible microscopic configurations
*  that fit into that macroscopic description, are there some that would act this way and are there
*  some that would act that way? And if the answer is yes, then that corresponds in the higher level
*  vocabulary to you could have acted differently. That's where I think is the right connection
*  between free will and the underlying laws of physics. Chris says, what do you think are the
*  most important things to know, not in science but in life in general? This is not going to be very
*  clever or original, but I'm going to give a sort of a teach you how to fish kind of answer. I don't
*  think there's a set of facts that are the important things to know. I think the most important things
*  to know are how to learn things, techniques for gaining new knowledge. Because then rather than
*  just giving you some knowledge I think you should have, if I teach you to learn things, then you can
*  get knowledge for yourself. So I don't know what those things are. Basically the answer is along
*  the lines of techniques for gathering information about the world, converting them into models and
*  hypotheses, testing them and being a good scientist about it. In the broadest possible sense. So I'm
*  going to include human relations and things like that in that set of things. The theories that
*  I'm talking about developing are not just theories for how people behave, but you know your theories
*  for how you should behave, how to get ahead, how to live a meaningful life, to develop purposes and
*  how to matter to other people and be nice. Those are all things you need to learn and so that's what
*  I would hope that you would start out by knowing. Napoleon's corporal says, DNA passes on physical
*  traits and the specific genes that carry these traits can be identified. But what about behavioral
*  traits? Can we identify genes that result in things like the hurting instinct that shelter dogs
*  have been bred to have? The broader question here is how can any physical thing influence something
*  like behavior? Well I don't know any specific examples of DNA base pairs that are correlated
*  or even the genes that are correlated with specific behaviors, but 100% they exist. Yeah I mean
*  that is absolutely something that neuroscientists and psychologists etc, geneticists do figure out.
*  And I'm honest I'm not quite sure what you mean by how can a physical thing influence something
*  like behavior. What else influences behavior? You know the behavior of the ball is influenced
*  by the fact that I throw it, right? Physical things influence behavior. That's the you know
*  behavior is a way of talking about what physical things do I think. So I'm not even quite sure what
*  what you're what you're worried about there. Alexandra Bates says, do you believe there are
*  certain traits or paradigms that separate scientific theories from pseudoscientific ones?
*  Or do you believe all theories have the same capacity to be scientific and what makes them so
*  is their agreement with the data? No actually I think you know I don't think there's a hard
*  fast line. You know people would love it if they could find a single way to demarcate
*  scientific theories from non-scientific theories and there's a name for this,
*  the demarcation problem. I don't think that's going to be quite that easy. I think it's more
*  of a sliding scale. And I've famously pointed out that Karl Popper's attempt to answer this question
*  by talking about falsifiability is not up to the task. I don't think anything is up to the task
*  but I do think that that Popper was on to something as I also often say and people ignore that part.
*  What he was on to was there are two properties that good scientific theories tend to have.
*  One is that they're definite, that they're incompatible with some things. A good scientific
*  theory is not one size fits all. A good scientific theory says that some things happen and some things
*  don't. And the reason why this is philosophically not crystal clear is because when you talk about
*  falsifiability then you're taking this ontological feature of the theory, some things happen and
*  some things don't, and turning it into an epistemological theory. I can see some things
*  happen or not see them happen and learn about it. And that's where things get fuzzier because if the
*  things that happen are other universes then they might very definitely happen or not happen but you
*  can't observe them. So that's where it gets a little bit messy. But nevertheless the basic idea
*  that a scientific theory is definite, that it says certain things happen and certain things don't,
*  I think is absolutely part of scientific theory. And the other thing that I think Popper was right
*  about in his direction that he was trying to move in is we ultimately judge scientific theories
*  empirically. We do not intuit our way to the right answer or at least we don't intuit our way to
*  knowing that the answer is right. We have to test them against the data. So scientific theories are
*  not ideas that had to be right, right? They're not deductive arguments from a priori principles to
*  correct answers. They are hypotheses that are tested, hypotheses that we put forward and we
*  assign the credence to and then the credence goes up or down on the basis of observations and collecting
*  and collecting new data about the universe. So I don't think that there is a simple clear dividing
*  line but I think that these two properties of being definite and being amenable to empirical
*  testing are two parts of being a good scientific theory. Liam McCarty says,
*  why do you think some ways of solving a given problem are easier than other ways? I'm sure
*  part of it has to do with human psychology but I'm wondering if there's more to it than that.
*  For example, arguably Feynman diagrams are more efficient than Schwinger integrals and
*  Newton's laws are more efficient than Einstein's field equations in a particular regime. Perhaps we
*  could define such a notion of efficiency for problem solving approach or physical theory.
*  Maybe there are complexity classes of the sort here, not for different problems but for the same
*  way of solving a single problem. So this is similar to the previous question about a metric on the
*  space of operations on functions or something like that. I'm sure that human psychology
*  plays some role here. I mean human beings are specific arrangements of stuff and specific
*  ways of thinking so it would be weird if the specific kind of thought process that went on
*  in human brains had nothing to do with why some problems are harder than some and some are easier.
*  But having said that, I think we tend to overrate that aspect of the issue. I think that
*  there are some aspects of problems that are just hard. This is, you know, if you just say
*  the initial question you asked is why are some ways of solving a given problem easier than other
*  ways? This is very closely related to complexity classes. Complexity classes are about how many
*  steps it takes to solve a problem rather than different ways of solving the problem. But
*  complexity class is usually about the minimum number of steps it can take. And this is a pretty
*  objective fact, right? I mean if it takes a certain number of steps to solve the problem,
*  it doesn't matter whether it's a human being doing it or a dolphin or a computer.
*  So I think that we tend to not credit enough the fundamental aspects of the problem and we tend to
*  leap too quickly to some particular fact of human psychology when we think about these things.
*  But the basic question that you're asking, why are some ways easier than others?
*  You know, I'm not going to give you the right answer. I don't even know how to formulate
*  what an answer would look like. But I will again make the point that it probably has to do with
*  the features of the problem more than the features of the human brain most of the time.
*  P. Walder says, is the interference pattern observed in Young's split,
*  yeah, Young's slit experiment to be considered as evidence for the many worlds interpretation
*  of reality? Nope, because the double slit experiment is predicted by any decent
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics. So therefore it literally cannot possibly count
*  as evidence for many worlds. I mean, you might think that the explanation for it in many worlds
*  is nicer or more attractive or whatever. But you know, as a Bayesian, what is the likelihood that
*  you will get that data given the theory is equal in many worlds or bohemian mechanics or any other
*  respectable theory of quantum mechanics? Because if you didn't predict the double slit experiment
*  correctly, you would not have gotten off the ground. No one would have paid attention to you.
*  Lucas Derhashing says, I've been recently looking into some of the cosmic speed limit postulated
*  by Minkowski. It's quite interesting to find out that we all move through space time at the speed
*  of light. My question is, if we would completely stop moving through space, how fast would time go
*  by? So I think that I'm going to disagree with your middle sentence there. We do not move through
*  space time at the speed of light. I don't know who said that. I'm not even sure what it meant.
*  I'm not even sure what it means. And you know, how fast does time go by? It always goes by
*  one second per second. That's the only speed at which time can possibly go by. And that's true,
*  whether you're speeding or staying still or in a gravitational field or not. There's no such thing
*  as the speed with which we move through space time. The idea of a speed is the amount of distance we
*  travel as a function of time. That's what speed is. So it just doesn't apply to going through
*  space time. It's a different kind of thing. And I'm not going to go into many details here,
*  but this is just something you have to wrap your mind around when you really get into what is meant
*  by special relativity and the interval in space time and why the twin paradox works. I will
*  recommend reading the book that I just wrote and will eventually come out like a year from now
*  that explains these things in great detail. Or failing that, you could just check out the videos,
*  the biggest ideas in the universe. Marco Tausser says, my question is, how is an electron's wave
*  function different from the electron field? Do you picture them differently in your mind?
*  Well, they are different. They're very different, in fact, but there's sort of a limit in which they
*  become kind of similar to each other. And that limit is where the field is only vibrating enough
*  to give you a single electron. And honestly, there's technicalities that arise with electrons
*  that make me reluctant to talk about that. It has to do with the difference between fermions
*  and bosons. And it's harder, although not impossible, to talk about the electron field
*  in sort of classical visualizable terms because of the exclusion principle, because you can only have
*  one fermion, like an electron, doing the same thing at the same time. It's easier to talk about
*  a bosonic field, like the photon field or the Higgs field or something like that. But the point
*  is that when you have the quantum field, which is the more fundamental thing, then you have a
*  wave function of that quantum field. And the single field can describe any number of particles,
*  right? It's not just one electron or one whatever, Higgs boson or photon. It's any collection of
*  these things can be described by the wave function of that single field. But then when you boil it
*  down, when you say, okay, I'm only going to be interested in configurations of the field or
*  wave functions of the field that represent a single particle, then there's really no,
*  the difference between the wave function of the field kind of dissolves. Not exactly. I mean,
*  certainly in the case of the electromagnetic field, it does not dissolve very well because
*  the electromagnetic field is a vector and it's real valued. It is not a complex valued scalar
*  number like the wave function is. But my point is, the only useful thing I'm trying to say here
*  is that the wave function of the field is a much bigger, grander thing. It can describe not just
*  one particle at a time, but any collection of particles, including the creation and annihilation
*  of particles. That's one of the crucial features of quantum field theory. So the single electron
*  is sort of a limit that you get. And then in that case, the distinction between the electron wave
*  functional and the electron field becomes a little bit harder to distinguish. Dan O'Neill says,
*  what are we? I like these big questions. When I think of the four dimensional space time of
*  relativity theory and how the passing of time is just an illusion, I think we must be the braided
*  world lines of all the particles that have made up our bodies over the course of our lifetimes.
*  Then when I remember the questionable status of a particle in quantum mechanics, I think we must be
*  an intricate inter-rippling of quantum wave functions. But then when I remember the problem
*  of the wave function collapse and the solution posed by many worlds, I try to picture myself as
*  a massively complex branching bush of wave functions in an unpicturably vast multiverse.
*  Ignoring immersion properties, is this what a human being is? If so, do you see it as a remarkable,
*  perhaps beautiful phenomenon even at this fundamental level? So there's one problem with
*  your question, Dan, which is you say ignoring immersion properties, is this what a human being
*  is? But a human being is a emergent property. There's no human beings in the fundamental
*  ontology of the world. If you're a modern particle physicist, you would say the fundamental
*  ontology of the world is quantum field theory. If you're even more extreme like myself, you would
*  say it's just a vector in Hilbert space, it's a single quantum wave function. But either way,
*  there's no human beings there, right? Human beings are concepts that only make sense at
*  the higher emergent level. So you can't say, tell me what a human being is, but don't talk about the
*  higher immersion level. That's just not fair. And it's also crucial to actually answering the question
*  more seriously, because as I said, in different contexts, you can always take the purely microscopic
*  point of view and just never talk about higher level emergent concepts. And this is what you
*  would do if you were a Laplace's demon, right? If you literally knew the exact micro state of the
*  universe and how it evolved over time, you wouldn't need to talk about these higher levels. You know,
*  you wouldn't need to describe the earth going around the sun as just its center of mass and
*  its center of velocity. You would talk about every single particle in the earth. Why not?
*  You have access to it all. If you have that fundamental microscopic description,
*  you can purely talk in that language. So the question of what is a human being is by its nature
*  a question about the relationship of the higher levels, including the ones that have human beings
*  as part of them to the lower levels. And there might not be a unique answer because it might
*  depend on exactly which levels you're comparing to each other. So, you know, it's perfectly okay
*  to talk about human beings in a single world at a time. You know, you can know, you can be convinced
*  that the fundamental theory of reality predicts that there are copies of you being made all the
*  time, but you can still talk about the one that is in the world that you're in right now. That's okay.
*  And you don't need to worry about all these other ones. There are certainly ones they branched off.
*  They're not you anymore, right? They are descendants of your past you, but they are not
*  related to your present you in any useful way. So I think that to correctly tackle this, I'm not
*  giving you the right answer to this question because I think it's a tricky one and probably
*  not a unique one, but to think about this question in a useful way requires taking seriously and
*  biting the bullet about these higher emergent levels. You can't really get around them.
*  Chris Murray says, near the end of the biggest ideas in the universe, Q&A number nine,
*  fields, you introduced the Riesch Leiter theorem. Can you make an educated guess as to what a person
*  on a space station would see if they looked up at the Taj Mahal being created on the moon
*  from acting on the fields somewhere on earth? So the Riesch Leiter theorem is a reflection of the
*  fact that in quantum field theory in the vacuum state, the fields in any one region of space
*  are entangled with fields everywhere else in any other region of space all throughout the universe.
*  At least if you're truly in the vacuum, which maybe you're not, and if it's just Minkowski space,
*  which we know we're not, but anyway something like that is likely to be true. And because of that,
*  because of that entanglement, you know how if you have two particles that are owned by Alice and Bob
*  and they're entangled with each other, making a measurement on one particle tells you something
*  about what the other particle is going to be doing, even if you don't know it immediately,
*  might take time for any information about what is going on to go back and forth, but something
*  happens. The difference is that in quantum field theory, even in one small region of space, you
*  don't just have a spin that is up or down. In quantum field theory, you literally have an
*  infinite number of things that could be going on in one region of space. You have fields that could
*  take on literally any value. There might be a probability that they take on certain values or
*  certain other ones if you were to observe them, and there is, but every value is represented,
*  is an infinite number of possibilities. And this is one of the reasons why I don't think quantum
*  field theory is right. That's kind of a lot to put into one tiny region of space, an infinite
*  number of possibilities. So this infinite number of possibilities is entangled with infinite numbers
*  of possibilities at every other region of every other point in the universe. So the Riesz-Schleider
*  theorem says that when you make a measurement on a region of, on the quantum fields in some region
*  of space, one possible outcome is to bring into existence somewhere else in the universe,
*  literally anything. In the Alice and Bob with spins case, by measuring your spin up or down,
*  you bring into existence the spin is either up or down, whereas it was for Bob's particle,
*  even though it wasn't a superposition. In the quantum field theory case, empty space can be
*  thought of as a superposition of all sorts of crazy things, and you don't notice it because
*  it's in the superposition that gives you a minimum energy. But in principle, there is a measurement
*  outcome that corresponds to bringing into existence a copy of the Taj Mahal on the moon.
*  That is why the Riesz-Schleider theorem is sometimes called the Taj Mahal theorem. And so the
*  question is, what would that look like? You know, the honest question is, it could look like almost
*  anything, because that's part of the theorem, right? Like, on the one hand, you bring into
*  existence the Taj Mahal on the moon. On the other hand, there are some photons that travel
*  from the Taj Mahal to you. And guess what? They could be anything, because you could bring anything
*  into existence. You know, the whole point of the theorem is you're supposed to suspend your interest
*  in the probability that any of these things actually happen. You're just proving rigorous
*  mathematical theorems about what could happen. So what could you see? Anything. Literally anything.
*  But the probability that you see anything at all is going to be very, very small. The probability
*  that the Taj Mahal exists at any, it comes into existence, is extraordinarily small. This is
*  absolutely a case where, just because something in principle could happen, I wouldn't worry about it
*  in any realistic way. Nate Wadoops says, standard sirens came up in an episode that I listened to
*  last month. What are the forces that come together to tune them to standard behavior? I mean, what,
*  why do they all act the same rather than being random sirens? So the point of standard sirens is
*  you're imagining two black holes that are coalescing, okay? Just like we observed it in LIGO or
*  whatever. The point is, in a typical LIGO event, what you don't know is the redshift, because you
*  don't have any visible light coming from them. To get a redshift, you need visible photons that
*  have spectral lines that you can ask how redshifted they are. So what you're really looking for is the
*  special subclass of events that have both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation,
*  so you can measure a redshift to them. And then the point is that you can figure out the distance,
*  if all goes well and you get enough data, in principle. In practice, this hasn't been done
*  yet, but they're working on it. The point is that you can follow the hole in spiral, right? So it's
*  not just you see a blip, you see a wave that grows over the course of a few seconds and then chirps,
*  okay? And so you see both the total amount of time it takes for that to happen and you see the
*  frequency, right? You see the space between the different peaks in the amplitude of the wave
*  and how it develops over time. So that's actually a pretty good amount of information. And from that,
*  if all goes well, you can discern the actual masses of the in-spiraling black holes. And so you can
*  predict the amplitude of those gravitational waves and therefore you compare that to the amplitude
*  you actually observe and you get the distance, okay? So the reason why there's standard is just
*  because all that's happening is gravity with two black holes. There's not a lot of degrees of
*  freedom, not a lot of weirdness, right? It's not like a star that could have different chemical
*  composition inside or being a different environment with different accretion disks or anything like
*  that. It's two black holes that have two masses. That's literally almost all the degrees of freedom.
*  It's not quite because they can be tilted and they can be spinning, so it's a little bit more
*  complicated than that. But in principle, you can work all that out. And there's certain special
*  cases where you have reason to believe that it's even simpler than that. So you can have more
*  confidence in your reconstruction of what the masses were and therefore the amplitudes and
*  therefore the distance to the thing. So really the ultimate answer is you're looking at a very
*  simple system, two black holes that are being very simple direct set of equations, the equations of
*  general relativity. Most things in the world are not that simple. It goes back to the very first
*  question in the AMA. Black holes have no hair. There's not a lot of details when it comes to
*  describing black holes. Teresa Robeson says, in your opinion, what are the couple of the most
*  indispensable science magazines for the layperson to read to keep abreast of recent scientific
*  research and advances? Yeah, I don't know. Honestly, like my science, my popular science
*  input comes actually mostly from Twitter because I follow science journalists and scientists on
*  Twitter. And when something interesting happens, they link to it. And so then I will click on it
*  and it might be wherever it is. So I don't like regularly go to the homepages of magazines or
*  subscribe to magazines. The magazines I subscribe to are like the New York Review of Books or
*  something like that, right? Like not specifically science or physics magazines. I will put in a
*  plug for two of my favorites. One of them is Ars Technica because my wife, Jennifer, writes for
*  them. So you can trust them. Absolutely. And the other of course is Quanta. Quanta magazine does a
*  very, very good job at modern physics and math and so forth. If anything, it likes math a little
*  bit too much. So if you don't think there's enough math in your popular science diet, I would
*  definitely check out Quanta. But the great thing about Quanta is they really care about the ideas.
*  They're not, it's not an excuse to write profiles of scientific heroes or things like that. It's
*  really about sometimes quite abstract ideas in math and physics. They tackle things that other
*  science outlets will not tackle. If you know the firewalls paradox, have you ever heard of the
*  firewalls paradox in black hole physics? Jennifer actually wrote an article for Quanta about that.
*  It was the first article about the firewall problem to appear in the popular media because
*  everyone else was afraid of doing it. But Quanta, but Jennifer would tackle it and Quanta would
*  publish it. So it appeared there and the New York Times came along a few months after that. And then
*  it caught on even more broadly than that. Michael Schillingford says,
*  pre-Socratic philosophers used to debate whether reality is made up of discrete things,
*  e.g. atomism or stuff like water. I've recently seen a similar argument centered around particles
*  and fields. Which ontology is correct between things and stuff or is it a defective debate?
*  Yeah, you know, I think that there's, it depends. What do you mean here? So
*  there's the question of the ultimate ontology of the world, which I've recently written a paper
*  saying it's a vector in Hilbert space. That's what I claimed that is our best current understanding
*  of it. But to get there, you know, we work through various levels of description and there's
*  absolutely on much more solid ground, a level of description, which is the quantum field theory
*  level. So I will take your question to be at that level of quantum field theory, at the best tested
*  version of fundamental physics we currently have. What is the fundamental ontology look like?
*  And unsurprisingly, given that it's called quantum field theory, it's a theory of fields,
*  but it's a theory of the quantum theory of fields, not the classical theory. Okay, let's take that.
*  But it is definitely not a theory of particles. And you know, this is a case where physicists
*  and philosophers kind of think about things differently, because philosophers think there is
*  a debate about whether or not the fundamental ontology is more particle-like or field-like,
*  and they debate it. Physicists, for the most part, know it's all fields, and they just think it's
*  fields, and it's not really much of a debate. And part of it is because the difference is
*  you start with the quantum theory of particles, and you can kind of bootstrap your way up into
*  a quantum theory of fields by insisting that the particles can be able to interact with each other
*  and annihilate and create and so forth. So many body physicists do that. Not many body physicists,
*  but many body physicists. Or you can go the other way. You can start with the theory of fields,
*  quantize it, show that you get particles out in the low energy perturbative limit. So it seems
*  like they're on an equal footing in some sense. But if you take the field perspective seriously,
*  there are non-perturbative effects. A particle is a tiny fluctuation in a quantum field,
*  and so it's an appropriate concept to think about when the field is nearly quiet. It's a tiny
*  perturbation around that quiet vacuum state. But sometimes fields do big things, collective things,
*  that are not tiny perturbations in any sense. They do non-perturbative things. Like when the Higgs
*  boson field rolls from a value of zero to its non-zero expectation value in the vacuum, that's
*  a big non-perturbative thing. That's easy to understand from the field theory perspective.
*  It's almost impossible to make sense of that if you thought the world were fundamentally made of
*  particles and not of fields. So for those reasons, particle physicists tend to think that really the
*  world is made of fields. But there could be something else underlying the whole thing, as I said.
*  Gregory Kusnik says, should parents lie to their kids about Santa Claus?
*  If they want to, I don't care. There's bigger problems in the world to worry about, for one thing,
*  but I think that there is a danger that people can fetishize always telling the truth a little
*  bit too much. I try to be a reasonable person about this. I care about the truth, but that doesn't
*  mean that there's some sort of Kantian principle that says that you should only ever tell the truth
*  and never lie, no matter what the consequences might be. If someone just got their haircut
*  and says, don't you think it looks nice? Just say it looks nice. Who cares what you actually think?
*  If they say, should I get my haircut in this way or that way and it hasn't yet happened? Then,
*  by all means, be honest. But if it's already there and they're just looking for some reassurance,
*  not really a judgment or an opinion or a helpful fact that they can use to make a decision,
*  be nice. Say the nice thing to them. Likewise, if your kid is five years old and is excited about
*  Santa Claus, tell them Santa Claus is going to come and give them presents. That's fine.
*  Most people who I know who grew up in the sort of same environment that I grew up in, we all thought
*  that Santa Claus was real when we were very, very young kids. None of us were seriously brain
*  damaged or psychologically impacted by the realization eventually that it wasn't true.
*  If you don't want to tell them that Santa Claus is real and you want to tell them the truth,
*  go ahead and tell them that too. That's also fine.
*  Nairoun Narasimhachar says, do you see a problem with basing day-to-day epistemology, ethics,
*  and other essential aspects of human life on very rigorous calculi, e.g. Bayesianism or
*  utilitarianism? While it is possible to do due diligence to these calculi in academic research,
*  implementing them in their pure form in our daily lives require impractical amounts of thought,
*  computation, and possibly knowledge. Are there philosophers who seriously work on developing
*  heuristic-only versions of such calculi? This is calculi in the sense of plural calculus,
*  by the way, in case you're wondering, that are both feasible for everyday use and robust against
*  variations in the user's backgrounds, etc. Basically, yes, I do agree with the thrust here
*  in the following sense. I think I've said this in other contexts, but I think that
*  in many ways, the fact that human beings are bounded finite beings computationally and
*  informationally circumscribed is really, really important. We don't either have the time or the
*  capacity to do perfect reasoning about anything. We will always be using heuristics, etc.
*  This fact has been put to use in psychology and things like that. For example, remember the
*  podcast with Carl Friston, who thinks about the Bayesian brain and the free energy principle.
*  The free energy principle is a way to make sense of what the brain does, thinking that it's trying
*  to be a good Bayesian reasoner, but it doesn't have perfect resources to do that. The free energy
*  principle is a shortcut to do Bayesian updating to get a picture of the world. I absolutely think
*  that in the real world, there are going to be constraints on how precise we can be and how
*  precise we can reason. Another relevant podcast episode is the one with Elizabeth Anderson,
*  where she talks about ideal theory. This is an ongoing debate right now in moral and political
*  philosophy. How useful is it to figure out how to be better morally or politically by first
*  imagining how to be perfect, what would be the ideal society, etc., and then moving in that
*  direction? That's a feasible thing to say. If we knew what the perfect society was and we know
*  what our society is now, we could say, good, let's move to make things closer to the perfect society.
*  I think that would work. What Anderson says and what other people would argue is there's no such
*  thing as the ideal theory because as the real society changes or as conditions change, you
*  might learn more or change your mind about what you want society to be. It's much more feasible
*  to talk about how we can start with where we are and make things a little bit better
*  than to start with where we are and say, well, over there is the perfect thing, let's move in
*  that direction. I think a similar thing is probably true for more everyday life kinds of things. How
*  should I choose what to do from day to day or even make big picture decisions about getting married
*  or choosing a new job or having kids or something like that? There will always be heuristics involved.
*  The short answer is I don't know of detailed philosophical investigation, but focused on
*  exactly that feature of day to day decision making. That's not to say it's not out there,
*  it might just be out there and I'm not aware of it. Emmett Francis says, any thoughts on some
*  strategies for maintaining good mental health as a graduate student or as an academic more generally?
*  From my experience as a current PhD student and from talking to other grad students, I know a lot
*  of us struggle with imposter syndrome, anxiety from the pressure to publish or perish, etc.
*  I don't know if I have great thoughts on strategies for that. I'm very sympathetic to the issue.
*  I like to say I think the graduate school should actually be fun. I mean, there's no question it
*  should be a challenge. It should be pushing you to your limits, but in a healthy and rewarding way.
*  Very few people go to graduate school in something like theoretical physics for the fame and fortune.
*  They go into it because they love the material, the topic, the subject matter. If that love is
*  squeezed out of you by being in some sort of psychological pressure cooker, then it's not doing
*  what it's supposed to be doing. There are absolutely abusive advisors and mentors and
*  lab PIs, etc. that if possible you should stay away from. This is one of the things you should
*  take very seriously when you're looking at possible graduate schools. Not only which is the most
*  intellectual powerhouse, but of the potential advisors of the places you're looking at,
*  do they treat their students well? What are the reports back from the students who are there?
*  Having said that, there are certain things that are always going to be true about the graduate
*  school experience. Not only is it hard to learn the things you need to learn to be a successful
*  PhD, but usually you enter graduate school hoping to become a professor. There are not that many
*  professor jobs. It's a very tight market and there's just nothing to be done about that.
*  There will always be more people who want those jobs than there are jobs. It's like being a concert
*  pianist or a professional basketball player. There's a lot of people who want that and the
*  competition is very stiff to do it. In some sense, as difficult as graduate school is,
*  it's a lot easier than trying to make a living as a Hollywood actor because at least graduate
*  school, postdoc, etc. is a clear-cut set of steps that you can go through and it's either up or out.
*  You succeed or it's clear you should get a job doing something else. Whereas if you're an actor,
*  a musician, etc. you can struggle for years and never know. It might be that tomorrow you get a
*  big break. It's a lot more random and a lot less structured. Hold on to that as a little
*  shining beacon of hope. Otherwise, what can I say? Other than not choosing an abusive advisor,
*  even if you choose a really nice advisor, people can still put pressure on themselves. Like you
*  say, there's imposter pressure, imposter syndrome, there's the competition to eventually get jobs
*  and things like that. I don't have good advice there. I'm really sorry because I think that
*  I care a lot about the mental health of students. I try to make my own students... If anything,
*  I don't push my students hard enough because I know that it's hard and I let them push themselves.
*  That's a tricky thing as an advisor. For one thing, by the way, you get no advice on how to
*  be an advisor. No one teaches you how to do it. It's a hard thing to do because you have a tremendous
*  impact on the future lives of your students when you're an advisor and you have no training
*  in how to do a good job at it. One of the things that's crucially important about being an advisor
*  is that different students need different kinds of advising. Some students are better if their
*  advisor is hands-off and they let them do their own thing. Others really need to be guided. Others
*  need to be constantly encouraged. Others need to be told, you know, nope, you're slacking off,
*  try to do better. It's hard to know ahead of time what the right strategy is. Even if your advisor
*  seems to be taking the wrong strategy, don't necessarily blame them because they're not
*  experts in this game either. I think that if I'm going to give one piece of advice,
*  when it's not very helpful, I know, but I'm going to give it anyway, which is to just do your best
*  not to lose sight of whatever that little bit of delight and passion and wonder it was that got you
*  into this field in the first place. If you went to grad school because you didn't know what else to do,
*  then I don't know what to tell you. But I think most people go to grad school because they're
*  really passionate about the material. They want to learn about this stuff and hopefully increase the
*  total amount of human knowledge about this stuff. That's what to keep in mind, not comparing yourself
*  to other people or worrying about the job market or whatever. Getting a PhD, whether or not you get
*  a job as a professor, ultimately down the road, is an intrinsically worthwhile endeavor. It's
*  like climbing a mountain, right? It's an obstacle there that is maybe a little artificial,
*  but there's a sense of accomplishment upon doing it. And it's better than climbing a mountain
*  because you learn something that is really useful for other purposes. I don't want to disparage
*  mountain climbers, sorry about that, but you get something out of it that is both a sense of
*  accomplishment and something a little bit more tangible. It's always the comparisons with other
*  people that get you in trouble psychologically here. I'm not good enough. I'm not going to get a job.
*  My advisor is mad at me. It's always those things that get you in trouble. The material, the learning,
*  and keep reminding yourself how much more you know now than you did two years ago. It's remarkable.
*  At any one moment from week to week, it's easy to lose track of the fact that you're learning a lot.
*  But then you look back a couple of years and you're like, boy, I didn't know anything two years ago.
*  That is a wonderful time of your life. You're really learning to go from being a student to
*  being a researcher when you're in graduate school. That's just a singularly wonderful
*  thing to get to do. So, imposter or not, don't forget to be glad that you're in this wonderful
*  position to really take advantage of the intellectual life that humanity has been able
*  to cultivate for a few of its people and not too many of them. Jeff B says, I was reading about
*  Lord Kelvin's idea that different atoms are just different types of knots in the ether. Although
*  this is obviously false, can we think of string theory as a quantized and relativized upgrade to
*  this idea or is there more to it? Well, there's definitely more to it, but maybe there's a family
*  resemblance there also. I mean, there's no ether, so that part is wrong. And they're not knots.
*  Strings are generally not knotted. They're generally either single line segments or circles.
*  They're not tied topologically interesting ways around each other. If they did, they would just
*  untie right away. So they're neither knots nor the ether. But I know what you mean. I mean,
*  they're vibrating one dimensional things and the kinds of vibrations are what specify what kind of
*  particle it is, what kind of field it is, et cetera. So that's the family resemblance. But
*  there's no direct intellectual lineage from Kelvin's idea to string theory. As you may know or may not,
*  string theory arose in a really backwards way. They were trying to understand the strong
*  interactions. Well, there's a couple of different threads that came together. People were trying to
*  understand the strong interactions. There were certain patterns in the observed particles out
*  there that particle accelerators were giving us and people were trying to fit them to different
*  functions and make predictions and so forth. And Venetiano came up with a formula that said,
*  he could predict some of these patterns of masses and spins in the observed spectrum of particles.
*  And then other people like Leonard Susskind is one of them. And from a very different angle,
*  Yoshiro Nambu was one and Goto, his collaborator, pointed out that by starting with one-dimensional
*  strings and quantizing them, you could derive this Venetiano amplitude. And they were still trying
*  to understand the strong interactions and it failed. It didn't work for the strong interactions.
*  There's a little bit of lingering remnant of it in the fact that you take two quarks and stretch
*  them apart like a one-dimensional string of gluon field stretches between them. So there's something
*  slightly stringy about the strong interactions. But what we now call string theory is a completely
*  different version of that that gives us gravity and things like that and hopefully everything else.
*  But the strong interactions come along for the ride rather than being the central point. None
*  of this has anything to do with what Kelvin was talking about. So it's at most a family resemblance
*  rather than a direct relationship. Casey Mahone says, I sense a stigma in our culture against
*  being single. I'm starting to find that I may be the kind of person that would just prefer to be
*  alone, but people seem to view this as childish. They wonder how you can really be an adult if you
*  don't have a partner to build something with. Do you sense this stigma and do you think that it is
*  justified? Well, I certainly don't think it's justified. I mean, I get what you mean. There's
*  both a deep sense and a shallow sense. The shallow sense is a lot of our society's social
*  activities are constructed around the idea of being part of a couple or a family. Go to dinner
*  with your loved one or whatever or show up at a table for two or two people hotel room or whatever
*  it is. We group society's functions around the idea that either now or someday you're going to
*  be a member of a couple. That is true. And then I think like you're hinting at, there's sort of a
*  deeper thing going on where people judge you. It's not just we've built structures to make it easy
*  to be part of a couple, but it is assumed that you want to be part of a couple. And if you're not,
*  it's because you failed in this universal goal. It's not exactly the same, but there's a close
*  analogy with the idea of being sexual versus being asexual. Remember we did a podcast with Angela
*  Chen where she talked about how difficult it is to realize that you're asexual, that you just don't
*  have that kind of relationship between love and lust that most people have. And society is not
*  built to deal with you and judges you to be bad if you don't fit in. This is what society does.
*  Society takes the fact that human beings are very diverse, looks at the most common ways that human
*  beings are and judges those to be correct and judges all the other ways to be wrong. And this
*  is a flaw in how society works, but it's hard to hope. Hopefully we're getting better at it, etc.
*  There's a lot of resistance to change along these directions. So it's certainly not justified.
*  I mean there's softer but related prejudices against not having kids, for example. It's assumed
*  you should want to have kids. That's just what you want to do. Getting married, etc. What if you're
*  in a couple and you don't get married? What if you're in a couple for the same couple for 50 years,
*  but don't get married? People will look at you funny. What can you do? Be proud of who you are
*  in your individual peculiarities rather than worrying about them. It's not the biggest kind
*  of prejudice out there in the world. So I get that you might feel like you're being judged, but
*  lots of people are being judged for different reasons. And you just got to tell society to
*  suck it up and deal with it because you are who you are and you like it that way.
*  Robert asks a priority question. If our current formulation of quantum mechanics hasn't appeared
*  to answer what happened at or before the Big Bang, the black hole firewall, and singularity
*  questions, is it better to think of the wave function as a complete description of quantum
*  mechanics or that it needs to be modified to account for these mysteries? So good. This
*  gets to the issue of quantum mechanics as a framework versus a theory. Quantum mechanics
*  is not a theory of physics. It's a framework in which you develop theories of physics.
*  Just like classical physics is not a theory all by itself. You can have the classical theory of
*  gravity, of electromagnetism, of the simple harmonic oscillator, whatever. Likewise,
*  you have the quantum theory of simple harmonic oscillator, electromagnetism, gravity, whatever.
*  You have different versions of all of these different specific theories, classical versions
*  and quantum versions. So when you struggle to understand some particular quantum mechanical
*  phenomenon, it is possible to ask, is this a case where it's not just we haven't found the right
*  model within quantum mechanics, but the quantum mechanics itself is not up to the task? Maybe.
*  In some sense, that's what Stephen Wolfram would say, if you remember our podcast with him.
*  I don't see that at all. I think that quantum mechanics, number one, there's no experimental
*  problem with it at all. In other examples of times where we've had to throw out a theory or
*  improve upon it, there's always been some experimental evidence that it wasn't quite
*  fitting. But number two, I don't think that we've tried hard enough. It seems to me to be extremely
*  premature to say, well, we haven't quantized gravity yet, therefore quantum mechanics is wrong.
*  We just haven't tried hard enough to quantize gravity, honestly. I know there's a lot of people
*  out there working on quantum gravity, but most of them are still starting from some classical
*  theory and trying to quantize it. I don't think that taking the quantumness of it seriously has
*  been tried nearly hard enough. So that's why I am not in favor of doing that. Quantum mechanics,
*  as a framework, is extremely robust and successful. And there's also the small data point that people
*  have tried to change it and failed. It's really, really hard to modify quantum mechanics in a way
*  that doesn't immediately run afoul of something you know about the world, like the speed of light
*  limit or something like that. So you're welcome to try, but there's no experimental evidence that
*  says you have to, and there's a lot of theoretical hurdles to overcome if you're going to give it a
*  shot. Anonymous says, regarding the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, is information
*  conserved in the same way that energy is conserved? Yes, in fact, precisely the same way. Namely,
*  in many worlds, both information and energy are exactly conserved in the wave function of the
*  universe. They are not exactly conserved on individual branches of the wave function where
*  observers find themselves. And this fact is very, very well known when it comes to information.
*  It is less well appreciated when it comes to energy, but I think as I mentioned earlier
*  in the AMA, it is true. Energy can vary a little bit from branch to branch of the wave function.
*  Seth says, did your discussion with Sylvia Earle on the ramifications of consuming animals
*  change your view of the morality of animal consumption? I think I might have edited this
*  badly because we were talking specifically about sea animals, right, not land animals.
*  So the short answer is no. Sylvia Earle had very meaningful and important and interesting things
*  to say about the health aspects of eating seafood, both your individual health as a person and the
*  health of the planet, right? I mean, there's the issue of overfishing and ruining the resources
*  that we have in the oceans. That's very, very important. And I think we should take that
*  seriously. And then there's the extra issue of the point she made, which is kind of very obvious
*  in retrospect, but I had never really thought about it before, that unlike if you're a meat eater
*  as a human being and you eat land animals, most of the land animals or even most of the
*  birds that we eat, so chicken, pork, beef, whatever, these are themselves vegetarians,
*  right? Herbivores. Cows eat grass and wheat and things like that, okay? They don't eat other
*  animals. We don't eat jaguars and crocodiles that much. I guess we do eat crocodiles sometimes. But
*  anyway, most of the animals that we eat for our daily diets are themselves herbivores. So when
*  chemicals that we human beings nastily or thoughtlessly put into the environment
*  go into the environment, there might be some bad poisonous chemicals that fall onto plants and then
*  the cows eat them and then we eat them, but it's relatively sparse, all things considered. Whereas
*  the fish that we eat are themselves carnivores, right? The fish we eat generally eat other fish
*  to live and those fish eat other fish, et cetera. And what happens is a focusing and a concentrating
*  effect that all the bad chemicals in the oceans are consumed by the little fishies or the plankton
*  or whatever and they keep getting consumed by bigger and bigger fish and they don't go away,
*  right? So they get concentrated in the fish that we eventually eat. So seafood can have a much higher
*  level of these toxic chemicals than our land food can. I think that was Sylvia Earle's biggest point
*  about the health aspects of eating fish. And so I think it did certainly make me think twice about
*  the health benefits of eating seafood. Because if you don't think about the toxic chemicals,
*  then seafood is thought of as a healthy thing to eat, right? Compared to bacon or hamburgers or pizza.
*  But when you do think about those chemicals, then it changes your mind a little bit. And so, yeah,
*  I think maybe it may be a little bit less eager to eat seafood and count it as a health move
*  than I otherwise would have. Okay, I'm grouping two questions together. Let's see if I can remember
*  why. Sid Huff says, you've mentioned a few times on previous AMAs that you had a distinctly non-academic
*  upbringing. Do you think it was extra difficult for you to succeed so well academically because
*  of that? Have you ever felt imposter syndrome? The sense that you don't really know enough,
*  aren't really capable enough to be where you are, that somehow you managed to fool everyone so far.
*  And Jim Murphy says, do you have any advice about developing discipline? I'm always impressed by how
*  much you were able to do without seeming exhausted at all. So yeah, I was reluctant to answer both
*  these questions because I don't like to talk about myself personally that much. I like to talk about,
*  you know, my ideas and so forth. But, you know, look, these are decent questions and maybe we can
*  help other people by talking about them together. And I especially like Jim's question about how
*  impressed he is about how I'm able to do so much without seeming exhausted at all because,
*  man, I am exhausted all the time and I'm very happy to hear that it doesn't seem that way.
*  You know, especially, yeah, I'm really good at just saying yes to requests to do things that
*  have deadlines in the future and then being in trouble when the deadlines get here and it can
*  be very exhausting. And, you know, there's a lot of things I want to do. You know, there's like so
*  many books I want to write and papers I want to write and, you know, things I want to learn that
*  I don't yet know that I could easily imagine living for another 200 years and not doing nearly
*  everything that I want to do. So there's a kind of rush to get things done in some sense. But at the
*  same time, at some point you want to enjoy life. And I'm actually not that bad at enjoying life.
*  I'm not a workaholic who sort of deprives oneself of, you know, leisure time or anything like that.
*  But then that just contributes to the fact that you're working really hard when you're not having
*  the leisure time, when you're not watching movies or basketball games or whatever it is.
*  And I'm not especially disciplined either. Like, you know, I feel like I waste some time and I'm
*  very productive at other times. I'm fortunate enough when it comes to writing or doing science
*  that, you know, I can go in bursts, right, and different people work in different ways.
*  But I'm the kind of person who can be really unproductive for long periods of time and then
*  the burst of activity and get a lot done. And, you know, so far so good, kind of good, you know.
*  Like I said, I'm not one of the world's five best physicists, so maybe it could be better if I were
*  productive all the time. But, you know, I've done okay. And I'm appreciative of the fact that other
*  people seem to appreciate some of the things that I do that makes me feel good. But as far as
*  developing discipline and having some technique or something like that, no, no, I really don't.
*  I muddle through as best I can. Like, I'm always like people who write books are always asked about
*  like their writing process, you know, like, do you wake up at 6am and meditate and then, you know,
*  write for an hour and then answer emails. And that's just not my life at all. Like every day
*  might be completely different process wise. Like I need to write when I'm inspired to write, when
*  I'm ready to write, I can't force it on some schedule or in some routine. Maybe it would be
*  better if I had a routine and did that. But I just don't. As far as Sid's question goes,
*  imposter syndrome was never the right way to say it, you know.
*  You know, I think like I'm, like I said, pretty good at physics, but not as good as the absolute
*  best people in the world. And I think that is correct syndrome. That's just, that's more or
*  less accurate. I don't feel like I'm imposter. I think that there are people who I'm better than
*  at and people who I'm worse than at. I didn't construct that sentence very well, because like
*  I said, I don't like talking about myself, but you know, I am an odd duck in some ways. You know,
*  I obviously I have a podcast. So if nothing else, that makes me very unusual in this set of all
*  theoretical physicists. And I write physics papers, which makes me very unusual in the set
*  of all podcasters, even about physics. So, you know, it's always been an awkward fit. And I've
*  never been, you know, a big non-academic family, big public high school, middle of the road,
*  Catholic university, etc. It's always been, you know, me trying to find my own ways in ways that
*  my environment didn't always train me for in the best ways. It was certainly never something
*  where this is all expected to happen. And for better or for worse, I just wanted to do things
*  in my own quirky ways. Like when I was at Chicago, I eventually got denied tenure at the University
*  of Chicago. And I'll be very honest that I worked hard and wrote papers and some of those papers
*  became super highly cited. But I didn't like devote myself to getting tenure. I didn't just say like,
*  I didn't live in fear of not getting tenure. I just thought obviously I will get tenure. What's
*  the problem? I'm doing good work. I'm writing good papers. What is the thing to worry about?
*  And in retrospect, that was pretty dumb on my part, right? But it is, you know, how I live my life. I
*  would like to do things like I would like to do them. And I've been extraordinarily fortunate
*  enough to mostly get away with it. That was one example where I didn't get away with it in a very
*  big and loud and noisy and impactful way. But otherwise, I've done okay. So I don't think it's
*  imposter syndrome. Like I've never, like I know that there are people who are better at physics
*  than I am, but I don't think that's like a psychological mistake. I think that's just true.
*  And I admire those people. I try to learn from them rather than feeling like I don't belong with
*  them because I do think I'm better than them at other things. You know, then there's probably
*  people who are better at than I am at everything. But I don't, yeah, those people, I don't want to
*  do that often. You know, I'm lucky enough that for most people, even if they're better at me at 99%
*  of the things I care about, there's one thing that I'm better at than them. Maybe it's just like
*  playing poker or I don't know, making stir fries or something. Yeah, there's got to be something,
*  right? So that's how I avoid getting too much imposter syndrome in my life.
*  Einar Venmire says, priority question. Why is the uncertainty principle not enough to explain the
*  collapse of the wave function at measurement in quantum physics? A measurement of a quantum
*  property means to amplify a phenomenon from the microscopic atomic domain to the classical domain.
*  To amplify means to add a substantial amount of energy to the microscopic domain to make it
*  noticeable in the classical domain. When adding energy to one of the superposition of quantum
*  states, the object being measured will have an uncertainty in its energy. This is determined by
*  the added energy. The uncertainty in energy will imply an uncertainty in the lifetime of the
*  superposed state through the uncertainty principle, causing the superposed state to decay quickly into
*  one state. No, so I don't think it works at all. Sorry about that, Einar, for many reasons. For one
*  thing, to amplify a microscopic quantum superposition to a macroscopic quantum
*  superposition has nothing to do with energy whatsoever. You don't need to put energy into
*  this system at all. The classic example is Schrodinger's cat, right? Where you amplify
*  the superposition of a decaying nucleus to a superposition of a cat. But the point is not that
*  you put energy into the cat. The awake cat and the asleep cat have the same amount of energy,
*  roughly speaking. It's just that they're in a macroscopically, a superposition of two macroscopically
*  different things. And that's absolutely typical of quantum mechanical superpositions. There need not
*  be some large energy difference between the two parts of the superposition. So you need not add
*  any energy at all to put things into a superposition. That's one thing. Second thing is,
*  you say at the end, you know, there's uncertainty in energy that implies an uncertainty of lifetime
*  and the superimposed state will decay quickly. But that's already assuming an answer to the
*  measurement problem. Superimposed states don't decay quickly. They evolve according to the
*  Schrodinger equation. Unless you have some theory of the measurement that then collapses the wave
*  function onto one thing or the other. That's what we call a decay. So when you observe a
*  Geiger counter click because some nucleus decayed, that is a measurement of the system that has
*  collapsed the wave function. So you need already a theory of the collapse of the wave function
*  before you can talk about that. Finally, in some very real sense, the uncertainty principle is not
*  about measurements at all. Okay, so you really, in principle, can't bootstrap your way up from the
*  uncertainty principle to a theory of the measurement problem, because the measurement problem has to do
*  with the fact that there is a set of processes under which wave functions appear to not obey
*  the Schrodinger equation. They appear to collapse, right? And so either they don't obey the Schrodinger
*  equation or they just appear not to because, as Everett would say, you're not observing the whole
*  wave function. But the uncertainty principle isn't about that. It's not about the measurement process.
*  It's about the existence of quantum states without even measuring them. Certain quantum states just
*  don't exist. There exist no quantum states where there is a perfectly, the technical way of saying
*  is you cannot be in an eigenstate, a state of perfect determination of both position and momentum
*  at the same time, because there are no states like that. And I did not use the word measurement
*  anywhere in that statement that I just made. There are consequences for measurement of the
*  uncertainty principle, obviously. That's not surprising. But it's fundamentally a statement
*  about the fact that there's a relationship between momentum and position that you that if one is
*  perfectly fixed, the other one is perfectly uncertain. That's it. Nothing to do with measurements.
*  Blake Brasher says, on a somewhat recent podcast, you mentioned that we shouldn't think of the
*  nucleus of an atom as being composed of discrete protons and neutrons, but rather as a swirling
*  mass of quarks without any distinct boundaries between the quarks. Does this mean that the
*  neutron stars are actually giant blobs of quark soup? Or is it also wrong to think of a neutron
*  star as being the same thing as an atomic nucleus? You know, this is way too down to Earth physics
*  for me to really be an expert. So I believe that the answer is yes, it does mean that neutron stars
*  are actually giant blobs of quark soup. And this is a part of the weirdness of quantum mechanics,
*  there is going to be a lowest energy wave function for a certain collection of up and down quarks
*  that is also feeling a gravity, you know, if it has enough mass to have an appreciable gravitational
*  field, such that that lowest energy state looks like a neutron star. So it's not that there's
*  individual neutrons bumping up against each other because there's a lower energy configuration
*  than that and the system will settle into that. At least that's what I think on the basis of my
*  basic physics knowledge, but I don't know nearly enough about the details of neutron stars. You
*  should ask a real neutron star person or maybe even Google it. I honestly don't know. Simon Kitt
*  says, priority question, is the discussion research of consciousness an example of strong
*  emergence? As much as I struggle with the strong emergence concept, I find it hard to have a
*  coherent picture of endeavors to understand consciousness that don't involve some top down
*  causal power. I can't imagine a race of philosophical zombies having this field of inquiry.
*  What could possibly be causing discussion research into the nature of consciousness,
*  if not consciousness itself? No, I don't think it is an example of strong emergence.
*  So, you know, you've already undermined your own question when you say I can't imagine a race of
*  philosophical zombies having this field of inquiry. Remember, by definition, zombies behave in
*  precisely the same way as non-zombies do. So every book that a non-zombie would write could also be
*  written by a zombie. Every discussion, every field of inquiry, every passionate defense of the
*  redness of red and the experience thereof would be done by a zombie just as much as it would be
*  done by a conscious person. And this is why I don't think that people who advocate the zombie
*  thought experiment really think it through for exactly this reason. But I don't think that, you
*  know, strong emergence is a slightly ill-defined concept because it's kind of defined negatively,
*  right? You say that I have a theory of small constituents making up a bigger system,
*  and I have a theory of how the small constituents behave. And if I put that theory of how the small
*  constituents behave on a computer and simulated it, what it would predict for the collection of
*  all those constituents is different from what happens when I actually physically get those
*  constituents together. In other words, it's just a statement that your theory of the small constituents
*  is insufficient, is incomplete, is not enough to say what happens when all these constituents come
*  together. That's strong emergence. As I talked about in the podcast with Philip Goff and Keith
*  Frankish, there's no room for that if your microscopic theory is the standard model of
*  particle physics. Particles behave locally in space, and they respond locally to what fields
*  are doing at the same point in space where the particles are. So there's no way within that
*  theory unless you want to change the laws of physics, which is good for you, try to do that.
*  But if you don't change the known laws of physics, strong emergence is not going to happen
*  from the level of particle physics to the level of human beings. The question you're asking is,
*  I think you put it best in the final line, what could be causing discussion and research into
*  the nature of consciousness if not consciousness itself? Well, sure, the research is being done by
*  conscious creatures. There is no school of consciousness research that is populated by
*  researchers who are not themselves conscious. That's true. But this is not something that is
*  in any way in conflict with the idea that conscious creatures are just collections of physical
*  particles obeying the laws of physics. Your brain is a thinking machine and it's thinking about
*  itself, among other things. There's a very good article recently in, where was it? I don't know,
*  but I tweeted it out. It was by Jananne Ismael, previous podcast guest. The reason why I tweeted
*  it out, not only because it was a good article, but because the headline on the article was abysmally
*  bad. The headline was something like, you know, physics is wrong. Human beings play a crucial role
*  in the cosmos. And of course, Jananne would never say something like that. And those words are nowhere
*  to be found in the actual article. What she was saying was, there is a problem, well, not a problem
*  even, but a feature of how we describe the world that needs to be taken into account the fact that
*  we are in the world. So it's a self-reference problem. It's not a problem of incompleteness of
*  the laws of physics, but it's a problem of one of these famous philosophy problems of
*  if you're able to completely predict the future, if you're a prophet, or if your Laplace is a demon.
*  But then if you know what's going to happen in the future, because you can predict it,
*  what happens if you do something else? What happens if you violate the prediction? This is always the
*  problem with time travel stories or prophet stories or whatever. And the answer is that,
*  you know, real physical systems are not completely accurate predictors about the future. They model
*  the universe and they do their best. And Jananne's point was that in that model of the universe needs
*  to be a model of you, because you can affect the universe. But your model of you is always going to
*  be crude. You don't have enough capacity to model yourself perfectly, right? I mean, this is my way,
*  now I'm translating, now I'm riffing on what Jananne said, but that's the basic point.
*  So, but that's not an obstacle to describing yourself at all. There's an obstacle to describing
*  the world perfectly given that you're in it. But we never try to describe the world perfectly. As
*  we talked about earlier in the AMA, we use heuristics, we use coarse-grained descriptions
*  of the world, and they're always going to leave wiggle room. That's why there is something that
*  is useful to call our ability to make choices and have volition and have free will in the world.
*  But there's nothing about any of that that makes you think that it would be impossible to describe
*  all that in terms of purely physical motion of matter, as far as I can see. Okay, I'm going to
*  group two questions together. James Nancarrow says, why don't we know the actual size of the
*  universe? I understand that it may be our observable universe is only what we can see,
*  and there is likely matter further away beyond our horizon. But doesn't the microwave background or
*  early universe nucleosynthesis allow some scaling of the universe's total size? That is, does the
*  proportion of primordial hydrogen and helium determine the total amount of matter? The bigger
*  the universe, the more time for cooking up more helium at the start. And then Alexander Marash says,
*  Alexander, sorry, Alexander Marash, I think you mentioned in one of the previous AMAs that the
*  universe, while obviously being super small at the beginning and during the inflationary epoch,
*  could have been infinite in size right after inflation ended. I heard Professor Alan Guth
*  saying many times that our universe could have been the size of a big marble or a baseball at
*  the end of the inflationary period. Taking this piece of information on board, did I get your point
*  wrong? More broadly, when we say that our universe could be infinite in size either right after
*  inflation or today, I get confused. Do we mean our universe, which as per Guth's opinion, was once the
*  size of a marble or some other broader reality? Okay, so there's a couple of different things
*  going on here. One is, you know, cosmologists are often sloppy when they talk about the universe.
*  You would think that they would be precise when talking about the universe. It's their job. It's
*  what they do for a living, but in fact, they're sloppy. Sometimes when you say the universe,
*  you mean the collection of everything, absolutely everything, the whole shebang, what we see, what
*  we don't see, the whole bit. Other times, we just mean our observable universe. In fact, it's probably
*  more frequent when a cosmologist talks about the universe and says, oh, there's 10 to the 88th
*  particles in the universe. They mean our observable part of the universe. They mean our
*  observable radius of the horizon that we're able to see out to. So that is the part that when we
*  say the universe at the end of inflation was the size of a marble or a baseball, that's what we're
*  talking about. We're only talking about the observable part of the universe. We're not
*  necessarily talking about the whole thing. The whole thing could be either pretty much that size
*  and maybe a little bit bigger, but not too much, or it could be infinitely big. We just don't know.
*  There are theoretical models either way, and there's zero experimental data because we can't see
*  outside our observable universe by the nature of what it means to be the observable universe.
*  So all of the things that Alan Guth was saying about the size of the universe refers to the
*  observable universe. My statement, so you said the universe was super small at the beginning and
*  during the inflationary universe, but could have been infinite in size right after inflation ended.
*  So I didn't say that, or if I did say that, I certainly didn't mean that. What I might have
*  said, what I have said sometimes is that at the moment of the Big Bang, which is a hypothetical
*  singularity, which is really just a way of saying there is no singularity. We just don't know what's
*  happening, but if you just naively trace the equations backwards, there's a singularity,
*  and that's the Big Bang. It's impossible to define the size of the universe at the Big Bang because
*  there's a singularity. It just means your equations are breaking down and you don't know what's going
*  on. But at any time after the Big Bang, the universe could have been infinitely big.
*  That's completely compatible with everything we know about general relativity. So the Big Bang
*  could be the beginning of an infinitely big universe. It doesn't need to start at some finite
*  size and expand. So it's nothing to do with inflation whatsoever. That's just a feature of
*  general relativity, that the whole universe could come into existence infinitely big when it's there.
*  That's not our observable universe, of course. Our observable universe was marble-sized or whatever
*  it was. And then for James's question, I got mixed up there in the middle of your question because
*  CMB and nucleosynthesis and things like that, all these data points we have from the early universe,
*  they are completely independent of the size of the universe. They have nothing to do with the
*  size of the universe. What they have to do is with the local density and expansion rate and temperature
*  of the universe. So the CMB and the nucleosynthesis result from microphysical processes of
*  protons and neutrons fusing or electrons being captured by nuclei, things like that,
*  right? Things that happen in points in space and they depend on the local conditions, the temperature,
*  the density, etc. But they don't know how big the universe is. The CMB and nucleosynthesis would
*  happen exactly the same way in a finite-sized universe and an infinite-sized universe with
*  the same temperature and density everywhere. Okay, Thomas Prunty says, in your podcast with David
*  Wallace, you guys had a bit of a disagreement about how to think about the low entropy of the
*  Big Bang. He said something like the early universe had as high an entropy as it could have given that
*  it was uniform and you said that uniformity is a huge constraint. I don't see why uniformity could
*  be surprising or need explanation. It seems like a very simple and sensible boundary condition. I
*  understand that it's low entropy when gravity is considered, but I don't see how that implies that
*  it's unlikely in this case. What am I missing? Well, you know, in some sense, this is all just
*  fuzzy talk. Like, you know, what should the universe be? What should be surprising? What
*  demands explanation, right? Like, who are we to say what the universe should look like or be
*  surprised by? But I don't think that the fact that something is simple... Sorry, let me go... Let me be
*  a little bit more definite than that. Simplicity is a very useful thing to keep in mind when thinking
*  about laws of physics, right? Dynamical rules that tell you how systems evolve over time or
*  something like that. We found empirically through the history of science that looking for such
*  simple rules is a very fruitful endeavor. But it's completely different in my mind to think about
*  conditions or configurations that the universe can be in. That's not something where we have any good
*  reason to think a priori that the configuration of stuff in the universe should take a simple form.
*  I don't see why that should be true, right? I do see why it should be a high entropy form,
*  and the answer is because there are more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy. If you just
*  sort of randomly consider all the different ways the universe could be, many, many, many more of
*  them are going to be high entropy than to be low entropy. So that's not to say the universe can't
*  start out with a low entropy, but it says if it does start out with a low entropy, there should
*  be some reason why. There should be some explanation. That's a clue that there's something about
*  the dynamics of the universe that you haven't figured out yet. And so when David says the
*  early universe had as high entropy as it can given that it was uniform, that's true in some sense.
*  It's not exactly true, but it's pretty darn close to being true. But that doesn't say that
*  that statement is completely independent from whether or not the fact that the early universe
*  is uniform suggests that we need to think more deeply about what was going on or should just be
*  the stopping point. I don't see why the fact that the early universe is uniform should in any sense
*  be something where we go, oh yeah, well, what else could it have been? That's a natural starting
*  point. The obvious thing to think about is, as Hugh Price likes to point out, if you imagine a
*  collapsing universe, if you run the clock backwards, a collapsing universe does not become
*  more and more uniform as it collapses. It becomes lumpier as it collapses. So that's the arrow of
*  time. It's a very, very unusual, weird, finely tuned configuration for the early universe to be so
*  uniform. Bijan Warner says, here's a question on the relationship between quantum mechanics and
*  chaos theory. To what extent does the principle of sensitive dependence on initial conditions
*  apply to quantum systems? Does this framework matter at all? Or is there something about
*  quantum systems that make this not an interesting thing to ask? This is a complicated question,
*  actually. And I'm not even an expert on it. So let me try to restrict what I say to things I'm
*  pretty sure are true. There's a whole subject called quantum chaos. And here's the reason why
*  it's a non-trivial question. Because in classical chaos, classical systems are often chaotic. Not
*  always. There are non-chaotic classical systems. But you don't need to work very hard to get a
*  classical system that is chaotic. Like you put a couple of pendulums and hang them from each other
*  and you get a chaotic motion for the triple pendulum, as it is called. But quantum systems
*  are a little bit different because the reason why classical systems can be chaotic has to do with
*  the non-linearity of the interactions between them. What I mean by that is linear is when
*  everything just depends on the variable you're looking at to the power one, right? X to the first
*  power. As soon as something depends on higher powers, you know, x squared, etc., that's non-linear.
*  And the difference is that when you have a linear system, if you perturb it a little bit,
*  it moves a little bit. And that's it. A small perturbation leads to a small difference in what
*  is happening. But when you have a non-linear system, a small perturbation can grow very rapidly.
*  And that's where you get chaos. That's where you get sensitive dependence on initial conditions,
*  because the tiny perturbation you give it can feed on itself and grow very, very quickly.
*  In classical mechanics, the fundamental equations of motion are often non-linear. In quantum mechanics,
*  the Schrodinger equation itself is linear, okay? The Schrodinger equation has a wave function as
*  its fundamental variable, and the wave function appears to the power one on both sides of the
*  Schrodinger equation. One side is the Hamiltonian, which is asking how much energy is there, and it
*  says h operating on one power of psi, the wave function. The other side is the time derivative,
*  how fast is the wave function changing, acting on one power of the wave function. So the kind of
*  evolution that is chaotic in classical systems naively doesn't appear at all in quantum
*  mechanical systems. The wave function itself does not evolve chaotically, full stop. But of course,
*  in quantum mechanics, we have a classical limit, right? And this is where it becomes a subject
*  that requires a study and papers written about it, and why there's a whole thing called quantum
*  chaos, because even though the wave function evolves linearly and non-chaotically, the classical
*  observables, the classical limit of that wave function, you know, gives rise to classical
*  mechanics. The triple pendulum that is a chaotic system is a classical limit of some quantum system,
*  right? So there has to be some classical limit of this quantum system that does behave non-linearly
*  and chaotically, okay? So there is an interesting thing to talk about, which is this relationship
*  between the underlying behavior of the wave function and the emergent classical world and
*  the emergence of non-linearities in that classical world. So I'm not going to say anything specific
*  about that, but that is an interesting intersection overlap to talk about. Okay, Andrew Vickerstaff
*  says, many recent Mindscape episodes have looked at the fallibility of human thought processes,
*  and how susceptible we all can be to bias, manipulation, and irrational ideas. Given that
*  we understand this problem today much more than we did, say, 20 years ago, and given the exponential
*  growth and misinformation the average person is now exposed to, do you think that the jury system
*  in its current form is still a fair way to decide criminal trials? In particular, do you have any
*  thoughts on the jury selection process in America and whether or not it helps or hinders the justice
*  system? That's an interesting thing to put together. The jury system that came out
*  hundreds of years ago, it was thought to be important that people were tried by a jury of
*  their peers. Now, there's well-known issues there because only property-owning white men were
*  considered people at the time in terms of who got to vote and who got to serve on the juries and all
*  that stuff. But nevertheless, the idea was that it was a participatory part of the democratic process
*  that deciding guilt or innocence should not be led to a professional elite, but should involve
*  the participation of the common people. In part, a reflection of going way back to ancient Greece,
*  you know, in Socrates' trial, everyone in Athens who wanted to be part of the jury could be part,
*  they all came and they all voted if they wanted to. We don't do it quite that badly. But by the way,
*  for those of you who are not in the US, in the US there is a right to trial by jury. We say there's
*  a right to trial by jury. In fact, it's only for sufficiently serious crimes. If you get a parking
*  ticket, you do not have a right to trial by jury for that. But just because there's a right doesn't
*  mean people take it. In fact, jury trials are a tiny percentage of all of the legal actions going
*  on in the legal system at any one point. You know, sort of the big ticket corporate legal procedures
*  don't even go to trial, right? I mean, you can sue somebody, but they're usually just settled out of
*  court after it becomes clear who will win at court. And even in criminal defense situations, you can
*  easily just have a judge trial. You don't need to have a jury trial. It's something that the
*  defendant can request under appropriate circumstances. So juries are not a big part
*  of the criminal justice system overall. I certainly appreciate the problems with the fact that
*  people who appear on a jury are not going to be experts, right? They're chosen specifically
*  not to be experts. But I think that, and I'm not an expert on this, but here's my feeling,
*  and then real experts can let us know. There's both good and bad aspects of that. I mean,
*  one aspect that is good is just the fact that it is participation. Just the fact that it's a reminder
*  to the people on the jury that they play a role in the government. That the act of governing their
*  country, including judging people's guilt or innocence in a court of law, is not purely the
*  domain of some distant elites. It is something that everyday citizens have some role in doing.
*  There's some civic virtue kind of aspect to it that way. And then from the other side,
*  from the point of view of the defendants, etc., I think it's the case that usually juries take
*  their jobs pretty seriously, right? It's an interesting phenomenon. I talked about this
*  with Astra Taylor when she was on the podcast, the political system called sortition, where it's
*  government, or if not the whole government, at least certain decisions being made, not even by
*  voting, but by just a random selection of people are chosen to sit and think about an issue. So not
*  the guilt or innocence of some criminal defendant, but a law, right? Should this be a law or not? So
*  sortition says we're going to pick some random representatives from the population, let them
*  sit and think about it. And what you find is that when people are put into that situation, they
*  usually take it really seriously. That doesn't mean they're good at it necessarily. They still
*  have their own biases, etc. We're not always very good at making sure that all of the representative
*  voices are heard on juries and things like that. But there are some surprisingly uplifting features
*  of that kind of situation. So clearly juries do the wrong thing sometimes. That's absolutely true,
*  100%. But I'm not at all convinced, I don't know enough to have any strong feelings about,
*  but certainly I'm not at all convinced that we would have a better system overall if we didn't
*  have juries. Like judges and lawyers can be bad too, right? Even though they are professionals. So
*  I would need to see actual data-based, evidence-based studies that are trying to
*  be very fair about whether or not juries overall make things worse or better. I really don't know.
*  Brandon Lewis says, do you imagine that you will use quantum computing in your research once they
*  become available to you and mature enough to be useful? And if so, what kinds of problems would
*  they help you to solve? Probably not is the short answer. The research that I do is very pencil and
*  paper. I do some minor computer simulations, like in the paper I wrote with Ashmeet Singh,
*  on dividing up quantum systems into subsystems. We did a little example, a little toy example
*  with some simple harmonic oscillators and we put it on a computer and simulated it.
*  In principle, on a quantum computer that would be way more efficient. That's what quantum computers
*  are really good at, is simulating quantum systems. In that sense, some of my research projects would
*  be good fits for quantum computation. But I'm a little skeptical that you're going to get
*  very powerful quantum computers like that, at least in an affordable way, anytime soon.
*  By which I mean, like my research career. I'm a little skeptical that we're going to build up
*  a lot of qubits and have just so much capacity that people are going to have quantum laptops
*  or something like that. I'm not at the level of using supercomputers even right now. So I
*  don't think that we'll ever get to the level of needing a quantum computer for my research,
*  more than people who are really doing quantum field theory, simulating on a quantum computer,
*  or chemistry on a quantum computer. Those are the kinds of things that would be
*  higher priority than little old me. Peter B says a priority question. You've discussed before how
*  the many worlds of quantum mechanics may be just the other side of the same coin as the cosmological
*  multiverse. I'm still struggling to understand this idea. I can understand how I am in a super
*  position with other versions of me in the quantum multiverse, but how can I be in a super position
*  with other versions of me trillions of light years away? Or are you saying that these types
*  of multiverses redundantly contain the same set of events, but they're still distinct from each other?
*  Well, this is a subtle thing. So I guess I've discussed it before, but probably not very often
*  because it is a very subtle thing. I have a blog post about it that goes into more detail.
*  This was an idea that, however many years ago, before these two papers came out, two papers
*  came out, one by Yasunori Nomura and the other by Rafael Busso and Lenny Suskind.
*  They both were on long very similar lines, drawing a connection between the cosmological multiverse
*  and the many worlds of quantum mechanics. Before that, if you would ask me, I would say, no,
*  they're obviously very, very different. They have nothing to do with each other. But the
*  missing ingredient, which is highly non-trivial, is the idea of horizon complementarity, which is
*  a little complicated, but this is a priority question. So it was good that you put priority
*  question in here because otherwise I might have skipped over it because this is complicated to
*  explain. But the idea is the following. Due to Suskind and some of his collaborators, first in
*  the context of black holes, they were trying to understand the black hole information loss puzzle.
*  And there's certain features of classical black hole physics that are a little bit puzzling,
*  not super puzzling, but a little bit counterintuitive at face value. If you throw something into a black
*  hole, right? You know, the famous thing to say for the information loss puzzle is throw a book
*  into a black hole. The information falls in, it disappears. Classically, that would be fine,
*  but quantum mechanically, it evaporates away. How does the information get out? But we all know,
*  because there is something called gravitational time dilation, that from the point of view of
*  the outside observer, at least in some approximation where the book does not have its own mass or
*  something like that, but the book, you don't see the book disappear past the event horizon, right?
*  What you see is the book move more and more slowly as it comes close to the event horizon.
*  The book doesn't feel that way. If you were writing the book, if you fell in with the book,
*  you would just pass right through the event horizon. But from the point of view of an outside
*  observer, it just seems to slow down and approach, creep up closer and closer to it. So Suskind and
*  friends said, well, maybe there's like a souped up quantum version of this, which says that there's
*  one thing that is going on in the world, but there are two different ways of talking about it that
*  depend on which observer you are. There's the observer that falls in and everything is just
*  perfectly normal. And to the observer far away, all of what falls into the black hole, all the
*  information that falls into the black hole is somehow stuck on the horizon. Okay. And this is
*  an incompatible picture, but that's why it's called complementarity because you get to choose.
*  You can't describe it both ways at the same time. You can either describe it from the point of view
*  of the infalling observer or the distant observer, but not both. Okay. There's a version of this idea
*  that works for cosmology. If you're in an accelerating universe, like we're in, right?
*  Then you have a horizon around you. That horizon approaches a fixed size. And so the horizon
*  complementarity view of cosmology would be that there is no outside universe.
*  This is kind of a, there's different versions of this idea. I'm telling you the most radical
*  hardcore version. Okay. The most radical version is there's the universe we see from inside and
*  what you and I think of as the external universe, all of its information is just on our horizon.
*  There's nothing more to it than that. Okay. But that includes everything that you might
*  have been tempted to say is outside our observable universe. It's all just encoded on our horizon.
*  And that's a finite amount of information that you need that would ever be relevant to describing
*  the outside world. Okay. What does that have to do with many worlds and the multiverse? Well,
*  it would seem that taking that idea at face value rules out the multiverse, right? You're saying that
*  there is no universe extending infinitely far away. There's just our horizon. But now remember,
*  there's the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. And in these cosmological theories of
*  the multiverse, what you're imagining is there are quantum mechanical transitions between different
*  vacuum states that would look like different local laws of physics. So much like a decaying nucleus,
*  or let's say just pick an individual neutron out there in space. A neutron can decay, we say,
*  into a proton and electron and anti-neutrino. In a correct many worlds version of that story,
*  we say that the neutron wave function evolves into a superposition of a neutron plus proton,
*  electron and anti-neutrino. In a very similar way, the universe evolves into a superposition of
*  our vacuum state plus other vacuum states. And in all of them, according to this version of the story,
*  there's a horizon and the horizon has a certain size and that's the whole universe.
*  So what this theory says is that the cosmological multiverse still exists in the presence of horizon
*  complementarity, but it exists because of the many different branches of the wave function.
*  All the different parts of the universe where there's different local laws of physics are sitting
*  on top of each other at the same point in space in some ill-defined sense, but all the branches of
*  the wave function describe individually finite sized cosmological horizon-sized patches.
*  That's the story. So you can sort of instantiate the cosmological multiverse in one patch of
*  space-time by evoking the many worlds of quantum mechanics. That's the idea. Is the idea right?
*  We don't know. We have no idea. This is doing our best to draw conclusions from sketchy
*  assumptions about how both gravity and quantum mechanics work. So it's possible,
*  but I couldn't tell you whether it's right or not.
*  Matt Hickman asks a priority question to it. Can I have another priority question, please?
*  Nope, you can't. That's the whole idea of the priority question. You only get one. So you should
*  use it wisely or you should have used it wisely, however you want to parse that.
*  Rebecca Lashua says, you've mentioned in the past that if you weren't a theoretical physicist,
*  you would consider being a theoretical computer scientist. Are there any particular results in
*  the theory of computation that you find interesting or aesthetically pleasing?
*  It's very vague because I'm not a theoretical computer scientist, but I find fascinating
*  the restrictions on computability and computation. As we discussed before in the AMA,
*  all of the structure that comes to life because of our boundedness and finitude.
*  This has to do with emergence and things like that that I am working on.
*  In John Conway's Game of Life, the famous cellular automata with the black and white
*  squares on the checkerboard, there's a sense of emergence in that game. Because
*  there are structures like gliders and glider guns that you can talk about as individual
*  phenomena without specifying the specific details of every little black and white square.
*  In some sense, theoretical computer science has something to do with artificial worlds.
*  You can study general principles of dynamics or emergence or things like that in the context of
*  these artificial worlds and then worry later about applying it to our world. As a physicist,
*  I kind of got to worry about our world. That's my job. But as a theoretical computer scientist,
*  you are less constrained. I think that's the kind of thing I'd be interested in. But who knows?
*  Maybe I would be doing artificial intelligence or something like that. It's a whole brand new
*  world that we're inventing in that whole field. So many, many interesting questions out there.
*  Peter C. Harris says, Do you have any thoughts about the 1619 project and the New York Times
*  decision to endorse it? My understanding is that the person leading the project is a brilliant
*  journalist, but not a historian. An historian? Peter correctly wrote, sorry, I mispronounced it.
*  And that many historians, including African American ones, say the project contains significant
*  historical errors. Isn't this roughly analogous to a science journalist creating a project that
*  endorses the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and having the idea of quantum
*  mechanics and having that project endorsed by the Times, even though credible rival interpretations
*  such as many worlds exist? Should a newspaper record even be making such endorsements?
*  I think the short answer, I try to give the short answer to long questions first. So the short
*  answer is no. I don't quite agree with where you're going here. And I don't even think that it's
*  correct to formulate it as saying the New York Times has endorsed this. The New York Times
*  published the 1619 project just like it publishes op-ed pieces and book reviews and news articles
*  and a whole bunch of other things that it published. And certainly it rose to the level of being
*  publishable in the New York Times. But I think that the framing is a little bit off, I would say,
*  at least my opinion versus your opinion, I would frame it a little bit differently.
*  The 1619 project made a lot of claims and some of them were mistakes.
*  That's not surprising to me at all. You know, any big project, I've written books, you know,
*  as someone who writes books, a couple of mistakes will creep into those. That is by itself not
*  really determinant of anything at all. I do think there's a slightly more pointed critique you could
*  make that maybe some of the mistakes they made were, you know, the direction of the mistake was
*  influenced by an underlying political perspective that they had. I think that's a better criticism
*  to make that they, you know, erred. There were systematic errors and not just random ones,
*  let's put it that way. And that's okay. It's a perfectly good criticism. But to me, that criticism
*  completely pales in comparison to what they're trying to do to the bigger picture point of view
*  of what they're trying to do. Look, any society, any country, any nation, tell stories about itself.
*  History is a set of stories that we choose to tell. The number of facts about the past that
*  we could potentially write down is infinitely big. The whole thing about history is we pick
*  some of those facts to focus on and to tell as stories and to relate to ourselves. And
*  unsurprisingly, countries, nations tend to tell more or less flattering stories about themselves.
*  They tend to gloss over the parts that are a little bit less flattering, right? Like Japan
*  doesn't really like to talk about what happened in Manchuria at the beginning of World War II.
*  They don't really like to talk about that, right? France, you know, I have friends who are French
*  who really are genuinely puzzled about why other people from European nations don't like Napoleon.
*  I mean, after all, Napoleon just brought civilization to them and the rule of law,
*  shouldn't they be thankful to Napoleon? British people are genuinely puzzled that people around
*  the world mind that they were colonized. Again, you know, weren't they just bringing
*  peace and love to them? They don't get it. Because we tell these stories about ourselves that,
*  you know, in China, any any idea about Tiananmen Square has been scrubbed clean, right?
*  And the United States is no different than that. The United States tends to, in its sort of history
*  lessons, etc., teach a sanitized version of the real history. You know, there's plenty of examples.
*  The Trail of Tears is a terrible, awful incident in United States history, which is not put front
*  and center. Certainly when I was in high school, maybe it's different now. Maybe a more well-known
*  example is the controversies over Columbus Day, right? By any even halfway objective judgment,
*  Christopher Columbus was a terrible, terrible person. I mean, he was a genocidal, rapist,
*  racist maniac. And he also, you know, had some ships that, you know, traveled across the ocean.
*  I mean, even his Spanish sponsors got completely tired of him by the end of it. But no objective
*  historical account of what Columbus did would paint him as a hero. But, you know, there's a story in
*  the United States that, you know, discovered America, and, you know, we brought civilization
*  to it. And this is not, you know, just from hundreds of years ago. I remember when I was
*  growing up, we had Schoolhouse Rock, which was great, mostly. Schoolhouse Rock were these little
*  cartoons you would watch on Saturday mornings that would teach you about different educational
*  things, sometimes about grammar or science, but sometimes about history. And there was one called
*  Elbow Room, about how, you know, when the colonists came from Europe to the United States,
*  they needed elbow room, they needed space. So they basically spread across the country,
*  and everyone was happy. That's a story that we're telling that leaves out certain aspects of the
*  story, namely, like all the indigenous people who were killed, right, and their cultures wiped out
*  in the process of that expansion across the continent. And the idea of slavery and its role
*  in the whole history of the United States is one that absolutely we don't always face up to in the
*  United States. And so the goal of the 1619 project was to put slavery front and center
*  as an aspect of what was being thought about at the founding of the United States. And did they
*  go too far sometimes? Did they over emphasize the role of slavery and, you know, why the
*  American colonies chose to declare their independence from Britain and so forth?
*  Maybe, very plausibly, I'm not a political expert there. But look, the point is,
*  it's them versus the world. You know, it's not like they're the only history of the United States
*  has ever been written. They're going up against every other single history of the United States,
*  where the role of slavery has been under emphasized. You need a correction in these
*  situations. And so good for them for moving in that direction. You know, I think that this is part of
*  being honest, being factual and evidence based is that you have to look at your potential biases.
*  And this goes for countries just as well as it goes for individuals. You want to tell a story of
*  your past that makes you look good, right? And this again, for societies as well as for individuals.
*  And the United States has been just really, really, it's consistently failed to examine the role of
*  slavery in the history of the United States. You know, we talked about the Civil War. Plenty of
*  people in the South still think, you know, that the Confederacy was virtuous in one way or another.
*  And they try to tell themselves stories about how it really wasn't about slavery and things like that.
*  And so, you know, I am perfectly willing to criticize factual mistakes that are made by
*  the 1619 Project or anywhere else. But the project is well worth taking seriously. You know, we need
*  to examine our flaws. And again, this is part of being honest and truthful and factually based. We
*  need to be able to face up to the parts of our history personally and nationally and humanly
*  that make us the least comfortable. That's not always an easy thing to do, but, you know,
*  I applaud them for pushing us in that direction. Paul Cousin says, the last episode with Ty Deney
*  Bradley was fascinating. In it, you discussed the philosophical question of whether it could be
*  conceivable to find all of the semantics and the statistics of the words alone. Would it make the
*  idea more realistic if we include in these statistics all the sensory inputs that humans
*  receive from the world while experiencing words, in which case a machine will be strongly limited
*  in its abilities to understand language unless we provide contextual sensory information as well in
*  the data set? What do you think? Again, this is something where I don't have thoughts that
*  are necessarily very expert level. Okay. This is the kind of question that people take very,
*  very seriously in AI, robotics, language studies, linguistics, etc. Semantics, semiotics,
*  so, but let me just say that, you know, maybe in principle you would get a different
*  view of the role of language and how it was used if you coupled it to observations of the outside
*  world. So you look at not only what words are being said, but in what context those words are
*  said. What is going on in the world around you? What data you have in front of you when you say
*  those words? Sure. I mean, that's more data, right? So it gives you a better view of the world,
*  but it also sort of pulls the rug out from underneath the dramatic claim that is being
*  made, which in some sense, there's a claim being made, which is that you don't really need that
*  extra information. And that claim could be true or false. But the idea is that there is enough
*  information just in the relationships between words and how they appear,
*  that it greatly constrains the possible meanings of those words, even if you don't know what the
*  person is looking at or talking about or whatever. So yeah, you might be able to get even better
*  understanding by adding more stuff in. But the question is, can you get a really, really good
*  understanding without it? I think that is the issue that is trying to be addressed by this research.
*  And again, the answer might be yes or no, or yes sometimes and no other times, but that's what
*  they're trying to do. Naiv Alam says, which genre of music do you consider to be your favorite? Do
*  you have any interest in opera, say by Wagner, Strauss or Mozart? So I'm pretty ecumenical in my
*  musical taste. I like music overall. I like all sorts of different kinds of music. But
*  classical music is something where I'm not an expert. I know that there are layers there that
*  I am not sufficiently discerning or familiar enough to really talk about or judge in any reliable way.
*  I'm very happy to go to the opera and enjoy it, but I'm not going to claim to be appreciating
*  the nuances that a real expert would be able to experience. Somewhere between jazz and classic
*  rock are my favorite genres of music. I grew up in the 70s, I guess, my formative musical years,
*  70s, early 80s. And I like the music of the 60s and the early 70s and in popular music wise.
*  That's my bread and butter. And then later on, I discovered jazz and would go to jazz clubs. And I
*  really do love jazz, probably maybe a little bit more even than rock and roll. But everyone from
*  Mingus to Thelonious Monk to a whole bunch of people, there's a reason why I went to Marcellus
*  as one of my first podcast guests. But I'm not very judgy about music. I'm not
*  it would be weird since I'm not even a moral realist for me to be an aesthetic realist.
*  I don't think there is a fact of the matter about what music is good and what music is bad. Music is
*  what moves you. Well, what matters about music to me is what moves you personally. You can like and
*  enjoy the simplest, dumbest bubblegum pop music as far as I'm concerned. I do not think any less
*  of you for that. I don't think it's wrong to like that. If it brings you pleasure, then that's great.
*  Special accomplishment in liking the weirdest, most challenging music like it's good if you like it,
*  that's cool. But doesn't make you better than anybody else. You know, liking John Cage is not
*  intrinsically superior to liking Britney Spears or whatever it is, whatever comparison you want to do.
*  Alex Borland says, Do you have any favorite restaurants in Boston, especially in Chinatown?
*  So you know, I debated whether to answer this question, because the answer is no, I don't,
*  I don't have any really super favorite ones. Like, but I wanted to just remark on the fact that,
*  you know, I look, I love Boston, it's where I'm spending some time here. And I spent
*  eight years of my life here living here. The restaurant scene, man, it's just not,
*  it's just not up to stuff. Sorry. You know, before this, the two cities I lived in,
*  or in between when I was here for grad school and postdoc. And now, the two cities I lived in the
*  longest were Chicago and Los Angeles, both of which in their ways are amazing food towns.
*  Weirdly, Chicago is great for fine dining, you know, for like three star Michelin star restaurants
*  kind of things. Alinea, which is arguably one of the world's greatest restaurants is there.
*  And there's plenty of other restaurants sort of in that stratosphere for, you know,
*  getting dressed up a little bit, spending a lot of money. Chicago is just amazingly good. And it's
*  not even a lot of money, to be honest, like there are cities that are a lot more expensive than that.
*  Whereas Los Angeles, the sort of street food, ethnic food, you know, variety of different
*  cuisines and different mixtures is unprecedented in my experience. And of course, there's other
*  cities, you know, New York and San Francisco and whatever that have amazing food scenes and in
*  their own ways, New Orleans and Austin or other places around the US. And Boston is fine. It's
*  okay. But you look, I live in Chinatown right now from where I live for a couple months. And,
*  you know, I'm surrounded by dumplings, so many dumplings, so many hot pot restaurants,
*  a few noodle restaurants, and they're fine. There's a little bit of variety. There's a
*  Malaysian place that is the of the ones I've sampled. This Malaysian place is definitely the
*  best. But it's not like transcendent. We good, right? It's not like you're going to get in the
*  San Gabriel Valley. And if you're in Los Angeles, probably the I've been to a couple of fine dining
*  restaurants here in Boston, and they were fine, you know, but not as good as you get in Las Vegas.
*  Vegas, you get really good fine dining, much less Chicago or New York. And, you know, I probably the
*  single best restaurant experience I had was a place called Ruka near Chinatown near downtown
*  crossing, which is sort of like a it belongs in Vegas. Maybe it has an outpost in Vegas. It's like
*  a hip Japanese slash Peruvian fusion place. And that's the kind of, you know, recipe for disaster
*  if you do it badly, but they really do it well, like the cold sesame noodles. And the roles that
*  they had were really, really top notch. I got to give Ruka some kudos there or UKA if you're near
*  Chinatown in Boston. Justin Bailey says, What do you think is this is the most credible explanation
*  for why we experience a single reality in a branching universe? So I think this is one of
*  those like sneakily difficult but really fascinating questions actually, you know, if you so I'm more
*  hardcore about quantum mechanics and many worlds than even most other many worlds people are then
*  like more than David Wallace's in the sense that I think that the ultimate way to think about reality
*  is a pure quantum vector, not something that sort of is based on some pre existing classical precursor
*  theory. So to me, the there's work to be done in explaining why the world looks classical at all,
*  more work than for most people who sort of presume some classical superstructure
*  hidden in how they define the correct theory of the world, like they put in space and fields or
*  particles or whatever, I think that all those have to emerge somehow from the wave function. So
*  it's a tricky question, why we experience a single reality. So first you have to say,
*  why I mean, there's different levels to this question. One is,
*  how is it that a classical looking world can emerge from a quantum mechanical underlying
*  structure? And I think that there seems to be a lot of prerequisites to that, you know, the
*  underlying quantum structure has a lot of properties that are necessary to allow for
*  a classical limit to exist. So when you say single reality, sorry, let me back up, there's
*  too many things going on here with this question. So let me let me finish that thought I was making.
*  Only certain quantum theories will have classical limits at all. Okay, that is one fact, and we're
*  still trying to investigate that and understand it better. The other which I should have said first
*  is that the word we is sneakily important in this question you ask, why we experience a single
*  reality. Okay. So, you know, again, if you were the quantum version of Laplace's demon, you can
*  just talk about the wave function of the universe, you wouldn't need to talk about branches or
*  anything like that. But Everett's insight is that when the branching happens, what occurs on one
*  branch has no effect whatsoever on what occurs on other branches. So that is a subset of a sort of
*  deeper principle. And I'm not sure what that deeper principle is. This is why I think this is good
*  research level question to ask. How given some big theory of everything, do you divide it up
*  into subsets which interact with each other in some interesting ways so that they would count
*  amongst themselves as a separate world? Okay. We have examples, you know, in the case of many
*  worlds when there's decoherence, it's pretty clear, you can sort of point to the reasons why
*  things that happen on one branch of the wave function will not affect things that happen on
*  another branch. In the cosmological multiverse, it's also clear because in forget about all the
*  craziness we just talked about about horizons and complementarity and things like that in the naive
*  picture of the cosmological multiverse, where something is just trillions of light years away,
*  you can't get to it. So that's a pretty straightforward reason why you can't interact
*  with it. And therefore, you're part of a separate universe self contained kind of universe. But the
*  general theory of that, I don't know, I don't know what the general statements are about when to divide
*  things up into different universes, which you would call like, I cannot treat myself and the
*  table in front of me as part of two different universes, because I can easily interact with it
*  and the fact that Nick can affect me, right. But I don't know the general theory of that. So that's
*  point zero point one is the way that individual branches of a quantum wave function become
*  separate worlds in this sense is by being classical is by being well approximated by
*  the rules of classical mechanics, right, like we got along for hundreds of years in human history,
*  describing the world's the world with the rules of classical mechanics pretty well, right, we
*  didn't need to know quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics imposes itself in unavoidable ways only
*  when we get down to the level of individual particles or atoms, right. Why is that, you know,
*  why are there classical limits to the world? And why do we need there to be classical limits to call
*  it a single world? Okay. And then finally, so there's the question of given a quantum theory,
*  how do you get a classical limit out of it that you would call a single world, then there's a very
*  deep question of why does the quantum theory of our universe have the properties that are required
*  to give you a classical limit at all? Why are we allowed to have a classical limit? I don't know
*  that one either, right? That's another set of rules that we don't have written down yet. So all
*  this is very difficult to answer stuff. So the vague answer to your question is there is some
*  feature of the real world that is fundamentally quantum mechanical, but is amenable to an emergent
*  higher level description as a series of parallel classical approximations. Why that's true, or
*  under what conditions it could be true, are things that we don't really know very well.
*  Josh Charles says, when thinking about the far-flung future, do we have an idea of how much
*  matter would escape going through the process of entering a black hole and being radiated back out?
*  So I think what you mean is if you just let the universe evolve for a long time,
*  some matter is going to fall into black holes and then be radiated away eventually, and some
*  maybe won't. You know, I'm sure this is a very answerable question if you really sat down and
*  thought about it very carefully. You know, there have been papers written by Fred Adams and Greg
*  Laughlin about exactly these kinds of questions about the ultra long-term fate of the universe,
*  and I think the question is that most matter falls into black holes if you wait long enough.
*  Some matter was just like flung out into the space in between the black holes, but you know,
*  our galaxy, for example, most particles in our galaxy are gravitationally bound to the galaxy,
*  right? They're not just passing through on hyperbolic orbits. And what that means is if
*  you wait long enough, they will spiral into the black hole at the center. Now you have to wait a
*  very, very long time, and the spiraling in is caused both by mixing between different parts of
*  the stars and gas and dust in the galaxy, by the emission of gravitational waves, by just cooling
*  off and emitting photons, by a whole bunch of different things. Plenty of things won't fall
*  into black holes. Plenty of photons will never fall into black holes, but I think most of the
*  actual massive particles in the universe will eventually get there. That's my belief.
*  Don't ask me to do a calculation to test it. Zach McKinney says, how do you see differences
*  in seemingly esoteric, philosophical, and metaphysical questions such as the nature of
*  consciousness or free will, translating into concrete and consequential differences in how
*  people approach real world problems and conflicts? Well, you know, they do and they don't, you know.
*  I think some do and some don't. I think there's an obvious way in which these deep philosophical,
*  esoteric questions do have an effect on real world outcomes, namely metaethics.
*  Okay, so we have ethics, which is your view of what is right and what is wrong.
*  We have metaethics, which is how you justify your view of what is right and what is wrong. So if you
*  say, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, that is an ethical precept. If you say,
*  there are universal rules that everyone should follow, that is a metaethical precept. And then
*  the do unto others is the ethical, the actual rule that you say everyone should follow. Or if you
*  should, if you say, you should be consequentialist, that's a metaethical precept. And then if you say,
*  here are the consequences that matter and here's how you add them up, that is a specific, specific
*  ethical way of doing things. So here's a metaethical perspective. Do what God tells you to do.
*  And I think if you have that metaethical perspective, which many people in the world
*  do, by the way, you might end up with different ethics than people do who are more naturalist
*  about it. Theism versus naturalism is a really important philosophical question with very obvious
*  practical real world consequences. I've used this argument with friends before that, you know,
*  because a lot of physicists and philosophers, they tend to be atheists, right? They tend to not be
*  theists. They tend to be naturalists. Not all of them. There's obviously many
*  counterexamples, but many, most are atheists, but they don't talk about it a lot. You know, they don't
*  draw a line from their scientific or philosophical viewpoints to a public declaration of
*  atheism or naturalism. And I, you know, I try to say that, look, what we do for a living as theoretical
*  physicists or philosophers or whatever, this is sort of the implicit issue in your question from
*  Zach. It doesn't have a lot of impact on people's everyday lives, right? You know, you know, whether
*  or not it's Bohmian mechanics or Everettian quantum mechanics, right? You know, you can go
*  through your life pretty much okay. But the one example where it does have an impact is in whether
*  God exists. That has a big difference. And then, so that's, and you can sort of fill in the gaps,
*  fill in the details about how that might affect people's behavior in the real world. And then also,
*  you know, even if you specialize to people who are naturalists, I don't think that naturalists
*  have done a good job of telling people how to live. Or if you don't want to be quite so prescriptive,
*  of suggesting ways that we can find meaning and purpose in our lives, even without God.
*  There's some cliches that we bandy about. But really, when you get right down to it,
*  it's not quite as convincing and full of a story. And it could be and should be. But, you know,
*  we're still, we've abandoned these sort of underlying philosophical justifications
*  for a lot of the choices and modes of life that we've had throughout human history,
*  without actually changing the modes, because we haven't really thought through what the
*  implications should be of this new view, the fundamental nature of reality. Look, again,
*  you know, I'm quoting a lot of old podcasts here, but go back to the very first week of
*  podcasts I did. And I talked to Anthony Pinn, who is an atheist theologian at Rice University.
*  And also, he's black, and he cares a lot about how the black community is very religious. And
*  he thinks that they should be more atheist, but he gets why they're not. And he says, look,
*  you know, you have that black people get something out of going to church, out of being part of a
*  religious community. And you can't just tell them that the force of reason is against their
*  belief system. You have to give them a soft landing. You have to tell them how they can live just as
*  fulfilled and rewarding a life without that religious superstructure. And you haven't, he says,
*  you atheists, who includes himself and myself among them, you haven't done that. So I think that,
*  even within naturalism or atheism, there's still a lot of work to be done in doing exactly what you
*  are asking about. What are the everyday consequences of this view of the world? I mean,
*  how in the world can you imagine changing your completely deepest fundamental nature of reality
*  without any consequences for how you live your everyday life? Surely there must be there.
*  We haven't done a great job of explaining what those differences are. All right. And the very
*  last question from Sam Buck is now for something completely different. What's your favorite kind
*  of sandwich? And so I'm going to, you know, I helped myself to a few flattering questions earlier.
*  Actually, I started with an insulting question, right about the professor telling me that it was
*  pop philosophy. But then there were some flattering questions about how is discipline and things like
*  that. So I wanted to end with a self deprecating question, because I do not have a sophisticated
*  theories of sandwiches. I think that's too bad. You know, maybe I should have a sophisticated
*  theory of sandwiches, but like my favorite sandwiches are kind of the down to earth,
*  everyday sandwiches, like a good tuna melt. I like there's of course, the famous question
*  about whether hot dogs or sandwiches, right. But if they were, if you I don't have a strong feeling
*  about whether hot dogs or sandwiches, but if they were sandwiches, they would absolutely be
*  some of my favorites, like a really good hot dog. I know a lot of people have never had good hot
*  dogs before that is part of the Chicago culinary scene is their hot dogs. Like again, you know,
*  the East Coast as much as I love it, and I grew up here, you know, in Boston or in New York,
*  for that matter, the street level food is whoof, like, you know, the hot dogs just sitting there
*  in the lukewarm water, or the pizzas that they make in the morning, and then the pizzas sit there
*  cold for hours, they will reheat a slice for you. And I'm like, how do you live like this? This is
*  just terrible in Chicago, you grill that hot dog when you order it. And then it's it's a good hot
*  dog. It tastes completely different. Even in O'Hare, even in the airport, no hair and get a really
*  good hot dog better than I can get on the streets of New York by far. Anyway, cheese steaks grew up
*  in Philadelphia, love a good cheese steak. I like sandwiches, I like the idea of sandwiches, I like
*  them in in PETA. You know, one of the best hot dogs I ever had was in Paris of all places, like in a
*  baguette with really good French mustard. But I don't have a good sophisticated theory of sandwiches.
*  I couldn't tell you why certain sandwiches are good and certain sandwiches are bad. They're easy,
*  they're good comfort food, you can get a lot of variety in every bite. It's a good system. I'm pro
*  sandwich, I can go that far even without telling you what the best one is. And with that, we'll call
*  an end to the AMA, the final AMA of the year 2021. What a year it was in many ways. Thank you once
*  again, as always, for supporting the Mindscape podcast. I appreciate it very, very much. I hope
*  you're getting something out of it. I'm constantly kind of amazed that people will go with me on this
*  journey through so many different questions in so many different fields talking to so many different
*  people. It's great fun and great privilege to me, and I'm glad you're coming along. So take care and
*  for those of you who have holidays in front of you, have good holidays, give thanks, be well.
