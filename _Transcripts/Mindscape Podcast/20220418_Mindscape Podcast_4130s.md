Every time we make an important decision, it’s hard not to wonder how things would have turned out had we chosen differently. The set of all those hypothetical lives is a kind of “multiverse” — not one predicted by quantum mechanics or cosmology, but a space of possibilities that is ripe for contemplation. In their new movie Everything Everywhere All At Once, Daniels (the collective moniker for writer/directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) use this idea to tell the story of Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), who is the “worst” of all her avatars in the multiverse. We talk about philosophy, filmmaking, and how we should all strive to be kind amidst the chaos.

Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert are writers and directors collectively known as Daniels. They met and formed a collaboration while in film school at Emerson College. They have directed a number of music videos for artists such as DJ Snake and Tenacious D. Their first feature film was Swiss Army Man, starring Daniel Radcliffe.

# Mindscape 193 | Daniels on Everything, Everywhere, All at Once
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_r1gIjv8lA)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. You may know from
*  listening to Mindscape in general or my AMAs in particular or reading any of my books, there's
*  something out there called the multiverse. Well, what I should say is there's an idea out there
*  called the multiverse. We don't know for absolute certainty whether or not there actually is a
*  multiverse out there. In fact, there are different kinds of multiverse, which I would assign different
*  credences to taking seriously. There's a quantum mechanical kind of multiverse,
*  which I take very seriously. There is a cosmological kind of multiverse, where literally
*  just very, very far away, there's different pockets of space-time where things behave differently,
*  that I'm kind of indifferent about. Maybe it's there, maybe it's not. There's good reasons to
*  take it seriously, but we honestly just don't know. There's also more philosophical kinds of
*  multiverse. The philosopher David Lewis famously advocated modal realism, the belief that every
*  possible version of the universe is actually real in some sense. The question of figuring out
*  which universe we live in is just locating ourselves in the space of all possible worlds.
*  You may also have noticed that the idea of the multiverse has moved beyond science and philosophy
*  to narrative, to movies, TV shows, books, things like that. This is not a completely new move.
*  Fiction writers have used the notion of a multiverse as a device for decades now,
*  but it's gaining in popularity a little bit. Back when we had Scott Derrickson as the guest
*  here on Mindscape, he had just come off directing Doctor Strange, the Marvel movie, the new sequel.
*  It will be Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, which follows up on the most recent
*  Spider-Man movie, which also investigated the multiverse idea. So it's out there. We're using
*  it. There's a new movie, which I very much encourage you to see, called Everything Everywhere All at
*  Once, that just came out, as I'm speaking this, in mid-April 2022, and it's by Daniels. Daniels is
*  the collective name for a writing directing team of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.
*  And they've made this movie starring Michelle Yeoh, which has a multiverse concept in it. I'm
*  not going to give away too much. Don't worry about spoilers here. But they use the multiverse in a
*  very interesting way. Because look, as I know from talking about the many worlds of quantum
*  mechanics, which is one version of the multiverse, you can talk about the Schrodinger equation and
*  decoherence all you want. What people really latch on to is the possibility that there are other
*  versions of yourself out there, real people who are experiencing slightly different or very different
*  realities in some way. It is undeniable that that's a concept that grabs us, that really makes us
*  think about this. Some people contemplate it and reject it as terrible and dumb and ontologically
*  extravagant. Others are sort of charmed by the romance of it all. Some of us just stick with the
*  equations and try to make sense of them as a physical theory. But all of us are thinking about
*  these ideas. So in Everything Everywhere All at Once, the idea is that Evelyn, who is played by
*  Michelle Yeoh, a very famous, wonderful, just about ideal actor for this role, starts out kind of
*  not in trouble. Well, I guess in trouble is okay. But anyway, her life is not going great.
*  There's family issues. There are issues of paying the taxes on her laundromat that she and her
*  husband owned. There's just issues of putting food on the table and so forth. And honestly,
*  owning a laundromat isn't that sexy or exciting. So it's a kind of life that is a little bit gloomy
*  and struggling. And many of us can, in different ways, identify with that kind of struggle when
*  life doesn't go well. It's exaggerated for cinematic purposes. But we all have some of that
*  in our real lives. And then the multiverse comes in, in literally the way that there's different
*  versions of the universe. And all of them have a different version of Evelyn. And the gimmick,
*  which again, I'm not spoiling anything, is that she learns how to take advantage of skills that she
*  or versions of herself have picked up in other versions of the universe. And there's sort of
*  different parts of the universe, the multiverse are fighting against each other and she has to
*  do battle. And that's all I'm going to tell you about it. But the great thing about this particular
*  version of the multiverse is that it's not just, oh, look, there's a lot of weird things out there.
*  But it makes us reflect on the real world fact that there are roads not taken, right? That there
*  are things we could have done, decisions we could have made, where things would have turned out
*  differently, we would have become different people. And so this is where, for me personally,
*  the use of way out scientific philosophical concepts is at its best in telling a story,
*  making a movie, when it's making us think about the real world. Okay, it's not just
*  amazing us with how things would have been very different if the world had been a different kind
*  of world. It's making us think about the world we actually live in, because we all have regrets,
*  or wonder about how things could have been different had we done things differently.
*  So both Daniels are really, really thoughtful people about everything from the philosophy
*  and science of the multiverse to the techniques of writing and making a movie. The movie has been
*  getting rave reviews from people all over. It's not just for us multiverse aficionados,
*  it's something for everyone. I encourage you to go see it. And I think you're going to like this
*  conversation because we get into a lot of things that you don't normally get to talk about with
*  filmmakers. So it's a different perspective. And I think that it sort of resonated really, really
*  well. Occasional reminders that we have a web page at preposterousuniverse.com slash podcast with
*  show notes, links, full transcripts of every episode, completely searchable. And there's also
*  a Mindscape Patreon page. You go to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll, where you can support the
*  podcast, get ad free versions, suggest questions for the Ask Me Anything episodes, and get a feeling
*  of belonging to a community of like minded mindscapers. So again, you can do that if you want,
*  you don't have to. It's great if you're listening to Mindscape whatever way it is. Tell your friends,
*  we want everyone in the world listening to Mindscape, everyone in the multiverse for that
*  matter, even if I do not get donations from elsewhere in the multiverse. At least I haven't
*  figured out a way to do that. Maybe I should start thinking about that. And with that rather
*  down to earth thought, let's go.
*  Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Hello for having us. Yeah.
*  So you have a movie that's just come out, everything everywhere all at once. And there's a lot of things
*  that happen. But let me just start with the obvious thing that where you begin is very mundane, right?
*  I mean, the concerns of the movie right from the start are food, family, laundry, taxes. These are
*  concerns that we all have. So I mean, maybe this is just storytelling 101. And it's the obvious
*  thing to do. But a little bit of insight into why you chose to be quite that grounded in things that
*  we could all agree on right from the start, knowing that you're going to go some crazy places.
*  Yeah, it's a great question. I think a lot of people expect multiverse movies to exist in very
*  high concept, high superhero type genres. And we wanted to make sure that ours started in the
*  opposite, just because we knew how wild the rest of the film was going to be and how
*  much we were going to ask the audience to come along for this ride and kind of suspend their
*  disbelief. And so with this movie, we were like, let's spend a decent amount of time at the beginning,
*  just grounding our characters in a very real world that feels relatable. And also, as many people
*  have been putting it mundane, because in the end, we knew we wanted to find a lot of small,
*  beautiful, profound things in that mundane quality. Yeah, we always knew we wanted to
*  juxtapose those things. But it did used to start, we threw a lot of things at the wall,
*  there used to be a different opening scene where she was a physics professor doing like, like,
*  Michelle Yeoh is teaching the students about like the waveform collapsing. Yeah,
*  double slit experiment. Yeah, yeah.
*  I'm very sad now. You've made me sad that this is not in the movie.
*  Yeah. There's a whole deleted scene. And then as she's showing, like the wave becomes particles,
*  she's putting dots on the chalkboard. And then her class, her students start giggling. And she's
*  like, why are they giggling? She turns around and all the dots have formed a perfect penis.
*  And then she just, and then she mutters, Oh, no, she's here. And then Jo Bu walks in. And it was
*  a whole matrix kind of sci fi intro. But it's so we kind of have class. Yeah. Sorry, one more time.
*  I said it's so embarrassing when that happens in class when you're lecturing on the double slit
*  experiment. Oh, yes, I'm sure. Oh, is that common? To bring the class's attention back to the
*  equations once exactly. Yeah, well, I mean, that's, I mean, that's kind of why I was asking the
*  question because, you know, the superhero movie, whatever people love these, obviously.
*  But it's not that we identify with the characters, it's that we aspire, we wish we could fly or be
*  bulletproof or whatever here, it's much more like these are our problems as well. Right?
*  Totally. I mean, I think some people identify with
*  megalomaniac white men. And those people have had plenty of movies, you know, about them,
*  you know, like most it's mostly about a guy who's like got a good intentions, but is a little too
*  egotistical. And we were like, we'll make our protagonists a little different. A little bit
*  different. Are you just talking about us now? That's what directors are for the most part.
*  But that's what like the first seven Marvel movies were. And so fun that they're starting to change
*  it up. But it was like, it was like, what's Thor's problem? Too confident. What's Dr. Strange's
*  problem? Too confident. What's Captain America's problem? He's a confident dude. Yeah. Well, I was,
*  you know, look, I love Dr. Strange and my friend Scott Derrickson, who also was a previous podcast
*  guest directed Dr. Strange. He was my guy growing up in the comics. But I always questioned this idea
*  that he was somehow made humble. You know, he was arrogant, then he was humbled. Like he became the
*  Sorcerer Supreme. That's not exactly a humbling experience. That's kind of a wishful film experience.
*  Totally. Yeah. But then okay, you bring then things do go crazy. It's not mostly a movie
*  about paying your taxes on the laundromat. So there's a lot of places a lot of movies you
*  could make about paying your taxes in the laundromat. But you brought in the multiverse,
*  some crazy ideas inspired by science fiction. Why is that a good place to go if you do want
*  to tell a more or less relatable story? Yeah, I mean, our we kind of reverse engineered it. And
*  we had this concept of a multiverse story where you tap into lives you could have led and borrow
*  their skills. And then we just started the two sides of that coin. That's really interesting to
*  us is first you get some powers, which is like great for, you know, crowd pleasing action movie.
*  But then on the flip side, every time you tap into a power, the you know, the double edged sword is
*  you suddenly have an existential crisis because you realize, you know, how good your life could
*  have been. And that felt like a really fun, you know, device to throw a character into.
*  Yeah. So then we talked about what character would be the most interesting one to put through
*  the ringer. And the more we talked, the more we got excited about being someone who's older,
*  someone who's maybe our parents generation, who's had more life lived, so maybe more regrets. And
*  then we start talking about our parents and started talking about the immigrant experience,
*  because Dan's parents immigrated and, and that was like, even more interesting, like even more
*  kind of color to like the past lives, the alternate lives they could have led. And, and then,
*  and then yeah, the more mundane, the better, where we were like, Oh, if it's someone who really
*  doesn't feel good about their life right now, then this journey is going to be extra, you know,
*  existential for them. Yeah, ultimately extra rewarding for them by the end. Right. And then
*  the goal became, you know, to make a big flashy movie that ultimately is about how beautiful and
*  wonderful that normal life was all along. So, you know, we wanted to make that challenge,
*  which we knew early on was the challenge. Not too easy to be like, No, no, we're gonna make you love
*  the taxes universe. By the end, you're gonna, you're gonna be like, I want to stay right here
*  in taxes. Yeah, get them right. I mean, I just want to pause for a second to give kudos to the
*  amazing acting in the film, Michelle Yeoh. Most obviously, she was brilliant in this role.
*  Thank you. Yeah. I mean, we love taking credit, but we don't deserve any credit. She just killed
*  it. She's came in and was so prepared and passionate and believed in the movie. Yeah.
*  And I did I did find online that there are a couple of interesting alternate universes
*  where different people were playing the main character in this movie. Right?
*  Yeah, the only two we ever tossed around were very early on, we were like,
*  who are our favorite, you know, Chinese actors. And we were like, what if we could get Jackie
*  Chan or Michelle and or Michelle Yeoh in our movie? So early on, they're like, you know,
*  talk about them. And then when we weren't sure about Michelle Yeoh, our producers were like,
*  who could you go to? You know, if she's busy. And we couldn't think of anyone because we basically
*  accidentally wrote ourselves into a corner and write this movie kind of lives or dies off of
*  Michelle Yeoh, which was kind of a terrifying, terrifying realization, because we had been
*  working on the movie for a couple of years at that point. Yeah. But then almost as like a
*  last ditch effort, my my brain kind of went back and then was like, well, you know,
*  in some ways that this character was inspired by my mom, maybe we could just cut the budget down
*  to like 10% of the original budget. And then the whole movie is like a prank film where these
*  directors drag literally drag their mom into their into their movie and surround them with, you know,
*  pedigree actors and it would be more like a jackass style, like meta film. Yeah. And nobody
*  liked that idea. We never pitched it to his mom. The producers were like, that's not that's not a
*  real idea. Don't. Well, the reason I wanted to bring this up because you know, alternative casting
*  is always a weird thing. We live with what the world we got and it worked out brilliantly and
*  not only Michelle Yeoh, but everyone in the movie is a fantastic actor. But the movie is is like
*  you just said, it's about thinking about all the roads not taken, right? I mean, that's why
*  it's a really, to me, a cool use of the multiverse idea, because it's not just other worlds where
*  weird things are happening, but other worlds where you made different choices, right? It's very,
*  very directly tied to the real world fact that we always carry around with us these questions about
*  how things would have gone differently. Have we done things a little bit differently at crucial
*  moments in our past? Totally. Yeah, I think I think a lot of people keep asking us this question of
*  why the multiverse, you know, why is it happening? Having a moment right now, I think a lot of people
*  can relate to it because there's never been a time where our brains have been allowed to explore all
*  those paths, you know, all the potential things that our lives could have been and all the potential
*  ways our lives can still go. You know, if I wanted to, I could, you know, pack my bags and move to
*  another city and have a completely different life. And that wasn't the case, you know, 100 years ago.
*  Or like what's extra different is now you can go on Google Maps, you can go on Zillow, look at real
*  estate in any city in the world, you can go on Instagram, figure out what it would be like to live,
*  you know, in any city, figure out what all your friends are doing. There's even like, you know,
*  they talk about like dating app tourism, where you literally can just change your
*  location on your phone. And suddenly you can see who is single in Malaysia or who is single in
*  Brooklyn. And I know some people who've actually done that and then actually flew
*  to that location just to meet one person. And so our producer maybe did that.
*  I call him out on a podcast. Yeah, and now they're gonna get going to get married.
*  But he didn't go to Malaysia for like a mail or bride. No, no, no.
*  It was New York where he had an apartment. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it was. But the whole idea is that
*  I think this movie is resonating with people and the multiverse in particular is resonating with
*  people because we are living in the existence that already feels like the multiverse. And that's why
*  we wrote this movie. That's a really cool point. Because you know, as a physicist, I think of the
*  multiverse as being something that we talk about as maybe scientifically real in a different sense
*  than it would be in this movie. But I'd never thought about the fact that in some sense,
*  we're closer to the multiverse now in the modern world, because the space of possibilities for our
*  lives is bigger than if you grew up, you know, as a peasant in the 14th century or something like
*  that. Yeah, it kind of goes back to I don't know if you've read this, or maybe you can even prove
*  me wrong if I if I my research was was incorrect. But when we were reading about everything about
*  the multiverse in preparation for writing this movie, one of the things I found really interesting
*  was one of the earliest recordings of the word multiverse being used in the English language
*  actually had nothing to do with science. It had to do with morality and and theology. It was actually
*  written by a theologist who was lamenting the fact that he believed that there was one moral
*  universe like center to everything, which was God. But then we looked around at the secular world,
*  he was confused by the plurality of moralities and the the moral multiverse that kind of
*  made him struggle every day. And so that was where he that's what I mean. That's where the word
*  multiverse came from, which is really interesting, because it's kind of moved so far from there. But
*  like, I feel like that's where we live. We're living right now. We're living in a place where
*  the internet has created so many moral bubbles and different centers of universes. And what's
*  happening now is we're watching them collide. And, you know, we're all kind of terrified to see what's
*  going to happen next. But to me, I think that is that that's one of the more interesting things I
*  came across while we were reading. Well, and am I correct to Well, let me just ask you as a question
*  rather than just saying statements. Did scientific ideas or philosophical ideas about the multiverse
*  inspire you at all? Or did you sort of hear them go ha and just run with it yourself? Or did you
*  did you like I think you alluded to reading about multiverse ideas?
*  Totally. No, we Yeah, that was the other thing I was just thinking is, you know, we're both
*  really fascinated by science. But you know, we we only have enough vocabulary to understand like pop
*  science books, you know, we're really big into like interdisciplinary study. So like it's about
*  everything combining. Yeah, science is obviously a big part of that. And I always find like,
*  I just I love like a big swing of a take on the on science and philosophy or the state of the world
*  or the state of the world. And, and when it makes me start feeling emotional, or kind of like sends
*  me on a philosophical tangent, and, and so reading about like, you know, huge ideas of physics, like
*  reading, you know, Stephen Hawking's or reading like stuff about evolution and like, is, is a
*  huge source of inspiration for us, because we'll come we'll come to each other and be like, Whoa,
*  like what if, like, how did that make you feel when you read that, you know, article about the,
*  what's it called the brain simulation? Like, what if it's more likely the simulation argument brain
*  would, would just form and, oh, the Boltzmann brain, Boltzmann brain, right. And we're like,
*  we'll come to each other and be like, what a crazy article. And it's a, and it, and then we're kind
*  of off to the races kind of tossing around how that could, you know, affect a story, you know,
*  and so in this particular case, yeah, we read a lot about multiverse from every angle, because I
*  the fun thing about the multiverse is almost every single medium and every single field of study has
*  its own way into it. You know, because like, there's there's the quantum mechanics version of it,
*  which is all about, you know, probabilities and quantum decisions and things like that. But then
*  if you go to cosmology that we're talking about, like the infinite scale of, of, of, of an expanding
*  universe that contains a multiverse even within itself. But the way I got into it was actually
*  through linguistics, oddly enough, I came across this idea of modal realism about 10 years ago.
*  And I was just so fascinated by this idea of like, taking the modality of language and treating every
*  version and every variation as real as almost as a thought experiment, and just went down a rabbit
*  hole down that direction. But you know, mathematics has its own version of the multiverse. I'd
*  argue, you know, Joseph Campbell talking about the many faces of God is another version of just
*  talking about infinity and again, talking about the multiverse. And, and so like, to me, the entry
*  point is more like, like we're saying, it's more interdisciplinary, it's about this, this bigger
*  picture idea of us looking at some at bigness at scale, and trying to squeeze that into a sci fi
*  action movie was really fun. Well, I mean, this is great, because much of what you just said, I
*  could easily have said or have said before, I've written a lot about Boltzmann brains and about the
*  quantum mechanical multiverse, the idea of modal realism is still one that even I come up a little
*  bit short. This is usually associated with David Lewis, famous philosopher who thinks that literally
*  every possible world is equally real. And we just happen to live in the one that we find ourselves
*  in. And that that's, I think that's a step too far for me. But maybe I'm just, you know, too down to
*  earth. I don't know.
*  Oh, I mean, totally. I, to me, the fun thing about all this stuff is that it reminds me like,
*  obviously, it's all rooted in some truth, but it still reminds me of the way that, you know,
*  our ancestors all interpreted certain truths in different directions, like the way that they would,
*  you know, the ancient Greeks would watch a lightning strike and paint a picture of a god
*  throwing lightning in anger or whatever. Or the fact that, you know, there was probably a great
*  flood, you know, thousands of years ago, and every single civilization at the time came up
*  with their own version of a story describing that flood and explaining that flood. And I feel like
*  all these different things, whether it's modal realism or quantum mechanics or whatever,
*  we're all just pointing at the same thing. And we're trying to understand it. And so like,
*  I, to me, I believe none of it. And I also believe all of it. It's a very strange thing where it's
*  the closest thing I have to like a spirituality or to like this idea of like a faith, because I
*  will never be able to fully understand any of it. And so like you saying modal realism doesn't make
*  sense is like totally fair. To me, it's just fascinating because it's another tool for
*  pointing at the same thing. Yeah, I will make one point about quantum mechanics, which I try,
*  because I know that I have my friends and audience listeners out here who will care about this,
*  which is just that, you know, I really do believe that in my body 5000 times a second,
*  there is a nuclear decay, right, there's a little bit of radioactivity, and there's a universe in
*  which that nucleus decayed and one of which it didn't. So I believe that there's many, many,
*  many copies of me being made all the time. I actually do believe this. But I also don't,
*  I insist that the versions of me in the other universes are not me. They're like, they share
*  a past with me, but it's like an identical twin, you know, like once we split apart,
*  we're two different people going our own ways. We obviously have a lot in common.
*  But it's not like things that happen to that person affect me in any way. That's the one thing
*  that I want to hear about my view of the multiverse. And it's perfectly okay. I love it.
*  If in the film, I feel like sometimes in interviews, people have like asked us like,
*  what's interesting about the multiverse, and they're coming at it from this like,
*  pop culture perspective. And I, and I wish I was as articulate as you, because part of me wants to
*  be like, well, a lot of very smart people for very valid reasons, think it's real. Like, it's not
*  just a comic book thing, guys. Like, it's, it's the best explanation we have for, like, these,
*  you know, tiny physics observations. And like,
*  but then it goes both ways. There's a very good chance there's an infinite number of us. And we
*  are in a, we are living the life of a random one. One of them. Yeah. And that's mind blowing to me.
*  And like that, that was a huge inspiration for this movie to just be like, I don't know how that
*  makes me feel. And I don't know what to do about it. But I kind of am excited to stare at it for a
*  few years and see if I can tell a story through that, like, mind, like that just absurd, but maybe
*  real premise, you know, which is why, you know, we push for those who have seen it, you know,
*  you know, we push our character to the, you know, cognitive limits and our audience as well,
*  because we're trying to basically touch upon what it really feels like when we when we
*  treat that as real, whatever you just said, the this refreshing of our bodies, like how,
*  how terrifying, how beautiful.
*  Yeah, but kind of how beautiful it's like, Oh, well, my, it's a miracle that I'm like,
*  able to reach over and pick up this object right now, like, and observe just one, you know,
*  and, and, you know, as you as you alluded to before, in all this infinity of possible
*  futures that my past self had, the one that you're focusing on in the movie for Michelle
*  Tio's character is the one in which she's the worst. She came out the worst of all of that.
*  And it's still not so bad. So I mean, that's, that's a little bit of hopefulness in there,
*  right? Yeah, it's almost, that's almost from a place of judgment from the alpha universe,
*  which is sort of, you know, the, if there are villains in this movie, it's probably them.
*  And so even though they say that, I don't think we actually believe it. And I don't think,
*  I don't think by the end, the character doesn't believe that obviously, but in that moment is the
*  worst thing that she can hear. And she takes it to heart because I think a lot of people feel that
*  way. You know, I think a lot of people, no matter who you are, or where you are in the world, they
*  have this feeling that maybe, maybe this is the worst version of me. How did I, how did I screw
*  up so many things to get to this point? And so I think a lot of people like laugh at that moment in
*  the movie when the character says that, but then I've also heard people say that this actually made
*  them tear up because they felt so targeted almost as like, you know, the film was speaking to them.
*  And I love that because I think if it was speaking to them in that moment, then I think by the end
*  of the film, hopefully it really pulls them out of that and makes them believe in the possible,
*  the future possibilities. If, you know, if we are constantly fracturing out into, you know,
*  infinite number of versions of ourselves every few milliseconds, like you're saying, that also
*  means we are getting resets every, every moment, every moment is a new possibility that we get to
*  choose, which is really, I don't know, it's really thrilling to think about.
*  Well, let me, let me push on that a little bit. This is a totally unfair set of questions to ask,
*  but one pushback I get when I talk about the quantum mechanical universe is that it makes
*  life meaningless. If everything happens, then who cares about what choices I make? Because there's
*  some other universe in which I made other choices. I try to argue that, you know, not all universes
*  are created equal. This is a feature of the quantum version of things where there's sort of more of
*  you in some versions of the universe than there are in other ones. But of course you get to cheat
*  in the movie because you get to access all the universes at once. But what is your stance toward
*  this sort of meaningfulness if all these infinite number of things are happening?
*  Yeah. I mean, I think that we, we went into the project unsure what our stance was. And that was
*  a lot of times that's what attracts us to a project is like, is that, oh, we're gonna,
*  we're gonna chew on a big scary question for a while. And because, because you're right,
*  the multiverse is actually kind of anti-narrative in that way, where if you have a character make
*  a decision and you know, in the back of your head that the other decision was also just as valid
*  and just as, just as realized, then nothing matters because in narrative, the character is only built
*  off of their decisions. Which like, which then in real life is like, yeah, so disempowering,
*  or it can be so disempowering. So we ask ourselves, can we make a multiverse movie where we lean into
*  that and say, I'm going to make you not care. I'm going to make the character not care. I'm going
*  to make the audience not care and basically stare at the meaninglessness of all of their decisions
*  and see if we could pull ourselves out of that because we don't believe that. I think we needed
*  to convince ourselves that even if we are just one tiny speck in a sea of infinite other versions of
*  ourselves, that there's something still worth holding onto in this moment. So yeah, the answer
*  we stumbled upon, so we figured it out is that- This is gonna be a very valuable podcast.
*  I mean, or the answer that we've used to get ourselves out of this impossible project,
*  and so we could actually release it, was that like too much nihilism is a bad thing,
*  but a little bit's not so bad. And that like a lot of people are so convinced they're right,
*  you know, kind of like Evelyn, our main character, that they're making themselves miserable.
*  They're making the world around them, you know, maybe not a better place. And that like,
*  there's something kind of freeing about that scary concept of, you know,
*  this universe is a random one. And we kind of feel like that most people, if they took a step back
*  and stared at that scary question, and then they ask themselves, do I want to be a nice person or
*  a mean person? The answer just intuitively is like, a nice one. Like, I guess I want to do good in
*  the world. I guess I want to spend time with the people I love. Like, maybe I'll quit like,
*  screaming online at people I hate, and bake some cookies for my neighbor if I have a little
*  existential crisis, a little healthy one. Yeah, I don't know how deep we want to go down,
*  like the road of like morality, or just like turning this into a morality tale. But you know,
*  because I was raised very religious, you know, evangelical, almost fundamentalist Christian.
*  And so now I'm very allergic to like, objective morality, or any kind of any way of talking about
*  those kind of things. And then objective sense is very scary to me. But I am fascinated about the
*  fact that like, for so long, the golden rule was sort of like this very strong center to humanity,
*  the idea of like, treat your neighbor as you would like to be treated, has been such a big
*  part of human morality, you know, and we're watching that break down. And I think a big
*  reason why is because the definition of neighbor has just been stretched thin. I think that was
*  really useful back when we had communities of, you know, a few hundred people, even a few thousand
*  people. But now when the community and the neighbors are literally in the billions, like there's no way
*  for that rule to actually hold true anymore. And so like, to me, what you know, what Shiner's talking
*  about, about nihilism, allowing us to say nothing matters, throw out everything for a moment, just
*  hit the reset button, so we can take a step back and find a new center or a new, a new,
*  yeah, a new version of morality. Because, you know, I think we constantly have to be updating those
*  kinds of things as the world changes. And I think what we discovered on this movie, and is being
*  echoed in a lot of art that's being made right now, it's not just not just our film, is this idea,
*  it's like, the neighbor concept is, I think, is failing us. And so we have to just look at it,
*  instead of saying, how do we want to treat other people? It's more about the freedom that we need
*  to be giving everyone. And so I think this new, the new morality that I'm chasing is this idea of
*  nothing matters, there are no rules, let everyone do whatever they want, as long as you're kind.
*  As long as it's not hurting anyone, why does it matter? And I feel like that, you know,
*  those things will be up to debate forever. Like, who is every action hurting? And to what degree?
*  We will always be struggling with that. But rather than being trapped in this idea of trying to
*  police our neighbors, or think of just the individual neighbor, I like the idea of just
*  freeing ourselves up to say, don't worry about it, nothing matters, just be kind.
*  I promise we'll get in a minute to like down to earth questions about screenwriting and moviemaking.
*  But I have some still some deep questions, deep issues I want to talk about.
*  This is our jam. No, we're excited. I'm just going to chime in and say, I still think treating
*  your neighbor how you want to be treated checks out for me. I don't know. You know, it's like,
*  no, it checks out. But it's limited now. I think I think it's breaking down.
*  He just treats his neighbors like garbage. I never want to be like Dan.
*  To be treated like that. Maybe he wants to be treated like that.
*  Does that grow dog shit over the fence all the time?
*  Yeah, I just want to be shamed and
*  Right.
*  Well, the flip side of this is when you contemplate these gigantic multiverses, not only
*  do you think about, you know, does it is it meaningful because I could have done other things,
*  the other worry from the existential side of things is I noticed that I am very small
*  inside this huge collection of infinitely many things happening, even if it's not other me's
*  out there. There's certainly a lot of other stuff out there. So I personally kind of,
*  when people bring that up, I kind of lean on a version of the serenity prayer. I'm like, well,
*  yeah, but know the wisdom to understand what you can affect and what you can't. And even if it's
*  small, that is what matters to you, right? Yeah, that's great because what you just said is kind of
*  where my brain has been at the past couple of weeks, the serenity prayer, just like knowing when
*  the limits of the individual and that's probably going to go into our next movie. I don't know.
*  There's something there that is really profound. And our visual effects supervisor, who's a good
*  friend of ours who worked on the movie, this morning, he literally just sent me a podcast
*  about that very thing, about the limits, the limitless expectations and limitless
*  imagination that we have versus the limited bodies that contain them. And that tension is so
*  awful. And then I feel like on the other side is like, I've recently been reading more like Alan
*  Watts, like philosophizing. I haven't read much, but like, there's something so, it's one of the
*  only philosophers I've read where I'm like, oh, this kind of just adds up. It's all just like,
*  it's not like super difficult to parse out. I mean, I guess that's what he's known for is being like,
*  hey, I'm going to take Eastern philosophy and make it so Westerners can understand it. But like his,
*  you know, he talks about like how it can be a really upsetting, dangerously upsetting thing
*  to really focus on the self as something 100% separate from the rest of the world. And that
*  like, and that it's a porous thing, you know, like, there's your consciousness, is that the self or
*  there's your body? Is that the self? Like, but the food in your stomach is not the self or maybe,
*  but like, maybe it's just this becoming the self, but maybe it's this like, more, more,
*  more as thing that like you control some, but like, you control it less and less, the further goes
*  out, but also like, Dan is a part of me, like my community is a part of me. And like, the universe,
*  as huge as it is, is me. And that there's something kind of like, beautiful about that,
*  where it makes you feel less shitty about being so tiny. And then you're like, I love redwood trees,
*  good thing those are part of me, because I'm part of earth, pretty cool. They get to high five the
*  redwood tree and be like, I look good. This is a good that's my version of Alan Watson.
*  But the great thing about art in general is it can take these lofty ideas from science or philosophy
*  or whatever and bring them down. Like once you have to make it manifest in the plot and characters of
*  the story, then that's sort of what matters like philosophers love them. I'm kind of one myself,
*  but you can talk in abstractions all the time. And it can often be like an extra step that doesn't
*  get taken to make that real in people's lives. But as filmmakers, you have no choice you're
*  showing people doing things on the screen. Yeah, I think it's I think sometimes we come into a
*  project with like, with some hot takes that we're real confident about, you know. And then when you
*  start having to like illustrate them with human beings and trying to make them relatable,
*  it's like humbling and you're like, oh, there's more nuance to this. Like the point I was trying
*  to make is changing because because I want it to feel real and real people aren't as black and
*  white as you know, my opinion, you know, like a bumper sticker is easier. And then like, so even
*  while working on this project, you know, like, I think we, we had to put our shoes put put ourselves
*  in the shoes of these characters that are our parents generation. And like, I think at first,
*  we were a little like, know it all II, as we did that. And we were like, and through the process
*  of making it, we're like, it's not easy to like understand your children who were raised on the
*  internet. If you weren't raised on the internet, it's not easy to like, you know, understand your
*  kids pronouns when your kids pronouns change. Like that's hard. Yeah. And but it's also still
*  important. But but anyway, yeah, that's what your comment kind of made me think about is like,
*  our bad art is like just propaganda where someone's screaming a hot take. But I think like,
*  yeah, the good art which we aspire to make, you know, requires nuance. And you're like,
*  well, I'm having to get in the weeds here. Well, you're giving me an idea that maybe it should be
*  required in philosophy courses that all the students write a little bit of a screenplay
*  to illustrate the ideas that they're thinking about, like really put it into action somehow.
*  I think it's a great idea. And it's amazing. And vice versa. I think like filmmakers should have
*  to take a philosophy course and figure out what on earth they're trying to say. Otherwise, they'll
*  just go out and just like have someone shoot a bunch of people in the forehead because it looks
*  cool. And they never think about what it means or why they made that movie, you know,
*  all of this is reminding me of a of something I read once and I'm going to attribute to Kurt
*  Vonnegut. But that might be totally wrong. But when in doubt, when in doubt, when I get it. Yeah.
*  But basically, it helped me understand our place in in the world as storytellers. And basically,
*  the idea is that in order for any paradigm shift to happen in any for any any big idea to come into
*  the zeitgeist, you need three types of people. The first one are the the the ones who basically
*  come up with the idea and are treated like like heretics or just like crazy people, insane people.
*  They're the ones who have an idea so wild that the world rejects it. Then the second person you
*  need is someone who basically looks at that crazy person and says the first one who says,
*  oh, wait, there's something here. This person actually is onto something. And they're the ones
*  who validate it. They're the ones who who bring them into into like out out from the outskirts
*  and into society. The podcasters. Exactly. The podcasters. Exactly. Yes, exactly. And then
*  the final the final person that is needed is the storyteller. It's the person who can take these
*  very complicated, just convoluted, complicated, contradictory ideas that the world is not ready
*  for and turning it into something digestible and something scalable for for society. And so
*  after I after I heard that, I was like, okay, I can do that. That sounds that sounds like something
*  worth worthy of my time. I want to chase after complicated feelings and complicated ideas
*  and try to turn them into something that my mom can understand or, you know,
*  you know, high school kids can understand or at least begin to understand. And so I do think
*  whether it's for science or philosophy or any of these fields, that the person who translates
*  to the masses is such an important part of all of this. And I think I think a lot of storytellers
*  forget that that is one of the many hats we can wear. Yeah, there's plenty of movies out
*  there with the shooting in the head. We look but I like the idea that a little bit of
*  forced reflection might make them slightly better. I mean, the it makes me think about like,
*  on the other side of on the less optimistic side, Dan was I haven't read this, but you're telling me
*  about, I think Socrates, like, was really anti playwrights and like anti storytellers.
*  Or maybe in playdough. It might be playdough. But like, one of them was like, yep, there's nothing
*  factually reliable about a piece of theater. It's just emotionally effective. And then
*  he's like, if you're trying to create like an educated populace, who's trying to figure out how
*  the world really works, the worst thing you can do is just throw art at them. That's super persuasive
*  and has no scientific method involved at all, you know, and I, and I love sometimes, you know,
*  it's like such a fun, humbling thought to be like, I'm, yeah, sometimes I'm trans, I could
*  be translating something important for the masses. And other times, I could just be throwing
*  misinformation out there. That's as, that's as detrimental as something the Kremlin, you know,
*  is cooking up or, you know, like, there's a responsibility there. Yeah, one of my recent
*  guests, Peter Dodds is a statistician data scientists, but he studies that, you know,
*  uses big data to study stories and narrative. And his motto is never bring statistics to a
*  story fight. It's just not going to be a fair fight. The stories are always going to win.
*  That's such a bummer. Yeah, because yeah, I think about that a lot.
*  Because we, we started off like, we've been thinking about it a lot in the last few years,
*  that like, our work early on was just us dancing with the algorithm, like, you know, what kind of
*  short film can I make that, you know, YouTube will like, and we weren't spending much time
*  thinking about like, you know, what the difference that might make in the world, you know? Yeah.
*  So and, and then sometimes you look back and you're like, Oh, I accidentally spread
*  misinformation, you know, like, even if it's just representation in media, you know, you can do the
*  statistics, and you're like, 20% of people look like this, but 100% of people in this movie
*  look like this. But also, like, you know, like our obsession with serial killer stories makes us
*  think there's more serial killers than ever, when homicides are way down, or that there's child
*  predators everywhere, but it's way down. It's like, Oh, that's not. Yeah, I love statistics.
*  And sometimes I have so much guilt about being a filmmaker.
*  Well, you know, as a scientist, as a physicist who lives in Los Angeles, I've consulted on a
*  bunch of films, including a bunch of Marvel films. And, you know, I'm very much of the opinion that
*  I'm not going to object to the laws of physics being broken in the movie, like, what is the
*  point of that? But, but there's still a little voice inside of me that sometimes squeals or gets
*  annoyed or something like that. So I'm only gonna do one little I'm gonna let you know, I'm gonna
*  let you in on the one part of a kind not just your movie, but movies like this, that I can't
*  quite stop thinking about just to get your reaction to it, which is just the fact that infinity
*  is very big. When you talk about an infinite number of things that can happen, most of them
*  are either terrible or boring, right? I mean, the vast majority of universes out there don't have us
*  in them at all, not just like other versions of us. And oftentimes, when people portray like
*  Douglas Adams and the hitchhiker's guide, right, the infinite and probability drive,
*  they portray other possibilities as kind of cute and fun. And there's there's an example in your
*  movie where you do this also. And so I mean, how I mean, is it just forget about that? We're telling
*  a story, we're going to have fun, we're going to be cute? Or do you contemplate the idea that,
*  you know, in the vastness of infinity, most of it is terrible and boring?
*  Yeah, no, that's that's my pet peeve, too. And it was kind of,
*  yeah, hard to grapple with. And we we threw a lot at the wall.
*  We nod to that a bit. You know, there's a there's a universe where life doesn't.
*  The conditions weren't right to form or whatever. And most of them are like this. But then it turns
*  out that universe, they're still talking. Yeah, it's still made it cute. It was still cute. It was
*  my favorite part of the movie, but it was still adorable.
*  Oh, great. Thank you. But yeah, I mean, you're right. There is that tension between what is
*  accurate and what is going to help the story. And I think for the most part, the universes that we
*  picked were the ones that would collide with the with the protagonist, the best. And so
*  a lot of the end of the being the wilder ones, which is kind of interesting. And we kind of
*  maybe we'll do a sequel that's like all boring universes. It's just universes that are just like
*  so mundane and nothing's happening. Yeah, nothing's happening forever.
*  Gets the last score. I think it'd be great.
*  But yeah, I mean, we wanted to start with something extra accessible and cute and be like,
*  oh, what if there was one other universe? And and like from very early on, we're like,
*  we're going to introduce more and more. The audience is going to get a little stressed out.
*  And then we're going to pull the rug out. And we're going to introduce a stupid number
*  of universes to kind of point at infinity, almost like an exponential curve of universes,
*  you know, for a movie, knowing like there was no logical way we could film, you know, like there
*  would be limitations of what we could film and also what would be, you know, interesting at all
*  to look at. But hopefully, hopefully people leave our movie and they they can tell that we
*  were pointing at even more universes than what we showed. Like, and that like, ours is a cute
*  little is like a cute version of the physics because and we yeah, I'd love nothing more if
*  people took that germ of a feeling and went off and actually did some research read into it more,
*  you know, because it's it's fascinating. Yeah. Well, this brings up a filmmaking point because
*  once you've granted yourself access to the multiverse, you can be as silly as you want,
*  as weird and bizarre and shocking as you want. And I don't want to put words in your mouth,
*  but I get the feeling that you enjoy that that that freedom. I mean, how much do you have to
*  pull back and say, no, no, no, that's just too silly or too gross or too off putting versus,
*  yes, let's let's, you know, shock the audience a little bit.
*  Totally. Yeah, it's a constant debate within ourselves. I think we're always trying to
*  surprise ourselves because if we surprise ourselves and we surprise the audience and like,
*  what better gift to give an audience and we get bored easily. So we try to make a movie that would
*  not bore us. But then we're always, you know, with every new ingredient we add, we're always doing
*  the calculation or ahead of like, OK, what percentage of the audience are we going to lose
*  if we include this this element that's too far? And like, how important is it to the
*  the main character's journey? And and that kind of became the the back and forth.
*  Yeah. But the most shocking thing about all of this is, you know, we're used to our movies
*  cutting out a certain, you know, pushing away certain audience members because it's too much.
*  It's too weird. It's too, you know, aggressively strange. And that's why we're always doing these
*  calculations in our heads. And so we expected certain people to, you know, walk out of this
*  movie being like, that was not for me. But I think something has happened in the time
*  since we started making this movie where the world has just gotten so weird and the world has gotten
*  so chaotic. You know, you read headlines and they feel like a parody website is writing these
*  headlines, but they're real. You know, these are actually happening. Real life feels absurd.
*  And for some reason, you know, audiences are really embracing this movie way more than we
*  ever expected. The fact that we're even on this podcast right now is very funny to me because this
*  is not what we were imagining when we set out to write this movie. We thought we would find some
*  interesting weirdos like us who would enjoy this. And that would be that. And we would be happy with
*  that. But this is kind of proof that something has shifted and the world is ready for art that
*  reflects life. And right now, life is absurd. That was I mean, that ended up being our excuse
*  for keeping a lot of the most shocking stuff in there was that the internet is shocking.
*  And that like, in a lot of ways, this movie is in conversation with how it feels to
*  live online these days. And even our parents generation is spending more time online than
*  ever and is more aware than ever of just how like, you can scroll between something that makes you
*  like smile to something that disturbs you so quick. And, and we wanted to not
*  we want to do that justice a little and be like, you know, our generation grew up on the internet,
*  like that there's sexual content around every corner on that, you know, and so like, we're like,
*  there should be cuss words and sex toys in our movie, even though that's going to make our,
*  you know, moms disappointed with how, you know, where our film school tuition went.
*  But it felt, you know, yeah, authentic. I mean, it's another funny, I sorry, I haven't really
*  thought about this enough, I guess. But this does the fact that not only do we have this technology
*  now, and it's changed our lives in certain ways. But one of the ways is the whiplash, the rapidity
*  with which we can be pushed from one thing to another, like I don't know about you, I grew up
*  with 10 channels on the TV and you know, some books that you know, in your any one book for a
*  long time, but with thousands of channels on TV, and literally millions, billions, probably of
*  websites out there, you can get this sort of conceptual emotional feeling of just being a
*  just chaos at a very, very rapid rate. And I guess that is hardly what is being reflected in the film.
*  Yeah, it's wild. Like, I mean, I think people have always loved camping, because you kind of
*  calm down. But, you know, I, you know, I'm not that old. So I can't speak for what camping was like
*  in the 80s. But I feel like when I when I go somewhere, and my phone doesn't work for two days,
*  like, it is wild how different I feel and how my brain feels. And it's like, it's like only when
*  you get off the drugs, do you realize just how bad it was different life feels when you don't take
*  your drugs. It's like that. But yeah, the movie, I think the people who really click with this movie
*  are the ones who immediately understand that the whiplash that you're feeling is intentional. You
*  know, I think some people watch it, they aren't ready to let go. And it's it's it's a lot. It's
*  it's it's almost abusive to the audience. This movie sometimes, of course, we took a lot of care
*  and making sure that the abuse was rewarded. But once you let go and realize the whiplash is
*  intentional, you are ready for this roller coaster ride. And we use a lot of genre and we use a lot
*  of like really quick snappy filmmaking techniques to make it apparent. But it is fun to be sitting
*  in an audience with a bunch of people. And some people are laughing and some people are crying
*  and some people are screaming all at the same time watching the same exact scene, but reacting
*  in all these different ways. Because that's that's what it feels like on the internet when someone
*  posts like a tragedy online. That's what it's like. Some people are cheering, some people are
*  crying, some people are making jokes. It's a very strange way to exist where you're not allowed to
*  have your own feelings about something anymore, because the world is having it first.
*  Let me just take advantage of having you here because you talked about your goals with a movie
*  like this. How does it come together? Is it always the same? Or is this is every movie different? I
*  mean, you start with the characters, the plot device, the images. Yeah, I think we start with
*  throwing a lot up in the air. Even right now as we try to figure out what our next movie
*  might be, we have too many ideas and too many things about the world that are interesting us.
*  We're always just waiting for a bunch of our favorite ones to coalesce.
*  It's like this aha moment that's not just one idea. It's that moment where like,
*  oh, that project will let me do 10 of the things that interest me right now.
*  I'm not going to get bored with that. Which is the other half of my answer, which is like,
*  we like to do things that we won't be sure if it worked and we won't be done until the very end.
*  It took us all the way through mixing the movie to refine what we were saying and
*  we were constantly tweaking things because we bit off something hard.
*  Yeah. One thing I'll say is I think we write the wrong way. I think classically you're supposed to.
*  This is actually a metaphor that our composers used for their process and I'm stealing it now.
*  So Sunlux, they were the band that composed the score for this film.
*  They describe their process like this. They say normally an architect will build a house
*  and you get the structure right. You make sure everything feels safe and sound.
*  Then you go inside and you start to populate the house with furniture and appliances and
*  things that make sense. But their process, which feels very similar to ours, is instead of building
*  the house first, they might be walking down the street and come across this amazing chair. This
*  amazing arm chair with 10 legs and it has leather but also there's some pokey parts that stick out
*  if you don't sit in the right. But they love it and say, this chair is incredible. I'm going to
*  build a whole house around this chair and I'm going to make this chair make sense. This chair
*  doesn't make sense right now. It doesn't make sense in my mom's house but I'm going to build
*  a house where this chair makes perfect sense. To me, when I heard them describe that, I was like,
*  yes, that's exactly how we work. We find these weird chairs and when we spend the rest of our time
*  just trying to build a house around it. I think for this movie, the chaos was the chair.
*  Infinity was the chair. I want to build an entire thing around infinity even if it structurally
*  doesn't make sense or structurally doesn't follow the rules. This is going to be a very
*  hard challenge but a very fulfilling one if we pull it off. I wish I'd done that with my actual
*  house. I just did renovations and my favorite sofa didn't fit in it and I had to get rid of it.
*  Defeats the purpose of a house if your favorite sofa does not fit in it, really.
*  Yeah, it just didn't make sense in the room. Well, maybe this is something worth explaining
*  to people who don't make movies for living because I think that a lot of people presume
*  that you have a script and then you film it. But there's still a lot of picking and choosing
*  along the way. You film things that don't make it into the movie. You end up filming things that
*  maybe weren't in the script. What is the planning versus chaos element in that process?
*  Totally. Yeah, I think there are filmmakers like the kind of classic Hitchcock style is that he
*  would perfect his script, perfect his shot list, have storyboards and he'd come in and he'd move
*  around his actors like chess pieces and execute exactly what he had planned all along. But that's
*  so hard with live action and also very unpleasant and the opposite of why I got into filmmaking.
*  I like the collaboration and the problem solving and the fact that you're learning new things all
*  along. It's also self-limiting. If you're going to go in there and say, I know exactly what I want,
*  there's no room for the universe to tell you better things or to show you better ways of
*  making the film that you're making. And I think a film like this would never have worked if we had
*  done the Hitchcock crew. I think we had to be constantly listening, constantly feeling out what
*  our crew members were saying and what the locations were telling us and how just everything down to
*  scheduling around different actor schedules. All of that is speaking to you and you have to listen
*  as a filmmaker because otherwise you're just fighting against entropy and you're fighting against
*  just inertia, which is impossible.
*  Yeah. For example, we get all the way into the final weeks of the edit and there's still things
*  that some audiences aren't latching onto about the logic of the movie. We were still rewriting
*  lines of dialogue and just one line of dialogue could make such a difference that would then help
*  everyone, just help a few more people give up to the absurdity of the bagel, for example.
*  We were tweaking those lines straight up to the end or there was one shot that we added to the
*  opening of the film that's just the daughter sad driving her car and the simplest shot,
*  but it wasn't in the script. It wasn't in the edit and something about the daughter's journey
*  felt like it wasn't set up properly and audiences were like, why is it all about the daughter at the
*  end? I think it's a product of how much we were trying to squeeze into our movie and how ambitious
*  our ideas are, but we added that really late and it made a huge difference.
*  It's a chemistry set. Yeah. You just got to keep tweaking those proportions until it feels right.
*  To answer your question in another way, he comes from improv. I come from animation.
*  Animation is filmmaking when you have all the control and improv comes from
*  filmmaking where you have no control. I think our style and our process is somewhere in the middle
*  where we plan as much as we possibly can, but knowing that our projects are so ambitious,
*  we have to leave a lot of room for improv. Also knowing that we have really talented friends
*  and we want to leave room for their ideas, leave room for the actors to come in and surprise us.
*  Well, one of the features of the film is these wonderful Hong Kong cinema fight scenes.
*  Presumably those are pretty darn choreographed, but how much were you just nodding toward that
*  sort of genre film versus actually using the techniques that they would use to make a fight
*  scene like that? Growing up, that was all we watched in the house because my dad loved
*  watching movies and my mom fell asleep in most movies unless they were in Chinese.
*  My dad would just constantly be finding bootleg copies of Hong Kong action movies and things
*  like that. We watched a lot of that growing up and both of us, we both connected over the fact
*  that we loved that filmmaking style. What was great about it for this movie is not only is it so
*  damstily and satisfying. It's our favorite, but it also happens to be
*  not that expensive compared to the bombast of American action movies. It's all about two
*  people fighting over a prop as opposed to 100 people with guns as the building falls.
*  It doesn't make it easier. In fact, I think it's much harder to pull off Hong Kong action because
*  it requires every performer to be incredibly physically able. Also, the camera work has to be
*  very precise and you have to have a team who's all dedicated to this idea of shooting action
*  unconventionally. I think a lot of things have been changing in American action films,
*  but for a very long time, the way that we shot action was the same way that we'd shoot coverage
*  of any other dialogue scene where you get the wide shot of the whole thing. Then you get some
*  close-ups and then if you need some inserts for clarity, you'd go and get this foot kicking this
*  thing, which is way more efficient because then you're not changing light setups constantly.
*  You're not turning around and forcing the whole crew to move every single time you do another
*  take. But when you cut it together, there's a dryness to it that feels like you're shooting it as
*  if it's a conversation and not like a dance, not like a proper fight. In Hong Kong, Yoon Woo-Ping
*  was the legendary choreographer that did almost all of that stuff or at least influenced a lot of
*  that stuff. His way of shooting would be he would just choose the exact shot for every single move
*  that would best illustrate the feeling and also narratively the story in that moment.
*  Even if it was just one punch to a face, he would find the perfect shot for it and hit that punch.
*  They cut to a wide and suddenly the fall would have a very specific angle that would make the
*  fall feel very dramatic. Even if sometimes it cuts fast, it's always very narratively clear.
*  There's also these incredible moments where they just let the performers perform because they're
*  that good. You can just hold on a stationary tripod shot for a decent amount of time and
*  just be impressed by how incredible these athletes are.
*  Stan
*  And then the last thing in our Hong Kong spiel we like to say is that we referenced it so heavily,
*  tried so hard to make something that could stand up to like Michelle Yeoh's career.
*  And then we tried to not hurt anyone. And so, the difference was when we did our action scenes,
*  we had very thick wires and we just removed them in post. But like classic Hong Kong action movies,
*  they use thin wires that the camera couldn't see and it's so dangerous.
*  Stan And a lot of people got hurt.
*  Stan And a lot of people would get hurt on those movies. And so, we're happy we found a
*  safe way to do that style because we did not want to hurt Michelle Yeoh, our hero.
*  And that's compatible with the underlying lesson of the movie I guess, which maybe makes this a
*  good last question to ask. Is there a lesson to the movies? Is there moral to the story and
*  should movies have morals or is it just, I shouldn't say just, but is the goal more to
*  give people a bunch of ideas to think about and come up with their own stories? I mean,
*  how pat should the lesson be at the end versus a little bit of loose thread chaos left hanging there?
*  John Ligato Totally. Yeah, I think it's all we're always searching for a balance in there.
*  And I'm not sure what the right vocabulary words are, but like,
*  you know, we have a very concise moral to the story that's so
*  simple, it sounds like a children's book, you know, which is like, it's chaos, be kind.
*  But on top of that, we tried to make every character's journey nuanced and explore things
*  that didn't have super black and white answers and leave room for everyone to kind of see what
*  resonates with them when they leave the theater and not into the movie with someone walking off
*  into the sunset happily ever after. So that, like, hopefully there's things to chew on that are
*  gray and, and that, you know, it's it does feel like the movies out of our hands now. And we read
*  think pieces online and we're like, Whoa, I guess the movie means that like, cool, which is such a
*  fun experience. I think that's all product of the fact that like, we don't go into every movie with
*  a moral, we don't know what the moral is going to be, you know, if there is going to be one at all.
*  And hoping, you know, we just kind of enter every project, hoping that we will find something that
*  we can learn. And if we're learning, again, if we're learning, then the audience is learning. And
*  that's that's exciting to us. And so I think that's probably why, you know, people have a hard time
*  pinning down what this film means is because it grew into its meaning rather than us placing some
*  like some seed of meaning at the beginning, which I think is like, in my, you know, my experience,
*  those are my favorite kinds of films is where it feels like the filmmaker is searching the
*  filmmakers is looking for something rather than trying to teach something. I like reflecting
*  it back on a lot of our work, I feel like a lot of oftentimes, the characters are all the worst
*  aspects of our characters are the worst aspects of ourselves as writers and as humans. And we're
*  putting putting those people into these movies so that we can hopefully see a way to become a better
*  person through the process. And that's I think, hopefully, that's something that people feel.
*  It's like a hybrid, our filmmaking process is a hybrid of jackass and therapy. We're like,
*  we just want to do things that are fun to do and fun to watch. And we also want to like try to
*  grow as people along the way. And maybe that'll be valuable for the audience, too.
*  Well, and Evelyn has triumphed. But next year, she's still gonna have to pay her taxes again,
*  right? I mean, there's no escape from this. Yeah, exactly. It's still chaos. Yeah, she doesn't,
*  you know, still chaos. That is a great that's the moral. It's still chaos. So be kind to each other.
*  So Daniel, Daniel Shiner, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape podcast.
*  Oh, such a pleasure. Wow. This is
*  hopefully the same thing to see next time we're going to interview you. I know we have more
*  questions for you. Yeah, I have answers. Some of them will be crazy. Some of them will be wrong,
*  but I'll give them. Oh, great. Maybe maybe we should consult or ask you to consult on our next
*  movie. Honestly, now that now that we've connected this is how to get me. Yeah, love it. All right.
*  Thanks very much, guys. Thanks. Nice to meet you.
