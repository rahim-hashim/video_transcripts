Advances in technology have gradually been extending the human self beyond its biological extent, as we augment who we are with a variety of interconnected devices. There are obvious benefits to this — it lets us text our friends, listen to podcasts, and not get lost in strange cities. But as it changes how we interact with other people, it’s important to consider unintended side effects. Sherry Turkle is a psychologist and writer who specializes in the relationship between humans and their technology. She makes the case for not forgetting about empathy, conversation, and even the occasional imperfection in how we present ourselves to the world.

Sherry Turkle received her Ph.D. in sociology and personality psychology from Harvard University. She is currently Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society at MIT, founding director of the MIT Initiative on Technology and Self, and a licensed clinical psychologist. Among her awards are a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rockefeller Humanities Fellowship, the Harvard Centennial Medal, and she was named “Woman of the Year” by Ms. Magazine. Her new book is The Empathy Diaries: A Memoir.

# Mindscape 186 | Sherry Turkle on How Technology Affects Our Humanity
**Mindscape Podcast:** [February 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EpRMX2_3g)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean
*  Carroll. You know, in some sense, as it's been often pointed out, podcasts aren't
*  that different in spirit from just radio shows, right? We've had shows on the
*  radio for a very long time. But of course, there's also a difference. And a
*  lot of the difference between good old-fashioned radio shows and newfangled
*  podcasts is the device by which you are receiving this podcast. It could be a
*  portable device, right, a phone or a tablet, or it might be your laptop. But
*  this new bit of extra technology lets you do what makes podcasts great, which
*  is you can listen whenever you want, right? It's not like a radio show you
*  have to wait for that time. You can pause it, you can skip through the parts you
*  find interesting, and so forth. It's a tiny change, maybe, but it's an important
*  one that has been made possible by this bit of technology, these devices we
*  carry around with us. And it's just one example about how these devices have
*  really been transforming our lives and arguably even ourselves, who we are. We
*  identify with and use our devices in ways that really hit who we are deep
*  down. And maybe the world's leading expert in this phenomenon is today's
*  guest, Sherry Turkle. Sherry's a professor at MIT who started out studying psychology
*  and has a degree in psychology, that's her PhD, but she became interested early
*  on in the idea of technology and how it affects our psychology. So she got a job
*  at MIT, founding a new way of thinking about the relationship between human
*  psychology and machines and technology, right at the beginning of artificial
*  intelligence and the personal computer revolution and so forth. And even though
*  she was initially quite optimistic about how we can use technology to make the
*  human experience a better one, these days she finds herself, I think I would
*  accurately say, more often pointing out the worries that we should have. Not that
*  she's anti-technology in any way, but there are ways in which the technology
*  sometimes moves ahead of our ability to understand what is going on. We all know
*  how devices are extremely seductive, we can't put down our phones, the young
*  generation we have right now is growing up in a very different environment than
*  older generations did because of how they relate to technology and to each
*  other. It's something where in some sense the art of conversation, of spontaneity,
*  of not knowing exactly what you want to say and therefore spitting something out
*  and maybe it's not exactly right and you have to edit, that's a kind of art form
*  or even just sitting in silence that you don't need to face up to when you have
*  this technological mediation. How does that change who we are, who we want to be,
*  who we present ourselves as to the rest of the world? Sherry has a new book out
*  which is actually a memoir, it's called the Empathy Diaries. A memoir is the
*  subtitle and the idea of writing a memoir is because she does have this
*  interesting intellectual place where she's sitting and she wanted to try to
*  explain how she got there through her personal story and the Empathy Diaries
*  is an appropriate title because she wants to emphasize the importance of
*  empathy and personal connection in an age where machines dominate our
*  communication so strongly. I say all this of course knowing perfectly well
*  that I am recording this podcast on just such a bit of technology and you are
*  listening to it on just such a bit of technology so again not anti-technology
*  here but this is exactly the kind of situation where we shouldn't let our
*  enthusiasms run away without thinking about it, being cognitive, really trying
*  to understand where we're going rather than just racing willy-nilly from one
*  shiny object to another. That's what this podcast is trying to get us in the mood
*  to do so let's go.
*  Sherry Turkle, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. My pleasure. So this is an
*  unusual interview. I've interviewed plenty of people who have books out but you have a
*  memoir out which is a little bit of a departure but I think it works well
*  because we can use some of your biography to get into some of the
*  substantive thing that you've done over the years in technology and
*  communication and so forth. So explain to the audience how you had a career path
*  of becoming a psychologist and a clinical psychiatrist I guess and ended
*  up at MIT thinking about technology. Well you sort of had to be there at the time
*  but really that's why I wrote the memoir. The memoir is not a personal memoir. The
*  memoir is a memoir of a very particular kind. It's a memoir that tries
*  to integrate. It's in the spirit of the question you just asked because it tries
*  to integrate my personal story and how I ended up doing the work that I do. So
*  it answers that very question. I went to MIT because I wanted to have a place to
*  finish a book I was writing about how intellectual ideas get into the public
*  space and sort of hit the street after they've been in the seminar room. So my
*  case study was actually the popularization of French psychoanalysis in
*  the years after 1968. There was this very esoteric guy named Jacques Lacan.
*  Hardly anybody read him, very hard to read, very opaque and then there were
*  these May events kind of parallel to the French student movement we had here and
*  all of a sudden Jacques Lacan was like a movie star. Everybody was in psycho
*  analysis. Everybody was quoting this very you know hardly understanding him I
*  guess but psychoanalytic ideas were really in the popular culture in a very
*  big way and I was fascinated by this question of how ideas that are in
*  academia really become part of public discourse in particular ideas about
*  thinking about the self because that really influences therapeutic practice.
*  That's what my thesis was. That's what all my study had been about was about
*  how really in a culture you can only help people to get better from what's
*  troubling them if you use the ideas that are in the culture. You know you need to
*  use the ideas that are popular in the culture to get through to people and
*  explain their troubles to them in the metaphors that they can understand. So in
*  American society Freudian ideas talking to people about their oppression or
*  their Oedipus complex or their you know their childhood that had been kind of in
*  the public imagination for 30, 40, 50 years and not at all in France. Those
*  ideas had been shunned and then all of a sudden in the 60s they were very much in
*  the popular culture and I studied that process and I went to MIT because there
*  was a dean there who thought this work was very, very relevant to thinking about
*  how artificial intelligence was going to get out and ideas about thinking about
*  the computer were going to get out into the popular culture. Ideas like don't
*  interrupt me I need to clear my buffer. Not having enough bandwidth yes. No I don't
*  want you to reprogram me you know you know ideas that represented the mind as
*  a machine. How were those ideas going to get out and they felt they sort of needed
*  someone like me, someone who was not a computer expert but a sort of expert on
*  how ideas hit the street. Move from the classroom and the laboratory into the
*  culture to think about the new ideas of computers and artificial intelligence
*  and I was writing up my dissertation as a book and I said that sounds
*  interesting and I sort of went to see and I absolutely fell in love with the
*  question. I absolutely fell in love with the question and you know 40 more years
*  later I'm just as much in love with this question of how for example these ideas
*  about the metaverse now are going to change our ideas about thinking about is
*  reality important or are we okay that we're going to leave reality and go to
*  the metaverse. All of a sudden you have all these very influential people saying
*  I want to live in the metaverse let's all make avatars in the metaverse let's
*  spend a lot of money in the metaverse where we have commerce and meetings and
*  lovers in the metaverse. Well what about reality? Who's going to take care of
*  business? I mean it does that mean that we're going to be sold on the idea that
*  not only isn't face-to-face reality important but reality reality isn't
*  important either you know can we can we not take care of our streets and our
*  homes and our our public parks and our our our offices and our you know train
*  stations because we're just going to go to the metaverse instead of you know
*  being in the physical in physical space well we don't need to go to I mean I
*  don't want to go on and on but it's the same sort of question which is just as
*  you know just as compelling now as then so that's how I made the transition from
*  studying you know ideas from Freud and how they changed people's lives to
*  studying ideas from technology and how they change really how we think about
*  living you know we did not that was the transition not too long ago we had a
*  Lacanian psychoanalyst or psychoanalytical theorist on the
*  mindscape podcast Mari Ruti and I just want to let anyone know who enjoyed that
*  one that there's some very good Lacan stories in your memoir sharing so yes
*  he's a character I went to Paris and I I basically said to him listen I'm
*  writing a book about the impact of your ideas on popular culture where everybody
*  was making something of this this man's ideas different things and usually
*  opposite things and I said but you've got to you know explain to me some of
*  your ideas because I'm really having some trouble here and he you know I
*  think he saw me in French there's an expression you know Lidia du village
*  I mean sort of like not a village idiot exactly but some sort of naive you know
*  like and he he who has a reputation for great opacity said yeah I'll explain
*  I'll explain this to you and he was actually a very sensitive and very kind
*  teacher to me and I try to in this book and in everything I've written about him
*  try to communicate you know how he explained his ideas to me in a way that
*  you know I could understand and you had the chutzpah to invite him to give a
*  seminar at MIT which did not go exactly well as I recall but let's get into this
*  mindset because it is a great you know sort of right place right time story
*  where someone like you at MIT in the 70s when it was sort of the first heyday of
*  artificial intelligence and people were like you said you know part of that is
*  building artificial intelligence algorithms but a flip side of that is
*  thinking of human beings as machines right we human beings always do that the
*  latest technology is the metaphor we use to start thinking about ourselves so you
*  know how did that feel back then in the 70s were you optimistic we like oh yeah
*  human beings are gonna be machines or were you already a little bit worried
*  that people were taking this too straightforwardly too far well I was I
*  was very worried because my background was to see to me it was a I called it a
*  move from meaning to mechanism from looking the first the first thing that
*  had hit me and the thing that had compelled me to do this what I was
*  teaching a course that had a unit on an introduction to Freud and I was trying
*  to explain what calls what we call Freudian slips and Freud in his in his
*  book on slips and his notes on slips explains Freudian slips he calls them
*  parapraxis by by saying by giving an example of a chairman who calls a
*  meeting to order but instead of calling the meeting to order he says it's I call
*  the meeting closed in other words he substitutes closed for open in the
*  meeting and then he goes into a whole long rigor a mole about how he might
*  have done that why he did that his wife is sick so he wants to get home his he's
*  ambivalent about what's gonna happen in the meeting I mean all the meaning
*  reasons that a Freudian would give to unpack that slip and a hand is raised in
*  the back of the room of a computer scientist who says I think that you're
*  looking at this in the wrong way in a Webster's dictionary closed and open or
*  as far away as C&O in a Freudian dictionary their opposites closed and
*  open or as far away as you can get you have to go into all these meanings and
*  ambivalence and his wife is sick and but in a computational dictionary closed
*  equals minus open a symbol has been dropped right when you make that
*  mistake there's been a power surge one bit one bit there's been no it's no
*  problem I mean it's like you know nothing happened you had a power surge
*  on the line so there's no you don't need this whole big production just your
*  there's been a little glitch in the electricity your brain your mind your
*  mind is a series of electrical circuits I mean get a talk about something
*  interesting I mean you have a mechanism here that were nothing very interesting
*  has happened yeah and I was so taken aback because I realized that if you do
*  see the mind as a machine she was absolutely right this whole
*  infrastructure of meaning depended on a model that she didn't believe in from
*  her point of view there was no there was no there there in this story and I
*  saw that a structure in which you looked for meaning was shifting to a structure
*  of mechanism that was going to have all different kinds of assumptions I guess
*  and and I tell a story in the empathy diaries to illustrate this you know this
*  is what kept me at MIT I mean I was then I was hooked you know I was about to
*  leave for some liberal artsy place you know but then I was just hooked and I
*  went to the debut of the movie Tron oh yeah original with Marvin Minsky who
*  thought the mind was a meat machine that's how he said the mind is a meat
*  love Tron because it showed the mind as a meat machine it showed all the little
*  programs you know interacting and in the mind as little you know
*  anthropomorphic programs he loved that and then he said you know and children
*  will go see movies like this and they'll never see movies like Bambi and I and I
*  and I bit I bit you know he had me I shouldn't have risen to the bait but I
*  did I said why not Bambi every kid sees Bambi and he says because in Bambi the
*  children get attached to their mothers and the mother dies and in the world
*  we're going towards the robots will be immortal will be taken care of not by
*  the mothers but by the immortal robots there'll be no death will be uploaded
*  onto the computer in other words he gives me this whole AI version of how
*  we're on the way to this radical self-improvement in AI and I realized
*  whoa you know this just isn't a theory this is a whole way of a philosophy of
*  being in the world and I think that that really is what we're struggling with now
*  even as we talk about the metaverse it you know it's not it or talk about robot
*  caretakers for our children or robot psychotherapists which is being pushed so
*  much or robot companions or robots who will love us or you know all of the all
*  of the things that are so current now in our discourse is how much do we care
*  about our bodies about having human companions about the specificity of
*  being human all of these were questions that were posed for the first time when
*  first got to MIT now we're living them out in real technology that is being
*  proposed to us but they were proposed in theory when I first got there I'm
*  interested in that story about the bit flipping in the in the Freudian slip
*  context because I can kind of see both sides here I mean at a deep intellectual
*  level I'm sympathetic to the idea that the mind is a machine that you know
*  ultimately there's neurons and the remaining laws of physics etc but of
*  course it's a kind of machine that is so enormously more complicated than what we
*  build on our computers right now that to think of a human being making that wrong
*  word choice as just a bit flip is probably hopelessly naive I would think
*  well also where I think I do believe along with the with the tradition and
*  represented by you know phenomenologists and Merleau-Ponty and in
*  the computer world by Hubert Dreyfus by Antonio de Mazio that were a particular
*  kind of machine that's attached to our bodies right and very specific bodies
*  and bodies that have a life cycle and bodies that feel pain and bodies that
*  know they're gonna die and bodies that were born and bodies that grew up being
*  attached to parents on whom they were dependent and you know that that I think
*  that those experience those embodied experiences and those experience of
*  dependency and attachment really create a specificity of the human that even if
*  you have a neuronal accident and you drop a bit because you know sometimes a
*  cigar is just a cigar you say open when it's you mean closed because let's say
*  you stumble have a bit drop you know still when you do that it triggers
*  associations from all of those other systems and with all of those other
*  consequences so I think that we are more complex and I always like to quote it
*  it's so funny that when you write several books those people sometimes say well do
*  you repeat yourself and I say I intentionally repeat a couple of times
*  I've intentionally repeated a story because I loved it so much and I wanted
*  to give the author credit I don't repeat stories of mine but I repeat other
*  people's work and Peter Kramer wrote a book listening to Prozac quite a few
*  years ago but he tells a story at the beginning of listening to Prozac I mean
*  it was a very big book when he wrote it I mean he so he you know got a lot of
*  credit for how brilliantly it was written but I but I give him extra extra
*  credit because he began it with the following story that I think sums up the
*  human condition and the question you've just asked me so perfectly and the story
*  is this that he was a psychiatrist working at Brown University in the
*  counseling department and a student comes in he says he's depressed and
*  Prozac was just coming out and Kramer gives it you know gives a student Prozac
*  for the depression three weeks later the student comes in and the student says
*  I'm not sleeping and Kramer the last notes he has on his in his student
*  chart for the chart says he gave Prozac and he knows that Prozac sometimes leads
*  to sleep disorders this is not to worry I'll give you something for the sleeping
*  this often happens when people take Prozac and the student says to him no I
*  didn't take the Prozac I'm not sleeping because I feel guilty towards you about
*  not having followed your advice and Kramer says that in the in less than a
*  heartbeat in less than a second I mean it didn't take a second he went from
*  seeing that student as a bundle of synapses that he was going to treat with
*  Prozac and serotonin at the synapse to seeing that student as in an edible
*  context and he and the transference and and what had happened in the
*  transference to him and what about his relationship with his father and as part
*  of a family system and how was he going to deal with this family system and his
*  and his whole relationship to this completely divorced from this whole
*  thing about the mind is a machine and what the pros that could do with the
*  synapse etc etc etc and and I and he said that is what is extraordinary
*  about the human condition that we relate we can relate to each other and at the
*  same time machine to machine Prozac giver to Prozac receiver and as edible
*  transference figure to son and that the way he describes that flip and then of
*  course he had a slip back because then he's the question is a walk in Prozac
*  you know he still maybe wants to try Prozac you know but but that way it's
*  that way that we all live that really is the human condition that we are both and
*  and that one doesn't exclude the other and it's time that we stop behaving as
*  though well we'll just go into the metaverse so we don't need to be in our
*  bodies anymore you know I mean we have to start stop behaving as though we're
*  on the red is that we're behaving like we all saw the matrix and we have to
*  choose between the red pill and the blue pill we have to actually our situation
*  is that we don't get to do one pillar the other pill we live in the fully
*  hybrid world our minds now are in a fully hybridized situation so we're
*  talking now on I mean I'm you know you see where I'm going so I'll set my
*  lecture but but we the human condition is that we are both you know I wish I
*  had known that story because when I wrote my book the big picture I talked a
*  lot about how you can describe the same situation using different vocabularies
*  that are very different in content but are both right as long as they're
*  compatible with each other this is a great example of exactly that. It's the same thing except what I
*  think that happens to clinicians what happens to people you know what happens
*  to and this gets back to your first question about being a clinician is that
*  if you're a clinician you operate you you have to operate on both levels
*  because we do have drugs we do have medications that can we're not to use
*  the medications would be wrong to say no I'm just talking to I'm just
*  talking to everybody you know Freudian mind the Freudian mind that would be
*  wrong because these medications do calm people down to the point where they're
*  more accessible for conversation so you know certainly someone like Kramer is
*  not a completely anti medication person but the point then is to have a
*  conversation with with the more complex person who did have a relationship with
*  his father and so when some fancy psychiatrist said do this he said the
*  hell with that I don't want to do that I want to do anything that an older man
*  tells me to do no but then later he came back realizing he was you know there was
*  something maybe to learn here well now he was depressed and angry at Peter
*  Kramer and angry at his father and still depressed and maybe there was something
*  to get out of this experience and speaking of conversations this this
*  provides a wonderful segue because it is a different world that we're in now that
*  we were in the 70s in terms of how this technological revolution is going to
*  affect us and I think that the idea of people carrying around small mobile
*  devices that are conduits to interacting with the whole world was
*  probably not nearly as appreciated in the 70s as it is manifest to us right now
*  so you've done a lot of work and thought a lot about how having these devices
*  changes how we behave but also who we are in fact you already mentioned the
*  fact as Antonio Demacio was another former podcast guest and he and others
*  have really emphasized the existence of the body as an important part of who we
*  are and now in some sense these little phones and iPads and laptops that we
*  carry around are becoming extensions of our body and changing who we are yes I
*  mean I actually in the empathy diaries I talk about the the change in my work
*  because in the beginning that's my first book when I got to MIT and I saw this
*  new world of devices and and AI and thinking of the mind as a machine and
*  the way people I called my first book the second self because I saw the way
*  people were projecting themselves onto the computer I called it an evocative
*  object I because it was sort of on the border between mind and not mind I
*  thought it was a place where people were exploring this their sense of self and
*  their question of free will and I even said what sex was the Victorians the
*  question of free will is to our generation that the programming brings
*  up that question of free will that I mean I wasn't positive I was talking
*  about all of these very you know these these big questions that AI raised but
*  it was a it was a book of discovery and exploration then when the mobile phone
*  and I wrote another book that was very positive which is a book called life on
*  the screen where I talk about people going into muds and things like the
*  metaverse and playing Sims and Second Life and you know again exploring to
*  avatars gender and their personality and taking on different roles and doing
*  role playing and I saw the dangers but I also talked about them as identity
*  workshops and placed you know how cyberspace was a place to play with
*  identity again I talked about the problems I talked about addiction I
*  talked about I mean I talked about a lot of things but my attitude was these are
*  places of psychological possibility let's study them I'm basically an
*  empiricist I'm not a moral philosopher but when I saw that people were walking
*  around with the world of computation to enter you know just like that Sherry is
*  holding up her phone I'm applying it directly to my head I my attitude
*  shifted because my model of how people had been using the phone as an identity
*  device involved sitting on your couch with your friends and your family and
*  your baby and your lover your mother your brother and then walking away going
*  office sitting at your computer and have doing some identity exploration and
*  getting up from your chair and walking back to your living room and being with
*  your family again in other words it was a it was a going to the place of therapy
*  or experimentation or or you know you know being in a parallel universe and
*  then coming back to the real right and what the phone did is it broke that
*  barrier so the people were cycling through people were cycling I called it
*  cycling through that when in the in the original model people kind of cycled
*  through the real and this metaverse and then the cycling through became the
*  rapid cycling became so rapid that the boundaries broke down yeah and people
*  were going back and forth and back and forth and back I mean the people said I
*  I really that the world really that they were accessing from their phone was more
*  real than their real life was often more compelling than their real life and what
*  distresses me now is that people are saying well me just said people and Mark
*  Zuckerberg or anybody who's pushing the metaverse which is increasingly like a
*  lot of companies because they're gonna make a lot of money on it they're saying
*  that's right we are gonna make the metaverse more compelling than the real
*  you're gonna want to work in the metaverse you're gonna want to play in
*  the metaverse you're gonna want to and I saw a New Yorker cartoon that was I was
*  trying to explain it to some friends and I think I'm gonna make it like my
*  holiday card it was it was like a cartoon about things that were gonna
*  have a hard time explaining to the next generation you know like things that
*  will be difficult for my grandchildren to like understand how it used to be
*  where a grandmother was with her grandchild and the grandmother is
*  have has oculus glasses on and she's saying to the grandchild okay now when
*  we're together now in the metaverse do you see me with these goggles or do you
*  just see me or do you see me without the goggles and the little grandchild says
*  to the grandmother oh no grandma I see you as a unicorn because that's the
*  avatar I've made for you so the grandmother says you mean you don't see
*  me your grandma when I visit you and the grandchild says no no I did just do
*  your fear unicorn and the grandmother says so what's the point why do you need
*  deep question there I mean now we're pushing that the you know the the it
*  was it was so touching to me because because you know I like it so much that
*  I can see you I mean your listeners don't know but I can actually see you
*  it helps the conversation it means everything to me that I can see you I
*  mean if you were just there as a little avatar little unicorn I mean what's the
*  how's that gonna help me I mean I see you I see your books I see your guy who
*  has posters I mean it I don't know it's just nice well I guess I mean at the
*  metaverse I wasn't planning to go there but it's a it is a compelling thing I
*  mean let's let's let me pretend to push back because I think I get your back
*  yeah I think I get your point but in the metaverse yeah we call it the metaverse
*  I guess because Facebook decided that's what they want to be whatever virtual
*  reality yeah I had a little house in second life I've given talks in second
*  life etc they're not very advanced technologically but you know you can
*  look however you want you can live however you want you can travel by
*  teleporting or flying I see the attraction there how should we think
*  about using that in the original optimistic sense of identity workshops
*  yeah I mean I've studied that for years and years and I'm completely I mean I
*  was a great fan of that because it has very powerful very positive things to it
*  you you get to play with identity you get to plug people can play with gender
*  keep young people can be old you get to play with what it's like to be an old
*  person if you're young and how you treated if you're a woman you get to see
*  the kind of authority you have as a man if you if you're short you get to be
*  tall I mean I remember being I mean I'm five I say I'm five four but I'm lying
*  I'm really five three and a half and I get to see what would be like to be five
*  eight five nine even it's different experience I mean you just you know you
*  just it is a very powerful thing to to play with elements of identity and to
*  present yourself in different ways and and I'm hundred and these are very that
*  whole notion of I talk in my in my work on this about Eric Erickson's idea of the
*  moratorium about how about how he wrote about how in adolescence traditionally
*  people were allowed a kind of timeout to try different things to experiment with
*  different things and there's no moratorium in American society now I
*  mean you're you know I mean my god you know I mean now on Facebook I mean from
*  from eight you're you're you're tracked you have a you have a trail of but it's
*  not even that you're trapped there's no there's no sort of timeout you know
*  there's no idea of there's no notion of adolescence as a time of no consequence
*  there's no huckleberry thin Tom Sawyer time there's no life on the Mississippi
*  there's no sense of 13 year olds or 13 year olds but that's because 13 year olds
*  didn't used to carry guns and you know shoot people I mean there you know there
*  was a sense of childhood boys will be boys you know but when people you know
*  when the when the level of well you know what I mean when the level of violence
*  and aggression reaches a certain point you know swiping some you're not you know
*  it becomes too much in any case that's out of American life doesn't have that
*  anymore but it was nice to have those it that sense of adolescence at the time
*  when people tried on identities like for example you know people tried on I'm
*  going to try on Catholicism there used to be a lot of in my circle you know
*  people would try out being Catholic or try out being Muslim or people are not
*  trying out so much religion because it goes with such a heavy now it goes with
*  such a heavy overlay of other meanings so that's what it's good for it's good for
*  all this trying out now when the metaverse becomes or when augmented reality or virtual
*  reality really becomes the place where we live where consequential decisions are made
*  where it's where we have our relationships with where we go to work where it's where we
*  you know where we sculpt a primary sense of identity where I wake up I put on my glasses
*  or my contacts or my goggles and you know that really becomes me our ways of having conversations
*  are going to change our ways of being spontaneous are going to change our ways of
*  experiencing our physicality our commitment to the environment our commitment to the city
*  our commitment to what our streets look like are going to change our commitment to what our
*  offices look like if you if you anticipate that that four days a week people are going to be
*  working virtually or even three you're more likely to say well on the two days or they come to work
*  it doesn't matter so much they're a beautiful office or you know what their office is like
*  yeah I mean I think this is really so much to each other when we're with each other face to face
*  there's something very interesting here and just just in many ways but with the question of identity
*  in particular as just one example I think you you've brought up sort of two flip sides one is that
*  in virtual spaces we can try on different identities right on the internet no one knows
*  you're a dog you know you can you can play act but at the same time in our if you want to call it
*  the real world our tangible physical reality it's had the opposite effect you can't reinvent yourself
*  as easily because you have this record out there on twitter or facebook or whatever and I remember
*  there's a poignant moment in one of your books where you mentioned students in college you know
*  wistfully saying I guess it used to be possible to go to college and be a different person but
*  you can't now because everyone can look you up on facebook and they know who you are yes yes and the
*  idea that virtual reality becomes a place for experimentation because you can somehow try to
*  erase an avatar and what about when you can't erase an avatar anymore I mean what makes us think
*  that you know I think that virtual reality is as the metaverse becomes more corporate
*  this whole notion of you know its playfulness is going to go away too because you're going to be
*  dealing with real money and selling real things and you're going to need to have a real reputation
*  it's not just going to be oh that was my avatar because I wanted to work out something
*  so I mean I you know I think that a lot of the things that I saw are so positive about you know
*  this identity space are going to fade fall off as it becomes more like it was as it becomes our real
*  life yeah so basically I'm actually very concerned about the kinds of relationships and attachments
*  and empathy that people that you that you get avatar to avatar you know
*  because I think that what defines us as human ultimately you know this is playtime it's great
*  to have all these technologies and to play with them and to see their affordances and to see what
*  they're good for and to you know I'm I'm not a Luddite I think we should all try everything and
*  I don't believe in closing down work on anything and you know nothing like that but I think we've
*  had a little experience now and I don't think that I think we've learned that too much time online
*  too much time on screens we don't form the same sorts of attachments we don't form the same sorts
*  of sense of you know responsibility and connection it's just easy to ghost somebody you know the
*  amount of people who end relationships both both romantic but also work relationships of all sort
*  relationships of all sorts you know not just oh my you know my boyfriend ghosted me but my
*  colleague ghosted me my friend ghosted me my just the sort of vague talk to you soon
*  chow chow you know and then somehow they're you know they're gone you know they're you know
*  colleagues and you know kind of because they can just not because they're being mean or
*  even feel they're being unprofessional but because they can really yeah you know I had a very
*  significant relationship with an editorial colleague and who I meant very well and he
*  meant me very well and then I think it had if all of our meetings had been if our relationships had
*  not been so internet mediated things would have ended differently because this way was just like
*  oh you know chow chow see you online and then emails don't get answered and it just is very
*  vague or they get answered with a very cursorily and just because you can not because people
*  are trying to be people can end things and defer things and not get back to you and in business
*  practice just because they can and people don't want to be vulnerable people don't like for example
*  firing people or rejecting people professionally I'm not just talking about in personal life or love
*  but nobody wants to send a rejection letter much easier to just not answer and so not answering
*  becomes like a thing because you can because ghosting isn't just for lovers ghosting is for
*  every level of professional life you know I should write a book called ghosting is not just for
*  lovers I like that all right I think I love that ghosting is not it's a great title ghosting is
*  for every level of professional life well it speaks to something you know tangible about this
*  difference because on the one hand it's easy to say that higher levels of connectivity help us
*  meet and interact with a wider variety of people and that's good but what you're pointing out
*  is that those connections that we make seem to us much more disposable and temporary and ephemeral
*  than the ones we make in if we want them to be yeah if we want them to be I mean I had a wonderful
*  you know and Stephen Colbert had his um you know his original show I was on it was called the Colbert
*  reporter when I was on that program he's such a brilliant man and he he asked and I guess alone
*  together had just come out he interviewed me for that book and it was such a privilege because
*  he's so brilliant and he asked me the following question he said in character as you know whoever
*  he was the character he was playing the Stephen Colbert character and the question was don't all
*  those little sips of connection add up to one big gulp of conversation yeah and I said no no they
*  don't but it was it was the greatest question it was exactly the question because a thousand sips
*  of connection during the day are not the same as sitting down with somebody and saying look I've
*  sent you I've sent you a p I've sent you my artwork for critique I want to know if your gallery
*  is interested in me you've had it for a year I've gotten nothing could you know I I'd like
*  you had my slides could we have a five minute conversation that about about them and whether
*  I should be considering you as a gallery for my future if I should move on and that conversation
*  you know doesn't happen right you get I mean I'm not an artist but I've interviewed enough artists
*  to know that conversation doesn't happen well and what I what I like about the the analysis you give
*  of this is that you make the point that a lot of things we would think of as bugs or disadvantages
*  of person-to-person conversation are actually features right are actually things that are
*  really necessary the awkwardness the silence the getting it not quite right the first time you say
*  it right I mean you try to make the point that these are actually useful and helpful parts of
*  the process not things we should polish away yes one of my favorite interviews on this point was
*  a young woman who I was interviewing about conversation and she says you know there's a
*  there's an eight minute rule that you have to really listen to somebody for eight minutes
*  in order to understand what they're saying that's a long time they stop they start I mean if you
*  really want to understand like if even if you like somebody you know or really like you know not even
*  romantically but she was talking like just like who is this person in her experience it takes eight
*  minutes you know it says people say it takes less than a nanosecond for for people to know if they
*  want to be intimate with each other but it takes eight minutes and I'm willing to believe that but
*  it takes eight minutes to like figure out who is this I mean who is this what what is their
*  experience where I mean are they like a child of a holocaust survivor have they been abused
*  have that what who am I talking to who am I talking to is this somebody who's been abandoned is this
*  somebody who's you know spent their life trying to carve out an individual identity I mean who am
*  I talking to and after saying that I'm thinking I found my goddess I mean this is my this is my
*  woman and then she says but I don't have the patience to do this I just I I can't stay away
*  from my phone that long I've lost my ability I've lost my ability to hang in there and and
*  and I feel that there's a kind of vicious circle of our incapacity for solitude our incapacity
*  for boredom our incapacity to stay with people for eight minutes you know our incapacity to
*  just be with you know to just be with with people and just kind of take them in to give them that
*  kind of patience because in in in in the metaverse something's always happening you're making the
*  avatars just don't sit around kind of like a lump you know it's like a it's an active environment
*  and we get used to constant activity and you know boredom is your imagination calling to you
*  and so in in in the empathy diaries what I try to do is I try to link you know my personal story
*  and growing up in a particular kind of household with with empathy denied me to my interest in how
*  important empathy is and how you know when you create a technological environment in which empathy
*  is going to be denied to a lot of people you know you and you're going to have robots and chat bots
*  not you know who can't show empathy at all how you're playing with fire and that's really more
*  the you know that's more the messaging I think that I that my work now has is that we're at a
*  point where we given who we are psychologically we're playing with fire with who we are psychologically
*  as humans how well how well do we understand psychologically speaking why the devices have
*  this pull on us why it is so hard even though you know we're designed to because we know a lot about
*  human psychology we know for example what makes us compelled to stay at something you know we're
*  compelled by devices that engage us with rage for example we know that we're engaged by being angry
*  we know that we're engaged by anxiety we know that we're engaged by not having stable feedback
*  but by having intermittent positive feedback or you know so all of the so fade Facebook's algorithms
*  engage us by keeping us angry by keeping us on the edge of our seat by giving us intermittent
*  feedback and by keeping us in a silo with other people who agree with us and who make going to
*  make us angry and angry or and you know so the more we so we're it's like we're a slot machine
*  that's been designed specifically for us when we sit down to play a video game or when we sit down
*  to do a little Facebook we think we're just doing a little talking to our friends but everything is
*  designed to keep us in a to get mad to stay with people who are going to keep us mad
*  that's a that's a way and to be shown ads for things that we really are pre-tested to know that
*  we want so we're we're sort of like a trembling string of purchase purchase being made angry being
*  shown more pictures of things are going to make me angry i mean you know it's not just people who
*  are being made angry by being told that there's you know you know it's not just people on the right
*  who are being made angry yeah i'm on the i'm on the left and i'm being i'm being constantly revved
*  up by being shown things that are going to make me angry and angry on the left in other words
*  sometimes people get this wrong impression that oh it's only people on the right who are being
*  showed pizza gate and you know thing crazy things crazy you know um you know uh stories of things
*  that couldn't possibly be true about vaccines or stuff no it's everybody's been shown things that
*  are going to make me crazy about canadian truckers and you know when nazi flags being
*  you know desecrating things that i think are important so i mean i'm i'm being whipped up into
*  a into a into a into a crazed state and then i'm being thrown in with people who are gonna who are
*  also furious and make me feel as though i'm in a community of other angry crazed people and
*  so it's siloing us into more and more tribal well this isn't good i mean obviously this is yeah so
*  so your if your question was um well how does how does it keep you know why are we being so compelled
*  is that we know so much about human psychology and this all this all this smart knowledge
*  is being turned towards making our devices compelling to us
*  is it a good analogy to think of it like almost as empty calories you know uh we seek out sugary
*  sweet things because 10 000 years ago it was hard to get calories and you know we were we were trained
*  to look for those and now that's not really the best thing we can we can have for our health and
*  likewise you know these psychological techniques that our devices or our social media use to hook
*  us are you know are are giving us something we do want but it's sacrificing something harder and
*  and more important is that a good way of thinking of it well you know it that's such a good question
*  i'm not sure that we would be so um tempted if our society wasn't in a period of such
*  social fragmentation okay in other words you know everything is working in in sort of very
*  a very vicious circle of unhappy lockstep to get us to a point where sitting alone in our room
*  uh getting angry buying stuff and hanging out with other angry people seems like a good idea
*  yeah um so you know there are these wonderful studies about the precipit and this is even
*  before covid but the precipitous decline in civic organizations i mean america for all of its um
*  um you know terrible problems and systemic racism it's you know all the things that
*  you know have have gotten us into so much trouble uh inequality and so forth um it it one of the
*  miracles of the country no you know de toqueville noticed it in 1830 was our our amazing um the
*  amazing organization of our uh civic organizations our floor floral you know garden clubs the women's
*  clubs you know the church organizations the the coral societies that every group every county had
*  the bands that every city had the the high school marching bands the organization of the parents
*  teachers associations i mean that if you moved into a community and you wanted to make friends
*  there were there were 15 things in your community that were waiting for you yeah and that those have
*  just been closing at a clip and that there seems to be very little pushback uh as those close
*  people are just not feeling that connection to their communities anymore as these close so you
*  know yes you still have religious organizations you still you know you know the fact that the
*  catholic church has had such a terrible um you know crisis and such a terrible encounter with
*  its you know historical uh its historical tragedies uh you know was certainly something that you know
*  had to happen but you know there go all of those um organizations in this is in this in the in the
*  parish that kept people at making lunches for each other and elderly people and kids and you
*  know i mean so there's some you know there's a there's a lot you know that's it's it's
*  that's a big loss to a community um and that's true of of religious organizations across the board
*  and other kinds of civic organizations as well um similarly when i was a kid growing up i lived on
*  a block where we had a democratic club and uh i mean god knows what kind of graft and corruption
*  i don't even know you know i have no comment i haven't studied it but uh you know this was
*  just happened to be a block in brooklyn where i'm sure there was not a republican you know i mean
*  this democratic club didn't have to do a lot of politicking to get both so in state they had like
*  you know they had speeches and they had you know children's fairs and they had
*  civics lessons and they had i mean it you know they had it was a community and they had potluck
*  dinners and they had an elderly program and they had um that's not happening anymore so that's now
*  what the local democratic club is doing you know it's professional organizers coming in and i mean
*  i think potluck dinners and giving seniors meals and door to door giving out food is gone
*  i guess i'm saying that that we are this the society is quite atomized and the the idea of
*  digital friends for example is such a crazy idea because there's no friend there there's no person
*  there to be a friend and yet i've interviewed so many people who say that seems like such a good
*  idea to have a digital friend a friend who can never disappoint you well i do think that um again
*  the flip side of this would be that there are people who don't fit in to their local communities
*  and can find like-minded individuals uh much more easily over the internet than they can in physical
*  space yes and i'm 100 right i'm for it i'm for i mean but there are two different things there's
*  using the internet to find other people and there's using a program to be a friend good yeah and i
*  think it's very important to make this distinction i love using the internet to find other people
*  and then potentially you convert that relate you know at a certain point you say hey right let's
*  let's have a coffee you know or uh you know next time you're you know you're in you know you're in
*  if you're far away you know you meet halfway or you try to find a person who is not necessarily
*  3 000 miles away but you try to find uh you know people join chess clubs or playing word games
*  or whatever and they you know they meet or they get on zoom or they you know they they become
*  closer and closer to the reality of another person there i'm really you know i using the internet to
*  to to join with other humans and to ultimately get to a meetup with humans where you
*  can build on now i could not be more pro right now i actually see more and more people
*  wanting to make friends with chatbots as an alternative to the vulnerability
*  of dealing with another person well this is another i wasn't making myself clear is that i
*  actually see a slippage right past using the internet to talk with other people
*  where you're less vulnerable because you can ghost them or you know kind of just keep the
*  conversation simple moving right past that to you know uh to having psychotherapy with a chatbot
*  and then having a best friend chatbot a companion chatbot and you already did mention the idea that
*  we're building you know robot therapists or companions for elderly or kids or or whatever
*  and so are you i mean what what is your take on that is it a good stop gap all bad okay all bad
*  no because it gives you have nothing i really have nothing good to say because even if the whole
*  point is the people who are for it say the people you can't tell you're talking to a
*  if you can't tell you're not talking to a person what's the harm
*  and to me that's the profoundly dangerous a profoundly dangerous position i mean that's a
*  that gives up on the essential of the human endeavor it's the it's the turing position
*  you know if you're talking to a machine and you can't tell it's a machine the machine is intelligent
*  well no not necessarily it just means the machine has fooled you into thinking
*  you're not being able to tell it doesn't mean that it's intelligent at all so would you
*  want to make a decision about war and peace would you want to make a decision about your child would
*  you wanted to make a decision about would you want to discuss a relationship with it would you want
*  to discuss questions of equity or social justice with it it has no skin in the game it doesn't care
*  it doesn't care about the future of the planet it doesn't care about my baby it doesn't care about
*  my life i mean it doesn't doesn't love me it has no i mean i really mean skin in the game was i mean
*  that's what came to mind but that's what i said literally it has no literal skin it has no stake
*  right i mean it's it's the people who have the stake it's the people who can form attachments the
*  machine can form an attachment that matters with you so like during covid i a new york
*  times reporter called me and he said that he millions of people were signing up for hundreds
*  of thousands to this new wonderful chat bot and uh did i want to comment and i said well sure i'll
*  i'll sign up and i'll try it out and um and i would and i said but you're looking for me not
*  to like it right because you know that i'm you said well yeah because everybody likes it and you're
*  pretty sure not to like it so i said look i mean i'm not going to just say it's bad i'm going to
*  try it out so i tried it out and i made an avatar i made an avatar of a female therapist
*  and i just sat down and i said well you know it's the pandemic or you you know can we have a
*  conversation in which you're my we have a conversation about things that are troubling
*  me during the pandemic during quarantine and the chat bot said yes and uh i can i said well
*  can we discuss loneliness because that's my biggest problem i can't see my daughter and i
*  i'm living here alone and i want to discuss loneliness and uh she said yes i mean it said yes
*  and i said well you know what do you think you know what are your first thoughts because really
*  being loneliness is my is really my greatest issue and how to handle loneliness and she says well
*  you know loneliness is warm and fuzzy so i took a screenshot it was a bug by the next day i'm sure
*  it was fixed because it was so bad i took a screenshot i'm sure by the next day it says
*  something really like from heidegger of something very from you know very very
*  you know from mary oliver or something very you know very appropriate i sent it back to the new
*  york times reporter and i said look this is why i don't hold it against the program we're called
*  replica i don't hold it against the program that doesn't know but this is why people need to talk
*  to people now you know i i need to talk to somebody who is afraid of getting sick this is before the
*  vaccine you know who's afraid of getting sick who's afraid of being intubated who's afraid of
*  saying goodbye to their child on a on a ipad you know i need to talk to a person who has a body
*  who's over 60 you know i i and who's lonely this is the fact that it could pretend to be lonely
*  and that tomorrow it will succeed in pretending to be lonely is of no use to me and this is why
*  uh it's it's it's it's inhuman to have people talking to this and you know everybody else
*  liked it so i was a dissenting voice yeah you're a dissenting voice but it's it's we deserve
*  we deserve each other it's an area in which i don't think that there's so much good that
*  artificial intelligence can do to pretend to be human in an area that is so uniquely human
*  empathy body sense life cycle children it's just overreach yeah you know it's just profound
*  overreach well maybe as a set of closing thoughts um we all have these devices we all use the
*  internet that's not going away are there from your research from your thinking about these things
*  are there strategies or techniques you've come up with for dealing with them in healthy ways do you
*  think that people on the street are sort of making some common mistakes that we can fix or it should
*  we leave it to the companies that are building these devices to try to i didn't think so just
*  just wanted to check no i think i think there's some very common well the common things for dealing
*  with your daily use should be you know no phones in the car you should say to your children the car
*  you make sacred spaces in your life where the devices don't go so you leave room for conversation
*  you know not the car not the not anything having to do with food preparation or food eating so not
*  not the kitchen not the table and not the car you just say the car is your captive audience and this
*  is where we talk right your children say no this is where i do my social media when they're young
*  enough you say no i i'm driving so i'm not doing my social media and this is it's important that
*  our family talk so the most important thing is to establish that it's important that human beings
*  talk to each other and that's the first thing that i think that it sort of getting back the
*  importance of conversation goes a long way in a family towards putting phones away when they
*  should be and phones shouldn't be in classrooms and they shouldn't be at dinner i mean they
*  shouldn't be in places where we're traveling with human beings the question of substituting
*  artificial intelligence for empathic humans that is a question that we need to be constantly
*  discussing because it really once you talk about it and say does something that has no body
*  that was never a child that is that was never sick that doesn't know pain that was never in a family
*  that that never wanted love that was never rejected is that going to understand me
*  in the ways i need to be understood during covid is something that doesn't fear death
*  something that's going to understand my problems now and if not well it shouldn't be your
*  personal chat partner you need to find yourself a person and let the internet help us find people
*  all for that all for that let the internet help us find people i think that's good piece of advice
*  to end on so sherry turkle thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast my pleasure
*  do
