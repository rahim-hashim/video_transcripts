Welcome to that beloved Mindscape annual tradition, the Holiday Message. An opportunity for a quicker and less-well-thought-out solo episode to round off another year. Ironically, this year the theme is the importance of slowing down and thinking things out really well! Illustrated by two things that have been on my mind: a couple of internet/tech kerfuffles (Elon Musk buying Twitter, Sam Bankman-Fried and the collapse of FTX), and the distinction between foundations of physics and “regular” physics. See if you can dimly perceive the thread that ties them together.

# Mindscape Holiday Message 2022 | Thinking Really Slowly
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp1fTGDCadk)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and
*  this is our annual holiday message for 2022. It's a rainy day here in Baltimore,
*  my first December here in Baltimore, so if you hear little pitter-patter of
*  raindrops on the window right next to me, that's why something we didn't get too
*  much of in LA. You know, the idea behind the holiday message that I started doing
*  in the first year of the podcast would be a solo episode but something shorter,
*  not structured, not deep, not careful, more like a little reflective, self-indulgent
*  perhaps, more personal set of opinions about, I don't know, something that was
*  inspired by the year that had just passed, whether it was with the podcast or
*  the outside world or whatever is going on in my life. And I've not been great
*  about picking topics. I mean, I think the actual holiday message has been pretty
*  good but I really need to sit down and think every single year about what to
*  talk about. So this year I did think of a couple things. You know, obviously my
*  life has been completely uprooted, moving from LA and Caltech to Baltimore
*  and Johns Hopkins. Still haven't yet moved into the house that we will
*  eventually move into but that's coming later this week, so apologies if this is
*  a quick and dirty kind of episode. But there were two things that I kept
*  thinking about that certainly did not rise to the level of a whole episode and
*  I realized there was a through line through them that I could combine
*  together. And the two things were, on the one hand, things going on online and in
*  the tech world. And a subset of that, number one, Twitter obviously being bought by
*  Elon Musk, changing in various ways. I'm very active on Twitter so that is
*  affecting me. And the other one was the FTX crypto collapse featuring Sam
*  Bankman Fried about which I'm certainly no expert but nevertheless have some
*  opinions about. So that's something that I wanted to say something about in a
*  very narrow specific way. I have no way of commenting on the bigger picture
*  there. The other idea was again coming to Johns Hopkins and being now a
*  professor both in the physics department and the philosophy department
*  concentrating on foundations of physics. The idea that in some sense what
*  separates foundations of physics from just regular physics research is a
*  certain kind of patience, a certain kind of value in thinking slowly and carefully
*  about things. You know physicists in some sense are always thinking carefully
*  about something but they take some things they don't need to think
*  carefully about and put them in a little box and don't worry about it. And in
*  foundations of physics we really want to open precisely those boxes and dig into
*  them. And the common thread here is of course precisely that value of thinking
*  slowly. I think that in the small number of things I have to say about Twitter and
*  FTX they mostly center around you know boy people are really over valorizing
*  not thinking very carefully before doing something and then watching as the
*  consequences blow up in their faces. So in some sense both of these things this
*  sort of online set of kerfuffles and the difference between ordinary everyday
*  physics research and foundations of physics comes down to an appreciation for
*  thinking slowly and carefully. So the title of course blatantly stolen from
*  Daniel Kahneman's famous book Thinking Fast and Slow he's talking psychologically
*  about system one thinking which is sort of all of our beneath the surface
*  subconscious heuristic ways of thinking about the world, thinking fast ways that
*  we already have patterns for you know when you're driving to work if you
*  commute in the same way every day you're more or less on autopilot right
*  you know there the difference between playing guitar or playing a sport as an
*  expert who is all sort of automatic and you're in the flow zone versus someone
*  who's overthinking things like that. And then system two is the cognitive part of
*  your brain doing math problems writing text or something like that where you
*  really have to sit and think carefully about it. But I want to sort of I'm just
*  joking about the title by going further than that to thinking really slowly not
*  just being cognitive and doing a math problem but taking a breath thinking
*  about the context that some certain problem or situation resides in and
*  think about all of the connotations and insinuations and implications of what is
*  going on. Now in part this is kind of a cheap point to make I'm not claiming
*  that it is anyway profound I suspect that most mindscape listeners by virtue
*  of a very strong selection effect on whether or not you listen to mindscape
*  are already convinced that thinking carefully and slowly about things is a
*  good thing but maybe by looking at some particular examples we can flesh that
*  out a bit and I do want to stand up for the fact that the people who don't always
*  sit back and think very carefully about things aren't necessarily making
*  mistakes there are usually reasons for doing it that way and so it's important
*  to sort of separate out the conditions under which moving fast and breaking
*  things which is the Silicon Valley motto is the right thing to do versus
*  stepping back and kind of trying to be more careful in the China shop so that's
*  what we're gonna be doing here today and I think that's it holiday message 2022
*  happy holidays to everyone out there and let's go
*  I think perhaps of all the podcast episodes I've done here at mindscape so
*  well over 200 now the one that I keep quoting the most or coming back to the
*  most is the one with T Nguyen on the philosophy of games and gamification
*  that one really stuck with me really sort of shaped how I think about things
*  you keep hearing me refer back to it and part of that was because you know I
*  think the games are intrinsically interesting and you know certainly a
*  huge part of modern human life gamification is something very much to
*  worry about but T really extended it like a good philosopher should into a
*  realm way beyond what you might guess it would attach to he really emphasized the
*  allure of clarity and simplicity in worldviews and models of the world
*  and you know I think if you would ask me before that podcast about how important
*  clarity and simplicity are in a good model the world I would have been very
*  much in favor of them and still am in some way but what he was really
*  emphasizing was there is a downside there's a dark side to clarity in your
*  view of the world trying to get things to be too clear and too simple is
*  seductive because it makes you think you have answers for everything and that
*  opens you up to vulnerability to being a conspiracy theorist to generally
*  disdaining questioning yourself adding new nuance and carefulness into your way
*  of viewing the world and that can make you fall into a trap that can limit the
*  ways in which you think about and experience the world so like many ways
*  going back to Aristotle there's a happy medium maybe here to be struck between
*  looking for simplicity and clarity but not thinking you have it before you
*  really do that's the difficult thing to do so that's for the lens with which I
*  want to think about these things I'm talking about you know are people
*  oversimplifying the world for some purportedly sensible purpose and then
*  having it backfire on them so the first example is the purchase of Twitter by
*  Elon Musk and again there's much to say about this and I'm not going to in any sense give any
*  comprehensive response or set of thoughts to it it's just not something
*  that I've thought about systematically in any way so it would kind of be a
*  little hypocritical of me to you know pretend to have the complete theory of
*  that when I haven't thought about it systematically since my whole message
*  is the value virtue of thinking systematically at least the message in
*  this particular holiday message but you know it's been a mess honestly right I
*  am not in favor of the changes at Twitter since Elon bought it there's a
*  great increase in juvenile trolling including by the new owner ugly
*  interactions lack of moderation lack of direction for the company and so on
*  enough so that I personally have downshifted my own Twitter use you know
*  I'm not abandoning it yet I don't think that any of the currently existing
*  alternatives are comprehensive alternatives maybe they will grow into
*  it I actually am not going to pretend to be able to predict the future about
*  Twitter something like Twitter is really really useful I've made friends I've
*  learned a lot but it's also kind of a mess in many many ways so I'm spending
*  less time on social media in general and you know this is part of just a general
*  thought that you know you have only finite number of hours in the day only
*  three billion heartbeats in your lifetime how are you going to spend them
*  I did you know just as an example put up a joke on Twitter right is after Elon
*  had bought it and people were complaining the I was going to crash and
*  things like that and I said well you know maybe it would just be a good thing
*  if we took the year off and read some books and because it's Twitter people
*  immediately misinterpreted it in an uncharitable way as we should quit our
*  jobs and do nothing but read books when really I was just talking about
*  switching off social media and reading books instead and therefore I was
*  criticized for being too bourgeois and wealthy and not understanding people's
*  real lives and the whole bit this is part of the problem with a Twitter like
*  conversation system but the point being that you know there is a time and place
*  for quick hit reactions for instantaneous takes or whatever and
*  there's also a time and place for getting deep into something and maybe
*  we've lost the balance there a little bit and so rather than giving a
*  comprehensive response to the new regime at Twitter I do want to just focus in on
*  this idea that Elon or whoever is is helping him have just been way too
*  simplistic about how this should and does work this is shown in you know they
*  released a whole bunch of text messages that Elon had been sending about the
*  Twitter acquisition before it actually happened one of which was from some CEO
*  who says step one solve free speech I'm not making this up so you know that
*  just reveals so much just that not I mean maybe it was not meant to be
*  entirely serious but the idea that it is not simply parodying something but at
*  least you know meant to be pointing in the correct direction is just so absurd
*  to me and it pains me deeply because I think that the issue of free speech is
*  super duper important not and I mean that both because I think that free
*  speech is important but also what restrictions we should have on free
*  speech and in which context we should have them is super difficult that is
*  this is exactly an issue that requires really really carefully thinking about
*  it because it's not an absolutist yes or no thing it is a quintessential example
*  of balancing different kinds of values and different kinds of goals and that's
*  always going to be tricky you always have to sit down and think about it
*  carefully just listen to the podcast I did a few years ago with Teresa Bajan
*  about the history of it and the other modern version of it and you know
*  Teresa is someone who is a free speech scholar and has thought about it a lot
*  and she will admit and did a bit of the podcast you know she started off pretty
*  hardcore about being a free speech absolutist but has seen her thinking on
*  that sort of become more nuanced and careful as you think about it and what I
*  see happening online is that the phrase free speech is sort of degenerating
*  from a crucially important political philosophical concept into a slogan it
*  becomes a tribal identifier right you know are you in favor of free speech are
*  you or are you in favor of suppression of alternate ideas because you can't
*  handle the truth and that that's the level of simplicity that the
*  conversation is is degenerating into same thing with words like woke or
*  politically correct or whatever they become slogans by people who want to
*  make a point with them and use them for political advantage and that makes it
*  harder no matter what you might think about it no matter which side you're on
*  about any of these issues it makes it harder to have a careful conversation
*  because people want to load on a bunch of connotations for political purposes
*  to these existing phrases and so free speech is becoming like that and everyone
*  knows when Elon Musk bought Twitter you know he came in saying comedy is now
*  allowed on Twitter free speech is returned etc etc we're not going to do
*  anything except obey the law so if something is illegal we're gonna get
*  rid of it and if something is not we're gonna leave it on turns out it's
*  trickier than that it turns out that that's a hard thing to do even if you
*  just did that there's different countries with different laws it turns
*  out to be really difficult even to implement that way over simplistic
*  version of a moderation policy what do you and people wrote about this I'm sorry
*  I forget the names and the ability to therefore cite them but as soon as it
*  happened the purchase you know people who were very very experienced in this
*  field basically wrote articles saying here's how it's gonna go you're gonna
*  say oh you can do whatever you want on Twitter is completely free speech and
*  then someone's gonna say well what about you know death threats you go oh no okay
*  no death threats well what about hardcore pornography well no hard no
*  hardcore pornography and then what you realize very very simple very very
*  quickly is you are drawing a line everyone draws a line between what is
*  permitted and what is not permitted I mean there was just an example literally
*  today as I'm recording this where Elon famously said that he is such a big
*  believer in free speech that he would not disturb the Twitter account of the
*  guy who tracks his private plane guess what he just got rid of the Twitter
*  account of the guy who tracks his private plane and also all that guy's
*  other Twitter accounts it's hard and I'm not saying that he should or shouldn't
*  do that I'm saying it's hard and you have to think about it because there's
*  no magic formula you have to list all of the different considerations and see how
*  you personally value them and then guess what you have to talk to other people to
*  see how they value different things because they might not value them in the
*  same way and if you're doing something that involves a community getting input
*  and getting the opinions of the community is gonna turn out to be really
*  really useful so I think it's just a classic example of coming in thinking
*  that this field you know nothing about is gonna be pretty easy to fix you know
*  any possible complications that people might have had in mind was just because
*  they were prisoners of some outdated political point of view and then finding
*  out in the harsh light of day that's actually quite nuanced and tricky
*  whether you like it or not I will say parenthetically again not having thought
*  of it very deeply myself but it seems to me like some people are pointing at the
*  idea that if you do want to do it correctly the real problem is not where
*  to draw the line between what's allowed on Twitter and what's not allowed on
*  Twitter but the procedural question about who gets to moderate I mean really
*  the problem is not well one of the problems anyway is not just what got
*  moderated and what didn't but that the process for moderating things was
*  entirely opaque and it was in the hands of a very small number of people and
*  there's a scaling problem because any social media platform generally has a
*  huge number of users compared to the number of people working at the company
*  right so that's why when you get a tweet deleted or a Facebook message
*  deleted or whatever it can be really really hard to figure out why and it's
*  very very opaque they don't tell you what the standards are they don't tell
*  you why you personally have been blocked or banned or whatever and that's very
*  very frustrating so Noah Smith on Twitter has been emphasizing the
*  superiority in social media contacts of community moderation and I think that's
*  a very likely to be true idea you know I would I'd like to see more data and
*  empirical analysis about it but you should have the ability for communities
*  to self organize and decide what they think is a good moderation strategy I
*  know that Mastodon is doing something like that Mastodon is one of the Twitter
*  alternatives it has its own problems but I mean certainly the interface is super
*  clunky and very hard to use one of Twitter's advantages and attractions was
*  always how easy it was and not everyone catches on to the importance of that but
*  you know maybe something like that will happen Jack Dorsey who was the founder
*  and CEO former CEO of Twitter also has made very clear that he thinks now that
*  their problem was they were too opaque and they were trying to do it top-down
*  rather than having community moderation he has some sort of secret Twitter
*  alternative project Jack Dorsey that he's working on that is supposed to
*  remove social media from being owned by anybody I forget what it's called but
*  something like that might be the future you know it's just this is and there's a
*  whole nother interesting thing to think about from the perspective of complex
*  systems research right because there is a thought that you can just think really
*  hard and anticipate what all the problems are going to be and then write
*  bureaucratic trap right the bureaucratic trap is I can think ahead to every
*  possible circumstance that will happen in the future write a set of rules that
*  will deal with it and it always fails you know this is why bureaucracies are
*  horrible because they can't anticipate all the possible situations that a
*  complex system will find itself in that's why you need some kind of agency
*  some kind of ability for a smart careful considering person to think about the
*  actual situation you're in maybe it's unanticipated or unprecedented and deal
*  with that in some way or have a community do it not necessarily an
*  individual it's that top-down thinking you can predict everything belief they
*  just gets you in trouble with all sorts of complex systems whether it's a car
*  or a university or a social media platform so I think there's a clearly a
*  flaw here in the the idea that you just assume everything will be easy and then
*  what happens is you announce you're gonna do something it fails you have to
*  move back you know again just as I'm beginning to record this there was a
*  story on gizmodo about Twitter and how you know Elon Musk has scared away
*  various advertisers so he's looking for other ways to make money and he says
*  that gizmodo says there's a strategy being debated I guess Twitter HQ that
*  says that there's a new strategy that may mandate that you share your location
*  information and let Twitter sell your data to third parties and the company
*  may compel your consent for targeted advertising using your contacts and a
*  phone number that you provided for two-factor authentication this is almost
*  certainly illegal the article continues on gizmodo but you know this is an
*  example of well we're gonna try something we don't know if it's gonna
*  work but you know let's let's just see what happens because we're kind of
*  desperate now again as I said at the beginning I don't want to be too
*  one-sided here because it's a balancing issue once again it's not just a
*  balancing issue between different competing interests and therefore the
*  issue is difficult but there are good reasons to move fast and break things
*  sometimes you know we can be in situations again with complex systems
*  where you're in what is called a rugged fitness landscape in complex systems
*  research and also in evolutionary biology a fitness landscape is you have
*  some space of all possible choices space of all possible configurations or
*  genomes or systems or networks or whatever it is and all of these
*  specific configurations that you can imagine have a fitness how well they do
*  in their environment or how well they do at the task they're trying to work at
*  and because the space of parameters is so large whether it's your genome or
*  whether it's just all the different possible moderation policies that we
*  could have on Twitter these are complex systems and maybe you're in a situation
*  where given what your current choices are there's no short simple easy change
*  you could make that it would improve your life you are at a peak a local
*  maximum in the fitness landscape everywhere you change by a little bit
*  things would get worse but somewhere over there past the valley there's an
*  even higher peak in the fitness landscape right there is a way to evolve
*  if you're in evolutionary biology to an even better way of doing things but you
*  can't get there incrementally you have to go through a worse-off situation
*  before you can get that advantage so this is always a tricky thing in
*  evolutionary biology how do you get there sometimes it takes sort of a
*  disaster right the Cambrian explosion you get a whole bunch of extinctions
*  opening up new niches and then you can explore in a more open-ended way that's
*  how you find this new even higher fitness peak so that's a reason to move
*  fast and break things there are ruts that we have to get out of and there's a
*  there's a set of context in which that works very well and not less
*  analogically and in the real world it works very well in startups right if
*  you're starting something brand new there's clearly a value in doing
*  something totally different right doing something really really new is more
*  likely to be the next big thing but then when we're evaluating who has done
*  well there's a huge selection effect there's a thousand people trying
*  something new and crazy most new and crazy things fail and we look at the
*  one that succeeds and go aha genius they tried something new and crazy right
*  is a it's exactly like mutations mutations in evolutionary biology for an
*  established organism are usually bad there can be beneficial mutations but
*  they're exceedingly rare so we don't just say oh let's just mutate our genome
*  from generation to generation because we might get better at it there's a
*  difference between being early in the evolutionary history of life which is
*  like being a startup versus being later in the evolutionary history of life
*  where we figured some things out when you're running something established
*  Elon Musk did not come in and found a Twitter it was already up and running
*  and pretty big right so there's all this complexity all this
*  interconnectedness it's like any computer programmer knows when you're
*  trying to improve some legacy code when you have some code that has been going
*  on for decades and you've been building on it and modifying it you don't know
*  what's gonna happen when you delete some module or subroutine or something
*  like that you can't see that it has any use but somehow it's really really
*  important in a way that you don't know that's again the nature of complex
*  systems and indeed in evolutionary biology the rate of mutations was way
*  higher early in the history of life than it is now you know I think in some sense
*  and I know that not everyone agrees but I think that Elon Musk is in some sense
*  very sincere about his care for humanity and the earth you know he could have
*  done many things to make money but between SpaceX and Tesla as an electric
*  car company I think that he really did a huge amount to change the world in
*  ways that most people don't now that's not to say that he's at all good at
*  hurt at helping actual people along the way his track record at dealing with
*  employees and things like that is very very bad okay but I don't think that
*  he's sort of an evil genius I think that he in his mind is perfectly sincere
*  about saving humanity he's just not been very good at it in his late phase what
*  is going on now let's put it in his career okay which is a little bit
*  different than the other example which is SPF Sam Bankman Fried and the FTX
*  crypto exchange where unlike with Twitter where I'm an active user I know
*  nothing about the world of crypto etc but how can you help but be drawn in to
*  this story this guy this young guy Sam Bankman Fried had a net wealth that went
*  from 26 billion dollars estimated to zero in a remarkably short period of
*  time because of the collapse of his crypto exchange FTX and it was not just
*  bad management it seems very very clear that there was outright fraud going on
*  in a lot of ways and just like Elon Musk turns out to be you know inveterate
*  oversharer on the internet SPF as he is known has done a lot of interviews since
*  his collapse where he basically says oh yeah you know a lot of the stuff I did
*  was just kind of fooling people to get them to give me money and then you know
*  he claims he's not responsible for the actual fraud but it kind of seems like
*  he is it's pretty clear that he is and the question is and so you know a lot of
*  people invested a lot of people put their money in his crypto exchange and
*  a huge number of people and not just people off the street there was a
*  community he one of SPF's strategies was he was extremely active in effective
*  altruism which our former podcast guest Will McCaskill was a founder of is a
*  founder of and is still very active in and Will was very close to SPF in fact
*  introduced SPF and Elon Musk to each other I don't think they did anything
*  together but that he tried and so you can ask how can someone who I think is
*  extremely smart and is absolutely a hundred percent sincere like Will
*  McCaskill how can he get taken in by someone who is more or less clearly not
*  like SPF and you know there's probably lots of psychological explanations there
*  but I think that part of it is a way that we think about smartness right you
*  know there's a couple of little factoids that I will share that shaped my
*  thinking here one is there's this video that you can see of there's a infamous
*  pitch to investors that SPF was doing he was doing a zoom call where he was you
*  know trying to get people to invest and you know when you're doing a zoom call
*  your you know your eyes are glancing around you know you're not necessarily
*  making eye contact maybe your camera is not where your screen is etc okay so
*  it's a little bit different kind of interaction but it turns out he was
*  playing video games the whole time and you know while he was he was talking
*  right he was making sense and he was making his pitch but he was not
*  completely concentrating on the task at hand he was playing a video game in the
*  background and the interesting thing is not that the interesting thing is that
*  the investors when they found out thought it was awesome they're like wow
*  how smart is this guy that he can make such a smooth slick talking pitch like
*  that while his attention is distracted by a video game and that just amazes me
*  this is why I'll never be an investor I'd be like how what why in the world
*  would that be considered good why in the world would you find out that someone
*  was completely their attention was completely elsewhere while they were
*  asking you to give them a whole bunch of money and go wow that person's really
*  smart that would I'm not gonna say what my response would be but it would not be
*  that let's let's just put it that way it's a valorization of a kind of glib
*  quickness and fast talking over careful thought I see this in guest suggestions
*  for the podcast all the time I get lots of great guest suggestions for
*  mindscape and I often take them many of my guests have been people I didn't know
*  about before but people suggested them so I look them up but I get way more
*  suggestions than I can possibly ever take and some of them are you know you
*  should talk to this person because they're really really smart and I and I
*  say like well okay what are they smart about what have they done what you know
*  what is the topic that they're that they know more about than anyone else and the
*  answer is like everything they just good at everything they have a take on
*  absolutely everything in the world and that is a complete turnoff to me that
*  gives me a very bad feeling I'm instantly repelled by that idea you know
*  it's it's there's value and it's good to be quick and to have opinions about
*  things breadth is good but so is depth you need a little bit of both again you
*  know there's there's if you're going to be a pundit if you're going to be just a
*  commentator then that kind of breadth and ability to bounce back and forth
*  from topic to topic is very valuable an essayist let's put it in the most
*  positive light that we can right and there's an absolutely a place for that a
*  critic an essayist there's absolutely a place but mostly not exclusively but
*  mostly I'm looking for the depth when I'm here on the podcast I'm looking for
*  people who have really thought through the nuances of something as a person I
*  would want both as a podcast guest I'm looking more for the depth the other
*  clue and again I'm gonna keep saying this over and over again I have not read
*  very carefully about this I'm just giving my off-the-cuff opinions but
*  there's a quote by SPF where he told the journalists that he thinks every book is
*  a mistake he would never read a book no one should ever write books every book
*  should just be a blog post it's a waste of time and again I'm thinking wow like
*  how in the world could so many smart people think that that was the sign of
*  a true genius person who's gonna make a lot of money and make the world a better
*  place there's warning signs here you're ignoring the red flags to me like I think
*  that even if you want some new hot shot brand-new idea get it from someone who
*  shows some interest in being a little more careful and deep than that and with
*  that let's switch gears a little bit from you talk about foundations of
*  physics which sounds like a completely different topic and it is a completely
*  different topic but there's a through line here once again and by the way I
*  should tell you what I mean by foundations of physics because it's a
*  slightly different thing philosophy of physics is of course a well-established
*  field as his foundations of physics but the more common phrase you will hear is
*  philosophy of physics or philosophy of science and foundations is sort of some
*  maybe a subset of philosophy of physics but also you can do foundations of
*  physics without being a philosopher at all just sort of a certain kind of
*  careful deep way of doing physics philosophy of physics might include a
*  lot of you know theory choice and methodology and epistemology or even
*  history of physics whereas foundations of physics is really the same goal as
*  physics philosophy of physics is sometimes trying to describe and
*  understand the process by which physics gets done foundations of physics is
*  trying to understand the universe is trying to understand nature is trying
*  to understand reality just like physics is but it's doing it in a way right it's
*  a style within the our attempts to understand nature better and I was
*  thinking about this because I gave an introductory talk here at Johns Hopkins
*  at the physics department a little talk on you know foundations of physics
*  boot camp what ways what is foundations of physics and in what ways might it be
*  helpful to actual working physicists so I had a chance to think about what the
*  answer to that question is and there's lots of answers and it's actually a
*  case where it's probably better to just so go through the examples and decide
*  for yourself what their commonality is but one theme I kept returning to was
*  patience in other words the idea of being willing to say well why is that
*  true okay why is that true why exactly is this thing true physicists as much
*  as I love them and M1 of them they are very happy to get the right answer for
*  the wrong reasons they are very very focused on getting the right answer
*  saying the thing is the what the thing is that nature does that will be
*  predicted by their models that will be seen by their experiments that's not a
*  bad thing you know getting the right answer is a very very good thing but
*  sometimes you get the right answer and you don't have real clarity on why you
*  have gotten it but you have a set of things you can say that are kind of good
*  enough right quantum mechanics is the obvious example here where almost a
*  hundred years after the Solvay conference we still don't have a
*  consensus on what's going on in quantum mechanics but we have no trouble using
*  it right we can make the predictions for the LHC or for superconductors or
*  whatever without knowing the ontology of quantum mechanics and as you know if you
*  listen to me talking about these things the vast vast majority of physicists are
*  perfectly happy with that you know it's one thing to say that we have a
*  challenge there's something we don't understand there's always things we
*  don't understand the weird thing about the foundations of quantum mechanics is
*  how happy we are with not understanding you know with we're professional
*  physicists and yet we're perfectly content to leave some of these really
*  really deep questions about physics by the wayside and I think that's kind of
*  wrong and it's not only quantum mechanics in quantum field theory there
*  are deep foundational questions there's something called Hogg's theorem HAAG
*  Rudolph Hogg which was developed by other people also but I'm not going to
*  go into it because it's very very nuanced and even the philosophers and
*  foundation people foundations of physics people argue about what it says and what
*  it means but basically the seeming implication of Hogg's theorem is that
*  there's a way that in quantum field theory we go about actually doing
*  calculations which is we often turn off the interactions of our electrons and
*  photons for example so we can just understand what the world would be like
*  if there were no interaction so there's electrons or photons flying freely not
*  interacting with each other and then we turn on the interactions let them
*  interact and then turn them back off again and we sort of try to match the
*  behavior of the interacting theory to the non-interacting theory to make a
*  prediction and roughly speaking Hogg's theorem says that you can't do this that
*  you can't do this in a way that preserves a lot of the structure you want
*  to preserve like the behavior of different fields and their commutation
*  relations and so forth so this naively says you know again naively that
*  everything we do to make predictions at large Hadron collider is complete
*  nonsense but guess what it works really really well so I know that it works and
*  it does work for a reason but we're not very sure what that reason is and to me
*  I would like to be more sure what that reason is and maybe the reason is simple
*  but it's not something I don't think we currently understand and there's other
*  examples as well the arrow of time the fact that you need a past hypothesis of
*  early low entropy is something that is just not understood by most physicists
*  who are teaching statistical mechanics the foundations of statistical mechanics
*  is a very important and open area in my own field whether it's cosmology or
*  particle physics we talk a lot about fine-tuning and naturalness you know
*  whether certain parameters are natural whether they're fine-tuned whether we
*  should be surprised whether you need a multiverse whether you know there's some
*  dynamical mechanisms guess what we have not as a physics community thought very
*  carefully about what that means some people have tried they've not done a
*  great job honestly but so again we're using these ideas without knowing
*  exactly what they're on about because we want to hurry up and get the answer we
*  don't have the patience to think really slowly about what we're doing and
*  there's a very strong motivation for that getting the right result getting
*  the right model predicting the outcome of the experiment that's ultimately what
*  we want to do and again there's a there's an analogy with the startups
*  right if you try a million different startups and most of them fail there is
*  a very strong weeding mechanism right you're you're gonna try to make money
*  you're trying to make a product that becomes popular in the marketplace so
*  there is a criterion for success and failure likewise in physics if you have
*  some ideas there's a very strong criterion for success and failure are
*  you predicting the right experimental outcomes when you're in a situation
*  where you have huge guidance from experimental or empirical data wrong
*  ideas get shot down quickly and so go ahead you know you can get a lot of
*  right ideas just because nature guides you to them kicking and screaming but
*  sometimes there are important questions for which the experimental guidance is
*  kind of meager right when we're talking about why is the cosmological constant a
*  small number why is the mass of the Higgs boson so much lower than the
*  Planck scale these are potentially fraught questions with sort of physical
*  implications because maybe the answer is something to do with supersymmetry or
*  some new physics or something like that but there's no immediate experimental
*  guidance to how to think about it so what happens is the old ways of thinking
*  that were perfectly good when the experiment would just tell you when you
*  were wrong aren't as much help in these deeper more foundational questions and
*  so you need to think a little bit more carefully to ask why you thought that a
*  certain number was natural in the first place and so on and I think there's a
*  lot of ways that this foundational thinking can help with good old physics
*  you know I think this is clearly true in quantum mechanics I'm increasingly
*  thinking it's true in cosmology that's one of the big things I want to write
*  papers about in the next couple years I think there's sort of a lot of ways we
*  could improve our understanding of naturalist and fine-tuning in cosmology
*  by thinking foundationally by thinking more carefully more slowly even than we
*  do so to close I'll try to give you an example an extended story that that
*  maybe speaks to the helpfulness the usefulness of thinking carefully and
*  slowly about theoretical physics even if you don't really care about the
*  philosophical side of things you just care about the physics side of things so
*  in the early 1950s David Bohm was a young assistant professor at Princeton
*  and he ultimately got in trouble he was he had communist sympathies he had hung
*  out with some communists back in the day that prevented him from working at Los
*  Alamos during the Manhattan Project and in the early 50s it was the height of the
*  Red Scare the McCarthy era the House on American Activities Committee and he ran
*  into trouble with them and eventually the president of Princeton locked him
*  out of his office and fired him and he couldn't even get jobs anywhere in the
*  United States he had to move to Brazil that's not the story that I'm thinking of
*  I'm thinking of a different story about David Bohm in the early 1950s which is
*  that he wrote a textbook on quantum mechanics and it was a very
*  straightforward you know conventional wisdom textbook he was not trying to
*  rock the boat or anything like that but it was still you know I wouldn't say the
*  early days of quantum mechanics but things were still settling and they were
*  still in the afterglow of the early days where all the possibilities were being
*  debated and we hadn't quite settled in on the final answers so Bohm talks about
*  the possibility of hidden variables in his book so in other words the idea that
*  not only is there a quantum mechanical wave function but there are other
*  physical quantities that go into determining your quantum theory and he
*  didn't talk about it in any great depth he merely quoted a theorem by John von
*  Neumann that proved apparently supposedly that hidden variables were
*  impossible that they you could never reproduce the success of quantum
*  mechanics with hidden variables the problem is that von Neumann's proof and
*  was a genius mathematical physicist but his proof was written in his book the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics and or was it that was it the mathematical
*  principles of quantum mechanics I'm not gonna remember the title of von Neumann's
*  book but the book had not yet been translated into English it was only in
*  German and like many other Americans Bohm was not a German speaker but at
*  Princeton there was someone who cared very very deeply about the foundations
*  of quantum mechanics and did speak German namely Albert Einstein so
*  Einstein saw Bohm's book and leaf leafed through it and summoned him to his
*  office right so when you get a summon to go to Albert Einstein's office you go
*  and Einstein says you know look you say that this thing is proven here but he
*  opens von Neumann's book in Germany says like it he's making all these
*  assumptions that might not be true this doesn't prove anything at all about the
*  real world and Einstein was right as Einstein very often was and it made a
*  big impression on Bohm so Bohm went back and started thinking about it and said
*  well okay if that proof doesn't quite prove the sweeping conclusion that it
*  is apparently trying to lead to can you make a theory of hidden variables and so
*  he did he made a theory called Bohmian mechanics and it's actually very close
*  to a previous theory by Louis de Broglie so sometimes we call it de Broglie-Bohm
*  theory and he wrote about it and you know the secret is to be non-local the
*  hidden variables in Bohm's theory have explicitly non-local interactions what
*  one particle at one point in the universe is doing is affected by other
*  particles elsewhere and no one cared no one was really interested I mean Bohm's
*  thesis advisor was J. Robert Oppenheimer who says okay we now we can just ignore
*  him because he's gone you know he's gone a little crazy modifying quantum
*  mechanics there was one person who was not unimpressed who was very very
*  stricken by Bohm's result who was called John Bell John Bell at the time was a
*  physicist at CERN working again on very normal quantum field theory particle
*  physics kind of problems but he had this interest in the foundations of quantum
*  mechanics and he read Bell's he read Bohm's papers and was really struck by
*  how like apparently Bohm was doing something that was supposed to be
*  important and he noticed that there was non-locality in there and so Bell says I
*  wonder if this non-locality that is part of Bell's part of Bohm's theory is
*  necessary could we get rid of it right and he ends up proving Bell's theorems
*  and deriving the Bell inequalities which basically says that you need some kind
*  of non-locality in quantum mechanics again under certain technical assumptions
*  you can get rid of but it's a very sweeping kind of thing and he he really
*  gives away of delineating which kinds of correlations you will get in a quantum
*  mechanical like theory and in some kind of local more classical kind of theory
*  and again you know he was hiding from his friends Bell did not want his
*  colleagues had certain to know about it he was working on weekends he finished
*  the paper during a sabbatical the whole thing and it didn't make when he
*  published his papers didn't make a big splash but so as we now know it did
*  eventually make a big splash the Bell inequalities became of great interest to
*  people working on quantum information and entanglement and the most recent
*  Nobel Prize was given to Clauser, Aspey and Zeilinger for their experimental
*  tests of the Bell inequalities and the punchline to this whole story is the
*  Nobel Committee when giving out the press release announcing the Nobel Prize
*  completely got it wrong they wrote in their press release that John Bell had
*  proven that hidden variable theories were impossible which is exactly the
*  opposite of the truth what he proved was that non-local was the only way to be a
*  hidden variable theory local hidden variable theories are impossible again
*  modulo sum possible more assumptions you have to make but Bell was a huge booster
*  of hidden variable theories Bell was always telling people that we should
*  teach Bohmian mechanics in quantum mechanical textbooks he didn't quite
*  absolutely have a belief in it but he has certainly his favorite theory of
*  quantum mechanics was Bohmian mechanics so to to present Bell's theorem as a
*  proof that hidden variable theories can't work is exactly backwards so you
*  know if even the Nobel Committee can make mistakes like this I think that
*  maybe there is some value to thinking more carefully about these issues I
*  think that you know physicists absolutely do think carefully about
*  their narrow technical problems that's one of the ways that physicists have
*  been amazingly effective at making such enormous strides in understanding the
*  universe by just digging super deeply into a particular kind of thing and the
*  really good ones know more than one kind of thing and they can bring them
*  together and make connections and that's great but you don't just say ah okay
*  it's working let's just move on with it right I don't know how to actually make
*  people think more deeply about things you know you you joke about things I
*  think maybe like have a new rule where you're only allowed to publish papers in
*  even number years and an odd number of years you have to read a book or read
*  many books or read other people's papers I don't know what the ways to change the
*  incentive structures are but I do think that whether it's being a working
*  physicist or a tech mogul trying to change the world we should place a
*  little bit more value than we do on going deeply being patient thinking
*  carefully thinking very very slowly about the very difficult questions that
*  we're trying to address and with that very paternalistic kind of message not
*  especially inspired message but I hope one that you are prepared already to
*  take to heart happy holidays everybody as you know I take next week off things
*  to do and I'll see you on the flip side early January with a whole new year of
*  the mindscape podcast thanks for your support this year take care
