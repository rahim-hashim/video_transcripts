String theory, the current leading candidate for a theory of quantum gravity as well as other particles and forces, doesn't connect directly to the world we see. It's possible that there is a large landscape of possible states of theory, with the hope that one of them represents our universe. The existence of a landscape implies the existence of a corresponding swampland -- universes that are not compatible with string theory. I talk with Cumrun Vafa, a respected physicist and originator of the swampland program, about how we might use constraints on what kinds of physics are compatible with string theory to make predictions about cosmology and other experimental regimes.

Cumrun Vafa received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University. He is currently Hollis Professor of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy, and Chair of the Physics Department, at Harvard University. He has done fundamental work on the dynamics of superstrings, the entropy of black holes, F-theory, and other topics. Among his awards are the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the Dirac Medal, and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences.

# Mindscape 277 | Cumrun Vafa on the Universe According to String Theory
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK_jKhhRyDo)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Those
*  of you who were old enough, are old enough, to have been paying attention to
*  physics, blogs, and magazines, and books in the early part of the 21st century, in
*  the 2000s, might remember the string wars. There was a slightly public debate about
*  the status of string theory, one of the most popular ways of trying to get a
*  quantum theory of gravity. String theory, you know, was born in the late 60s, early
*  70s, nobody paid any attention to it, became hugely popular suddenly in the
*  1980s when John Schwartz and Michael Green showed that certain flaws that it
*  might have, and that many theories do have, string theory did not have, the
*  anomalies canceled is the short version, that was the first super string
*  revolution. Then there's a second super string revolution in the 90s where
*  Polchinski and Witten and other people used D-brains and non-perturbative
*  things to say that there were dualities that united all the string theories, very
*  exciting once again. But ten years after that, by the mid-2000s, there was a
*  backlash and people like Lee Smolin, former Mindscape guest, Peter Wojt, and
*  other people wrote books and talked a lot on the internet about how string theory
*  was not really physics, it was not successful as physics anyway, there were
*  no predictions, there never would be predictions, etc. This backlash had
*  essentially no impact on physics research, it didn't affect who got hired
*  by physics departments or what research people were doing or anything like that,
*  but it had a huge impact on public perception, so much so that I was
*  communicating, I forget exactly why, with an editor from New Scientist back in 2007 and I
*  mentioned string theory, the most popular theory of quantum gravity, etc. and they
*  said, wait, people still do string theory in 2007? And I said yes, it's actually
*  still quite popular in leading physics departments around the world. So I ended
*  up writing an article for New Scientist about how string theory is not dead yet
*  and I explained that I'm not a string theorist, this should not be my job, but
*  anyway, still not dead, almost 20 years after that. However, it is absolutely
*  fair to say that it can be frustrating to try to figure out this theory that is
*  extremely rich in its structure and its content and has led to all sorts of
*  provocative ideas like holography and ADS-CFT and all these things, but still
*  hasn't really made a prediction for an experiment that you could go and
*  directly test, what is the status of it? If you go back to the interview I did
*  with Brian Greene on Mindscape some time ago, Brian, a very effective, very
*  influential string theorist, was very honest that maybe it will just end up
*  being math and not really be supported by physics departments after all. Or
*  maybe today's podcast episode will change your mind about that. So we're
*  very happy to have Kurmanwafa, who is one of the leading string theorists of the
*  world, department chair of physics at Harvard, and as you will find out he has
*  natural philosophy in his job title, which I was very pleased to learn, and
*  Kurman has done many very important things in the history of string
*  theory. He worked with, again, former Mindscape guest Andy Strominger to
*  count the microscopic states in certain kinds of black holes and show that you
*  get the entropy right from a string theory perspective, etc. But for a while
*  now, for almost 20 years, he has been pursuing what is called the Swampland
*  Program. You may have heard of the string theory landscape, the idea there's
*  many different theories that you could get at low energies in the late universe
*  by compactifying extra dimensions in string theory. What the Swampland
*  Program proposes is that there are many theories that you cannot get by
*  starting with string theory and compactifying. And so there's so many
*  that you can, it seems like a lot, but the argument is that there's even many
*  more, infinitely many more, that you cannot get. Those are the Swampland
*  Theories. So there are certain, in other words, constraints on observable low
*  energy physics that you naturally get from demanding that the low energy
*  physics you get be part of a more fully complete theory of quantum gravity,
*  namely string theory. And so that may be true, but how useful is it? And I knew
*  about the Swampland Program for a while now, and I was sort of following from
*  afar. It tried to make some statements about cosmology and about
*  particle physics and things like that. You have to be careful. You don't want
*  your beautiful theory of everything to already be ruled out, but you do want it
*  to be rule-outable, right? You want it to be falsifiable, if it can be. So that's a
*  fine line to walk, but ultimately the theory decides what it is, not we human
*  beings. So in the episode today, I clearly have not been following well enough
*  because I learned a lot about the Swampland Program, and in particular a
*  very specific set of ideas that come out of it about dark matter and dark energy
*  and how that fits in with particle physics and so forth. Clearly very
*  speculative, conjectural, don't get too excited, but the reason why I even
*  mention it here in the intro is that it clearly disproves the idea that 20 years
*  ago string theory was dead, that you couldn't connect it to observations,
*  that there's no possible way of doing that. It's true that we didn't
*  have very careful specific guidance from observations, but we had to think more
*  carefully about the theory, and maybe what we're talking about today's episode
*  will lead to direct confrontation between the string theory and experiment.
*  Maybe it won't, maybe we'll all go away, that's the nature of physics, right? We
*  have to do the work and then we'll find out whether it fits or not, but first
*  you got to do the work. So that's a good lesson to learn, whether or not this
*  particular theory ends up being the right theory of gravity and cosmology and
*  so forth. Occasional reminder, you're allowed to support the Mindscape podcast

*  very much keeps me going here at Mindscape. So with that, let's go.
*  Kermen Bappa, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. Thank you, thank you Sean for
*  having me, it's great to be here and talk with you about science. You know, the
*  first question I have to ask is that is it in fact true that you are a professor
*  of natural philosophy? Professor of mathematics and natural philosophy?
*  Hollis, professor of mathematics and natural philosophy, that's what it is.
*  This is the oldest chair in science in the United States. It was given to
*  Harvard, gifted to Harvard by Hollis. I think it was 1726, the last year that
*  Newton lived. So Newton was still alive where, presumably where this was gifted
*  and the terms of the chair, it says nothing about teaching Newtonian
*  mechanics surprisingly. It talks about other kinds of physics but not Newtonian.
*  So it surprised me to see that. That was too cutting-edge at the time probably,
*  but I don't know if you know but I am also a professor of natural
*  philosophy, that is my title at Johns Hopkins. But unlike yours, mine is only a year and a
*  half old, not many hundreds of years old. Oh I see, and probably yours does not
*  have any funny spelling like mine, mathematics where it has a K. That's right,
*  we spell mathematics correctly here at Johns Hopkins. So let's just dive in to the idea of string theory.
*  I mean string theory is obviously, I'm sure everyone in the audience has heard
*  of it, probably 85% of them have strong opinions about it one way or the other,
*  and they probably know that it involves replacing particles with little strings.
*  But why don't you give us the sales pitch for what makes string theory different
*  from other attempts to quantize gravity? We hear claims about how string theory is
*  the most promising theory of quantum gravity we have. Where did that originally come from, that feeling?
*  So the problem has been when you take gravity and quantize it with the usual rules of particle physics,
*  you get nonsensical answers when you try to compute physical processes using it.
*  So the physical processes are organized in terms of the degree of approximation or what we call the loop expansion,
*  and the higher and higher degrees that you go, the more and more divergent things you get in quantum gravity
*  and things all look good if you just view it as particle physics kind of technology.
*  So if you view gravity as a particle and we call that graviton, that does not seem to work.
*  So string theories claim to fame or why we think is an exciting theory is that
*  when you try to study just vibrating strings, relativistic vibrating strings,
*  basically means that these guys go with the speed of light here and there, and they have
*  properties which respect relativity. Then you amazingly find that among these excitations,
*  the light excitations and the massless excitation includes graviton, along with these other
*  excitations which correspond to higher oscillating modes of string which are more massive.
*  So you get a tower of particles, the lightest of which is gravity. Now the surprise was that
*  when you try to compute these corrections to physical processes, you find that what used to
*  be infinite suddenly becomes finite. That was remarkable because it wasn't put in by hand,
*  that somehow magically it becomes finite. The physical aptitudes and processes we compute become
*  well-defined. This was kind of a shock because first of all, we were not trying, by we I mean
*  the people who originally thought of string theory, they were not trying to describe gravity.
*  Gravity was an afterthought. They noticed that they have some particle which is massless that has
*  the same spin as graviton and they later identified it with graviton.
*  And somehow without putting it by hand, it gave you that and then the physical processes which
*  they computed became finite automatically in this theory. And it had very different symmetries than
*  the particle physics did. So it used some stringy symmetry. So I will try to explain one example of
*  what this stringy symmetry is that particle physics doesn't see. So imagine a string like a little
*  loop, like a circle and imagine this loop going around and coming back to itself. So if you look
*  at what the loop spans, this loop as a string, the circle as it goes around spans a donut,
*  what we call a torus. Now there are two sides to it. One is the cross-sectional side, which is the
*  string itself and then the other one is the path it went through the other circles. So there are two
*  circles involved and the size of these two circles can be different and you can choose different
*  sizes. Now one of the symmetries of the string is that, well actually you can revert which one is
*  the string and which one is the path you're going through. In other words, you could view the other
*  one as a string and the path going around as a cross-sectional path versus the other one.
*  And so in this way you revert the roles of these two radii and this kind of symmetry,
*  which is manifest in the picture I just told you, is absent in the particle physics kind of situation
*  and this is one of the main reasons you get finiteness in the string variability. So it is
*  a key fact that is a one-dimensional object or a higher dimensional object for this to come out.
*  So we see that it could not have been done in the context of just graphiton viewed as particles.
*  So this was the origin of why string theory became popular in terms of studying as a candidate for
*  quantum gravity and there has been a huge amount of things that we have learned about string theory,
*  which is not just about quantum gravity. It's about also quantum field theory, about various
*  properties or other things that we didn't expect and it has enhanced our understanding of not just
*  quantum gravity but of all physics. Dualities that we have discovered and all that that we can
*  talk about, they're all kind of enriched our understanding of broader meaning of what a
*  consistent physical theory is. And so when people say, I just want to make sure that
*  we're separating out the sort of careful claims from the short little mottos, when people say
*  string theory is a finite theory of gravity, is that 100% established or is that within a
*  certain regime or do we even know what string theory is deep down? So there are different
*  amounts of establishment. First of all, at the level of computing perturbation theory, which means
*  these order by order corrections, it has been established as finite. So at least we know it's
*  finite in that sense. Now there's also a process where you can go beyond these corrections one by
*  one and see the whole thing, does the whole thing finite or not? Given that the first one is finite,
*  we think the other one should also be finite. So that one is not proven. Though there are
*  symmetries that I alluded to which maps this problem to another one which in some sense,
*  no, it's finite. And in those cases, we can say at least in this example, we know that particular
*  string theory is finite even beyond an approximation scheme that we computed. So the option of the
*  answer to your question is that depends on the exact details of what we know, but we have enough
*  evidence to believe it is finite. But I do hear that people still ask themselves the question,
*  what is string theory? Yes, what is string theory is not an easy question to answer
*  precisely because of the following. What we learned about string theory, and I think this
*  is probably the most important discovery of string theory, is the discovery of duality symmetries.
*  Duality symmetry basically is telling you that the fundamental description of a theory is ambiguous.
*  That if somebody told you that this theory is made of x or y or z ingredients, then they have by
*  definition picked a particular vantage point which is not the full theory. So when we say a theory is
*  a theory about strings, we have also taken that vantage point of something. So then the question
*  becomes what is this bigger thing that includes all of these things without referring to any
*  specific one? And that's naturally much harder to define because we get our understanding by
*  going to corners and by corners of parameter space, that's what I mean. You choose some
*  particular parameters where strings emerges as objects that you can actually study. That
*  means they are like basically you can think about them as classical objects that you can view them
*  and evolve them and study them. This happens only in specific corners. The totality of what is
*  possible includes also places where this cannot be done. So therefore when we say what is string
*  theory, we should clearly not refer only to these particular corners where some particular
*  structures emerge, but the bigger picture of what this whole thing is. And this whole thing
*  does not just include one-dimensional loops of energy which we call strings. It could have
*  other corners where you have higher dimensional objects, for example, being relevant for the
*  discussions. And so this mishmash of objects which we can morph from one to the other as you go from
*  one parameter corner to the other is called the duality symmetries in string theory. And this is
*  precisely why it's most exciting and also very hard to define what you mean by string theory.
*  Good. So I have a way of thinking about dualities and I'm not sure if I'm right,
*  so I'm going to run it by you and tell me if I'm on the right track. I think of dualities as when
*  you have a single quantum theory that has multiple different classical limits or maybe multiple
*  different classical theories you could quantize to get that single quantum theory. Is that how
*  string theorists think about it? Kind of, yes. So in other words, you have multiple limits which
*  classical picture emerges, exactly. But those are only corners for us and that bigger collection of
*  things, that's the middle thing, is the bulk of it, I would say. So those limits are only your
*  approximation schemes allow you to say something. But the bulk of it is middle and that one we don't
*  have a good say of what it is that we are talking about. And that's the main question. Yeah, okay,
*  good. So moving gradually in the direction of the real world, the most famous thing about string
*  theory is that it seems to want to live in 10-dimensional space-time. And I do not live in
*  10-dimensional space-time, so somehow you need to hide the extra dimensions. Is that still how
*  people think about it? Yeah, so when you say you don't live in 10-dimensional space-time, what you
*  really I think probably are alluding to is that the space that you can see with your eye is
*  three-dimensional and the time that you experience is only one-dimensional and that's your four
*  dimensional space-time. It does not mean that there are no other dimensions because you may
*  not be experiencing smaller spaces around you in the same way as you experience the macroscopic
*  dimensions. So therefore, in some sense, the first statement is that you don't really know
*  in which dimensions you live in. You can only say that you live in at least three macroscopic
*  dimensions and one temporal dimension. But what the other dimension is you could say, I don't know.
*  And that's the way I think we would say it to begin with, namely, we don't experience them because
*  they might be very tiny and so you could imagine at every point in space another tiny circle or
*  many, many circles of different dimensions or spheres of different dimensions at each point in
*  space. And if they are so tiny, you wouldn't see these other dimensions so your eye is not sensitive
*  to them or more precisely our experimental archivists cannot see that fine detail to
*  distinguish it. And it's true that in string theory, at least the most
*  natural perturbative corner, the corner in which we have a classical string theory emerging,
*  indeed has nine spatial dimensions and one temporal one. But it doesn't imply that these
*  nine dimensions are all big. It could be three of them are big, six of them are small, whatever.
*  So therefore, there is no a priori contradiction with string theory itself being describing the
*  universe we live in. And that's only one corner of this bigger theory. The string itself is only
*  one corner. So we don't know whether we are at that corner or a different corner where there's
*  no actual one dimensional object oppresses the two dimensional object. Instead of a one dimensional
*  string excited, maybe there's a two dimensional object excite relevant for the discussion. We
*  don't know which exact corner we are at. So therefore, the statement of which dimension
*  we are at will also depend on that because for example, another corner of string theory can have
*  11 dimensions, 10 spatial dimensions and one temporal one. For example, that's called the
*  M-theory, the bit in which membrane becomes an interesting object and so forth. So depending on
*  which corners we are ending up, we will have different descriptions. And perhaps I would say
*  that the lesson of dualities is that we cannot say exactly what is the dimension, the dimension of
*  the physics because we can only say in this particular corner it looks like this many
*  macroscopic dimension is the right picture. And then there are some internal dimension,
*  which is hard to disentangle and see because there could be dual descriptions of that one
*  in particular. So the notion of dimension is also not an invariant concept. So just like the notion
*  of what is basic fundamental entities is not the right concept, it's not invariant concept,
*  you cannot make precise what do you mean what is basic fundamental entities, it only gets a
*  meaning in some particular corners. This notion of dimension also does not have an invariant notion
*  and it gets its meaning only in specific corners of parameter space. Do we think this is getting a
*  little, I worry this is getting a little vague. So this is this famous, you have in mind and I have
*  in mind this famous picture of M theory where it looks like a six-pointed kind of blob and M
*  theory is the whole thing and there's the different points are different varieties of string theory.
*  Is that basically right? Well, I was not, some people say exactly as you just said,
*  I was here alluding to M theory as one of the corners, not the whole thing. You can also,
*  some people have called the whole thing, but I think that confuses the issue because
*  the reason I don't like that terminology is that usually the 11th dimension is viewed as the M
*  theory corner. And some people thought that is the whole description and that's not the correct way
*  of saying it. So it's more democratic. One corner is 11 dimensional and that one I'm going to call
*  M theory. The rest of it I'm not going to call any particular theory. Some people do call it the
*  whole thing M theory or string theory if you wish, even though string theory has 10 dimensional
*  limit 11. So that's up to your taste in some sense. So sometimes I call it the whole thing
*  against string theory because that's where I looked at it anyhow. Well, I was going to say
*  like you don't even have a name for the whole theory that- That's why people made up M theory
*  as a word or string theory. I usually, I use the word string theory for that whole thing.
*  And do we think, and this is obviously something we don't know, so it's okay to have a vague
*  impression. Do you think that the real world lives or the world of our everyday experience, let's say,
*  lives close to one of those corners where things look more or less like a certain kind of string
*  theory or is that something we just don't know? I think in some ways I believe that our universe
*  is near one of the corners and this one I can get to a bit in a bit more detail when I talk about
*  some aspects of this string theory where I'm myself very excited about. So I do believe and
*  I will elaborate further later perhaps why we think we might be near one of these preferred
*  corners and this may not be the string corner but some other corner. Okay, very good. And one
*  question, this is just because I have you here and I've wondered about this for a long time.
*  If there are extra dimensions and they're curled up, they're compactified to something very small,
*  presumably near the Planck scale, but the Planck scale is also where quantum gravity becomes
*  important and our notions of space-time begin to break down. Is it even okay to think of them as
*  dimensions of space or are they fuzzier than that? No, you said it very well. Precisely because of
*  what you said, that's why I was saying in answering your previous question, the number of dimension is
*  a bit ambiguous. Right. Precisely because different pictures will give you different ones in that
*  regime where the curled up dimensions are very small like Planck scale. Therefore, the notion
*  itself is a bit ambiguous. That's why I wouldn't answer it that way. We could more unambiguously
*  answer what is large and those are the ones which will make more sense. But what is the net
*  dimension of the space-time depends on the corners. Great, great. Okay, good. But nevertheless, this
*  picture of curling up our extra dimensions is very visually tangible. We like it and you're
*  going to explain this better than I can but apparently there are many, many different ways
*  to curl up those extra dimensions and that gives us many, many different options for what physics
*  in our four-dimensional space-time ends up looking like. That's right. So if you start with nine
*  spatial dimensions at one time, the most natural way to curl up is the six extra spatial dimensions
*  is simply by taking six circles basically. Each dimension could be a circle and just take what
*  we call the product of six circles or sometimes called six-dimensional torus. So this is just
*  basically taking these angular directions and six extra of those in addition to what we usually call
*  x, y and z or the three spatial directions. Now that particular example I just told you
*  is an example where Einstein's equation is solved automatically or more precisely in this case,
*  string equations are also solved. In other words, this gives you a consistent background for string
*  theory. Namely, if you started with taking six extra dimensions to be six curled up circles,
*  then it is a nice stable static solution to our universe. It's not our universe but it would be
*  a universe. It would be somebody's universe perhaps but not ours. The one I just told you
*  would have too much other stuff that's not seen in our universe but it would be a viable,
*  potential viable three-dimensional spatial theory with one temporal one which is static and nice
*  and special which has symmetry which certainly we don't see in our universe at low energy called
*  supersymmetry where it tells you that there are equal number of bosons and fermions with
*  interactions between them with special properties. This supersymmetry is automatically follows from
*  the example I told you but it's not enjoyed in low energy at our universe. Therefore,
*  it cannot be our universe. One down, how many other ways are there to curl up those extra
*  dimensions? There are many ways to do it and there are ones which satisfy Einstein's equation or the
*  analog of the string equations and there are a huge number of those. Many of them have fancy names like
*  Kalabeya manifolds. These are after the two mathematicians who proposed and proved the
*  existence of such spaces and these give you nice properties that means in particular it respects
*  the supersymmetry that the theory starts within 10 dimensions and you can use these as your
*  backgrounds for string theory. There are a huge number of those and there are millions or whatever
*  number of them and each one of them itself can have sizes and shapes. For each one of them there
*  are infinitely many choices depending on what radii you choose and what sizes you choose and so
*  forth. Depending on what you mean by how you count it you can say infinite or you can say finite
*  different types of two choices of radii and things but there's a huge amount of them. We have a huge
*  set of examples when you respect some amount of this mysterious or not mysterious supersymmetry
*  which is not enjoyed in our universe. Now when you come to our universe which does not have
*  supersymmetry you're out of luck. It turns out that essentially all the solutions, well not
*  essentially exactly all the solutions we know in string theory which don't enjoy supersymmetry
*  are not exactly stable. In fact that's in some sense I would say a prediction of string theory.
*  String theory tells you our universe cannot be stable. That means that whenever you break
*  the symmetry you are in a difficult, in a dangerous zone. Namely you do not expect,
*  you should not expect a stable static universe in that situation just like our universe in some form.
*  Well I was going to say you know how bad is that? Our universe is not static, it's expanding. Is
*  there some cosmological way out of this issue? Well one might have thought we're expanding
*  because of some initial condition and maybe after you end up a long time you have basically
*  if the picture of dark energy or the cosmological constant were correct one would have said oh after
*  a long long enough time everything washes away and you have just a nice space which is exponentially
*  expanding but basically otherwise is static in some form. Now up to this exponential expansion
*  and you might think that's it but it seems like that's not possible in string theory ad infinitum.
*  Something has to give way and so therefore even that's not possible. So whereas you won't
*  without contemplated of such a thing be possible in from the viewpoint of just writing a classical
*  solution to height science equations with a cosmological constant.
*  So that that apparently cannot be possible in a context of string theory. Well we're certainly
*  going to get into that but how does this connect with the idea of the string theory landscape?
*  Because my impression was that in the landscape of all possible compactifications some of them
*  would have a positive cosmological constant just like we think our universe does. That was
*  how Lenny Susskind wants to solve the cosmological constant problem using the anthropic principle.
*  Yes I'm not sure I'm not sure I signed on to that picture. First of all I should say that there are
*  still no reliable solution in string theory with a positive stable cosmological constant or even
*  semi-stable. Nobody claims a stable cosmological constant. They want to talk about cosmological
*  constant. Positive cosmological constant they suggest that maybe they have a metastable one.
*  Hmm. So even so there's certainly no claim in the literature of an absolute stable
*  positive energy. Positive there because they're always when your potential goes up
*  in string theory invariably at far enough distance in field space it goes down to zero.
*  So therefore you never will have an exactly stable one. Now the metastable ones which would be these
*  kind of potential places where you have a local minimum for the potential whose value gives you
*  the cosmological constant. That's what we mean by cosmological constant the value of this potential
*  at the local minimum even those have not been constructed with enough reliability. So in fact
*  we believe that this is not this is very difficult to establish their existence or lack thereof for
*  a very good reason. The reason is very simple. We can only reliably compute things in string theory
*  when you don't have supersymmetry. Only when you have it when you are near a classical corner.
*  Near the classical corner you can show rigorously in string theory that there is a potential
*  if there is a potential like you break supersymmetry which exponentially goes down.
*  Therefore there is no critical point. So in the classical regimes where the computation is under
*  control you know there cannot be even a metastable one. Now you say oh okay so maybe it's not the
*  classical corners are a bad place to look at. Maybe we should go a little towards the inside.
*  But precisely when you go inside you lose control of your calculation. And so people who are hoping
*  or claiming to have solutions are on a dangerous path. They are trying to go to the regime where
*  the class they know the classical description is beginning to be bad but they are hoping they can
*  argue enough. They have enough control to argue the existence of this one which is not quite the
*  death for a corner. And that is why this thing is even debated because we know that in the cases
*  where it's not debated it's impossible to get it. In the regions where it's undebatable it's
*  impossible to get it. So I think this is a super important and subtle issue that probably has not
*  percolated very clearly out there into the world. So I want to just nail it exactly down. We can
*  sort of I'll rephrase it and you tell me you'll fix it. We can sort of hand wave our way into
*  imagining ways of compactifying the extra dimensions so that we get positive cosmological
*  constant, negative cosmological constant, whatever. And that gave people this idea that maybe there
*  was this landscape of all these possibilities. But what you're saying is that when we are a little
*  more careful and try to really establish that these compactifications are safe and will last
*  for long cosmological periods of time, we can't do it with the positive cosmological constant that
*  maybe nature wants us to have. That's correct. We don't know. We don't know. So let me explain
*  the difference between positive and negative values. So as I mentioned we have arguments why
*  far enough in field space the potential goes to zero. If that's the case then negative one can be
*  more stable because the negative one can be at the bottom and you go towards zero at the far end and
*  they could be absolutely stable. In fact only the negative ones support exactly stable solutions
*  like in supersymmetric cases. So negative energy is fine. Not all of them are stable but we do have
*  stable ones with negative values of energy. And those are among the best understood examples in
*  string theory, what we call the anti-de Sitter space examples. And a lot of interesting examples
*  in string theory having to do with holography come precisely from this class. On the other hand,
*  you might think it's just a choice of a sign. Just make a negative energy positive energy. What's the
*  big deal? And in fact that is what happens to a naive picture of physics. That is, oh it's just
*  a potential. You just draw the potential with just shift the constant up. What is the big deal?
*  That intuition is incorrect. The intuition that a classical Lagrangian can be written with that
*  form is as easy with positive or negative misleads the physicists to think that means it's as likely
*  or as non-problematic to have either sign. And this has been actually the major point of this
*  program that I can delve into more deeply which is called the Swamp Land program. At some point I can
*  do that. That's related to the fact that not everything that sounds natural from the viewpoint
*  of a classical Lagrangian is actually consistent with quantum gravity. Good. Yes, so I do want to
*  exactly get into the Swamp Land program. That's why we're here. But maybe first let's set the
*  table by talking about effective field theories and the fact that when modern quantum field
*  theorists and particle physicists think about the world, it's okay for them not to know what happens
*  at infinitely high energies. Yes, that's certainly correct. We don't need to know what happens at
*  infinitely high energies but it should still be a consistent picture. In fact in some sense
*  quantum gravity tells you there is no natural meaning to that infinitely high energies and some
*  notions that we keep sacred like the space on time etc break down at these limits. So there's no
*  natural description where you have a lot of energy for example pushed at one point. Now you can spread
*  it out like in a black hole to a larger region and you're fine. So you can have a large massive black
*  hole with a huge mass but if you pushed it into one point then you get the descriptions that we
*  don't think that's possible. So in other words when we have something which includes energies
*  having to do the Planck energies at the Planck length scale, because if you focus it much more
*  than that in the Planck length we don't think our description of space and time really makes sense.
*  But nevertheless we think that we can predict outcomes of the Large Hadron Collider. So naively
*  we have these Feynman diagrams like you started off saying we do these calculations, we compute
*  corrections, we get infinities, we renormalize as a whole bunch of things we say and we think that
*  for various reasons quantum gravity and other high energy things don't matter for predicting
*  the decay of the Higgs boson. Yes so that's the picture that the particle physicists have. So let
*  me try to explain that picture as you're moving to. So there's a cherished principle in particle
*  physics which is decoupling of small distance from large distance physics. That is you start
*  with something which is going on macroscopically like there are atoms and so on are going on
*  and at larger and larger distance scale it's irrelevant for the details of what you are
*  describing. For example if I look at a piece of metal or something yes there is made of some
*  atoms that you may want to study if you want to talk about some individual atoms and so forth but
*  overall as a solid object you have a much simpler description macroscopically. You don't need that
*  much detail all of them more or less look the same with some minor tweaking here and there.
*  So this idea that large distance you only have a few possibilities of what kind of physics emerges
*  whereas you can start with many many different things at short distances which wash out when you
*  when you step back and look at it from a big distance perspective so therefore you don't need
*  to know about all those details is one of the cherished principles of quantum field theory
*  and condensed matter physics and that we have learned you know one of these basic principles
*  that Wilson in particular emphasized about the decoupling of the ideas from the short distance
*  or what we call ultraviolet physics and long distance which we call the infrared physics.
*  So that's the cherished principle. Now this principle comes with one more ingredient
*  which means the following you can kind of integrate out as we call in physics or kind of
*  find that the effect of these short distance things at large distances by using a few parameters
*  in the large distance physics once you specify what the large distance physics roughly is namely
*  you say I want the large distance physics to have certain symmetries and I want it to live in certain
*  dimensions once you specify these things then you can write down essentially a unique theory
*  up to a few parameters that you cannot quite figure out because they all those parameters
*  have those symmetries so what you say that's the viewpoint of quantum field theories is that okay
*  the short distance physics that we don't know is irrelevant in every detail except possibly figuring
*  out these few constants finite number of these parameters so you say you know what I don't care
*  about the short distance physics I'll just start with this larger distance perspective and choose
*  the parameter that I like or I observe in my experiments and that's good enough so therefore
*  by and large it says that that complication of the short distance is not relevant to my perception
*  or description of a larger distance physics scale and that has been a cherished principle of
*  quantum field theory condensed matter physics everybody loves it it's sometimes called the
*  effective field theory description means the effectively how you describe large distance
*  physics does not be too much detail other than those few parameters that you can adjust at the
*  end that's the that's the the motto if you wish of this quantum field theory paradigm
*  this paradigm miserably fails when it comes to quantum that's the basic point right so I will
*  pause to give the listening audience an advertisement because I have a book that
*  just came out that goes into effective field theory and sings its praises in in great details
*  and they can find all the details there and now we're gonna for the rest of this podcast
*  see how it miserably fails when gravity comes in there and so and I guess that the source of the
*  miserable failure is that when we have a low energy infrared as we say effective field theory
*  we still like you like you alluded to have the we imagine that there is an ultraviolet completion
*  that there is a way to make it completely consistent including all the energies that
*  we might want to look at but but maybe that's not right but well we should have a theory which
*  describes everything and there should be ultimately answered to all questions that you
*  may want to ask it shouldn't be like the theory only with regardless of our ability to compute
*  the theory has to have an answer for every question that's regardless so so it should
*  be consistent self-consistent and so forth so what we learned in quantum gravity the via studying
*  string theory was the following we had all these kinds of ways where you could compactify the space
*  in curling curling up these dimensions and come down and we see what we got in three plus three
*  plus one dimensions so we curled up one way to say oh interesting we get this gauge with these
*  many particles that's why I think we don't think oh you got interesting other thing so we played
*  around a lot with this kind of thing and then we noticed there are certain things we're not getting
*  in fact we noticed that what we are getting is very limited actually and we were surprised we
*  were kind of saying wow what is what is going on are we just not being imaginative or is there a
*  good reason we are not getting other stuff so I will give you one very concrete example yeah
*  as I told you the theories which we really understand best are these theories which have
*  the super symmetry the symmetry between bosons and fermions and those are the ones which we have the
*  most control over in terms of computations so you say from a perspective of a four-dimensional
*  observer like we are suppose I'm interested in a theory which does have super symmetry fine
*  what are the possibilities well there it depends on how much super symmetry you have and so forth
*  you say okay I want to have a maximum amount of super symmetry consistent with having some matter
*  what would that give you well there is a particularly
*  maximal class with super symmetry which includes forces like gauge particles and so on
*  which is called n equal to four in terms of the number of super symmetries four super symmetries
*  in four dimensions that's the maximum one you want if you want to have matter you say great this is
*  what I'm interested in good now you say what do we know about quantum field theories forget about
*  gravity with these symmetries indeed such theories are characterized just by a choice of the
*  gauge group the group that controls the forces between these particles like the same group that
*  for this standard model is s3 times s2 times u1 whatever that group you choose for this theory
*  completely specifies the theory right so you say good it's very easy nice so what do I do with this
*  well you can just study quantum field theory forget about gravity you study it without gravity and you
*  find this is not only a well-defined theory but thanks to super symmetry is finite wow this is a
*  property that usually in physics we don't see usually when you have finite diagrams and quantum
*  field theories you have all these complicated infinities that you have to make sense out of
*  thanks to this normalization group technique which is what I alluded to to Wilson's idea about
*  integrating out small distances away from the largest distance physics but these theories with
*  four superseries do does not have this issue at all it's finite for any group you choose any group
*  with no matter how big a group you have for example if you have s2 and s3 if you have s3 s4
*  any s2 and you choose for the group it's a finite theory no matter what end you choose good so that
*  looks good now you say oh what this does not have gravity I want gravity in the mix so you say oh
*  no problem just what we say in physics couple it to gravity so we add gravity into the mix
*  hoping for the best because you know this is a beautiful finite theory yeah you add four
*  dimensional gravity to the mix and you find you never get anything bigger than su23
*  su24 and higher don't exist don't come out ever ever now you say oh maybe that's because I'm being
*  lazy or my string theory is limited and I better think harder and so on we have now learned by
*  studying more about why doesn't you get these ones that you cannot get these ones by some simple ideas
*  related to the what general properties we expect quantum gravity to have so therefore what you find
*  is that even though you could have at any end naively from one to infinity consistent with
*  s21 s22 s23 etc up to s3 infinity all of them are finite when you put gravity you have a finite
*  allowed set so this set of possibilities compared to the totality allowed one is measure zero
*  in other words if you were if somebody threw you throughout you a group you could without thinking
*  say it's not possible with gravity because you would be right because the the ones which have
*  gravity in them is measure zero the chances that somebody got it right is so small if they just
*  choose a random one from one to infinity so so therefore this is the this is the reality of
*  string theory we learned that the naive picture that we say oh nothing no problem you can just
*  put anything you want even such a beautiful simple consistent finite theory without gravity
*  totally gets messed up if n is bigger than 23 good so this is I take it that this is the origin of
*  this swampland idea that there are a lot of effective field theories we could write down
*  but not all of them in fact most of them can't be derived from string theory or some other
*  purported ultravioletly complete theory of gravity yes we believe that there is there is most of these
*  theories that people think are possible from the naive field theory perspective fails miserably
*  when it comes to gravity and it's actually easy to see why it could have happened that it's like
*  so let me explain from a perspective of of effective filters what the way to explain it
*  to an effective filter is why they should have expected something crazy to happen
*  so this idea that low energy and short distance and high energy short distance which is high energy
*  or long distance which is short low energy why these two things are decoupled cannot work with
*  gravity this decoupling between these two points of the idea that gives rise to the effective
*  filter it fails for an easy reason the easy reason is this supreme object the most mysterious objects
*  in quantum gravity which are black holes the black holes run the show in quantum gravity and
*  they are the most enigmatic but most beautiful objects in terms of what kind of things we have
*  learned from them so i will explain one aspect of them which i want to bring out now which is the
*  observation of beckons line and hawking that black holes carry entropy and the bigger black holes
*  carry more entropy the entropy being proportionate entropy meaning the number of degrees of freedom
*  that this particle or a state with this much mass could have which grows you know huge amount so
*  the entropy goes like proportional to the area of the the black hole area of the horizon of the
*  black or or more precisely one quarter of it in plank units so that's the area that's the formula
*  for the entropy which means that the number of number of particles which have a mass or number
*  of states which have a mass equal to the mass of the black hole is exponential of this huge area
*  if you're talking about a macroscopic black hole so this is so what i'm describing to you is a
*  prediction for high energy states in the quantum theory of gravity if you take the mass to be huge
*  that the general state is getting more and more thanks to this area of getting larger and larger
*  but how do we know that we know that using large distance physics which is the low energy physics
*  namely we are describing it using ice size equation which is valid for large distances
*  and that's how beckons-lein and hawking doing only only a tiny correction to classical gravity
*  were able to deduce this by just a tiny quantum correction or what we call semi-classical gravity
*  competition established these facts so what we're learning just from the thinking about black holes
*  that large distance or low energy and high energy are linked intricately and we cannot disentangle
*  so this idea that one feeds into the other is crucial in this in this whole idea and this has
*  been why this picture of effective field theory fails that in general notion of course it doesn't
*  mean that you cannot describe physics at any given scale using that scale that's of course always true
*  but it doesn't mean that you can get anything you want because the consistency of how that fixes in
*  with the lower energy is very intricate and that intricacy is what forces the whole thing to be a
*  very very finite and limited set ultimately that's the basic idea for this for this idea
*  so let me then again paraphrase let me then try to package it in a different way if you start with a
*  given quantum field theory which looks perfectly consistent like the example like they told you
*  about the supersymmetric one with arbitrary group that that that would have been a potential
*  consistent theory of quantum gravity if you mix the gravity with it i told you they are not so
*  so i would say that a putative theory which could have been okay with gravity but it's not we say
*  this belongs to the swamp right the ones for which actually can be completed to a complete
*  theory of gravity we call landscape so swampland and landscape in that sense they are not too
*  different from each other you could have thought it's part of the landscape but upon further
*  scrutiny you might find actually doesn't work so that's what we call it swamp so we believe as i
*  was explaining that essentially every theory is in the swamp any any theory you can conceive of is
*  the swamp and that all the very rare ones the jewels are the actual ones for which quantum
*  gravity can work so the quantum gravity are very specialized very specialized now this leads to
*  saying okay how do you know how do you pick these jewels how do you find which one of them are good
*  and which ones are bad of course it's very hard if you have a measure zero set to say what is
*  that measure zero half it's much easier to say what is bad maybe you say oh if it's if it's on
*  this side of the parameter space cannot be happening or if it's this side it cannot happen
*  so that that's why the program is that i've been working with a number of colleagues called the
*  salt land program to identify the bad ones not that we are interested in the bad ones but that's
*  the easier thing to do you can rule out what doesn't work this area is bad that's bad that's
*  bad to narrow down where the jewels can lie fixing the jewels is of course very difficult
*  because you have to really fine-tune all the parameters get actually appeared so if we want
*  the audience to take away a motto here gravity is truly different than the other forces it's
*  really causing us to think differently about all these important questions exactly so gravity and
*  led by this beautiful object black hole is the real reason when you bring in the quantum aspects
*  into the mix which is behave so differently so differently from quantum field theory so gravity
*  is a new new kind of a theory which you cannot just think oh it's just like the old stuff you
*  just add in one more field not so not so okay is there any simple nice tangible example of something
*  we've learned from the swampland program about what kinds of theories cannot be consistently part
*  of a quantum gravity theory yes yes one of the ones that is one of my favorites is what's called
*  the weak gravity conjecture now many of these things that we call these swampland properties
*  we call conjectures because we don't know how to prove them because we don't have the underlying
*  theory so so we we bring it as principles or conjecture so one of them is called the weak
*  gravity conjecture now what does this imply what does it say it says that if you suppose you have a
*  theory consistent and coupled to gravity so gravity exists in it suppose you have some electric
*  forces in that here so electromagnetic forces it's saying that in that theory there should be some
*  elementary particles which are charged under that electric force for which their electric repulsion
*  if you bring two of them next the same one next to another one
*  electric repulsion is much stronger than their gravitational attraction in other words the gravity
*  is the weaker force in fact it's always the weakest force so it said differently the gravity
*  if you have two particles of same mass then the gravity gravitational force goes like a square of
*  the mass product of the masses will be square of a mass and if you have electric electric forces
*  they go like electric squared electric charge squared that would be the repulsion force of let's
*  say two electrons if you bring them next to each other it's saying that the electric charge
*  is much bigger than the mass measured in plank units so the mass of the electron measured in
*  plank units we're saying is much smaller than the electric charge which is very much true in
*  our universe the electric charge is is a much more stronger force in our universe than the weak meager
*  electric force between two electrons so now you might have thought oh it's just a parameter
*  i can just take the mass of the electron make bigger and bigger and bigger so it's bigger than
*  the electric charge one when you measure some plank units in which case the gravitational force
*  will be stronger than electrical repulsion what's the problem yeah there is apparently no problem
*  from the viewpoint of of the effective field theory naively you can write down and so the
*  with sony viewpoint would have been no problem just write it down and however we know this is
*  not possible and there's even a heuristic argument for why this should not be possible using bad
*  pole physics this is not a rigorous argument but i will i will basically try to sketch what the
*  basic idea is if you look at the mass of black holes with a given with a given charge there is
*  a restriction that in fact it goes the opposite direction that if you have a very big mass of
*  black hole this mass is always bigger than or equal to its charge unlike the elementary particle
*  i'm talking about for which i'm saying that mass is less than equal to charge the gravitational one
*  tells you when you solve the ice line equation if you want don't want to have a bad singularity
*  it's always the other way okay so what am i saying that well if you take into account that you start
*  with one which is barely the mass is equal to the chart which is the boundary of possibilities for
*  the big black hole and if you assume it decays a la bickenstein and hawking or hawking's decay in fact
*  if you assume it decays which we cannot prove but we believe it to be true for all the examples
*  which don't have supersymmetry so if you have like a black hole in our universe we think it's
*  going to decay even if you start with mass equal to chart well if you emit a mass and a chart like
*  an electron if the mass and charge were opposites way if it was the same way than the than the the
*  back if you were if the mass of the electron was bigger than the charge then the resulting black
*  hole would give you a mass which is less than its charge and that's inconsistent so therefore there
*  should be objects which you can emit which have the opposite relation in which the gravity is
*  weaker force so this is a heuristic explanation of why this kind of thing can be related to black
*  hole physics and could be consistent what other evidence do we have for this well in all the
*  examples of string theory it's true in it in many cases in a very non-trivial way so therefore we
*  have a lot of examples from string theory supporting this but as you saw the argument I gave you or at
*  least heuristic as it may be did not use anything to do with strength it was about black holes
*  so this happens to many of these principles we kind of see the string theory and we see oh that's
*  curious can we have a better explanation and then we try to appeal to more fundamental physics like
*  properties of black hole and the consistency of their evaporation and this and that to try to see
*  if we can have at least a heuristic explanation and that is that is the nature of these kind of
*  arguments and just so we understand what the expectations are once we get very good at this
*  and figure out everything that we can you're not actually hoping to end up saying it had to be the
*  standard model particle physics we're not going to be that specific in narrowing down the swampland
*  absolutely not because we as I explained for example we know that all these supersymmetric
*  examples are perfectly stable consistent and not our universe so we are not under any illusion
*  that we are going to derive our universe in it in this way of course we are we are assuming that our
*  universe is a consistent one otherwise what are we talking about but we are not that's not our hope
*  so let me explain what is our hope and then I will explain what we have been doing with this hope
*  good our hope is to use observation as an anchor combined with the principles of the swampland to
*  make the next prediction in other words we want to say that some observed facts in our universe
*  that are not accidental you may we may not be explaining all the facts but if you have fact a
*  maybe fact b follows now you might ask why is the fact h2o I could say I don't know it happens to
*  be we live in this universe but then if a is true then b better be true now you say okay why can't
*  we do this without using any of the swampland the problem is that the in the case of if you
*  view the effective field theory perspective it does not allow you to do such a statement
*  if a is true it doesn't allow that necessarily b doesn't follow b only follows because of this
*  very limited possibility of what is the consistent theory of quantum gravity so you say oh if you
*  ever found the quantum gravity which we know is very hard to get of course which has a property
*  a then better have property b even though from effective theory there is no natural explanation
*  from a to b but from string theory principles there is so therefore we wouldn't say that oh
*  we have derived the whole universe etc etc but we correlate facts in our universe using these ideas
*  and that's what we have been doing so I will explain one fact which I think is one thing I'm
*  most excited about which is comes back to your question that you raised whether or not we are
*  near one of these classical limits of in the in the context of string theory so I will explain
*  why we think we might be near one of these so one of the things we learn from string theory is that
*  is this bizarre fact that whenever you choose your parameters in your theory to extreme values
*  you not only can get some kind of a classical picture you always will get some classical picture
*  in other words there is no there is no extreme regime of any parameter in our physical theory
*  for which it's not a classical picture so therefore we say oh this is an interesting fact so going to
*  extreme regimes of parameters take the parameter towards zero or towards infinity
*  it better be that some class new classical picture emerges this always happens and this is the duality
*  I was alluding to do we have a proof of it no we don't have a proof of it is it true in all the
*  examples of string theory yes so we take this as a principle that extreme parameters in physics means
*  there's a dual description without knowing what that description may be
*  now we have also identified what could be in general what are the allowed possible
*  ways you can get the dual description and we have only found two types of ways we can get these dual
*  descriptions what happens as you go to these extreme parameter regimes is that either some
*  dimensions get bigger and bigger that you were originally thinking they were curled up and tiny
*  they could get bigger and bigger some number of them one two three whatever number or what could
*  happen in other extreme parameters that these dimensions don't change size but some string
*  becomes lighter and lighter and lighter and you get a tiny tiny tension for them you get a tower
*  of very very light strings and these are the only two possibilities we have ever seen in all the
*  cases of string theory so either some number of dimensions open up or some strings become light
*  and tensionless what we call ours have almost no mass just like fundamental strings are
*  light strings so now we come to our universe so this is the general principle what we call
*  what's sometimes called the distance conjecture which means if you go a large distance in parameter
*  space you get some dual description and sometimes called the duality conjecture basically means at
*  large distance you get the dual description so we come to our universe and say okay let's apply this
*  to our universe well what is there's no parameter there are these parameters like electric coupling
*  and so on but they are not particularly big or small like e squared over h bar c is one over 137
*  it's not big or small it's kind of like there what we call order one perhaps but then you think are
*  they say oh come on there's an obvious one it's a big elephant in the room which is the dark energy
*  yeah so the minus 122 in fundamental units of physics by all measures breaks all the records
*  for smallness or extreme values other than zero so we say okay there is so that means the very fact
*  that we have cosmology constant so small means we must be near one of these corners
*  now you could say oh okay so let me just apply this principle i have seen in string theory to
*  this case in our universe lambda the dark energy is small what could it be well it could be either
*  so first of all then you can ask okay when you get this light so at these extreme powers
*  extreme parameters what happens that you get the tower of light particles and this power at least
*  tower of light particles scale with some power of this parameter so in other words we expect more
*  than just as the cosmological constant which let me call it lambda as lambda goes to become very
*  small like 10 to the minus 122 there are some particles whose mass scales like that lambda
*  10 to the minus 128 to some power yeah where that power is of order one we don't know what that
*  order one parameter is but something of order one this is the general principle we are we are being
*  told now you can give arguments of what is the range of that parameter and you can give an
*  argument that this range should be in our universe between a half and a quarter in other words the
*  mass should be the range between lambda to the half to lambda to the quarter range and then you
*  say okay armed with this first of all what is this parameter what what sorry what is this coefficient
*  this is what value is it between half and a quarter and what is this light tower of particles i have
*  not seen one the standard model is not that and so what is it we are saying that there's a light
*  tower of particles but without getting into any detail we just say somebody was telling us about
*  dark matter and more than that the tower instinct is predicted to be weakly coupled
*  so this automatically without doing any thinking says oh could it be that the smallness of dark
*  energy and existence of weak interacting dark matter are related this says yes so this automatically
*  without doing any kind of thing suggests connection between dark energy and dark matter
*  that is in some sense they come up bundled unified the existence of smallness of lambda
*  will say that there is a tower of like particles now where whose mass goes like lambda to the half
*  to lambda quarter anyhow you you check then you go on an experiment so can i check whether this
*  is true or not you you prove that the only value of this exponent that could possibly be true in
*  our universe because all the rest are ruled out is one quarter all the other ones you can show
*  they are already violated by experiments we have already done so experimentally ruled out not the
*  experimentally with that exactly so this is the principle of sending you we do not know how to
*  figure out what our universe is but something we can experimentally observe at some principle
*  can then zoom into something else we say oh therefore we are saying that there's a tower
*  particle that stays lambda to the one quarter and now you can say okay so what is this tower is it
*  is it some dimensions opening up or is it some current of dimensions getting big or or if that's
*  the case how many of them or is it the string going on again you use observation to rule out
*  all the possibilities except the possibility of one extra dimension opening up with the size of
*  the order of that cosmoid constant to the minus one quarter which is about microns scale so again
*  just by observations combined with this principle you are fixed with a unique possibility of having
*  one mesoscopic dimension so out of these curled up dimensions one of them is not as small as the
*  rest it should be of the order of about one to ten micron or something and more than that the dark
*  matter would be these oscillations of gravity in these extra dimensions in other words it unifies
*  dark matter with dark energy and with gravity maybe gravity dark matter is graviton the zero
*  mode of the excitation is what we call our massless graviton these other excitations is dark matter
*  why is it weakly coupled because gravity is weakly coupled so we don't have any you know in other
*  words we're not putting any like throw in another particle called dark matter or do this and that
*  and by the way it's related to dark energy so all of these things come actually quite elegantly
*  connected and actually gets connected to the neutrino physics which is also has the same scale
*  as lambda to one quarter and you can actually see that the fundamental Planck scale in fifth
*  dimension is not the usual class here but much reduced by a factor of 10 to the nine or so to
*  about 10 to 10 gv so in other words you get a totally different physics and you find that all
*  of these scales like the 10 dimensional physics scale is cosmological constant to the one twelfth
*  power the weak scale is is cosmological to the two twelfth power the neutrino scale or the this
*  tower of dark energy scales down to the three twelfth the the Hubble scale is down to the six
*  twelfth and so on so you get very natural simple powers that you actually compute like one twelfth
*  that's on you can actually compute one twelfth comes from four times three where four is the
*  dimensional space time and three is coming from five dimensional Planck scale having an implying
*  cube with the formula so you you put all of these together and you get this natural hierarchy of
*  scales coming out from one parameter which is this lambda being so small we cannot explain why
*  lambda is small we cannot explain why dark energy is small but if you take that small then you get
*  these other scales which are automatically uh hierarchic in the way of the kind of scales that
*  we actually do see in our universe and more than that it predicts the right amount of dark matter
*  in our universe so the amount of dark matter comes out right
*  without fine tuning so this this principle which is anthropic principle is not needed
*  to explain why do we have dark energy taking over just when dark matter and radiation temperature
*  are equal so that's one of the things that Weinberg basically suggested that well we don't want to
*  we want to have we don't have too much fine tuning for for for lambda for the dark energy but only
*  predicating on our existence and our existence means the dark energy should not have taken over
*  before the matter dominated at some point so so the existence of the galaxies and all that without
*  an impossible if the dark energy was too much and he put it just roughly the highest possible one
*  compatible with the matter radiation equality which gives like a coincidence fact that why
*  did the dark energy take over right after the matter radiation in cosmological epoch almost at
*  the same time but very shortly thereafter so this actually gets explained we don't put it by hand so
*  notice it works for any lambda so for any lambda you get the same feature so therefore there's no
*  fine tuning there so we don't need anthropics for that of course i cannot explain why lambda is small
*  so maybe for anthropics maybe you need it for that but this is a point here that some fine
*  tunings can be ameliorated in this kind of a program because the fact that there are very
*  few possibilities allowed already puts a huge constraint and if you get one of these facts then
*  many many things fall in place force it they're forced to be falling in place which is very strange
*  from the viewpoint of effective theory which is why from the modern particle physics perspective
*  they are having such a hard time explaining all these funny fine tunings that don't look natural
*  so those fine tunings for particle physics is kind of a lot of it actually it's not all of it
*  gets ameliorated by saying oh there should be a lot of something which appears as fine tuning
*  because otherwise the gravity doesn't work and the consistency of gravity drives the show
*  this sounds all very new and exciting and i uh you're you're motivating me to right after this
*  podcast is over i'm going to download some papers and read about this because i'm not
*  there's there's if you do that there is a particular paper i wrote for a review
*  for people who are not string theorists yeah thoughts on blandish predictions for our universe
*  so in that one i basically described the basic motivations of what this program is and how does
*  it give you what i just was telling you can i ask just very quickly i mean you have dark matter that
*  is similar in mass to neutrinos you said right yes yes and and you get the right relic abundance
*  but is it cold dark matter it is cold in the sense that it is it was never in thermal equilibria with
*  us okay but but it is cold so it looks very much like like lambda cdm except except the dark matter
*  these are made of these excited graviton states they are not stable so they are decaying down
*  because they're the tower but it turns out that decay down is so small because of the gravitational
*  strength okay because they are suffered so have the order one over n plankton them and the mass of
*  these guys is very small so so the the rate of decay goes like cubo of their mass divided by square
*  of the plank's scale and that's very small so they're gradually coming down a mess
*  and so the dark tower is kind of dynamical dynamically rearranging itself right okay good
*  i mean i'm sure that that's like a whole other podcast worth of questions here but but let's
*  maybe we can sort of bring it back to where we started close close the tourists as it were i
*  almost said close the circle but um uh with the cosmological constant which you've been referring
*  to so my impression was that as you said we have no examples in fact we have reasons why it's hard
*  to find examples of meta stable solutions in string theory with the positive cosmological
*  constant so how much are you willing to stick your neck out and say that the dark energy
*  that our telescopes tell us is there string theory says is not a cosmological constant but
*  is something slow and dynamical okay to say it's dynamical i can i think it's i can absolutely say
*  namely all the things that we learned from string theory and quantum gravities there's no constant
*  in any parameter in your lab ronjun including the cosmological constant that means that should be
*  viewed as dynamical now the next question is it whether it's stable or not yeah that's what it
*  was so so the question of stability is the next question so uh we have given a proposal of what is
*  what could replay what what is the principle which tells you how stable it is or it is not
*  as i told you when you go to extreme parameter ranges it cannot be stable because it rolls down
*  yeah now you could say well could we be near this region but not exactly near the extreme region
*  and i was telling you are you for you that our radius of the universe is we are near one of these
*  extremes how close are we to this extreme limit are we could we basically be near one of them with
*  some other coefficient or somewhere near the top of a potential maybe or a little bit okay so so
*  there's what we did with the with the pseudonym a few years ago was to propose what we call the
*  trans-Planckian censorship conjecture which basically suggests that things which are smaller
*  than the Planck length can never be physical that the it's a phantom the things which are too small
*  it's just the it's just the space should not make sense neither should the fluctuations in that
*  distance scale using that and the fact that these modes cannot exit the horizon and classicalize
*  we basically came up with some boundary conditions of what is possible for the dark energy
*  we found that uh we found using this principle that the potentials that we get in string theory
*  should fall off at near large distance exponentially as we were seeing it with the correct exponents
*  that we were seeing in string theory now this principle also nevertheless allows you to have a
*  metal stable one however however the lifetime of it cannot be too much namely the lifetime of it
*  is hobbled up to a logarithmic correction so in other words there's a bound if if it is on one
*  of these metal stable one it cannot be more than a few trillion years in our universe so that means
*  that we have an upper bound prediction of the age of the potential lifetime of a potential lifetime
*  of our universe could be no more than the couple of trillion years however the more natural
*  possibility of course is evolving now and i should i mean i'm quite excited to see whether the
*  recent observations by desi which just was just announced at the preliminary results announced a
*  few weeks ago where the dark energy may be evolving uh may actually true and this is too early to
*  actually to be sure about but it's an exciting possibility i say that what i'm most sure about
*  is that dark energy is going to go away long term long term meaning certainly two trillion year time
*  but but whether it's actually in our universe or not i cannot be sure but i would say that's the
*  most natural possibility because as i said we know it's going to go away at the hobbled time up to
*  log correction maybe it's just a hobble time and in fact that's the scale in which the rolling is
*  happening so for us the rolling unfolding in hobble time is natural so we have an explanation
*  on that that is when you say the slope of these potentials they're exactly of the type which
*  unfolding takes place in hobble time so it's similar to the kind of things that they they could
*  be seeing in in desi so i wouldn't i wouldn't be so sure until i mean the experiments come out more
*  more decisively on one way or the other but i certainly would think that's a very natural
*  possibility for us and so that makes it even more exciting so for the next few years what we have
*  and one other experiment that we're actually currently involved with with a group in vienna
*  who is actually trying to measure the deviations for one over r squared force law at the micron
*  scale right we are predicting that the one over r squared because we have one more dimension becomes
*  one over r cubed if you go for r's which is less than a micron or so up to now it has been measured
*  up to a distance of 30 microns that it does not become one of r cubed so this is where just at the
*  border of this region regime that we think something could be changing and they are trying
*  to actually do experiments hopefully within the next few years they will get some permitted
*  results up to 10 microns and so it's so they're getting close to the regime of interest that is
*  interesting so this one the darn energy decay and axion physics which i didn't tell you about
*  also in this model turns out to have the same mass scale as neutrinos again something that
*  could potentially be observed in near experiments in in in i saw that international axion
*  observatory that they are making so these could be observed also there so there are many potential
*  venues experimentally that could could shed light on on our program as well as verify or or check
*  some of the predictions that you're making so years ago i wrote a paper pointing out that if
*  you just had a generic dark energy scalar field with super low masses it would run into trouble
*  with fifth forces and time-dependent constants and things like that is there some fun string theory
*  property that gets us out of those limits so first of all it so certainly that's important for example
*  the rate at which the newton's constant is changing is less than 10 to minus four and if you go from
*  the beginning of our universe and i roughly like there's a bound percentage wise so indeed those
*  are important balance that one has to make sure and so whatever we are getting should be should
*  be combative with that people have had some i mean some of my colleagues are contemplating in fact
*  they have been writing papers not my colleagues but long ago chameleon models and so on so people
*  have proposed some alternatives so i don't want to say exactly what could potentially be but of
*  course the fifth force ones are certainly a worry if you ever talk about the evolution and that you
*  have to be careful about yes i agree okay good so uh that was very exciting uh i will i will let you
*  i'll give you the opportunity to wind up with a more grand philosophical point of view question
*  here i mean you're we ended up we started with the finiteness of string theory in quantum gravity
*  like you said string theorists in the early days weren't even trying to describe quantum gravity
*  and string theory has spent decades struggling or just ignoring the question of connecting to
*  experiments but maybe now we're coming closer to being able to do that or maybe not it's all very
*  you know shiny when things can break but is there some lesson to be learned here about just
*  stick-to-itiveness persistence uh being stubborn in in pursuing an idea that seems really good
*  even though you don't quite know how to connect it to what you want i think i think understanding
*  what we have learned from string theory is crucial and very often it's easy just to give up
*  and just say oh there's so many possibilities our universe is too complicated come on and so on but
*  actually if we look at the lessons that string theory has taught us and more broadly history of
*  physics has taught us is that ideas that are natural in some contexts could lead the way
*  into things which look crazy at some point i mean extra dimensions that's already crazy sounding
*  or you know things like i would say like black holes which now have been verified were crazy
*  even to einstein so i'm just saying that things which sound crazy does not mean they are wrong
*  and in fact if the theory naturally suggests these are natural thoughts we should take them
*  very seriously don't be afraid go with them make predictions and don't be afraid of making wrong
*  predictions and i think that's something that some of my colleagues are uh i think some of the
*  colleagues are a little bit perhaps worried about making predictions that can be disproved for
*  example now that's understandable on the other hand uh like in the context of salt land program
*  you make these assumptions which sound natural and based on these you get some consequences and if
*  for whatever reason those consequences are not verified as you learn something about what were
*  you missing in those principles try to get it improved that's what science is so i feel that
*  i feel that we have lost track of what a scientist is sometimes we think we are gods we should be
*  able to tell you with hundred percent certainly this is going to happen and if it doesn't happen
*  the universe is wrong no no no we should be modest we're just trying to understand we make
*  these models and if it doesn't work we go and refine our models that's the way science is
*  supposed to be i think a little bit of this grandiose picture that you know i know everything
*  and so forth and so forth or i better say something which is absolutely correct is actually getting
*  into the way of understanding nature and i think we should go back to the more modest things like
*  putting what we have learned taking the next educated guess based on those and see what it
*  predicts and if it doesn't work go and refine it and come back with the next one that's what
*  science is and that's what i hope me and my college should be doing i think that's a perfect place to
*  end kubu and bapha thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast thanks char it was a pleasure
*  thank you
