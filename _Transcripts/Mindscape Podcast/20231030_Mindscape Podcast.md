A "Theory of Everything" is physicists' somewhat tongue-in-cheek phrase for a hypothetical model of all the fundamental physical interactions. Of course, even if we had such a theory, it would tell us nothing new about higher-level emergent phenomena, all the way up to human behavior and society. Can we even imagine a "Theory of Everyone," providing basic organizing principles for society? Michael Muthukrishna believes we can, and indeed that we can see the outlines of such a theory emerging, based on the relationships of people to each other and to the physical resources available.

Michael Muthukrishna received his Ph.D. in psychology from the University of British Columbia. He is currently Associate Professor of Economic Psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Among his awards are an Emerging Scholar Award from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology and a Dissertation Excellence Award from the Canadian Psychological Association. His new book is A Theory of Everyone: The New Science of Who We Are, How We Got Here, and Where We're Going.

# Mindscape 255 | Michael Muthukrishna on Developing a Theory of Everyone
**Mindscape Podcast:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQzc2k7OhxY)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  Probably everyone listening has heard the phrase, a theory of everything, right? The
*  origins of this phrase are actually a little bit murky. You know, it's not such
*  a weird collection of words that it hadn't appeared in the literature a long
*  time ago. You know, people have talked about the idea of a theory of everything,
*  but the context in which we currently usually talk about it is either
*  superstring theory in physics or some other competitor to superstring theory.
*  As far as I can tell, that coinage came from John Ellis, who was a theorist at
*  CERN. He wrote a little article in the early days of the superstring revolution
*  in the 1980s called The Superstring, a theory of everything or of nothing. So it
*  wasn't completely triumphant, right? He was actually talking about whether or not
*  this possibly could be a theory of everything. It was immediately pointed
*  out by non-physicists and even some physicists that the idea of a theory of
*  everything in this sense is actually very, very restricted to a certain
*  reductionistic way of looking at the fundamental constituents of nature, the
*  idea being that nevertheless those fundamental constituents make up
*  everything else. But there's no sense in which that idea of a theory of everything
*  would be the final theory that we ever need in science, right? Because we do have
*  higher-level emergent things. We have biological organisms. We have economies
*  and societies and we have people in psychology, all this stuff, right, that is
*  certainly not covered, not to mention easy questions about astrophysics or
*  chemistry or so forth. So the root from that kind of theory of everything to
*  many other scientific questions is a complicated one. Therefore, we still have
*  room for other theories of large grandiose scope and today's guest is
*  Michael Muthukrishna who has a book coming out called A Theory of Everyone.
*  That's an intentional play on words from the theory of everything idea. The
*  subtitle is The New Science of Who We Are, How We Got Here and Where We're Going.
*  Obviously, a kind of an ambitious book trying to synthesize many kinds of ideas.
*  Michael is at the London School of Economics. He's sort of, I think his
*  official title is a professor of economic psychology. So there's both
*  economics in there and psychology. He's actually collaborated with some of our
*  previous Mindscape guests, Joe Henrich and Edward Slingerland. So he thinks
*  about the grand scope of human history and how we are influenced by
*  biology and evolution, cultural evolution, how we pass down ideas from
*  generation to generation. And you know a big thing as he'll say in the episode, a
*  big thing for him is the fact that human beings, unlike other animals, do have this
*  sort of distributed cultural knowledge that we can pass down. Human beings have
*  schools, right, have an educational system in a way that other animals don't.
*  Other animals do teach their young. Some of them do, you know, I don't know, lions, I'm
*  told, teach their cubs to hunt by, you know, pretending to be in pain when
*  their cubs bite them a little bit, right? So they're teaching them like, oh yes,
*  that's the right thing you should do. But they don't have a curriculum, they don't
*  have a syllabus, they don't have it quite as organized and systematized as human
*  beings do. So that plays a large role in the exceptionalism of human beings. And
*  of course it's tied to other capacities, our brains, our languages, things like
*  that. So we'll talk about all of that. But then Michael wants to go much further. He
*  talks about not only economics but the technological side of economics, the
*  importance of different ways we have of harnessing energy, from you know just
*  burning wood to burning fossil fuels to solar energy and how these allow for
*  expansions of the economy and therefore of human opportunity in a very clear way.
*  And then he brings it back, or brings it down I should say, to the current era. Our
*  political polarization, our stagnation of innovation, if that's true, and what we
*  can do about it, how we can do better. There are parts of this long elaborate
*  story that I am a hundred percent on board with, other parts that I will wait
*  to see. Let's put it that way, I'm not a hundred percent, but I'm open to it. I think
*  it's fascinating stuff. And Michael is very clear and very well educated on a whole
*  bunch of things. So I think it's a very good listen. With that in mind, let's go.
*  Michael Muthakrishna, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thanks for having me, Sean.
*  So you've written what sounds to the average reader of titles like an ambitious
*  book. It's called A Theory of Everyone. And I like that you're kind of making fun of
*  the physicists there.
*  It is a modest title. It could have been a theory of everything, right?
*  Exactly. Just people.
*  Yeah, no, it's a play on a theory of everything, of course. But I mean, the
*  title hints at the central claim of the book, which is that we are, so I'm
*  sure your listeners know already, but the theory of everything in physics is this
*  grand unifying theory, general relativity meets quantum mechanics, whatever.
*  The idea or the central premise of the book is that we have reached this point in the
*  human and social sciences where we have this overarching theoretical framework that
*  unifies things that make sense of an otherwise chaotic and confusing world and turns
*  it into a real science.
*  So, you know, I tell the story of how this happened in the more mature sciences to
*  illustrate how this has happened for the human and social sciences.
*  So, you know, like in physics, right?
*  We used to think that Thor was banging his hammer and the physical world was a result
*  of capricious gods.
*  And then, you know, folks like Newton and Maxwell and Einstein come along and they
*  write down equations.
*  I mean, Maxwell's crazy, right?
*  At the time of like whale oil and horse-drawn carriages, he's writing down equations for
*  like magnets.
*  It's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  But suddenly, like the world is less chaotic and confusing.
*  We know like the weather is still difficult to predict, actually, but we know that it's
*  not caused by capricious gods.
*  It's caused by these rules.
*  We have the rules.
*  And once we have those, we can also turn them into technologies, right?
*  Like we can eventually land a spacecraft on an asteroid.
*  And the same thing happened to chemistry.
*  Now, Newton's not a dumb guy, as we just said, but he's trying to turn lead into gold.
*  And again, it's not because he's a dumb guy.
*  It's because he doesn't understand like collision theory.
*  He doesn't know the world is made up of elements that fit into a periodic table.
*  But once you have a periodic table, you know, then alchemy becomes chemistry.
*  So you can do stuff before you have a periodic table, like we got to gunpowder, for
*  example. But, you know, why is it that when you pour this acid on a metal, you're
*  creating this gas, it's bubbling away like what's happening there, right?
*  And can we turn lead into gold?
*  Maybe it seems like another chemical reaction.
*  But once you have a periodic table, you can be like, yes, we can make gunpowder.
*  It's like, OK, yes, we know what's going on here.
*  But no, we can't learn turn lead into gold.
*  Those are different elements. The world is less chaotic and confusing.
*  And eventually you make your way not only to to chemistry, like, you know, turning
*  oil into into plastics or whatever, but even, you know, eventually to things like
*  protein folding. And of course, this happened in biology.
*  Right. So it was a chaotic and confusing world.
*  Why do some animals have live words and others lay eggs?
*  And why does the peacock have this giant elaborate tail and the peahen doesn't?
*  And then along comes Darwin and later on the modern synthesis with, you know,
*  Fisher and Wright and Hamilton and so on.
*  And suddenly the world is less chaotic and confusing.
*  It's still difficult to predict the trajectory of species or the behavior of
*  ecologies. But if you're trying to do that without the rules that underlie the
*  system, you're running blind.
*  Right. So, yeah, in other words, what I hear is that this underlying
*  theoretical perspective on what's going on can be helpful at a higher practical
*  level. And let me guess you want to extend this to human beings.
*  Exactly. I mean, the claim I make is not that like I have extended to human
*  beings, but actually we are in the midst of a revolution on the scale of of
*  Newton and Maxwell and Einstein and the scale of the periodic table and the scale
*  of Darwin in the modern synthesis.
*  That is, we know the rules.
*  We know why humans are different to other animals.
*  We know the rules by which humans acquire and synthesize information.
*  We know the rules by which societies are changing over time.
*  And that should allow us to build the equivalent of technologies, like do a
*  better job of public policy, for example, by applying that.
*  So part one of the book is kind of laying out that theory of everyone, that theory
*  human behavior. And then part two is like, OK, well, take me at face value and
*  assume that I'm correct about what I'm saying.
*  Here's what this means about inequality and innovation and how we design the
*  Internet and what the future of education should look like and how we get past
*  energy transitions and so on.
*  And how many pages is this book?
*  Like five thousand?
*  Like four hundred eighty pages or something.
*  You know, I mean, I lean heavily.
*  It is it is a book for the public.
*  So I what I try to stay away from, like you'll read some behavior books and it's
*  like in this study we showed X, Y, Z.
*  I mean, the studies are there.
*  But what I really what I'm really trying to say is like there is a tapestry.
*  There's a world that everything is connected up.
*  It's like once I explain the periodic table to you, everything makes a lot more
*  sense. And so I rely heavily on like, let me explain it to you so you can check it
*  against your own life. Like you should have new insights that that allow you to
*  see the world as you never saw before.
*  And once you see it, you can't unsee it.
*  So maybe a good starting point, then, is the classic question of what makes human
*  beings so special, what makes us different than the rest of our
*  animal cousins, even though we're actually very similar at the DNA level.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  So what humans are different kind of animal that have a third line of
*  information or a second line of inheritance.
*  And this is really fundamentally what allowed us to build the world that we
*  have today. So we not only have a genetic inheritance like hardware that we get
*  from our parents.
*  Right. And we not only have kind of a lifetime of experience where we learn
*  things, but we have cultural software that has accumulated over time and is
*  literally running on our brains, allowing us to think new thoughts, see the world
*  in richer, new ways and understand the world as no other species ever has.
*  And that cultural line isn't just learned, it is it is evolving.
*  It is a true it's not it's not an analogy to genetic evolution.
*  It is an extension of population genetics into the world of culture.
*  We call this cultural evolution and it's evolving beyond conscious awareness.
*  So we have a set of behaviors and values and sometimes technologies that are not
*  only the world is not only more complicated than the smartest among us
*  could ever recreate, but often we don't really understand why it is that we do
*  the things we do, certainly at an individual level and sometimes at a
*  population level.
*  Like you probably brush your teeth twice a day.
*  And if I ask you why, you'll tell me something about plaque and tartar or
*  something like that. But you don't really have a good causal model of that.
*  Or, you know, do you you probably finish your course of antibiotics, right?
*  To avoid superbugs.
*  But if you probably have a causal explanation for that,
*  but you have an illusion of explanatory depth that stops you from checking
*  further. Like if I were to say to you, it's like, obviously, Sean, like not
*  every one of those bacteria are going to die.
*  And so surely, if not all of them die, surely finishing your course of
*  antibiotics would have the most resistant bacteria left.
*  That's what would create superbugs.
*  And now you're like, oh, wait a minute, you know, but you don't have to worry
*  about kind of antibiotic kill curves or, you know, the optimal dosage or anything
*  like that.
*  You have just acquired the interfaces to interact with the world.
*  You check your emails on a device that may as well be magic.
*  So the book is about how that how we evolve to have that, how it is that
*  we became a different kind of animal, how that connects everything up and
*  what that means about how we should study ourselves and think about our future.
*  Right. Like if you want to understand the secrets of pivot tables in Excel, if
*  you don't understand how chat GPT works, you don't look inside the CPU and GPU.
*  It's not in the brain. It's not in the neuroscience, actually.
*  It's in the software that's running on that hardware.
*  So the difference, in other words, obviously, other kinds of animals and so
*  forth do have behaviors that are passed
*  down from generations, but they're not through learning.
*  Right. I mean, are there this it's always a worry when you talk about
*  vast generalizations to other species that there's going to be counterexamples.
*  Are there any counterexamples of, you know, things that are not genetically
*  encoded but are knowledge that other animal species pass down from
*  generation to generation?
*  Yeah. So this area is called dual inheritance theory or gene culture
*  coevolution or the extended evolutionary synthesis, and particularly the extended
*  evolutionary synthesis does it is about like these other transmission.
*  Like so environments are transmitted.
*  Right. And earthworm can inherit the environment created that more moist
*  environment created by its ancestors.
*  There's also information being transmitted just not to the degree that humans do.
*  Right. So like chimps, for example, learn from their mothers and they have
*  traditions of, you know, wadding up leaves into sponges and sponging up water
*  or using sticks for taking termites or whatever.
*  Those do seem to be trying or cracking nuts is another example of this.
*  They're entering the Stone Age, if you like.
*  They do have that. But humans, for reasons I explained in the book, and maybe
*  I can say a little bit about that now, rely on that social information and
*  agree to use that information if you like.
*  We use that information at the expense of our own everyday experience.
*  And chimps do not do that.
*  Like, let me give you an example.
*  You're the worst person to give this example to, but I'm going to give it to
*  you anyway. You'll see in a moment why that is.
*  Like if I ask the average person, right, or the average person will swear up and
*  down that we are on a spheroid rotating around a star, one of many stars in the
*  Milky Way, you know, one of many galaxies in the universe, they will swear that up
*  and down. And every day they look outside at a flat earth with a sun tracing the
*  sky from east to west. Right.
*  Right. Now you might be, you know, you're among a handful of people who checked.
*  But for most people, they don't.
*  They just believe it because the smartest people in their society, most people in
*  their society, they believe that.
*  Right. For the longest time, UFOs were like in the realm of the flat earth.
*  Right. And maybe they still should be.
*  But at the moment, because like the reliable sources are talking about what are
*  they called now, UAPs or whatever, and aliens.
*  Now people are like, wait, is that actually a thing?
*  Like, should I be reconsidering my model of the world?
*  We should go back to the previous consensus understanding, I think, there.
*  But this is interesting because you're saying two things, one of which I was
*  expecting and one of which is a little bit.
*  I've heard it before, but it's unexpected in this context.
*  The expected thing is, you know, we not only have knowledge, we have some kind of
*  symbolic knowledge.
*  Right. So, you know, we can package the knowledge and spread it more efficiently
*  between ourselves. And that's obviously some kind of phase transition in human
*  behavior that we can talk about.
*  But you're putting more emphasis than I would have guessed on our limitations, you
*  know, which I think are very important.
*  But it's interesting to hear in this context, you know, we're finite.
*  We don't have infinite ability to do our own research in the current parlance.
*  So we kind of have to rely on our social networks a bit.
*  That's right. And so it's actually because of those limitations that we ended up
*  with this cultural evolutionary system.
*  It's because of those limitations that we deferred the calculation, the computation,
*  the innovation to the population level.
*  So because we couldn't, you know, we couldn't fit all of that in our heads, we
*  ended up like selectively learning and copying without really understanding that we
*  were able to surpass it. So I'll give you there's an experiment I talk about in the
*  book that really illustrates this, what humans do compared to other great apes.
*  So this was an experiment done with young children and young chimps.
*  Right. And so what the experiment has a box and the box has a hole on the top and
*  the hole on the side. Right.
*  And the experiment who takes a stick and pokes it through the whole on the top
*  and pokes it through the hole on the side.
*  And when they do this, they pull it through the hole in the side, they, they
*  get a piece of fruit, which the chimps love, and they get a sticker which the
*  kids love.
*  So the experiment's your supposed to hold through the top books, the whole through
*  the side, you know, hands it to the chimp.
*  What is the Grove do?
*  Poles the whole through the talk folks a hole through the side.
*  All right. Experimental.
*  Develops a hole through the top.
*  Pokes holes through decide hands to the child.
*  What does the child do.
*  So hope two top poke hole through this side.
*  Okay. Now in the key variation in the treatment, you have the same box, but it's no longer
*  a black box. It's transparent. You can see into it. Okay. And you realize that that first
*  action doesn't do anything. There's actually like a ceiling or a floor, you know, where
*  that it just hitting that it's to retrieve the fruit and the sticker. You just need the
*  second action. Okay. But again, the experimenter takes the stick, pokes a hole through the
*  top, pokes a hole through the side, hands it to the chip. Now, if you've ever watched
*  like a chip, you know, doing a working memory task or spinning through Instagram chips are
*  smart, man. Very good. You know, and so what do they do? Ignore that first action, go
*  straight to the second action and they retrieve their fruit and they're a happy chip. What
*  does the child do? Experimental pokes a hole through the top, pokes a hole through the
*  side, hands it to the child. What does the child do? Pokes a hole through the top, pokes
*  a hole through the side. So children, this, you have a head full of recipes that you don't
*  fully understand. Interesting. That you've, that you've accumulated and you acquire from,
*  from the, you know, from the smartest people since you were a child around you. Some of
*  those you've checked some of the many of those you haven't. And if your life is going well,
*  you've never had a need to check some of the beliefs that you hold and the behaviors you
*  engage in. But because we were smart because we're dumb, you know, we're smart because we
*  ate better than apes do. And because we are willing to defer to that body of information
*  culture, we don't sit naked in the rain like they do. They want to figure everything out
*  from first principles. They want to understand it before they do it. And so they, you know,
*  they're stuck. They're stuck at a particular limit by their brains.
*  That's a wonderful example. I love that experiment because the cynic might have said, see the
*  children, human children, not as smart as the chimps because they can't figure it out. But
*  your spin on it is whether or not they're smarter. They're relying on a whole thing that the
*  chimps don't have access to this sort of collective knowledge that gets us through the
*  complicated social environment we're in.
*  That's right. But you see that collective knowledge isn't just about kind of behaviors
*  and beliefs. It's also about mental tools like literal upgrades to our cultural software
*  for thinking. And we know some of this through history, thanks to history, which is the
*  cultural fossil record, if you like. Right. So if you take something like numeracy, right,
*  like some small scale societies still count one, two, three, and then many. And our ancestors
*  probably counted like that too. Right. We were able to get further using a metaphor. So
*  many societies would use stones, you know, think calcium calculus, you know, maybe stones
*  pressed into clay. So you've got notches as well, or, you know, cut into wood. Many societies
*  use body parts. So we have a decimal system, which is super annoying, to be honest, it
*  doesn't translate well to binary. It's the worst of all systems, you know, and other
*  societies use phalanges. So they count 12 with their with their thumb, the finger bones,
*  and various other body parts. Right. I wish we'd landed on 16, but here we are. Yeah. You
*  know, and so as a result of this, we now had a metaphor for thinking that we no longer
*  had to use. We can just like store it in our heads, represented in our heads. And now we
*  could count the natural numbers above one. But stones and, you know, fingers and whatever,
*  they don't make zero obvious, because zero stones is nothing. And nothing is well, it's
*  nothing. And so it took centuries before zero was recognized as a number. And centuries,
*  it was really the 17th, 18th century, the negative numbers became more obvious. And again,
*  it became it was an upgrade thanks to a the number line. So we moved away from objects to
*  position. Right. And you know, there's this quote I have in the book from a British
*  mathematician, Francis Mesries, and he's something like, you know, negative numbers darken
*  the very fabric of reality. It's like way melodramatic. Right. And he's right. But once
*  you have a number line, it's simple enough that you can teach it to young children, which is
*  what we do. Yeah. But it's given us a new ability, because obviously, once you can count,
*  you can count to do anything. And then the number line itself gets extended. Right. So it's like,
*  what if you have another number line that is, you know, orthogonal to the other one, it's like,
*  oh, a complex plane emerges, right. And so you don't you don't you can't see this, because we
*  live in a bubble, a very big bubble. So I don't mean like you and I, you know, in our ivory towers,
*  you know, I don't mean like coastal elites and rural small town. I mean, we're all every person
*  we ever meet went through education through school. And school has become since the Industrial
*  Revolution, the primary means by which we download a cultural package to the next generation.
*  Because we are a species that relies on socially transmitted information, you have every child has
*  to catch up on the last several thousand years of human history. And we try to do it more
*  efficiently. Because if we lose that link, we literally become dumber, we literally lose lose
*  a bunch of technology, right, we have to transmit that every generation. But as a result of that,
*  many of the things that we think of as being human are in fact endowed by us by accumulated
*  cultural knowledge, and you can't get it by measuring it. So the Stroop test, I don't know
*  if you've ever seen the Stroop test, basically, you've got words, the color words, and they're
*  written in the color like red written in red, blue, blue, blue, or mismatched, right. And
*  you ask people don't say don't read the word, just say the color. So you know, so even though
*  it says red, it's written in blue. So say blue, and people struggle. Reading has become an instinct
*  that overrides color perception. Now imagine, you know, a psychologist from Venus, you know,
*  like the anthropologist from Mars, a psychologist from Venus comes down and studies these crazy
*  apes on, you know, on the planet, and they give them the Stroop test. And they're like, oh,
*  it appears that humans have an innate ability to read, but no innate ability or it overrides any
*  kind of color perception, which would be wrong, of course, right. But because these culturally
*  endowed skills have become part of our thinking, they're in the ubiquitous at this point,
*  you can't measure it, you know, all of experimental psychology, all of even IQ tests were developed
*  after the advent of truancy laws and compulsory formal education. So even something like the
*  ability to reason, so I talk about some of my own work, right. So Alexander Luria, we were replicating
*  some of his work, so Luria goes out to Uzbekistan, he wants to understand how education is changing
*  people's psychology. And he uses if P then Q reasoning. Okay. So he this is actually one
*  of his questions. He says, where it snows, the bears are white in Novaya Zemlya, it snows,
*  what color the bears now you didn't say it, but you're thinking white, you know, like Uzbeks with
*  education white, my six year old white, you know, but what happened to the to the Uzbeks who didn't
*  have education? How do they answer? They're like, I think probably brown, I've never been there.
*  You're like, what? Listen to what I'm saying. And you're like, well, I don't know what color
*  the bears are. I haven't been to Novaya Zemlya. So it's not that humans can't reason, of course,
*  we can't write, but it's a grounded cultural reality based reasoning. And it becomes an ability
*  and a hypothetical ability to reason through our education system. And then the whole world becomes
*  more complex, right? Like a new baseline is achieved. So if you you know, if you think about
*  TV shows, right, like think of like Wham Bam Batman for the 1960s, for it is like the Dark
*  Knight from the from the early noughties, right? Like, even the most low brow television has more
*  convoluted storylines, more characters than you know, what our parents and grandparents watched,
*  right? So that is that that is that is the central premise. And so the book is all about well, how
*  does that software get written? And how do we write better software for the future? Because
*  although IQ test results have been going up, they have now stagnated. And so have our schools.
*  Let me ask the sort of chicken and egg problem here. Because when we talk about human exceptionalism,
*  there's a whole bunch of things that happened. And maybe they're all related. There was some kind of
*  phase transition, right? Like some people will emphasize language and symbolic manipulation of
*  information. Some people had Adam Bully on the podcast, who is a part of a group that likes
*  mental time travel, the ability to hypothesize the future and speak counterfactually as something
*  that is uniquely human. And you're, you know, like other people emphasizing this communal aspect,
*  the sort of offloading certain cognitive tasks to the collective, which came first? Is there
*  some causality there? Or is it a package deal? So actually, the book is about it tackles this very
*  problem. So you know, people who, people who posit things like so I know, Adam, you know, and I know
*  the language people, I'm not sure who you spoke to, but people who posit language, as an explanation
*  are wrong, because language is part of the package of humans. It doesn't explain anything because
*  you know, in evolutionary biology, you have a startup problem, right? So let's say I'm the
*  first person with like some genes for language. Well, that's useless, because nobody else speaks,
*  you know? So like, you've got to you've got a startup problem. And language only works if
*  you've got something worth transmitting. So fair enough. So language isn't an explanation. And a
*  lot of the other features of our of our cognition are also this part of this package. So you know,
*  the story the here's what here's what a mix of kind of the models and evidence and what you can
*  kind of piece together tells us. Okay. So the first thing that happened was that there was a
*  transition across the animal kingdom, but certainly for humans, because of our generation like toward
*  relying on social information. And it is it is if you look at the models and population genetics,
*  these are the models where you can branch off into a world of social learning. So if you when
*  when the environment is highly stable, then genes do the best job of adapting to that environment.
*  So even among humans, right? skin color is a genetic adaptation that is well predicted by
*  latitude because of UV radiation. You don't want so much UV radiation that you get cancer,
*  but you don't want so little that you have vitamin D deficiency, which also leads to cancers and
*  other diseases, right? But the time scale is very long for those adaptations to happen. So a stable
*  environment is where they're fairly long, but they happen right for for for our for the human
*  generation length, which is not, you know, last several thousand years, 100,000 years, right?
*  It's not sometimes if there's a selection is strong enough, it can be quite fast.
*  Okay, and if there's variation in the population. And so by the way, you know, remember, like humans,
*  like part of this puzzle is that humans, when most animals encounter a new environment,
*  they're forced to genetically adapt. And we did a little bit like human skin color, right? But you
*  know, like, more more fat for the Arctic more, you know, proteins to process the local plants,
*  we trend we as hunter gatherers before, you know, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology,
*  all of this stuff. And even before agriculture, we marched across the planet. And we figured it
*  out in each stage, you know, we figured out how to process the proteins using, you know, like new
*  tech new techniques, and so that we can eat them. You know, we we we didn't get much more fat and
*  fur. We hunted the local animals and avoided prey and war sometimes the predators, you know,
*  skins as our own, right? Yeah. So this is what we need to explain. This is what we need to explain.
*  So genes do a great job if if the environment is highly stable, if the environment is highly
*  unstable, then genes are not a good solution. Because, you know, today, the red berries are
*  edible tomorrow, the blueberries and the water is here, the water is there, whatever, right?
*  Instead, evolution has to rely on trial and error learning across the lifespan to figure it out.
*  You got to have a big brain to do that. And you got to do a lot of trial and error. And it's really
*  inefficient. And so these key models developed by, you know, mostly by a Roy, Rob Boyd and Pete
*  Richardson, and also by, you know, Kaveli Schwartz and Mark Feldman over at Stanford,
*  there's an intermediate zone of environmental variability where it is matched to generation
*  length, such that your parents and grandparents have some knowledge worth paying attention to.
*  And it is it is at this point that we begin to rely on the information they have. So imagine
*  something like a cyclical drought. Yeah, maybe, you know, you've you've never experienced one,
*  the lag is too long, right? Maybe your parents haven't either. But grandma remembers that when
*  she was a child, there was a drought, and they went left to the forest past the mountain. And,
*  you know, she leads her tribe to safely and, you know, I was I was recently
*  talking to another problem. She's like, that actually happens. You know? Oh, yeah.
*  You know, this is this is a real thing. Kim Hill, you know, was telling me, you know, from his group.
*  So so now in this zone, so this was a nice model developed in the 1980s,
*  right in 1981. And 1985, these models were developed. And everyone was like, Oh, that's
*  cool. Yeah, maybe that's what happened. And what happened was in the late 90s, and early 2000s,
*  we actually got ice core data. So we could see climatic variation. What did we find massive
*  amounts of variation followed by a moderate zone as you know, at exactly the moment when humans
*  evolve. Now, you should have to you should pause for a second be like, Well, wait a minute, all
*  those animals surely they all experience right? There is there is a link to there is a link to
*  generation length for the first step. But you also need something else to kick this thing off. You've
*  got this bootstrap problem. Okay, so I suspect, you know, in the book, this is going a little we
*  don't have a model of this, you know, by the way, you know, theories only become theories,
*  if you can write them down. So you know, this, what I just said, we've got good models for good,
*  good empirical evidence, what I'm about to say, we don't have as good models, except when it comes
*  to brain evolution, which is some of my own work. So I suspect bipedalism actually did a lot for us.
*  Okay. And the reason for that, so we were we were probably bipedal for completely separate reasons,
*  right? This is kind of an early adaptation. And by being bipedal, it did two things. One, it freed
*  our hands for you for making tools and carrying them around, right? So you can invest in that
*  stone axe, because you can carry it to the next location and use it again. Whereas if you're a
*  quadrupedal ape, like a chimp or a orangutan or gorilla, whatever, like you don't want to carry
*  this big ass rock around. So you don't you have to reuse it. So cheapen the cost of tools. The
*  second thing that it did is what I'm doing with you right now that unfortunately, audio listeners
*  can't see, which is talking with my hands, right? Let's do that. Yeah, Italians. We all do it. I saw
*  you do it, you know, we talk with our hands. And so that opened up a new modality for communicating
*  with. So now now we can begin to solve that language problem, which, as I said, is not an
*  explanation as part of that package. So imagine, I should say more. So information begins to accumulate
*  because cultural evolution becomes a second line of inheritance. And that happens because of what
*  I described there. So for any evolutionary system, these three ingredients, variation,
*  like diversity, easy to solve for culture, people do all kinds of things for all kinds of reasons,
*  different information, different personalities, whatever transmission. So you need reliable,
*  you don't want too much information to be lost during the transmission process. So for,
*  for it for genes, of course, it's because genes are not mutating at a very high rate.
*  And you need variation reduction. And if you want it to be adaptive, you need selection,
*  where more of the good stuff sticks around and less of the bad stuff. Right. And if you meet
*  those criteria, you have an evolutionary system. It's how genetic algorithms work. Right. So genes,
*  we know how that works for culture. I just gave you the transmission we copy without understanding.
*  And so we don't lose too much information. And we do it selectively. We copy people who are more
*  successful. We copy people who other people are copying. We copy people who are experts. You know,
*  we have a we have a psychology that leads us to, for example, if a celebrity says I'm drinking this
*  drink, you're like, I want that drink. We do it instinctively. Why it's got nothing to do with
*  their success. Right. But other people, you know, but we don't know. It's a black box. I don't know
*  why, you know, Beyonce is such a great singer. So I'm just going to, I'm going to wear her perfume
*  and I'm going to dress like her. I'm going to do everything. Cause you know, if I'm trying to copy
*  the best hunter, maybe it's because of the shoes he wears or, you know, his weapons or where he goes
*  hunting, but equally it's because of his kickass beard or fact that he shaves his head or the gods
*  he worships. So a little hunter copies everything about them. Now, if you have that system, you've
*  already deferred to the population level and information begins to accumulate. Okay. Now we
*  have evidence for early accumulation of information because one of the best pieces of evidence from,
*  in my view, that this is absolutely why humans evolve is the fact that we rely on cooked food.
*  Our jaws are too, too weak for chewing like a gorilla on leaves all day. And our guts are
*  too short to process that food anyway, even if we could. Right. So that means we were cooking food.
*  We had fire. Now, I don't know if you've ever tried to light a fire, but it's hard, man. It's
*  hard, right? Once you're taught, it's hard. Right. And so like that meant that we needed fire to
*  survive and we don't have genes for it. It's gotta have been culturally transmitted. You couldn't
*  have figured it out. So that's a very early, very early bit of information. And maybe the stone tools
*  too, and probably before the stone tools, the bone tools and the wooden tools that didn't survive the
*  passage of time. When you say very early, what years are we guessing? So we're talking like
*  millions of years, millions of years ago, one and a half. Yeah. Yeah. So this is like very early on.
*  So before like modern humans. Yeah. And we have evidence for this, right? Like we have little bits
*  of evidence for, for, and so that meant while we were bipedal, we had information worth transmitting.
*  Right. And so that means you can get what's called a Baldwinian process in evolution. So
*  a Baldwinian process is one where you can get to a place through learning, but if you can get
*  there through genes more efficiently, those genes can be selected. So in this case, I can, there is
*  a bunch of gestures I can give you so you can build the tool or light the fire or know that, you know,
*  I can, I can have guttural utterances and I can wave my hands in a particular way. And you can learn
*  that that means just through, you know, reinforcement learning, figure out what I'm talking about.
*  But now if you have cognitive changes that allow you to acquire that bit of language, that bit,
*  you can do it more efficiently. And that means the next generation, you can do a little bit more
*  and a little bit more and a little more. Now you have the ratchet to get up in the presence
*  of an accumulating body of knowledge. You see where I'm going? Yeah, I do. And so go ahead,
*  keep going there. Yeah. So, so you have, you have, you can begin to accumulate this knowledge, right?
*  And so some of the genetic changes, by the way, like made us more susceptible to choking.
*  So as I say in the book, we were literally dying to speak to one another.
*  And so, you know, and so we had, so this did a few things. So one, now we had all this knowledge.
*  We had language begin to evolve. Language continues to evolve by the way. So for example,
*  it becomes more efficient. Some of my research and our brains grew. So they tripled in size
*  compared to our last common ancestor, you know, five to seven million years ago with a chip.
*  Our brains grew to the point where if you look at the medical literature today,
*  once you hit about the 85th percentile, so doctors used to think it was like big babies were difficult
*  to birth. Turns out it's not big babies, it's big heads. Once you hit about the 85th percentile,
*  it hockey sticks up in terms of emergency caesareans and emergency, you know, forceps.
*  So basically you need these. So that means for our species, like it was kind of the curse of Eve,
*  right? Like we had all this knowledge, big brain, it's painful and dangerous childbirth for mother
*  and baby. Yeah. So, so we did other things. We began to, for example, extend our childhoods,
*  right? So one change that seems to have happened for us is we had a self-domestication and we
*  became neotenous, which is an easy change revolution to make. I mean, we turned the
*  magnificent wolf into a poodle. You know, so we, we neotenized dogs into permanent puppies. And the
*  same thing happened for us. We are permanent, youthful apes able to learn for a very long time.
*  So we had a longer child, a longer juvenile period, and we created an adolescence,
*  which is the period from when you could reproduce to when you actually do,
*  which has been growing and growing as the body of knowledge has begun to grow. It used to be that
*  like a high school degree was enough to get a good job. Then it was a high school degree,
*  plus any college degree, then a STEM degree, then also a master's degree and an unpaid internship.
*  And so, and so when our actually hitting a new limit. So before the primary selection was on
*  like being able to give birth to these bigger heads. Now it's like about giving birth at an older
*  age, right? Yeah. This, all of this completely changed our societies in a variety of ways that
*  puts the whole human package together. It's what created grandmothers. It's what created,
*  you know, the, the difference between men and women. Like you created dads, very unusual among
*  great apes. It, yeah, I mean, the, the, the division of labor, you know, the division of
*  information, all of this emerges. So it's not what, you know, the theory of everyone isn't like,
*  so I make fun of what I call, I love this genre of book, by the way, the one thing that explains
*  everything, you know, the toti kind of books, you know, it's like, let me show you why my little bit
*  of research that I just love happens to explain the whole damn world. Right. Yeah. This is, this
*  is a toti adjacent book, like toti is like an acronym for that, you know, it's adjacent, right?
*  But I'm not like doing this one thing. Like I've got, you know, I kind of talk about the role that
*  energy, like the big theme of the book is the role that energy and particularly excess energy
*  has played in all of life and certainly in our civilization. And I talk about the fact that
*  there are kind of four laws and you're going to hate this as a physicist, but I don't mean
*  Newtonian laws. I mean, kind of lenses upon which we can view the world, you know,
*  the law of energy, which is fundamentally life is competing over excess energy,
*  the law of innovations and efficiency. So life is evolving new ways to use that energy more
*  efficiently. The law of cooperation that the scale of cooperation, it's the level at which
*  the individual unit, be they cells or individuals or, you know, in a society or in an employees in
*  a business is the level at which that per person per unit, uh, return on energy is not going to be
*  higher in a larger or smaller group. And the law of evolution, which is that both through genetic
*  and cultural evolution and the interaction between these, we find the space of how to cooperate,
*  how to innovate at a population level and how to, and how to unlock new bits of energy, which,
*  you know, thanks to the fossil fuel revolution with the industrial revolution, we now live in
*  that world. Well, let's talk about energy a little bit, because the story that you just painted
*  reminds us of this idea that history is basically a search for calories, right? Yeah, food calories,
*  back in the day. And then when we invent industrial technology, we're just, we need even more
*  calories in the sense of, of an energy source. And part of the theme of your book is how much
*  of a central organizing principle that is for human history. Correct. Yeah, that's exactly right. So,
*  you know, for, for us, the, the first, um, this is an ancient thing, you know, what you just said
*  about calories and I, you know, I put it in terms of Jules or Watts, like this is fundamentally what
*  matters. You know, the first organisms, whenever we turn from RNA into the first self replicators
*  or whatever, um, sorry, the other way around, you know, the first self replicators into RNA
*  and eventually organisms. Um, the only energy we had is like the fact that we got a large moon,
*  which was closer to the earth sloshing the water back and forth over the, you know, the land and
*  the seas. So you got some gravitational energy there, but some of it's the sun falling. So we
*  have the earliest proto photosynthesis, which was, um, uh, which didn't use any oxygen, right? Right.
*  And, uh, then we had a mutation, which, uh, led to a more efficient photosynthesis, which, you know,
*  polluted the world, the great oxygenation event, mass mass extinction, but there was also a new
*  opportunity. So once we had photosynthesis, turning solar energy into chemical energy in the form of
*  like ATP and little sugar, little sugar cubes, basically, it meant that other organisms could
*  begin to find a new niche of not directly converting the sun into, into organism and moving
*  at plant pace, but eating other organisms and moving a little faster, right? There were like
*  a little bundle, just as a story of colonialization, actually, you know, an energy rich little corner of
*  Eurasia creates the largest empire the world has ever seen out competing other, less energy, less,
*  less cooperative societies in devastating ways. Um, and so, you know, and so the same pattern
*  happens throughout life. You got prokaryotes getting eaten by eukaryotes, eukaryotes being eaten by,
*  multi-cellular life, complex multi-cellular life, and eventually all the way to you,
*  who is more like an ecosystem, an Amazon rainforest of a microbiome and, you know,
*  and interacting differentiated cells more than you are a single organism. And if you run out of
*  energy, you're going to get defeated by the lower scales, by the bacteria, or you're going to get
*  your stuff stolen from you by the bigger scale, same pattern across the, across everything.
*  So, uh, for humans, the, in terms of our calories, the first unlocking of energy was the one I
*  described before, which is fire, right? Uh, we, it was a chemical energy technology that allowed us
*  to pre-digest foods and make them, those calories more bioavailable, which allowed us to grow those
*  brains and shrink those guts, right? Occupy a new niche. The next major revolution was agriculture,
*  which was a solar technology, right? Where now, rather than expending all that energy, walking
*  around searching, you know, hunting and gathering, like trying to find plants and small animals or
*  large animals in a group, you domesticate and look after animals and you, you, you, you grow food
*  more efficiently. It was the law of innovation, if you like, and the law of energy, and you grow your
*  population to the point where you out-compete the hunter gatherer groups to the margins that are not
*  suitable to agriculture, which is still where they live today, right? And those larger groups are able
*  to innovate more. And you lay the foundations for the beginnings of cities as kind of massive nodes
*  of collective intelligence, right? This continues and we live in a Malthusian world, right? Of,
*  because, because the pattern in this story across every scale is that when you get this unlocking,
*  you get an era of abundance. And that would have been that first era of abundance. And then,
*  because carrying capacity has gone up, the number of individuals meets that carrying capacity,
*  and you once again enter an era of scarcity, where the per person calories or energy is lower.
*  The next major unlocking that is most relevant to us was the industrial revolution, which if you look
*  at any metric of progress, the size of our polities, the, you know, child survival rates,
*  anything you care about, it just shoots up into the sky, right? And as Ian Morris puts it,
*  it made a mockery of all the world's earlier history, scientific revolution, black death,
*  Renaissance blips in anything we care about. And that's because we exploited stored solar
*  energy in the form of like Pete turned to black rock coal and, you know, algae, you know, whatever
*  turned to oil and natural gas, right? And we unlocked that in a matter of centuries,
*  we began to burn that down. And we using that excess energy, we multiplied ourselves in our
*  efforts. We had another agricultural revolution, the green revolution, you know, Norman Borlaug,
*  where we synthesize through the Haber-Bosch process, we synthesize fertilizer with nitrogen in the air
*  and, you know, natural gas. And this allowed us like 4 billion people, half the population
*  alive today, thanks to that process, we're literally eating our fossil fuels, we use them
*  to develop new technologies. Now, here's where we transition to, you know, part two of the book,
*  which is that the energy return on investment, which is a key metric I care a lot about,
*  is decreasing. So the excess energy is shrinking and economics and a lot of what we do, we focus
*  on efficiency, because they all developed long after the industrial revolution, right? Or after
*  the industrial revolution. And so if you look at one metric, like oil discovery, and all the metrics
*  look like this. In 1919, one barrel of oil found you another thousand barrels,
*  okay, a massive return on energy. By 1951 barrel oil, a barrel of oil found you another hundred.
*  And by 2010, one barrel found you another five. So the level of cooperation is governed by this,
*  if you like the space of the possible created by an energy ceiling and an efficiency floor,
*  and that is shrinking, our ability to innovate new efficiencies is decreasing, the rate of that is
*  decreasing, and the ceiling is rapidly falling on us. And so our societies, all of the fractures
*  are cracking, we're falling back to lower scales of cooperation as a result of this.
*  And so I can get out of this as a physician.
*  Let's pause and dwell on this, because I think this is an important thing. First, let me just
*  sort of summarize this point, which I'm going to be very much in favor of as a physicist,
*  that the progress in the sense of just change, not necessarily improvement of human society,
*  is a story of transitions, right? It's more punctuated equilibrium than gradual improvement.
*  We, you know, innovate.
*  It's gradually gradual and occasionally punctuated. Yeah, sure.
*  Yeah, but the idea that we do innovate, we find some new mode for doing something,
*  whether it's producing energy or technology or whatever, and then that gives us space, right?
*  We can then grow into that. But you're saying that as we do grow into that, as we sort of reach
*  what might be a new equilibrium, we also, because there's less spare excess wealth in various forms
*  to go around, things get squeezed a little bit, our social fabric gets a little bit harder to
*  maintain. That's right. So I mean, our not only does population grown. And so that alone is but
*  that's a good thing for the most part, because it means more innovation, right? Like more people
*  more in so far as everyone is able to access all of that cultural knowledge. And, you know,
*  opportunity matches talent and all of that stuff, which, as we both know, isn't often not always
*  true. Yeah. But but you know, the other side of it is simply that the space itself is shrinking,
*  because not only is abundance turning into scarcity for the usual reasons, but we're re entering a
*  mouth using world simply because our excess energy is decreasing. Like, it doesn't matter how fancy
*  your gadgets and technology are, if you can't charge them. Like our ability to access energy
*  isn't just like price, it's a proxy for it. That's affected by a bunch of other things. It's
*  literally how much energy do I need to get some amount of energy back? ideal world, you want a
*  small energy sector, it's like 5% of the economy at the moment, right? That's great. But as because
*  that means that the returns on that energy allow you to do everything else that makes life worth it,
*  like traveling on flights across the planet, and you know, hanging out with your friends and eating
*  great food, that it requires ingredients drawn from all around the world, all of that stuff
*  relies on abundant energy.
*  And I guess, yeah, I think you're gonna have to convince me of this one a little bit more,
*  because I can imagine, you know, the same kind of general story, but then saying, well, once we
*  reach some equilibrium, once we have some steady flow of energy in and things out, then we can
*  figure out a way to organize our society that fits in to that equilibrium, you know, the moments of
*  change in a different telling than what you just gave, the moments of change are the scary ones
*  where we're not sure what's going on. But once everything is a steady flow, there, we might reach
*  a happy equilibrium. But you seem to be saying that's not empirically what happens. That's a very
*  physicist answer. Yeah. I mean, in biology, regardless of our, you know, our evolutionary
*  game theory, there are no equilibrium. And the reason for that is because, you know, in a world,
*  so, you know, I tell the story in the beginning of the book, like why I got into this, I'm trained
*  as an engineer, you know, originally, and I kind of switched fields. And the reason that I did that
*  is I got really concerned around climate change. And I got concerned about a lot of I've lived in
*  a lot of different places like Africa, New Guinea, and things like that. And I was concerned that
*  people don't understand culture, first off. And second, climate change, we're all focused on
*  mitigation. But as the world changes, we're also gonna have to figure out how to live in a climate
*  changed world. And some of that we get like carbon capture and those kinds of technologies. But how
*  do you deal with a million Bangladeshis underwater coming into India? How do you like, not have
*  civilization come apart? What does that mean for, you know, the Middle East and then for Europe,
*  like the Syrian migration crisis is the first example of that, you know, you had climate change,
*  probably induced droughts, you have a bunch of people coming into cities, there's not enough
*  jobs to go around, not enough infrastructure to support them. Eventually, they start to, you know,
*  and then the geopolitics kicks in, eventually, you have a difficult problem at Europe store stuff,
*  right? That's what I wanted to work on. So the thing is that in a world, like, you know, I
*  remember watching Al Gore's documentary in 2007. And I was like, and I started reading the IPCC
*  reports, I was reading the Pentagon reports. And I was like, Gore is absolutely right about the problem.
*  But he's crazy. Like, are we going to slow the economy to save the planet? If we do, amazing,
*  I'm happy. But I just I just don't believe that because in a world where every, every country is
*  trying to outcompete every other country, every company is trying to outcompete every other
*  company, and every individual wants more than their neighbors, you're not going to get this
*  equilibrium, sustainable, you know, whatever you're all you're going to do is encourage a zero sum
*  Malthusian world where your success means my loss, because there's a limited pie from which
*  we are taking stuff, unless you can somehow equalize everything and people don't like that.
*  So I mean, any theory of change or any theory of society that requires a complete shift in human
*  nature, and not just constraining in some way, is broken. It's broken from the beginning, it's broken
*  before you got there. So this is an example, there isn't, you know, so like ideas like degrowth, or,
*  you know, like, just pure sustainability, stagnation are dangerous, because they will
*  shove us back into a zero sum environment. Is that what it was like back in the hunter gatherers?
*  Yeah, so hunter gatherers are really interesting. So we have some new work where we're trying to
*  so hunter gatherers are well, some hunter gatherer groups are known for their egalitarianism, right?
*  They do equalize, right? If you move to like pastoralists and chiefdoms, you start to see a
*  bit more inequality and things like this. And so people sometimes interpret that as the ancestral
*  state was, you know, was was an egalitarian humans are by nature egalitarian. No, that is probably an
*  adaptation to those zero sum conditions, whether it's weak property rights. Why? Because in a world
*  that is zero sum, and that means your your gain is my loss and vice versa. If you like you start
*  a pizza business, right? Pizza, you know, I'm like, you started pizza, you took a piece of that
*  limited market, I gotta like burn your business down or take from you. That's what it incentivizes.
*  It incentivizes destructive competition. In a world that's positive, some you start a pizza
*  business, I'm like, yo, I got to start my own chain of pizza, you know, like, obviously, the pizza
*  business is booming, very different psychology, productive competition. So hunter gatherers in a
*  world of destructive competition, and there's two equilibria that emerged in the model.
*  One, they just kill each other to extinction because of these destructive cycles, or two,
*  they managed to flatten. But the consequence of that flattening is a decrease in productivity,
*  because what is the point if you can't rise higher, right? It's a little decrease in production.
*  And it is a kind of stagnation, if you like, right, that eventually gets you out competed
*  by the pastoralists by the agriculturalists by, you know, the larger societies that are not engaged
*  in that. And so that's the central problem with what I think the solution you're alluding to.
*  Well, it's not even a solution. I'm just wondering what the space of possibilities is. But you're
*  pointing out that, to put it in the harshest possible terms, inequality can be a driver of
*  innovation. Correct. And we and evolution, like life is competing. Now you could get cycles,
*  if you like, you know, like predator prey model type stuff, you know, where it's like you get a
*  nice bird and the rabbits go up and you know, the hair go up and then, you know, the foxes
*  catch up and then you get a lie. You can get these kind of equilibria emerge, but it's not a it's a
*  Malthusian world that most animals inhabit. We escaped the Malthusian trap simply because we got
*  a little boost. So the question is, so my view is that in order to tackle these very real problems
*  around sustainability, climate change, and not destroying ourselves and our planet, we need the
*  next era of abundance, not, you know, an era of scarcity, because, you know, the countries that
*  are it's, first off, it's easy to be nice to people when there's plenty to go around. Right.
*  And second, the countries that can invest in looking after their environment and preserving
*  blocks of land and wanting to live in a clean environment are those that are wealthy enough,
*  energy rich enough, that they're not worried about simple things like food, and, you know,
*  having enough resources for hospitals and education and other infrastructure. Those are the
*  countries like, you know, I was in Australia recently. Australian citizen, actually, you know,
*  like, so I, you know, I was I was in the Great Barrier Reef. I was there as a as a teenager.
*  And I remember, like, oh, my God, like, I was in these areas. It was like, so bleached, right? This
*  was in, I don't know, early 2000s or something. And I was back again last year. And I was
*  astonished. I was talking to people like, how did you manage to restore the reef? They have money,
*  they have resources, and they care about it enough, because they have the highest household
*  wealth in the world. And the only country in the world that has, you know, positive migration from
*  America, right? So they're able to invest in it, if they want to. You do that in a world of
*  abundance, not scarcity. Well, I'm Yeah, I mean, and I don't want to disagree, because I don't know
*  enough to be able to disagree. But I'm curious about the possibilities. Like I said, is that
*  that story you just told is compatible in my mind with an equilibrium zero sum game where everybody
*  has that level of wealth, right? I mean, I haven't quite seen the connection to
*  inequality and competition. It's just exactly what you said. So there is no baseline, right?
*  There's no like, now I'm satisfied. Right? You know, like, I have enough, like progress and,
*  you know, and and combat like we want more, we want more than our neighbors. And there's always
*  problems to be solved. And even if you as a society, even if you as an individual decide,
*  you know what, I have enough, we decided you're going to get out competed by the mutation,
*  cultural or genetic, right? Where that says, actually, I want a little more. Yeah, it's not
*  in equally. In other words, it's invadable by that other mutation. Okay, I'll make I'll make one more
*  stab at utopian egalitarianism. And then you can move on. Even if we bought the idea that inequality
*  is is going to happen, unless it's sort of we enforce some kind of rigid, you know, equitability
*  that everyone is unhappy. Can we imagine that we're in a world of such abundance now that we can
*  have some equality, some competition, some motivation for innovation, and yet, the worst
*  off people are still much better off than they are today in the actual world?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the issue is, so I kind of survey the the energy technologies available to
*  us. And I really apart from solar, if we solve the battery problem, and hydro, which is fantastic,
*  if you've got fast rolling rivers, please use them, get on your Canada, you know, it's really
*  it's really nuclear, as having the right numbers apart from fossil fuels, and the fact that those
*  are decreasing, we're in real trouble. And you know, there are there are you can have a society
*  that's more redistributive, and it comes at a cost or look at the top 100 European companies,
*  right? And they're old, you know, very few were, you know, invented, you know, created like this
*  century, if you like, look at the top 100 American companies, how many of them, right? Europe
*  redistributes a lot. And so it squashes, you know, it's a good it's like I live in Europe,
*  right? I live in the UK somewhere between it squashes things. And so productivity is lower,
*  production is low. And so you end up, you know, with America doing a lot of the innovation,
*  and there's a little bit of free writing, you know, where you get to benefit from all of those
*  drugs, and all of those technologies, you get to use the iPhone, you get to use, you know,
*  the internet, you get to use all of these different technologies. But it's being driven
*  by this American, you know, this creation of inequality in America driven, like, you know,
*  so I talk about Silicon Valley, right? Silicon Valley is a, people think of it as like a bastion
*  of success. No, man, it's a graveyard of failure. Right? Oh, yeah. And, and that's what America,
*  you know, America says, you do you everybody go try you can do this too, right? It's terrible
*  at an individual level. The Asian model, like the, you know, Asian tiger mom, you know, Japan,
*  whatever is, you know, you don't do you, you do me like you do this, you follow the script,
*  and everyone is better off, but it leads to incremental innovation, like you have to believe
*  in a crowded market, where everybody also thinks this. And most people still fail that you're
*  going to make it. Yeah. And a society that encourages that in a large enough marketplace
*  with enough energy results in finding the few apples, what we call unicorns for a reason,
*  right? The apples, the Amazons, the alphabets, the whatevers, right? And the graveyard of failure
*  is forgotten, because America is richer as a result of this. And you draw a good I'm going
*  to give up on the utopia there, you know, the egalitarian, I'm actually not highly committed
*  to it. I would enjoy this, not highly committed to it. But I want to learn. But you then take
*  this picture, I know we've given it very short shrift, because it's a deep book with a lot of
*  things going on. But you take this picture of human nature and the development of history through
*  these transitions and getting the energy, and you apply it to current issues that we have. I mean,
*  climate change is one of them, of course, but also political polarization. I mean, what about, you
*  know, the growth of populism and authoritarianism, and so forth? How do we understand that through
*  this lens? So I mean, the first thing is, you know, like, ideally, you want to predict, you want to
*  explain, but then you want to be able to do something about it. I mean, so I see the rise of,
*  there are always fractures that exist in a society, right? There are always fractures,
*  they are the class divisions, ethnic divisions, you know, regional divisions, there's all these
*  fractures that exist. But in a world where there's plenty to go around, people just mumble and grumble.
*  So, you know, I have this analogy, imagine the buses, buses coming along, right? That's the rate
*  of economic growth. And people are waiting for the buses. And you know, you've got some people who,
*  like, have special passes, the 1%, get to the front of the line first. And you've got groups
*  to like favor their in group. And like, they're like, come on, you can come in front and you're
*  waiting there. But if the buses are coming every five minutes, you mumble, you grumble,
*  but you put up with it, because you're going to get a seat. Just wait five minutes more. But if
*  the rate of buses slows down, what an hour, what a day. It's like driving around a car park where
*  there's plenty of spaces versus only one and now some asshole. So can I say that? Go ahead. Yeah.
*  Someone like tries to take your place, right? It's a very different psychology.
*  So and it doesn't even have to be like a reality, like the perception that that is happening,
*  the created perception can create the reality, right? Or if you're looking at if you if you're
*  if we have a psychologist sensitive to rate of change, right, and you feel like things are
*  slowing down a little bit, right, that alone is enough to trigger this, those fractures becoming
*  something more. So then you can have the rise of the right wing, you can you end up with more
*  ethnic fractures, you get political polarization, you get all those fractures becoming something
*  more. And the solution to that is one, if you've got the resources, invest, right, you can have a
*  million people turn up at your door if you don't have enough food and water and prepare for those
*  guests, right? So you need to invest in infrastructure. So that already stretched schools,
*  you know, the good schools, the hospital lines, you know, people are not waiting and waiting.
*  And now they're annoyed because you're giving things to newcomers. Like that's a recipe for
*  ethnic conflict. But if you're investing, and you're like, you know, alongside this this new
*  group of people, we're going to put in all this money so that there's enough space for everyone.
*  That's a good thing. And if you don't have that, you need to be investing in energy technologies
*  that allow us to raise that ceiling. So talk about the umbrella model of multiculturalism is really
*  fusing all of these solutions into something that would work in a way that current melting pots or
*  mosaics or, you know, no, no hyphen French models really just don't.
*  So just to try to rephrase it, because I do think this resonates with something that I had believed
*  for a while. They're one of the things the major factor that what is the acronym you use that you
*  have the one thing that explains everything. When it comes to, you know, populism, etc. is the idea
*  that people who are not well off, which you might think are going to go for like leftists who are who
*  want to spread the wealth, but they really are feeling powerless. And both in the sense that
*  their political voices aren't heard and that their lives are getting worse. Right. And then they that
*  combination pushes them toward appealing to a strong figure who can shake things up.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Look, you know, as I pointed out in the book, I don't think there's good evidence
*  that people don't like inequality. What people don't like is a double negative. So you're saying
*  that there are people like it like equality. No, I'm not saying that people like equality or
*  inequality or whatever. What the people want is fairness. Yeah. Okay. Right. Like people want the
*  outcomes to be matched to the input, you know, like they want a return like they don't want
*  necessarily the handout. Maybe some people do. Right. But like people want the opportunity
*  so that what they do that they're hard work, like if they choose to wake up early and get to the
*  front of the line at that bus stop, they will get at their seat. And when that stops happening,
*  no matter how early they wake up, or because of where they're born or who they're born to,
*  they just never get that seat. That is the problem. That's when society starts to come apart.
*  And that's what we need to resolve. So, you know, in the section on inequality,
*  I differentiate between, you know, wealth creation versus wealth appropriation.
*  Wealth appropriation is rent seeking. It's monopolistic behavior. It's like land, you know,
*  like holding onto land for centuries, as in the country I live in, you know, where you're just,
*  you're just taking, you know, a rent on the land, providing no additional value, right? This is why
*  we need like land value taxes, and kind of a way out of this. It's like a huge thing that I talk
*  about in the book. Whereas wealth creation is like you created Apple, or you created, you know,
*  Windows, or you created Amazon. Yeah, you put like a bunch of high streets and malls out of work,
*  but you made things more efficient that consumers like, and you actually, you created wealth in
*  some sense, either through efficiency, the law of efficiency, sorry, the law of innovations,
*  efficiency, or because you've found some new energy technology or something, right? You've
*  literally created a new, you've increased the space of the possible, and you are allowed to
*  keep a part of that space. And you are allowed to make other bets that we hope will continue to
*  expand the space. But the issue is that unearned intergenerational transmission of wealth that
*  entrenches that inequality, slowly over time, having the remaining people fight over smaller
*  and smaller scraps. That is when society comes apart. And that's what we need to solve.
*  So you'd be in favor of larger estate taxes?
*  Would be great. As I point out in the book, that would be great. But it runs up against a few
*  issues. One is smart estate planning, wealth flight, where people take their money out of the
*  country. And it also goes against, you know, it goes against kind of instincts about like,
*  provisioning for your children and working harder later in life. It's not it would be great.
*  What here's the outcome you want, you want to create a world that is, every generation has a
*  fairly fair playing field to start with, so that the best and brightest of every generation can
*  push forward our species to where we need to go. And over time, things accrue that prevent that
*  happening. So what I actually so there's a you know, there's a there's an open secret within
*  economics, where across the political spectrum, you know, people agree that most taxes are
*  distortionary. You know, they affect your behavior in negative ways, like your income tax, right?
*  Like if you are afraid, you're going to earn a little bit more and move into the next income
*  bracket, you're like that marginal gain is not worth it for me. So now it's distortionary on
*  your productivity, your production. You know, sales tax, like I'm not going to buy that because of
*  the sales tax is distortionary on commerce. There's one tax that is non distortionary.
*  And there's a moral case for it. And it is fair. And it would do away with the need for the other
*  taxes. You could get rid of income tax, you can get rid of sales tax and get rid of capital gains
*  tax. And you can still pay for the US military and Medicare and you know, this country many
*  are living. So that is land value taxes. So the one asset that people own that they did not create
*  the one asset that stands above all others is land. And I don't mean like what you do on the land,
*  you shouldn't be taxed for your buildings or anything you do on the land. But the land itself
*  is common. And there's a moral case almost like slavery, where we really need to get rid of this
*  ability to own land, or at the very least, those who take that land should be taxed for, you know,
*  for that use of that land for its most. And this does all kinds of things. So it's non
*  distortionary, it leads to the most productive use of that land, it solves a lot of housing issues.
*  And the only barrier to it that people agree is is going to require revolution, unless I guess
*  the middle class realized that because we all you know, I own land, you own land, you know,
*  like we own land. But what you don't realize is how little you own relative to, you know,
*  many others. 25,000 Britons who own half of the country or, you know, the 10% of Americans who
*  own I think 60% of the country. But just to just to point out, this is very radical as a proposal.
*  And there's probably, you know, unanticipating consequences. So the difference in utopia and,
*  you know, in a better world constraints. Yeah. And what you want, you know, there are real
*  constraints on this. And so what I what I suggest, you know, I suggest pathways out of this. So the
*  path dependence leads us into a world, like it's hard to rewrite the Constitution. It's hard to
*  like change the tax code overnight. But what you can do is do what for example, so you know, last
*  week I was in Estonia, because I want to understand how they are the top of the pizza tables in the
*  Western world, beaten only by a handful of other handful of East Asian countries. And they do it
*  while spending less per per student than the rest of the the OECD average and certainly less than
*  the US, Canada, UK, Australia, you know, then and they have better outcomes. How do they do that?
*  Sorry, explain what these tables are that you're talking about? Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry. The OECD
*  pizza tables test students around the world on mathematics, on reading and on science. Good.
*  Okay. And Stonia tops that table, their students top the table, right? Apart, as I said, from a
*  couple of a few Asian countries, how did they do that? So I went there to understand, you know,
*  I spoke to the former education minister, I spoke to the person who founded what was called the
*  Tiger League Foundation. So after the fall of the, well, after the Soviet occupation ended in 1991,
*  only half the country had a telephone. So, you know, when a Stony became a country, they were
*  like, Okay, if we want to leap ahead, we're gonna have to do something different. We're not like
*  super wealthy, we don't have like a bunch of resources, we just have our people, right? That's
*  it, we got to invest in our people. And so you know, you can tell you can see how why the people who
*  did this thought of it because of their own experiences, but they decided to really invest
*  in technology. So they created what was called the Tiger League Foundation, where they overnight
*  gave it the access to computers, you know, for every student, they internet connected everybody,
*  they train the teachers and so on, right, that they were able to do this, because they have
*  radical decentralization. Every school has autonomy over what they do, every municipality
*  has autonomy, and the central government can't just say, let's do this, they have to incentivize.
*  So teachers were incentivized to share knowledge through this teacher social network called school
*  life, they gave them opportunities and incentivized by sharing that knowledge, they increase their pay,
*  they give them opportunities to travel to other places to borrow the best from things from around
*  the world, creating a brand new curriculum. And they tested a bunch of things at a local level.
*  And when it worked, it got spread to the rest of the country. Many, you know, so you know, in this
*  case, for example, robotics is taught like they were the first country to teach reading, writing,
*  arithmetic, and now algorithms to like elementary school students. They, they trialed and you know,
*  Conrad Wolfram's I don't know if you come across Conrad Wolfram's criticism of math education,
*  where he says, you know, math education recapitulates history for some reason.
*  Like we you know, we're like, we're gonna learn numbers now, the Greeks and Pythagoras for some
*  reason. And you know, eventually get to algebra and eventually calculus, right? Many students never
*  get to calculus. And we don't learn any 20th century math in high school, let alone 21st century,
*  like we're missing huge swaths. Why is that really the most efficient way to do it? So Conrad, you
*  know, obviously wanting to sell some Wolfram products, but you know, he, he argues, well,
*  in the real world, you and I do math on computers, right? Like we're not back in the envelope
*  calculations. That's not where the hard stuff gets done. Right. And so what you want is for kids to
*  understand what it means to take a derivative, what it means to what an integral actually is,
*  and how it can be used, and maybe some stats and you know, like, you want them to have mental models
*  and work alongside computers. And you can teach that before you what's hard about calculus is not
*  the derivatives and integrals. It's the chain rule. It's the mechanics, the quadratic, you know,
*  it's those that are difficult. That's not what's important. That was built for world before.
*  Middle school teacher was like, make sure you learn how to do mental math. You're not going to
*  carry a calculator in your pocket. So we so they were able to trial that. And now they're
*  trialing this really radical new education system, where they the learning happens at home,
*  right? Where homework and schoolwork are swapped, basically, like, how can a teacher
*  teach to 20 to 30 kids have different abilities, they can't. So the lower end get left behind,
*  the upper end are ignored, right. And so in order to do that, what happens is, if you when you're
*  at home, you get educational material, you get teachers and whatever, you get this from the best
*  minds. And then you come to school to practice that you do the homework where the teachers not
*  the deliverer of knowledge that the facilitator helping you use the internet and AI to practice
*  your skills in a very kind of practical real world focus. And you do that through radical
*  decentralization. So the US works the same way, by the way, you know, justice Brandeis referred
*  to each state as a laboratory for democracy, right? Arizona, you want to try something, go try it. If
*  you fail, you fail at an Arizona level. And if it works, we bubble it up to the top. Such a Nadella
*  converted Microsoft from a monolith to a series of startups using the same principle, you know, it's
*  like, you're going to try different things, and we're going to bubble it up to Microsoft and it
*  works. And that they invested in chat GPT and open AI, right? Great moves. And the shares have been
*  soaring. The Catholic Church works this way, by the way, you know, it's like lasted for so long,
*  because they're like, well, we got a central authority. But you know, Jesuits, you go do your
*  weird thing. And we're going to laugh at you for most of it. Oh, now we have a Jesuit pope,
*  because that worked out, right? You have to have space to kind of explore these possibilities to
*  get out of that trap. So what do I why? Why am I talking about all this? Because land value taxes
*  are something you can do in what I call startup cities, right? Like cities are the place where we
*  all live. And countries are increasingly untenable in some ways, like, how do you get that? But if
*  you empower cities, give them more autonomy, allow them to learn from one another, have a more
*  startup ecosystem around that. This is a way out, right? This is the engine of development that Hong
*  Kong represented for China. This is why Singapore is at the top of the pizza tables, you know,
*  it's it's how Guangzhou works. And now there's a bunch of startup cities or charter cities,
*  sometimes, you know, in Africa. But this is a way past current democracy, and eventually maybe
*  programmable politics. But I don't have time to explain that. It's in the book.
*  It's in the book. I think there's a lot in the book. And you know, we've covered a lot of it. But
*  I do want to encourage people to check out the book because it paints a much fuller picture. But
*  maybe we can sort of wind things up by returning to something that we talked about right at the
*  beginning, the the children learning from the adults rather than using their reasoning, right,
*  that we rely on our cultural transmission of knowledge. I want to feed that back into what
*  we were just talking about in terms of inequality and fairness and innovation and things like that.
*  How much of a problem is it that in the modern era, we're able to get that cultural knowledge
*  in a quite fine tuned or at least quite differentiated way even within one culture,
*  right? Like if I, in your bus analogy, if I am constantly told that the buses come very rarely
*  and discriminate against me, even if it's not true, that becomes a problem for how society works.
*  Yeah, you know, like, you know, people talk about this is like the Walter Cronkite problem,
*  you know, like once upon a time, we all got our news. Well, not me. I'm too young.
*  Walter Cronkite, you know, was I was on the evening news. And now like we all read different,
*  we, you know, we read Breitbart and, you know, and Huffington Post and New York Times, we're
*  all getting it from like different places. So I think the internet is interesting in that. So I
*  argue that the internet is actually creating it. We are not in the midst of a fourth industrial
*  revolution or fifth industrial revolution. We are in the midst of a second enlightenment.
*  Okay. One driven not by coffee shops and pamphlets and books, but by tweets and, you know, and shared
*  articles on social media that piss you off. And they piss you off because they expose you to ideas
*  that are not in your in group. Now, alongside that is a countervailing force, which is that we are
*  also able to assort in smaller and smaller groups and those groups can compete with one another.
*  In other words, the internet creates new tribes. Right. So, you know, there's a show here,
*  Little Britain, and there's a there's a character, you know, he's like, he's the I'm the only gay in
*  the village. You know, it's not true. He actually there's lots of other gays in the village. But
*  once upon a time, you might have been like, if you had if you were a small minority in a small
*  village, you were you did not have a critical mass to do anything. Right. But the internet enables
*  you to find so you know, I point to a couple of examples. So are you are you into carrying sand in
*  your pocket? Sean? I am not I've never have done it. Well, you know, like 30,000 people on like our
*  you know, Reddit subreddit on pocket sand talk about all the benefits of carrying sand in their
*  pockets. But that's actually kind of a niche interest, unlike stapling bread to trees. Like,
*  listeners go and Google bread staple to a tree. It is a hobby held by around 300,000 people, right.
*  So yeah, you get these different groups. But it's very hard. It's very hard to generalize whether
*  that is silo, like it's an empirical question, whether we are now in silos or actually exposed
*  to more information. And both are true. I think what is actually the case is it's not about the
*  information. It was never about the information. It was never about misinformation. It was that
*  whom we trust. And what has happened is that our trust in our institutions, and to some degree,
*  as a result of that in each other has decreased. And that is resulting in selective access to that
*  information and greater assortment. And the ultimate issue here, the ultimate level problem
*  needs to be solved. And that is it's an energy problem, actually. Sorry, I you made a leap there
*  that I need to figure out. I mean, I agree that the trust in institutions has waned. It seems to me,
*  in some ways, that's an outcome of the same game theoretic analysis of different groups jockeying
*  for space and things like that. And of course, with the caveat that some institutions are super
*  untrustworthy, so it's correct to not trust them. But so how do you bring it back down to energy?
*  So sorry. So why I say that it's about the information is like, there are always people,
*  always calling for the end of the world or saying that, you know, we live in a racist society or
*  that, you know, we live in a society where you're getting screwed over. There's always people,
*  there's always a bunch of people saying everything, but whom people listen to,
*  depends on on circumstances. Right. And so what I'm arguing is there is a both a perception and a
*  reality. And yes, they can like feedback on each other. And the reality is that out truly our space
*  of the possible has indeed shrunk. The amount of excess energy available to each of us has actually
*  shrunk and you know, around about the 19, you know, the oil prices 1980s 1970s, you know, like,
*  it was around, you know, what the fuck happened in 1971 1973. This was when it all happened. The
*  American dream died around then, because you suddenly had a 5050 probability of being better
*  off than your parents that has truly happened. Right. And so that is fundamentally an issue of
*  excess energy, which ultimately drives GDP growth. So like 50% roughly of GDP growth is energy,
*  or 50% is about, you know, innovations and efficiency. Okay, I do get it now. So it comes
*  back to this shrinking distance between the ceiling and the floor, basically, in our society.
*  Yeah, you know, the amount the amount that we have to all live in together, the scale of cooperation
*  that is that is incentivized. And I will let you close the these sets of thoughts with your
*  optimistic spin on how we're eventually going to work our way out of this.
*  Well, you know, so as I said, you know, part one of the book lays it out all out lays out the science
*  lays out the problem. But then part two is, is exactly about, you know, how do we like the
*  chapter titles are like, how do we reunite humanity? How do we create a new forms of governance for the
*  21st century? How do we shatter that glass ceiling of inequality? How do we trigger a creative
*  explosion that maybe gets us to fusion and becoming the first generation of a galactic
*  civilization? How do we improve the internet? How do we as individuals become brighter? And because
*  like, imagine you are the first generation to have the periodic table, right? We can stop doing
*  alchemy, we start doing some chemistry. And there are actual solutions, given the constraints that
*  we face, real life solutions that are possible for tackling each of these problems. And that means
*  that a brighter future is possible if we so choose. I cannot close on any better sentence than that.
*  So Michael Muthukrishnan, thanks very much for being on the Mindscape podcast.
*  Thank you so much for having me, Sean. I loved it.
