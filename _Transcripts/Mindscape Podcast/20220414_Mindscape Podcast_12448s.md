Welcome to the April 2022 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | April 2022
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 14, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDbdWlnkBSU)
*  Hello, everyone. Welcome to the April 2022 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape Podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll. A couple days late again. Sorry about that. Once again,
*  this time, my excuse was for the past three weeks, I've been in Santa Fe visiting the
*  Santa Fe Institute, as I usually do in my role as what is called a fractal faculty member.
*  I'm supposed to go there several weeks a year. And it's like a part-time position, basically,
*  it's the equivalent of summer salary for those academics out there. I get my little part-time
*  change of pace from my regular job by going to SFI. And of course, it's amazing fun to be at SFI.
*  But I tried not to do any podcasts while I was there. Because well, for one thing,
*  I'm supposed to be there doing SFI type stuff. And for another, I'm not at home in my office,
*  where I can control the audio quality. So I did one podcast interview, turns out that the loft
*  that I was staying in while I was there was quite echoey. So I went into the office to do the podcast
*  interview. I think it did okay. I'm not gonna tell you which one it was upcoming. So if you can't
*  tell, then I win. If you can tell, so be it. Sometimes we deal with what we're stuck with.
*  But like I said, SFI is an amazing place. It's unique, right? It's a research institute in a
*  very beautiful location in Santa Fe, not the easiest to get to. I wish it were easier to get
*  there, but you can get there. And devoted to the sciences of complexity in all of their forms. You
*  know, the original founders were a lot of physicists, Murray Gelman, Phil Anderson,
*  George Cohen, and people who were at Los Alamos. But it's expanded by quite a bit intellectually
*  into economics and anthropology and mathematics and a whole bunch of different things. So I don't
*  know anywhere else in the world, I think this is literally true, anywhere else in the world where
*  you can just randomly walk into an interesting person walking down the hallway, or even sitting
*  in your office, and interesting people will come and knock on your door and start asking you
*  questions, whether it's the foundations of mathematics, or the growth of languages, or how
*  to use physics models in understanding politics or society. It's a great place. And in fact,
*  there were several mindscape guests who were there while I was there. Jeffrey West, of course,
*  early guest was the former president of SFI. Melanie Mitchell, who was a more recent guest,
*  is one of the most recent hires as a permanent member of SFI. Emily Real, a mathematician,
*  was there giving a talk while I was there. And this is the kind of cool people who just pass
*  through. And partly I'm saying this because people have asked, if you haven't heard already,
*  I'm going to become a professor at Johns Hopkins starting July 1. Homewood Professor of Natural
*  Philosophy is my official title. I've already had people on Twitter say in all seriousness,
*  oh, we don't have to listen to him anymore. He's declared himself as a philosopher. So
*  this does not bother me. I didn't want you to listen to me anyway, if that's your attitude
*  toward philosophy. But people were asking, am I still going to keep on with the Santa Fe
*  affiliation? And the answer is yes, very much. It's very part time visiting there a couple times
*  a year, completely compatible with what I'm doing at Johns Hopkins. So also the last time I was at
*  Santa Fe, it was last summer. There was still a pandemic. We had the vaccine, right? But I mean,
*  obviously there's still a pandemic now, but there were still mask mandates. And the suggestion was
*  you should work from home for very good reasons. So technically I was there, but it was not a lot
*  of interacting going on. Whereas this time we had in-person talks, in-person lunches.
*  Lunches at SFI are just some of the most fun events in the world. So that was a lot of fun.
*  That's my excuse for being late. With that, let's go.
*  Kathy Seeger asks, in your blog, you wrote that you'll teach a class about the physics of
*  democracy. Could you tell us what that's about? Yeah, that's going to be one of the first classes
*  I'm teaching at Hopkins in the fall, in September. So some of you know, because I think I mentioned
*  it on the podcast at some point, that I'm writing a book, supposed to be writing a book, on the
*  physics of democracy. I still am. That book is going to appear at some point, but it's been put
*  on the back burner while I do other things, like the Biggest Ideas books. So I thought that it
*  would be a good way to sort of keep my interest and focus on the topic while I'm technically
*  writing other books, by teaching a class. And in particular, this class is one of the new first
*  year seminars at Hopkins. You know, Johns Hopkins is a broad-based research university, has all
*  sorts of departments and everything, but student-wise, it is dominated by students in science,
*  engineering, pre-med, things like that. So as a result, a lot of students have been starting
*  their college careers at Hopkins by taking nothing but large lecture classes. You know,
*  the intro classes in these science and engineering and math fields are often just large, you're
*  listening to the professor, very unlike the ideal dream that you have of sitting around a table with
*  a handful of people discussing the great ideas of the universe. So recognizing this, and recognizing
*  that undergraduates have been kind of complaining a little bit that their introductory experience
*  in the university could be considered a little bit alienating, Hopkins has instituted these first
*  year seminars, which are mandatory. Every student has to take one of these seminars when they first
*  arrive, and the seminars are on basically anything. They're pass-fail, it's supposed to be very
*  low-stress kind of thing, but the idea is that you really dig into a topic with a professor and
*  with your other students, right? I think enrollments cap to 12 or 15 or something like that.
*  So you get to know everybody, you're talking about things, it's a seminar, it's not a lecture,
*  lots of discussion, much more like the ideal college experience than you might get. So the
*  physics of democracy will be a physics course, technically speaking. I mean, one of the funny
*  things was my physics colleagues at Hopkins apparently were not enthusiastic about teaching
*  the first year seminars because they already have their favorite courses they like to teach,
*  with equations and lectures and all that. So I was very happy to say, okay, sure, I can do that
*  for my first physics course at Hopkins. Now, as to what it is, in some sense, it's just about
*  learning about democracy and politics and society by being inspired by physics examples. As I hinted
*  in the intro, there's literally a talk on this topic at SFI while I was there. And I'm not trying
*  to say that it's all physics, right? I'm not trying to say that you're going to reduce the
*  behavior of people in societies to the standard model of particle physics or anything like that.
*  But I do think that the techniques and ways of thinking about things that physicists get
*  can be useful. Ideas about information flow, phase transitions, states of matter, segregation,
*  renormalization, there's a lot of ideas that physicists have that can be productively applied
*  to society in general and democracy in particular. Democracy in particular because democracy is a
*  quintessentially emergent phenomenon. It is not directed from top down. There are a lot of agents
*  called citizens and they vote and they sort of collectivize their decision making in one way or
*  another. That's an interesting question. What is the best way to do that? And then you can ask about
*  the features, the dynamics of that decision making. And it's very related to models in physics
*  where you have little tiny things that interact with each other in ways that lead to interesting
*  emergent behaviors. In fact, when I mentioned this to David Krakauer, the current president of
*  SFI, he said, oh yes, all you need to do is study everything the Santa Fe Institute has ever produced
*  because that's what it is. I mean, when you say complex systems, what are you trying to understand
*  is the simple emergent behavior in those complex systems. You know, the limits of how well we can
*  understand things, what you can say, what you can't and so forth. Ideally, in a way that is universal
*  among different kinds of complex systems, but at the very least you can start by drawing connections
*  between one kind and another. So this is just helping me write a book while also chit chatting
*  with the students, learning about how things are going. The other course I'll be teaching will be
*  an upper level philosophy course on topics in philosophy of physics. We'll all cover things
*  like the arrow of time in quantum mechanics and cosmology from a philosophical point of view. So
*  that should also be a lot of fun. Carlos Nunez says, what is your opinion about how the West
*  has dealt with Russia in recent weeks, particularly with regards to the trade off between stopping a
*  tyrant versus inciting a nuclear war? You know, I want to say pretty well, you know, as I mentioned
*  on Twitter, international cooperation is generally suffers from being slow, right? You know, there's a
*  conservativeness, a bureaucratic inertia that settles in. I think that the invasion of Ukraine
*  has to a remarkable extent united Western democracies against this particular kind of thing.
*  It's almost without exception that NATO and NATO adjacent kind of allies have said, no, this is not
*  good. What can we do to stop it? But as you hint, Carlos, there's only so much you can do to stop it
*  when the other country has nuclear weapons. You know, to be brutally honest, and I hate to say
*  this, if you knew for a fact that the only two choices were letting Russia conquer Ukraine or
*  having a full scale nuclear war between the US and Russia that would leave hundreds of millions
*  of people dead, I think that you would have to say that letting Russia conquer Ukraine is the
*  better option there. I hope that those are not the only two options. And that's the trick, right?
*  That's the art. That is the difficulty or the interestingness of being a diplomat in these cases
*  where you want to try to avoid those two draconian options. So you want to get to a point where Russia
*  has not conquered Ukraine without inciting a nuclear war. Now, partly, that's out of your hands,
*  right? You can try, but partly if one side starts a nuclear war, then a nuclear war has been started,
*  right? And what can you do about that? So what you're really trying to do is just lower the
*  temperature, lower the percentage chance that something terrible like that is going to happen
*  while still trying to achieve your goals. So what they're doing is, you know, diplomatic support,
*  economic sanctions, sending some military equipment, but there's a line that they don't
*  want to cross. If equipment is sent, that's considered okay. That's just considered, you know,
*  how things are done. But if actual troops are sent or even people operating the equipment sent from
*  one country to another, then that other country now counts as a combatant in the war. And NATO
*  countries do not want to be officially combatants in the war. Now, it's weird, you know, just saying
*  it out loud. These are all rules that people made up, you know? And number one, did they make up the
*  right rules? Number two, are we sure people are going to follow the rules, even if they're the
*  right ones? These are very murky questions. So you have to, again, you have to balance
*  kind of expectations from the history of diplomacy and combat and so forth versus the possibility
*  someone's just going to do something completely outside the box. So, you know, I don't agree with
*  absolutely everything they've done, but I think that, you know, so far, so good. We have not given
*  up Ukraine so far as I'm as I'm taping this. In fact, as I'm taping this, the most recent news is
*  that Ukraine has begun to win back some territory, which is kind of amazing. I'm a little bit surprised
*  that they were even able to do that, but they are and no nuclear war yet. So that's good. Fingers
*  crossed on that one. Luke Gendrot says, as a non-physicist, I find myself enamored with the
*  concept of eternal inflation, multiversal cosmologies. Intuitively, in an infinitely
*  expanding series of bubble universes feels like as good a cosmology as any to get behind.
*  I realize feeling like it's a beautiful cosmology is not a sound basis upon which to base a
*  scientific theory, however, and I'd like to know if you could expound on what testable hypotheses
*  are being explored in this area or have been proposed. I also know physicists tend to be
*  wary about infinity, so I'd be curious to know what your thoughts are on the topic in general.
*  Yeah, well, I'm not sure what to say about your statement that feeling like it's a beautiful
*  cosmology is not a sound basis on which to base a scientific theory. It certainly shouldn't be
*  your only basis. Science has to be fundamentally empirical, right? Looking at data, updating your
*  priors as a good Bayesian, right? But on the other hand, you have priors. That's how Bayesian
*  analysis starts. And for me, it's just perfectly obvious we're going to have bigger priors on
*  prettier, more elegant, simple scientific theories than ugly, completely ad hoc ones, right? And why
*  in the world would you not do that? So I think that it's a perfectly legitimate starting point
*  to say, yeah, I'm going to start with this particular idea because I think it's beautiful,
*  but then you have to compare it to the data. You don't stop there. That's the scientific attitude.
*  Now, the idea of eternal inflating universes, etc. has been around for a while. Inflation itself
*  sort of became officially invented. There were precursor ideas, but the official invention was
*  about 1980. And it wasn't that many years after. By the mid-80s, we knew that inflation could lead
*  to an infinite number of universes. It wasn't until the late 90s, so long after, that it actually
*  became a super popular idea for two reasons. Number one, we developed theories of string theory
*  that predicted that not only would you have an infinite number of universes, but the local laws
*  of physics in these universes could be different. Now, again, this is something that people had,
*  I thought about before, okay, they'd hypothesized, but now you had a prediction. Now you had a scheme
*  in which that was supposed to happen. And number two, of course, we discovered the cosmological
*  constant. And there was a pre-existing prediction for the cosmological constant from Steven Weinberg
*  and others that said, if you have a different number of cosmological constants in different
*  parts of the universe, and we're only selected anthropically, that is to say, we live in a world
*  where the cosmological constant lets us live, but there's no dynamical mechanism that is picking
*  its value, then you expect a certain magnitude. And that magnitude is roughly order of magnitude
*  what was actually observed, okay? So both of those give a little boost to the idea. However,
*  let's be very, very honest. Number one, none of these ideas are fully baked. None of them is a
*  rigorously defined theory. There's a set of rules, they're kind of ad hoc, you do your best to
*  calculate things under certain assumptions, but you don't know, right? I mean, these are not,
*  as you imply, well-tested ideas, so it could be completely wrong. And the second thing is,
*  there are problems with it. It's not just, you know, oh, wouldn't that be great? It's that you
*  make predictions that you don't know what to do with. People are not very sure what the predictions
*  are, even for things like the cosmological constant. So what you're asking is, you know,
*  what are the testable hypotheses, etc.? People propose lots of things, but honestly, I wouldn't
*  trust any of them. I think it's very, very important to do the work, but I wouldn't want
*  to be premature about claiming victory on the basis of the work being done, if that makes sense.
*  So, you know, people are making plots about what is the mass of the dark matter or the Higgs boson
*  supposed to be in this kind of collective multiverse, and, you know, good for them. I
*  think it's worth doing, but I wouldn't think that they're finally there. So I'm not going to give
*  you an explicit answer, Luke. I'm just going to say this is something that people are working on.
*  Hopefully, we'll get there at some point. Craig Stevens says, Newton's formulation of gravity
*  relates the strength of the attraction between two objects to the mass of each object and their
*  distance from each other. Einstein's formulation is based on the idea that the mass of an object
*  warps spacetime. It seems to me that under Newton's conception, light would not be affected by gravity
*  because it has no mass, but in reality, it is affected. Is it possible to derive Newton's
*  formula for gravity from Einstein's, but making some simplifying assumptions, or are they completely
*  separate formulas that both happen to work within different realms? So the short answer to this is
*  you can absolutely derive Newtonian gravity from general relativity, from Einsteinian gravity.
*  This is a standard exercise that is done in any general relativity textbook, including mine,
*  taking the Newtonian limit. So you consider a bunch of particles. Well, I guess the important
*  non-trivial technical fact is this. There are two limits. The limits come in a sequence. There's
*  one limit, which is called the weak field limit. And in the weak field limit, you just say all the
*  gravitational pull is relatively weak. In general relativity terms, what you're saying is that
*  spacetime is curved, but only a little bit. It's pretty much flat. So that's a limiting case of
*  general relativity, and it includes the solar system. All the gravitational fields in the solar
*  system are weak. What do you mean by weak in this case? There's a numerical criterion. You can think
*  of it as how close are you to making a black hole? Nothing in the solar system, even if you think that
*  Jupiter or the sun or whatever has a lot of gravity, they are nowhere close to being a black hole. So as
*  far as GR is concerned, general relativity, they are weak field gravity. But it also allows for
*  things like gravitational waves or the deflection of light, which are not understood in Newtonian
*  regime at all. So there's an additional limit that you take called the Newtonian limit, which
*  says that both the gravitational field is weak and all of the particles, all the objects in your
*  theory are moving much slower than the speed of light. So this is part of just being
*  Newtonian rather than being relativistic. In Newtonian mechanics, you don't have any limit
*  on the speed at which things can move, but in relativity, you do the speed of light. And so the
*  two theories overlap when all the velocities are very, very low compared to the speed of light,
*  and they begin to diverge when the velocities become close to the speed of light. So therefore,
*  if you have a relativistic theory like GR, and you say, but I'm only going to consider situations
*  where the particles are moving slowly compared to the speed of light, you can recover the Newtonian
*  predictions. Now, if you notice, we did not quite in that series of things I just said,
*  weak field limit and Newtonian limit, we didn't quite get to a point where you could compare or
*  think about deflection of light in the Newtonian limit. Because the Newtonian limit is particles
*  are moving slower in the speed of light and light moves out at the speed of light.
*  So that's part of the explanation for why if you're just purely Newtonian, and you ask about the
*  deflection of light, it's kind of an unanswerable question. Because this idea that there's something
*  called light, the particles of which have zero mass, and they always move at the speed of light,
*  all these notions are just alien to Newtonian physics. So if you want, I mean, light existed
*  before relativity did, or Maxwell's equations or whatever, but they didn't know what it was,
*  they didn't know whether it was a wave or a particle, what kind of mass the particle would
*  have, how fast it was moving, anything like that. So nevertheless, I think that the spirit of it is,
*  if you have the particles that are generating the gravitational field, like the sun and the earth,
*  if you have those be in the Newtonian limit, you can ask how is light deflected in a space-time
*  geometry that is within that regime. And that's where you get the general relativity formula for
*  the deflection of light. I do want to make the one philosophy of science point here. So if Thomas
*  Kuhn were in the audience, the guy who wrote the structure of scientific revolutions and
*  compared different paradigms in which people work, he would have emphasized that it's not
*  just that you start with general relativity, take some limits and get back Newtonian mechanics,
*  or Newtonian gravity, because your starting point is ontologically completely different.
*  Meaning that the actual stuff that you're describing is a completely different kind of
*  stuff in the two theories. In general relativity, you have space-time, it has a metric, a curvature,
*  and the curvature responds to energy and momentum. In Newtonian mechanics, you have space and time
*  separately, and there's a field, the gravitational field on top of that that pushes things around.
*  So it's a different language that you're speaking. And so one of the things that Kuhn was skeptical
*  about, but I think that you shouldn't be so skeptical about, I think that we can do better
*  than Kuhn did, is learning how to compare the understandings that you get within different
*  paradigms, within scientific pictures. And in fact, I would say that general relativity,
*  Newtonian gravity is a perfect example of two very different ontologies, two very different
*  sets of words about what the world is, that it's very straightforward to compare their
*  empirical predictions. And the missing piece there is that in addition to general relativity
*  as a scientific formalism and Newtonian gravity as a scientific formalism, we have our human-based
*  manifest image of the world. We say, oh, I see dots on my screen of my CCD camera, or I see
*  things in the sky, et cetera. And we're not comparing these two theories directly to each
*  other, we're comparing both of them to our observations. And so I think even though Kuhn
*  would have said they're in some sense incommensurable, it's not the perfect example
*  of incommensurability, but it's in the same spirit. I think they're perfectly commensurable,
*  and I think that all scientific theories more or less are, because you're not comparing one
*  theory to another, you're comparing both of them to how we experience the world.
*  Keith says, congratulations on the Homewood Professorship at Johns Hopkins. It seems like
*  a great and exciting fit, best to you and Jennifer. Thank you, Keith. On to the important stuff. A
*  huge congrats to the great seasons of both the 76ers and the Villanova Wildcats. What a great
*  overall season for team Sean Carroll. Ariel and Caliban better get max contracts. Would a Villanova
*  championship be on par with the 76ers one for you personally or in general if you feel like sharing
*  thoughts on differences and your preferences of NBA versus college? So here's why I regret being
*  late, because as I'm taping this, Villanova just lost its game in the Final Four. So for those of
*  you who don't know, number one, I was an undergraduate at Villanova University. They won the National
*  College Basketball Championship my freshman year. They've won twice since then. And right now,
*  as we speak, it's the Final Four in college basketball, March Madness. And even though they
*  weren't quite expected to, Villanova succeeded in making it up to the Final Four. Then they lost one
*  of their best players in an injury. So he wasn't able to play in the Final Four game and they got
*  more or less run off the floor by the Kansas Jayhawks, who were a very high powered team. And so
*  as I'm taping this, what we know is that the actual championship game is going to be between
*  the University of North Carolina and the University of Kansas. Two big public schools, so good for them,
*  good for public education in the United States. The question that I'm not going to spend too much
*  time on, but the interesting question is professional NBA level basketball versus college,
*  purportedly amateur basketball. I'm an NBA guy. I'm more of a professional basketball guy for a bunch
*  of reasons. Number one, it was my first love. My first true fandom in sports was when Julius
*  Irving joined the Philadelphia 76ers in the mid 1970s. And those sixers teams in Dr. J's day were
*  endlessly entertaining. And of course, they won us a championship in 1983. So my heart was stolen
*  there. I have mixed feelings about college sports in general. I ruled root for Villanova when they're
*  playing and it's a lot of fun to watch them. There's a lot more people who get to play high
*  level college basketball than professional basketball. So it's an important thing in their
*  lives. And I appreciate that. But yeah, college sports is just messed up for all sorts of reasons,
*  most obviously of which the schools and the coaches and the National Collegiate Athletic
*  Association make huge amounts of money off of these people and the students make nothing.
*  They get the team players, the athletes, they get free tuition at the university,
*  but that is dwarfed by the actual amount of money that the universities are making. So it's a bit of
*  a scam, actually. And it's a scam that the professional leagues play along with because
*  in both basketball and football in particular, college basically acts as a minor league.
*  The professional leagues and there are even rules about how you have to go to college before
*  you can go to the professional leagues. And that kind of makes no sense to me. I think that that's
*  just a scheme to get people rich other than the actual athletes doing the work. So I have slightly
*  mixed feelings about that. Whereas on professional basketball, everyone gets paid handsomely.
*  And you can argue the details, but also with the current standing, the current way that the college
*  ranks go, the very best players in college basketball only play for a year before they go
*  to the NBA because that's what the rules let them do. So you don't get to see them progress over time
*  in a way that you would with the professional teams. So there you go. On the other hand,
*  with the problem with the professional teams is that players can get traded, right? Players do
*  get traded all the time. So in some sense, you're trying to root for this continuous ship of theses
*  in the form of the team that is constantly changing its ingredients, but somehow it works.
*  Somehow, you know, your emotions get attached that way perfectly effectively.
*  Simon Carter says, I've just finished reading the excellent book, How to Make an Apple Pie from
*  Scratch by Harry Cliff. Harry mentions Svalerons as a potential solution to the matter-antimatter
*  asymmetry. What credence do you give to this being correct? And if not Svalerons, what do you think
*  most likely caused the universe to be dominated by matter and not antimatter? So for those of you who
*  are not familiar with the idea of Svalerons, you know, not many people are. In fact, most people who
*  get PhDs are probably never exposed to the PhDs in physics, are probably never exposed to the
*  idea of the Svaleron. It's something that happens late in your education in quantum field theory and
*  the standard model of particle physics. If that is your specialty, and it's not most people's
*  specialty, but it's not that hard to understand the implications of it, even if the details are
*  kind of mathematical. A Svaleron sounds like a particle, right? Like a proton, neutron Svaleron,
*  but it's not. It's a process, really. It's a dynamical thing that can happen in the electroweak
*  part of the standard model of particle physics. The part of the standard model that unifies the
*  weak interactions with the electromagnetic interactions via the Higgs boson, right? That
*  famous thing that I wrote a book about. And the Svaleron is one of these very fun, intellectually
*  fun exercises where you can change the topology of the fields dynamically in some quantum
*  fluctuation. And in the process of doing that, you change the number of particles. And when you
*  change the number of particles, you don't have to change it equally in the particle versus
*  antiparticle sectors, okay? You can change the total number of what we call baryons, strongly
*  interacting particles like the proton and the neutron are baryons. So you can change baryons
*  into antibaryons, leptons into antileptons, etc. That's important and interesting because,
*  as you probably know, there's an imbalance in the observed world between the number of matter
*  particles and the number of antimatter particles. And there's an ongoing mystery in cosmology. Why
*  is that? You maybe imagine that it was just baked into the initial conditions of the universe,
*  but for various reasons, physicists prefer to imagine that it was dynamically generated,
*  that the universe started with an equal number, maybe zero, who knows, of particles and
*  antiparticles. And there was an imbalance created in matter versus antimatter along the way.
*  So if sphalerons can do this, maybe they are responsible. Now, we've never seen a sphaleron,
*  okay? These transitions are supposed to be very rare. We've never seen one in the lab,
*  but they're theoretically on quite a sound basis. They're also not enough to get you a real physical
*  imbalance between particles and antiparticles because sphalerons as a class of possible things,
*  they don't care whether it's positive mass part or not positive mass, whether it's positive baryon
*  number particles or negative baryon number particles, okay? They don't really care whether
*  they're making protons or antiprotons. So you need to somehow tilt the balance there. And it
*  was Andrei Sakharov, famous Russian physicist, who really laid down the rules for when this could
*  happen. You need to departure from thermal equilibrium, you need to violate the difference
*  between baryon and anti baryon number, but you also separately need to violate charge parity
*  symmetry, okay? All of these symmetries are very easily violated in the standard model particle
*  physics, but the rates are just so tiny that they don't explain what we actually see. So that's why
*  there's a whole field, baryogenesis, trying to understand why there's more baryons than
*  anti baryons. So the question is, do sphalerons play a role in that? And the answer is maybe.
*  There are many, many different versions of baryogenesis on the market. Some of them make
*  uses of sphalerons and some don't, okay? I haven't actually followed the very most recent
*  research in this area. It's not exactly my area. The last time I did pay attention to it, the most
*  plausible sounding mechanism to me was some kind of something that involves neutrinos at super high
*  energies, you know, super high energies, you can make these neutrinos that themselves in their
*  decays, they can be very massive neutrinos and they can decay preferentially into either baryons
*  or anti baryons. So this is called leptogenesis. Neutrinos are leptons, not baryons, but then you
*  can convert the leptons into baryons in some way. So there are many elaborate schemes to do this.
*  I'm certainly not an expert, so don't ask me, but it's an interesting question because the fact
*  that there are more baryons than anti baryons is very empirically true, right? Like we didn't make
*  that up, so it's a very down-to-earth fact. The theories that we have to explain it seem to be
*  just a bit outside what we're able to test in the lab, so it's hard to know how to make progress in
*  the short term. But again, just like with the anthropic principle or something like that,
*  you got to keep trying, got to keep pushing on that and try to make better predictions and hopefully
*  we will figure it out at some point. Tyler Ogarek says, what was the inspiration behind the names
*  Ariel and Caliban? Ariel and Caliban are two characters in Shakespeare's play The Tempest,
*  which is a favorite of both Jennifer and myself. And also when we got them, so we got them,
*  these are our two kittens, by the way, two cats by now, they're five years old. For those of you
*  who are just tuning in for the first time, I have two cats, Ariel and Caliban. We got them from a
*  shelter, Santador Rescue here in Los Angeles. I encourage you to support or get your cats from if
*  you're interested. And when the kittens are in the shelter, they are just given names, they're
*  like mass produced names, right? So they have algorithms. So we were going through a Star Wars
*  phase in the naming of kittens at Santador at the time. And so let me see if I can get them right.
*  I think they were Gin and Cassian, right? I think that those are from Rogue One, but I'm not sure.
*  I'm revealing my lack of complete Star Wars knowledge right now. So we had to figure out
*  if we're going to keep them what the names would be, we're allowed to change the names, etc. And
*  honestly, to both of us, they both kind of reminded us of the actual characters, Ariel and Caliban.
*  In the play, Ariel is kind of angelic almost. They're both quasi supernatural spirits of some
*  sort. And Ariel is very light. They're both boys in the play, but our Ariel is a girl.
*  But anyway, Ariel is very pristine and pretty and perfect and glowing. And our little kitten,
*  Ariel, is perfectly formed, very sharp features, very elegant and a little bit high strung.
*  Whereas Caliban in the play is more rough and nature-like and beastly. And as much as we love
*  him, our little boy Caliban, when he was young, he's handsome, but he's not classically handsome.
*  He's a little bit asymmetrical. His teeth, his fangs are a little bit too long. His fur is a
*  little bit too long. He looks a little goofy, honestly. So he kind of looked like a Caliban.
*  That was basically the answer. And their personalities worked out to be fitting to
*  those two names. So it all came out pretty well. Robert Rux in Rescue says, I have a question about
*  space-time versus quantum fields. Can you have quantum fields without space-time? Can you have
*  any kind of space-time without any quantum field in it at all? So it depends on what you mean by
*  can. In other words, in the real world, we have space-time and quantum fields in it, at least at
*  the level of description where space-time exists and stuff like that. Let's assume that that's the
*  level of description at which we are working. All space-time has quantum fields in it because the
*  ingredients of the universe are points in space-time and a set of fields defined at each one of those
*  points. The same set of fields, right? So within our observable universe anyway, it's the same
*  collection of possible quantum fields, the electron field, the photon field, etc.
*  at every point, having a value at every point. So can you have quantum fields without space-time?
*  No, because the definition of a field is something that is a function of space-time. That's what it
*  is, okay? Rather than something that is just a function of a point or something like that.
*  Can you have space-time without any quantum field in it at all? Not in our universe, not in our
*  observable universe that we know and love. You can imagine space-time without quantum fields in it,
*  but even that is hard. You have to stretch the definition a little bit because always on space-
*  time you have a metric, right? You have the thing that determines the geometry of space-time,
*  what Einstein allows to be curved. Even if you didn't allow it to be curved, there would still
*  be a metric, but you could sort of imagine a world that was Newtonian in spirit or even, let's say,
*  special relativistic in spirit, okay? So there's a fixed space-time, so you have a metric, but it's
*  not fluctuating and therefore there's not really a quantum version of it. It's just a fixed fact
*  about the universe. And then you could just think about, you know, particle mechanics in that universe.
*  That's what Newton thought about, right? Or even that's what Niels Bohr would have thought about
*  before quantum field theory came along, quantum particle mechanics. So you can imagine hypothetical
*  worlds in which space-time exists but quantum fields don't, but that's not our world in which
*  we actually live. Nick C says,
*  But I always get stuck at this first point. I've never been able to see how that claim can be
*  rigorously made. I don't understand how we would know what the range of possible values for each
*  of these constants is or what probability distribution to assign them. It seems like
*  thoughtful people give this idea credence, so what am I missing? Yeah, I'm a little bit sympathetic
*  to your worries, Nick, but I think that there's a judicious middle position here. You're absolutely
*  right that people do make the claim that if you think of all the constants of the physical
*  universe, you know, the masses of the particles, the fine structure constant, the gravitational
*  constant, what have you, the claim that is made is that if I generically chose points in the space
*  of all possible values for those constants, most of those points would not lead to universes that
*  allowed for the existence of life. Clearly, that claim only makes sense if you know what you mean
*  when you say if you generically choose some set of values. Rigorously speaking, what that means is
*  you need to measure on the space of all these constants. And generally, people have a measure
*  in the back of their mind, namely, it's a uniform measure. It's uniformly likely, let's say that,
*  you know, the fine structure constant, which empirically is about 101 over 137, you could say,
*  well, maybe it's a random number chosen between zero and one. And someone else can say, well,
*  why zero and one? I know minus one and a billion or plus a billion and plus two billion. Like,
*  why did you choose that? And the answer is nobody has any principled reason for choosing that.
*  So there really isn't any very rigorous statement that you can make along these lines.
*  Okay, but on the other hand, there seems to be something real going on here. You know,
*  in the case of the cosmological constant, the vacuum energy, we don't know for sure what is the
*  right measure to use, or even if it's sensible to say that there is a measure. I mean, after all,
*  if there's only one universe, which maybe there is, and it just has a value of the vacuum energy,
*  or the fine structure constant or whatever, what does it mean to say that it's chosen randomly from
*  some distribution? It's not, it's just a value. It's just one thing. Okay. But okay, let's put
*  that aside for the moment. Given physics, as we currently understand it, there isn't a measure on
*  the space of possible values of the vacuum energy. And there's also no reason why it shouldn't be at
*  the Planck scale, or minus the Planck scale. So it should be, it could be any number as far as we
*  currently know between the Planck scale and minus the Planck scale. And the point of the fine tuning
*  argument is that in order for life to exist, it had to turn out that the values of the cosmological
*  constant were less than something like 10 to the minus 120 times the Planck scale, okay,
*  in magnitude. So between minus 10 to the minus 120 and plus 10 to the minus 120.
*  And the idea is, which I think it makes sense to me, the idea is that in the absence of any particular
*  rigorously defined measure on the space of possibilities, that still seems like a really
*  narrow window. And in fact, people like Steven Weinberg have tried to make this rigorous by
*  saying, look, in the space of all smooth functions that you could imagine on the values of the
*  cosmological constant, exactly because you're zooming in on such a tiny region, that that smooth
*  function will probably look flat, probably look uniform, because most functions look flat in very,
*  very tiny regions of space, right? Now, that's a bad argument by itself, because the particular
*  regime we're looking at for the cosmological constant includes the value zero, which might
*  be special. There might be that there is a measure on the value of cosmological constants that is
*  singular, that is infinitely big at zero or something like that. But we just don't know.
*  So I think that you're right to think that, again, it's not finished. I should, I could have grouped
*  this with the earlier question. I think that there is something there, some intuition that is being
*  pumped by this idea that the constants of nature seem finely tuned, but it is not a rigorous
*  argument. So the question is, what do you do about that? What do you do when you don't have a rigorous
*  argument, but you have some intuition? So one attitude to take is, yeah, I don't trust that
*  argument at all, right? Unless it's rigorous, I'm not going to believe it. That's okay. You're
*  allowed to have that attitude, but the problem is you're not going to get very far in real world
*  physics, because you'll soon discover that many, many things that we are very successful at using
*  are not on a rigorous foundation. So that's kind of a problem. The other, you know, extremist
*  attitude is to say, you know, it's good enough. I think the argument works. Therefore, the anthropic
*  principle must be the answer to something like this. And I don't think that's right either. I
*  think that you should sort of keep in mind that these arguments seem to make sense, but they are
*  not rigorous. Therefore, we should try to do better at them. I think it is wrong either to
*  dismiss them entirely, or to take them too credulously. That's my personal attitude.
*  Okay, I'm going to group two questions together about aliens. Stuart Haynes says,
*  In the intro to your recent podcast with Eric Kirchenbaum, you stated that you thought it's
*  unlikely that in our galaxy, there are other very advanced technological civilizations. If there were,
*  it would be very easy to have noticed them already. And we haven't. What means do we now
*  have to detect civilizations on exoplanets that are not producing results? Is it chemical signatures
*  and atmospheres or some other means? I think you may have said that the most likely means for a
*  distinct distant civilization to make contact would be through von Neumann machines, perhaps
*  parking them at Lagrange points around foreign planets. And Brad Malt says, In your aliens podcast
*  this month, you muse about why we haven't noticed any extraterrestrial technologically advanced
*  civilizations. Could your looming disasters podcast provide part of the answer? You know,
*  the big question here is the Fermi paradox, right? Why haven't we detected technologically
*  advanced aliens yet? And I think one of the reasons why this paradox is so hard or so puzzling is
*  because it's easy to come up with reasons, such as in the looming disasters podcast, why any
*  individual technological civilization might destroy itself. It's not that hard to imagine
*  that possibility. But if you really thought that technological civilizations were thick on the
*  ground, as it were, then you only need one of the ones in the past in our past light cone
*  to escape killing themselves. And that civilization could fill the galaxy. The important number here
*  is that the universe is 14 billion years old. Let's give it a couple billion years to make stars and
*  things like that. But you know, you can imagine that stars in our galaxy are certainly billions
*  of years old. Okay, I mean, our sun is over over 4 billion years old. So maybe 10 billion years worth
*  of star formation and and intelligence civilization building. But the speed of light crosses the
*  galaxy in 100,000 years. That's nothing you can cross the galaxy back and forth a lot. And if even
*  if you say, you know, well, I don't think they could go the speed of light. All right, let them
*  go at 1% of the speed of light, then you can cross back and forth the galaxy in 10 million years.
*  One way or another, it's a lot less than 10 billion years that it took that we've been making
*  stars. So we have a really rich past of possible extraterrestrial civilizations coming into existence
*  in our past light cone. And you have to believe that none of them have or it is true. Let's say that
*  none of them have contacted us. Okay, that is I know that other people disagree about that. But
*  that's my attitude towards other civilizations contacting us so far. If the contact we're going
*  on via radio signals or whatever, then it's very easy to understand why they would not contact us
*  yet. Because you can easily if you're an advanced civilization, you can easily send out radio signals
*  that we could detect. But why in the world would you keep doing that for 10 billion years? That
*  seems like a waste of resources, right? Whereas if you just build a spacecraft and send those
*  spacecraft to other parts of the galaxy and sit and wait for the emergence of life, then you can
*  do it very easily, right? Again, just move it 1% the speed of light in 10 million years, you have
*  filled the whole galaxy. And the reference that Stuart is making to von Neumann machines is that
*  John von Neumann figured out a way to make a machine that can build replications of
*  the complicated replicate itself. Okay, so send out one. It's kind of like a nasty virus, you send
*  out one little von Neumann machine, it goes to another solar system, gets raw materials, creates
*  10 copies of itself, they all go to other star systems, etc. And they park and they wait. Now,
*  maybe you think, well, okay, I don't think that a civilization would want to do that. Again, the
*  problem is you have to think that no civilization would have ever wanted to do that. And it's
*  absolutely possible that no civilization would have wanted to do that. But at this point,
*  to me, it just becomes easier to imagine there aren't any such civilizations. Okay, certainly
*  that seems more plausible to me than they're there, but they're not talking to us, they're
*  waiting for us to grow up. Again, all you need is one dissenter from that consensus,
*  or something like that. And again, this is not something I have very high credence in,
*  I'd be very happy to be wrong, we should still keep looking, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  But to me, the simplest explanation for why none of this has happened is that there are no
*  technologically advanced civilizations out there. Probably because the various stumbling blocks or
*  bottlenecks, I should say, in the development of complex life are hard to overcome. Here on Earth,
*  it was easy to make life, it was hard to make eukaryotic life, it was hard to make multicellular
*  life, etc. So I think it's just very plausible there's life out there in the universe and none
*  of it nearby has any advanced technology. I guess we'll see. Kyle Stevens says, what makes for a
*  good interviewee? Without needing to name names, has anyone stuck out as a particularly good or
*  bad at handling an interview? And if so, why? Well, yeah, there's certainly things about
*  interviewee that make them good or bad. It's a skill, okay? It's not really surprising.
*  And this comes up with me personally, because I want to, as I've said, get a lot of different
*  kinds of people on the podcast. And one dimension that is relevant is seniority, right? There's some
*  people you have on the podcast. This is not their first rodeo. They've been on podcasts,
*  they've been giving public talks, they are senior people, not only the skill of speaking and being
*  interesting and so forth, but also the skill of having an understanding of what part of your
*  subject matter is really interesting and being able to share it quickly, okay? Having not necessarily
*  sound bites, but at least an ability to dive to the important part of what you're talking about
*  and get rid of the less interesting parts. Maybe you can make it charming with some stories and
*  stuff like that. That would be the ideal kind of podcast guest. And I remember very explicitly
*  when I was sometime during my postdoctoral years and I began to occasionally get called by
*  journalists writing stories about cosmology or particle physics or whatever. And part of your
*  first response is, yes, but I didn't write that paper, so I shouldn't talk about it. You're asking
*  me to talk about somebody else's paper. But it is part of the job as an academic, as a professor,
*  et cetera, to be a spokesperson for your field, right? To be able to talk about it. So you have
*  your specific research agenda and the research you do, but you also, it's not an absolute necessity,
*  but it's good and nice and virtuous. If you have enough knowledge about the broader aspects of the
*  field, that you can intelligently talk about it and put things into context. Communicating with
*  the broader public is part of the portfolio of the field anyway, if not of each individual person.
*  So a lot of the young people, so I like to get young people and older people. I like to get people
*  you've never heard of and people you certainly have heard of. And the young people have not
*  had enough time to develop these skills. So some of them are just natural geniuses at it. That's
*  great. Others will be really good at it 20 years from now, but haven't figured that out yet.
*  So that's one dimension on which I'm still going to do it. I'm still going to invite young people
*  on if I think they have really interesting ideas, because that's how they're going to learn, right?
*  By being on these podcasts and you will learn about things that you might otherwise not hear
*  about from the older people. There's a perspective that youth and energy and vigor bring that is not
*  going to be there in the older people. So I think that's still very, very important.
*  You know, otherwise, you know, yeah, there's a wide range of ways to be good at being a podcast
*  guest. Some are basically giving their talk, except it's on a podcast. Others are very happy
*  to ramble off on tangents, whatever those tangents may be. You know, the perfect podcast guest is one
*  who answers the questions, but also understands that they are the expert, not me, right? So they
*  know better than I do what they should be talking about. So I will ask a question and they will be
*  able to say, you know, here's the answer to your question. And also maybe the question you should
*  have asked was this other one. Okay, I'd like that. That's what I'm looking for in a good podcast
*  guest. There's also, you know, kind of trivial questions like some people just want to give one
*  sentence answers all the time. Other people are not happy unless they're talking for half an hour
*  uninterrupted. And there is some happy medium there as well in terms of podcast guests.
*  You know, often I know about people's stuff from reading, right, what they've written, their papers,
*  their books or whatever. And I just don't know that much about their speaking style. So there's
*  always going to be some hit or miss. And you know, I don't I don't mind that. I would like more hits
*  than misses. But the excitement, the unpredictability, that's all part of the fun. Jesse Rimler says,
*  Do you have a recommendation for someone who is interested in getting into math for fun as an adult?
*  I'm looking into the Khan Academy and other resources, but I'm not quite sure what course
*  of studies appropriate Do you think someone who did not do well in school and has barely used math
*  in decades should restart at pre algebra say, rather than dive into a more interesting and
*  advanced subject. So I actually am not good at giving recommendations, you know, specific
*  operational recommendations about Khan Academy or some other resources. I have a vague feeling there
*  are a lot of resources out there. There is Khan Academy. There's Wondrium podcast advertiser got
*  to you know, put in a good word for them. They have a lot of good courses and lectures on things like
*  that. And there's also just other kind of MOOCs, right massively online courses that you can check
*  out. So but you can Google that as well as I can. I do not know much about the details. The question
*  is more specific about should you start a pre algebra rather than dive into more interesting
*  advanced subjects, you know, it depends if what you want is kind of a fun, interesting, diversionary
*  tickle your brain kind of introduction to some cool ideas in math, then you know, pick up a good
*  popular book about math, you know, we've had people like Jordan Ellenberg, Steven Strogatz on
*  the podcast who have written very good popular level books on math. Tyjanae Bradley has website
*  that is also a very good introduction. But if you want to really understand the deeper aspects,
*  then you got to start at the beginning. Maths is extremely cumulative subject. I'm a big believer
*  that it is possible to understand higher levels of math, whether it's you know, calculus or the
*  kind of stuff we talked about with Emily real category theory, very, very abstract stuff,
*  you can understand that. But you do need the background and pre algebra is a good place as
*  any to start the basics of functions, pushing around functions, maybe a bit of geometry,
*  certainly calculus, okay, and then you can go from there. And it's fun, I think it's very worth doing
*  the resources are out there. So I'd encourage you to at least give it a try. See how far you get.
*  And Tom Toppin says integrated information theory, IIT, which was initially proposed by
*  Giulio Tononi in 2004, claims that consciousness is identical to a certain kind of information,
*  the realization of which requires physical not merely functional integration, and which can be
*  measured mathematically according to the phi metric. Does this theory seem appealing to you?
*  You know, it's appealing to me, but I don't quite agree with it. And I say that with enormous
*  caution, because I'm not an expert. I've said this, I've opined about IIT integrated information
*  theory before, knowing that I'm not an expert. So you shouldn't listen to my opining about it.
*  But my vague impression is that maybe the phi metric on some complex system that is supposed
*  to be either conscious or not, gives you a necessary condition for being conscious,
*  I'm much less persuaded it gives you a sufficient condition for being conscious. In other words,
*  it just seems too easy to me to imagine systems with high amounts of phi, and yet we would not
*  recognize them as conscious. And, you know, maybe look, in some sense, that's okay, like we did,
*  you know, when we talked with Stuart Bartlett about life, and he makes the he made a very good
*  point that what we call life here on Earth has a number of distinct characteristics that can in
*  principle be separated out, right? Some systems will reproduce, others will have metabolisms of
*  a certain kind, you know, there's different things that you might all associate with life,
*  and you can take or leave individual parts of them. I think that consciousness is probably
*  similar, I bet that there's probably a number of things that one could try to make rigorous
*  and explicit about what is involved in what we think of as consciousness, and maybe phi is
*  getting one of them. But maybe not the whole thing. But you know, I really should learn more
*  about it. Honestly, it's one of the things on my list of things to learn more about so that I
*  shouldn't say anything more than that. Scott says, my kids have started asking me interesting
*  physics questions. Recently, one asked how potential energy is converted to kinetic energy
*  in the context of classical electrodynamics, charged particle and electric field. I said that
*  energy is not a substance, but a really useful accounting trick that lets you keep track of the
*  position and motion of the particle in the field without having to do numerical integration.
*  In particle physics, the energy seems to be the most important thing about any system,
*  and it's right there as H in Schrodinger's equation. So what is the right way to think
*  about energy? Useful accounting trick, fundamentally important, or both?
*  I'm on the useful accounting trick side largely, I would say here. In fact, what you said about
*  energy is not a substance, but a parameter, a way of thinking, a feature, a property of the physical
*  system you're looking at, that's something I've said myself before. And I don't think that changes
*  any from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. The usefulness of the concept, you kind of are
*  choosing a rhetorical strategy when you call it a useful accounting trick. It's a very useful
*  accounting trick. It is a way of thinking about the world that is very, very powerful, right?
*  I mean, the existence of the desk in front of me is a useful accounting trick to talk about a whole
*  collection of atoms and particles and things like that, right? But it's a very useful accounting
*  trick, so much so that I tend to think of my desk as a real thing that is sitting in front of me.
*  So in quantum mechanics, I mean, let's put it this way. In classical mechanics, if you were Isaac
*  Newton, when you wrote down Newton's equations for physics, you never mentioned the word energy.
*  The idea of kinetic energy was not one that was in Newton's toolbox. He talked a language of forces
*  and accelerations, right? You have a position, a velocity, acceleration, a force. Those were the
*  fundamental ingredients for Newton. It wasn't until later, Madame du Châtelet, etc., that we
*  figured out the distinction between momentum and energy, and we got the equations for them down
*  and then Hamilton figured out a way to do classical mechanics based on the energy. So the whole idea
*  of Hamiltonian mechanics is just a rewrite of Newtonian mechanics. It's not a new physical
*  theory, but it's a new language in which to talk about Newtonian mechanics, where the energy of
*  the system is the primary thing. So Hamiltonian mechanics starts with an equation for energy as
*  a function of position and momentum, and from that one equation, it gives you a recipe for
*  deriving all of the equations of motion in Newtonian mechanics. We call that Hamiltonian mechanics,
*  even though it's physically equivalent to Newtonian mechanics. By the way,
*  I have a book coming out that will explain all of this. This is all talked about, including
*  Hamiltonian mechanics and Lagrangian mechanics in the Biggest Ideas in the Universe, coming out in
*  September. But in quantum mechanics, the point is that we have the Schrödinger equation, yes,
*  and the Schrödinger equation certainly features the Hamiltonian, which is that thing invented by
*  Hamilton, the way to express the energy of the system in terms of its velocities and its momentum.
*  Schrödinger turns that into an operator on wave functions, but it's the same basic idea. So I would
*  say that energy doesn't play any more important role in quantum mechanics than it did in classical
*  mechanics. It's just that you're using a useful accounting trick to write to the theory in a way
*  that uses energy in a very straightforward, important, central way. So I would say that
*  something can be a useful accounting trick and fundamentally important at the same time, and
*  energy certainly qualifies as well as anything that I can think of. Okay, Sendip Chitalay is asking
*  a priority question. And so I edited this question a little bit because it was a priority question,
*  but it was long. I meant to say this in the intro, but let me say it now. Because now that we're in
*  the regime where I don't get to answer every question, people want to know why do I answer
*  some questions rather than others? There's lots of things that go into it. And as I've said,
*  do I personally have something interesting to say? Likewise, do I think that what I have to say will
*  be interesting to the rest of the world? That's also interesting. But a third criterion is I would
*  like the questions to be short. I am not in favor of long questions because it just takes time from,
*  they're both hard to understand audio visually. I mean, there's no visual, right? So you're just
*  listening to my voice and reading a question is one thing, but listening to someone say a question
*  out loud is a different thing. So keeping the questions short makes it more comprehensible
*  to the audience. And it also, you know, is a little bit respectful of the time that is taking away
*  from other people's questions. Anyway, I don't mean to pick on you, Sandeep. I know you're a long
*  time listener and I appreciate it. But I did edit your question down. That's all I'm saying here.
*  And if other people did not get their questions answered at all, ask how many paragraphs were in
*  your question. And if the answer is more than one, you might have stumbled across the reason.
*  So the question is, it is said that microphysics is time reversible. To me, what should actually
*  be said is that microphysics is velocity reversible. To me, reverse time is nonsensical.
*  What does that even mean? The direction of time is implicitly defined by the preceding events
*  followed by succeeding events. If we agree that time can only flow in one direction from preceding
*  to succeeding, then by definition, it does not need anything else to explain its direction. Then
*  why do we need a low entropy state of the Big Bang, the past hypothesis? So there's a couple
*  things going on here. One is the whole point of the arrow of time problem is that the setup that
*  you proposed, where the direction of time is implicitly defined by preceding events going to
*  succeeding events, is just not there in fundamental physics. In the equations of motion, whether
*  they're Hamilton's equations, which we just talked about, or Newton's equations, or the
*  Schrodinger equation, or whatever, time is just a label and there is no directionality to it.
*  So by just a label, what I mean is, mathematically, I can invent a new time coordinate. And I can
*  invent it by saying, let's let t prime equal minus t. Now the equations of either Hamiltonian
*  mechanics or Newtonian mechanics or whatever, in some sense, work equally well when you do that,
*  letting t go to minus t. You can run the movie forward or backwards, the level of fundamental
*  physics. The subtlety there, there's a footnote, which is what you're putting your finger on when
*  you say velocity reversible rather than time reversible. Because technically, let's think
*  about it in terms of Hamiltonian mechanics. Because the interesting thing about Hamiltonian
*  mechanics is that you don't define momentum as mass times velocity. You derive that momentum is
*  mass times velocity, but momentum starts life as something completely independent. There's an
*  equation of motion that says momentum is mass time velocity, but you don't assume it from the start.
*  And there, indeed, for a typical standard kind of dynamics for physical systems expressed in the
*  rules of Hamiltonian mechanics, to have this property that you can reverse the direction of
*  time as a matter of parameter choice, you also need to reverse the direction of momentum. That's
*  what you're sort of getting at when you say velocity reversible. So the rule is, in Hamiltonian
*  mechanics, I have a collection of particles, they have positions, they have velocities or momenta.
*  I evolve it forward in time, get some new collection of positions and momenta. I reverse
*  all the momenta. So I create a new state called the time reversed state, which is keeping all
*  the positions the same, but reversing all the momenta. And then I evolve backward in time.
*  And I can do that. I can just put minus t into the equations. Then I get a yet another state,
*  and I untime reverse it. Okay, so that final state, I'm going to reverse all of its momenta.
*  And the non-trivial result is that process, evolve forward in time, time reverse, evolve backward in
*  time, time reverse again, that gets you back to your initial state. That is the statement of
*  time reversibility in physics. And it's just as true in the Schrodinger equation, except rather
*  than going from momentum to minus momentum, you go from wave function to complex conjugate
*  of the wave function. There you go. Okay. Now the point is that when you have that property,
*  when you have reversibility, the reversibility says that the amount of information contained
*  in the state at any one point in time is preserved over time. You can evolve forward or backward
*  without losing information. And that's true about micro physical dynamics, Newtonian or Hamiltonian
*  or Schrodinger or whatever. It's not true about macro physical dynamics. If I have classic example,
*  if I have a glass of warm water with an ice cube, or I have a glass of cool water,
*  they will both evolve into a glass of cool water. And seeing that final state macroscopically
*  doesn't let me decide which one it came from. If I see a glass of cool water, I don't know if it
*  just was a glass of cool water, or whether it was a glass of warm water with an ice cube. They look
*  the same. But micro physically, I would be able to tell if I knew all the positions and momenta.
*  And that's why you need the past hypothesis, because the whole point is to connect the
*  micro physical theory to the macro physical theory. It is a fact about the world that entropy
*  increases over time. And we have very, very strong belief that it was lower in the past.
*  But that's not dynamically necessary. You know, given the state of the world now,
*  and the microscopic laws of physics, if that's all you knew when you gave sort of equal probability
*  to any micro physical state that was compatible with our macroscopic knowledge, with overwhelming
*  probability, you would predict that the past used to be high entropy. And no one thinks that's true.
*  So you need a hypothesis that says it is low entropy at the Big Bang. Now, to be fair,
*  the story I'm just telling you here, this is the standard story. This is what most physicists or
*  philosophers would tell you. There are people who don't go along with the standard story. There are
*  people who, like you say, really think that time just has a direction built into it, okay, that
*  there is a flow from the past to the future. I don't think that most working physicists don't
*  think that but there are people who think that okay. I still think that even if you believe that,
*  it doesn't by itself tell you why the past had low entropy. So the way that to me the logic goes
*  in the following way. You might want to think that time fundamentally has a direction, or the time
*  doesn't fundamentally have a direction. It's just that it started with low entropy. And so we perceive
*  it to have a direction macroscopically, okay. But if you think that time fundamentally has a direction,
*  you still need to explain why the early universe had low entropy. You know, that doesn't come
*  for granted. There's no feature about saying time has a direction that then says if I take the
*  current state of the universe and evolve into the past, the entropy goes down. There's no connection
*  there, right. So even if you believe that time has a direction, you still need to have some past
*  hypothesis. And once you have the past hypothesis, you don't need to assume that time has a direction
*  because it will have a direction macroscopically, even if microscopically, it's completely
*  reversible. I think that's why most people like the past hypothesis package when it comes to
*  explaining the asymmetry of time. Thomas Prunty says, Congrats on the new position at Johns Hopkins.
*  You mentioned they are encouraging you to keep up your other activities. But I think something's
*  got to give. Do you foresee a slowdown in the podcast schedule or trade or textbook writing?
*  You know, I get it. Thank you, Thomas. I get the concern. I've had it myself, but I guess we'll
*  have to see. Okay, I mean, I have a lot of obligations to both write things and to teach
*  courses and things like that. I think I can do it. But we'll have to see maybe something will have
*  to give I'm not going to kill myself or, you know, drive myself to distraction. Doing these things.
*  I certainly have no plans right now to slow down the podcast schedule. At any at any time, I did
*  I toyed with the idea of maybe slowing it down a fraction by instead of doing a brand new
*  interview episode every Monday, I just make the am a's count as a new Monday episode. Okay, so that
*  removes one interview I need to do every month. But while still giving you a new podcast once a
*  week, I don't know whether I'm going to do that or not right now. Again, that is not the plan.
*  But that is a possible future plan if it becomes unbearable otherwise.
*  Emmett Francis says I was recently excited to receive an email from Biophysical Society
*  saying that they will put out an issue on emergent phenomena in biophysics.
*  But when reading their email, they define emergence as systems of many components whose
*  collective behavior is governed by their interactions, so that the whole is greater
*  than the sum of its parts. This strikes me is more of a definition of strong emergence,
*  which seems non physical to me. Is there any way to reconcile this definition with physics? Or have
*  they just gotten it wrong? Well, you know, certainly, one issue in the study of things
*  like emergence is we don't agree on the definition. Okay. I can give my definition of it and someone
*  I mean, this literally happened not that long ago, someone in the middle of a conversation says,
*  that's just not emergence, you know, you can't win or lose an argument about that.
*  It's a definition you people can just have different definitions. Okay. Now, the specific
*  issue with the definition that you're quoting, I wouldn't necessarily say that the issue is that
*  it's non physical because it's strong emergence. I think it's just not very well defined. Okay,
*  so the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. That's their definition. What does that mean?
*  How do I know that the whole is greater than some of its parts? How do I know what the sum of its
*  parts is? Right? That's why part of what one should do if one wants to have a principal discussion
*  about these things is be a little bit more clear about what your definitions are. Do you mean that?
*  So just to back up for those people who are not experts, I should apologize, because I'm sort of
*  embedded in these debates, I forget sometimes, there's a famous distinction between strong and
*  weak emergence, probably the clearest version of which was given by a philosopher named Mark
*  Bedow in a paper, I think called weak emergence. Those people have talked for many, many years
*  about the idea of emergence. And I think the part of the idea of emergence that everyone agrees on
*  is there's a way of talking about a big macroscopic system that is a collection of little parts,
*  that doesn't directly refer to those little parts. Right? When you talk about the table in front of
*  me, I can talk about the table being solid or brown or whatever, without talking about its atoms.
*  That's a common feature of emergence. The question is weak versus strong, are those features of the
*  table in principle, coming down to just the collective behavior of the individual atoms
*  and particles obeying their individual lower scale laws of physics, in which case it would
*  be called weak emergence. And what Bedow very cleverly did is said, look, if you have some lower
*  level laws governing the atoms or whatever, and in principle, I could do a numerical simulation,
*  I could put those laws of physics on a computer, and I could ask what happens. And the prediction
*  for what happens is the same as what actually happens. That's weak emergence. Okay, weak
*  emergence is when in principle, all the behavior could have been figured out just by putting the
*  lower level laws on a computer. And strong emergence is not that strong emergence is defined as
*  something happens, but it's not what you would have predicted by putting lower level laws of
*  physics on the computer. It's something else coming in that is somehow brand new because it is a
*  collective. Okay. So, what Emmett is getting at is that strong emergence picture is kind of suggested
*  by this motto of the whole is greater than some of its parts, but it's vague enough that you're not
*  sure. Okay. So, and people, so, and I have a take on this, which is only temporary, and I don't want
*  to completely buy it, because I'm still thinking about this myself, but I think that whether or
*  not strong emergence happens at all depends on what your two levels are. Okay. To a physicist
*  like myself, like the microscopic level is going to be quantum field theory or atoms or something
*  like that. And in that case, I think strong emergence just doesn't happen because we know
*  what the lower level things are. They're pretty simple, quantum fields, electrons, particles,
*  or whatever. They obey local equations of motion. What happens to the electron is only influenced
*  by what's happening in its immediate neighborhood of space and time. And there's just either that
*  theory, the core theory, is either right or wrong. And if it's right, then you don't have strong
*  emergence. And if it's wrong, then good. You win the Nobel Prize if you show that it's wrong,
*  but no one has done that yet. Okay. But sometimes you're interested in cases where the lower level
*  theory is not fundamental physics. Like, what if you want to say the behavior of a nation
*  emerges out of the behavior of its citizens? Okay. Citizens, bless their hearts, some of my
*  favorite friends are citizens, but they're not simple. They're themselves complex systems.
*  So you can try your best to invent laws of behavior governing the citizens, the people in
*  the country. But those laws are hard to pin down, hard to know that they're right. And it's hard to
*  say that they're local. So it might very well be the case that there's some useful sense in which
*  you get strong emergence when you connect one complex level of analysis to another higher,
*  but still complex level of analysis. Whereas I don't think that there's any interesting
*  emergence of strong emergence if your lower level theory is completely simple and local like physics
*  is. Samin Tajik says, given my background in quantum mechanics, I was asked to work on a
*  mutual project regarding quantum finance. The quantum part, which involved Bohmian mechanics,
*  made sense for me and the math was simple. However, when I start thinking about the results
*  and conclusion part, I suspect the whole idea, like how using quantum Bohmian potential one
*  can talk about financial markets and analyze the occurrence of rare events. Sorry, I me Sean
*  emphasize the wrong pronunciation there. When I start thinking about the results and conclusion
*  part, I suspect the whole idea. In other words, suspicion is being raised about the whole idea.
*  So I remember how you posted this book, Quantum Social Science, written by the same author I'm
*  now working with. Here, I would really love to know your thoughts on subjects like quantum finance
*  and quantum social science. Well, you know, as someone who is trying to write a book called
*  The Physics of Democracy, I cannot completely poo poo the idea, but you got to be careful.
*  You know, as I as I tried to say when I was describing the physics of democracy,
*  I'm a believer in using insights from quantum or from physics broadly, and certainly inspiration
*  and analogies from physics when understanding society or other things. But that's different
*  than saying that it is that. In other words, you know, a financial market or a country or whatever,
*  they are not a wave function, they are not a quantum state. You cannot just blindly apply
*  all of the knowledge that you get from thinking about quantum mechanics to these other kinds of
*  situations. That's not to say you can't be inspired by some of the behavior of quantum systems,
*  especially because they're probabilistic and so forth. Probability works a little bit differently
*  in quantum mechanics than classical mechanics. So very often, when people try to apply quantum
*  mechanics to other kinds of systems, I think that they're just missing the fact that they could
*  equally well just talk about classical probabilities, since the systems are looking at
*  are really classical. But I don't know the specific examples you're talking about. So I can't judge.
*  So I wouldn't immediately dismiss it nor immediately take it as as sensible, I would really think about
*  whether or not you are getting something extra out of the fact that this was supposed to be a truly
*  quantum thing rather than just a fancy and useless way of talking about classical probability
*  distributions. Richard Graff says, In your conversation with Arik Kersh and Brahman Alien
*  Life, aside from a brief mention of possible life in the clouds of Venus, there is no discussion of
*  the potential for life based on the atmosphere of a planet. Is there some fundamental obstacle that
*  would make atmospheric life, especially intelligent life, highly unlikely without some reliance on
*  either the marine or terrestrial environments? Well, you're at you should ask Arik this,
*  not me. But it's a good question. And I could easily imagine obstacles to life becoming highly
*  intelligent and technological. I mean, intelligence is a different thing, right? Intelligence could,
*  I think, arise anywhere. What do I know? But that's what I would suspect. But technological
*  is a little bit different. You know, I do think that you get extra flexibility and possibility
*  when you kind of live near the triple point, the triple point in chemistry being the conditions
*  under which certain things could be liquid, solid or gas. Now, a real chemist says, the triple point
*  happens when a single thing like water can be liquid, solid or gas. But forgetting about the
*  single thing, the fact that life on Earth has access to solids and liquids and gases is kind
*  of useful if you want to grow up to be a technological civilization. If you're literally just in the
*  clouds of Venus, if you never go down to the ground, you don't have access to either liquid or solid.
*  Okay, so your raw materials are much more constrained than they would be if you were down
*  on the ground. So all else being equal, I think it's not a surprise that we became technological
*  here on Earth with access to all these different possibilities. And maybe it's less likely if we're
*  just floating gas bags on Venus or Jupiter. Amino asks a priority question. Do we make all possible
*  choices at each decision point somewhere in the quantum multiverse? And if so, this has unsettling
*  implications for the importance of moral action, as others are always both maximally helped or hurt
*  by our actions, making moral choices meaningless. Have I got the right idea? Or is there something
*  I'm missing that will save me from this existentially troubling conclusion? Yes, there's
*  something you're missing, which is that not all decisions are equal. Okay, I mean, I know I've
*  said this many times, and it's in my book, but maybe I don't say it loud enough, because people
*  seem to always fall into the same what I think is a mistake, which is, you know, if there is a,
*  let's say there's an electron, okay, and you're going to put it through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus.
*  This is for physicists out there. They know that that's how we measure the spin of an electron.
*  It can either be spin up or spin down along some axis that you measure it in. Famously,
*  if you prepare the electron so that its spin is pointed in the x direction,
*  and then you measure it along the z direction, okay, a perpendicular axis. So if you measure the
*  spin of an axis of an electron on along an axis perpendicular to where its spin actually is,
*  you have a 50-50 chance of measuring it spin up or spin down. Then you get two branches of the
*  wave function, you have a reader, a readout apparatus that says up or down, and now you
*  have two branches. But it's crucially, crucially, crucially, crucially important that I could
*  measure the spin of an electron that was only 0.0001 degrees away from the z-axis in the first place.
*  And in that case, with overwhelming probability, I would measure it to be what the spin mostly was,
*  mostly spin up. It's, again, crucially important if you're an Everettian, there are two branches.
*  After you do that, there's a spin up branch and a spin down branch, but they are not created equal.
*  They do not get equal probability. They do not get equal mattering if you're thinking about,
*  you know, utilitarianism or morality or choices or anything like that.
*  Lots of things happen in the Everettian multiverse, but they don't all count equally. So maybe in some
*  single universe model, if you thought, well, if I do this, it's a good thing and that's good,
*  then in an Everettian model, you think, well, if I'm probably going to do this, that's a good
*  thing and that's good. And all the meaningfulness is exactly still there. It's not changed
*  whatsoever just because of the existence of these very, very, very tiny and completely
*  ignorable other worlds. John Morgan says, apologies that this is answered elsewhere,
*  but why do measurements of quantum states produce definite outcomes? I have a vague
*  recollection of an argument regarding diagonalization of the density matrix under
*  measurement, and maybe that's related, but this isn't the kind of thing that's easily googled.
*  Yes, that's fair enough. It's not easily googled. I mean, you can google it,
*  whether you're going to get a sensible answer is harder. So the answer depends a little bit.
*  There is an answer. The answer depends a little bit on what we mean by produce definite outcomes.
*  So there's two things going on. One is that when you measure a quantum system, what that means is
*  you bring your quantum system into entanglement with an environment. Okay. And that induces
*  branching of the wave function of the universe is one branch on which the system now has one value
*  and another branch is another value. That's why you get definite outcomes in the sense that there
*  is one value on one branch and another value on another branch. Now, if you don't know anything
*  about decoherence or becoming entangled with the environment, that's a much longer story. I wrote
*  a book, you can buy it. I encourage you to do so. But there is another question, another issue here,
*  which is maybe what you're actually getting at, which is why is it specific definite outcomes?
*  So there's one fact that a quantum measurement gets you an outcome. The other fact is that the
*  outcomes it gets you are predictable ahead of time and there's a very limited sample. So let's
*  just take Schrodinger's cat. That's what we always take. It's a good example. In my version of
*  Schrodinger's cat, the cat is put into a superposition of awake and asleep. And so in the
*  formalism of quantum mechanics, you can observe the cat, okay, and you can observe it along any
*  basis you want, which is a way of saying that you could ask the question, is the cat awake or asleep?
*  That's a question you can ask with two possible answers, awake or asleep, and you will get a
*  definite answer. But there are other quantum states like the superposition of awake plus asleep
*  and there's a perpendicular combination, the superposition of awake minus asleep,
*  the minus sign really makes a difference, and you can ask that question in principle. In principle,
*  you could say I observe the cat to ask the question, is it in the superposition of one
*  half awake one over square root of two, be technical about it, awake plus asleep, or is it in the awake
*  minus asleep state? Nothing in the formalism of quantum mechanics prevents you from asking
*  that question. But in fact, when you see cats, despite jokes, the real cats always either awake
*  or asleep. You never see it in the superposition of both, and you cannot even choose to see it
*  in a superposition of both, so what's going on? And that is not just decoherence, but the feature
*  of decoherence, namely that the interactions with the environment are local in space. When you talk
*  about decoherence and the entanglement with the environment, what you mean is there are photons,
*  let's say, in the box with the cat that will either interact with the cat or not, depending
*  on whether it's awake or asleep, by which what I mean is there's a physical configuration of the
*  cat. We're imagining that the awake cat is up and walking around, and the asleep cat is lying on the
*  floor sleeping, okay? That's what we're imagining, just because it's our thought experiment, we can
*  set it up however we want, and the point is that a photon that might hit and be absorbed by the cat,
*  if it were up and walking around, will miss the cat if it's asleep. But that's true for all the
*  photons, right? There's a coherent physical spatial extent that the cat has, depending on whether it's
*  awake or asleep, and there is no coherent physical extent it has if it's in a superposition.
*  So the fact that the cat is constantly being bombarded by particles that interact with it,
*  depending on where the cat is, means that in practice you will always observe the cat to be
*  in a macroscopically sensible coherent state, not in a superposition of two such things.
*  So the bare formalism of quantum mechanics that you might learn about in a textbook
*  would not answer this question. Most textbooks don't talk about decoherence or pointer states,
*  as they are called, or anything like that, but that is the answer. There's other answers,
*  there are other questions that that raises about why interactions are like that, etc., etc.,
*  but that's basically the reason. There is a classical regime that you get by focusing in on
*  states of quantum systems that are macroscopically in certain places, not superpositions of being in
*  different places, and those are the states we actually see because that's how decoherence
*  works. Tamim M says, do you think the laws of physics are universal? Do you think of the most
*  basic law? After all, we're assuming universality when probing the universe with the Webb Space
*  Telescope, right? Well, we're not assuming, we're doing what good scientists do, we're hypothesizing
*  and we're testing that hypothesis. So, for example, you could very easily hypothesize that the
*  physics that give rise to atomic transition lines, where you can see in the spectra of a galaxy,
*  the physics is the same in a distant galaxy five billion light years away as it is here,
*  and then you can test that hypothesis. You can also hypothesize maybe it was different.
*  If the mass of the electron or if the fine structure constant were slightly different values,
*  then you would see shifts in the position of spectral lines that we observe. That's what
*  astronomers do all the time. That's how you figure out the redshift of a distant galaxy.
*  You measure the positions of its spectral lines, and those spectral lines will be moved
*  if the laws of physics were a little bit different, and there's two things to say about that. One is
*  the motion is not uniform for different spectral lines. You might say, well, how do you know if
*  it's been moved? Maybe that's just what you're perceiving as the redshift. But there are many
*  different spectral lines, and they all rearrange with respect to each other in different ways if
*  you change the underlying laws of physics. So that's different than a single universal redshift put
*  on top of everything. The other thing is, you might say, well, that's if you change the laws
*  of physics a little bit. What if you change them a lot? Well, then if you change them a lot,
*  then you don't expect to see spectral lines at all. Maybe you have physics that doesn't even
*  give rise to what you and I know of as spectral lines. So anyway, the point is you're being a good
*  scientist. You're starting with a very simple hypothesis, a very clean hypothesis, that the
*  laws of physics that we observe here on Earth are the same far away. And then you test that hypothesis.
*  And so far, every little bit of testing we've done, whether it's for electromagnetism or for the masses
*  of particles or for the strong interactions or whatever, they've all been consistent with the idea
*  that the laws of physics are the same very far away. That has nothing to say about when you're
*  outside our observable horizon, of course. The part of the universe we can't see, the laws of
*  physics might very well be different. That possibility literally is the cosmological multiverse.
*  We don't know whether that's true or not. Paul Hess says, my understanding is that triggering of
*  vacuum decay is a probabilistic quantum event. The Higgs field would have to quantum tunnel to a new
*  lower energy state with an extremely tiny probability at each moment in space-time this
*  might occur. If this is true, then under the many worlds interpretation, would each moment of time
*  contain a branch with an extremely thin new decayed world being sliced off, leaving the non-decayed
*  portion of what we continue to live in, that we can live in, as getting continually thinner over time?
*  Yes, I think this might be the first time my answer is shorter than the question. That is exactly what
*  happens in many worlds. It's a smooth evolution from a wave function that says the vacuum has
*  not decayed to a superposition of it has not decayed plus it decayed at this point, it decayed at this
*  point, it decayed at this point for every point in space and time where it might have decayed.
*  Emil Rojas says, from a physics point of view, what is a dimension? Does it differ in any way
*  from the math notion? It differs in some ways. Of course, physicists use math, so physicists use the
*  mathematical definition of dimension and roughly speaking, it's actually kind of tricky to define
*  mathematically what dimension is, but it's a standard by which you're measuring something and
*  those standards can be incommensurable in the sense we were talking about earlier. So, you know, energy
*  and length are incommensurable, so those are different dimensions for quantities you might
*  want to mention. In math, it is most, so we use the word dimension in slightly different senses,
*  both in math and in physics. In math, it's very often to have your attention focused on what is
*  called a manifold, right? A manifold is something that in very small regions looks smooth. Maybe I
*  should start, maybe we should back up. You start with geometry and flat geometry, okay, Euclidean
*  geometry. And in Euclidean geometry, it's very easy to distinguish between one-dimensional geometry,
*  two-dimensional geometry, three-dimensional geometry, etc. A manifold is a generalization
*  of that notion that says in small regions of the manifold, it looks like Euclidean geometry with
*  some definite dimension. So if something is a manifold in the math definition, it has a
*  dimensionality everywhere. It doesn't change its dimensionality anywhere. Of course, that is exactly
*  the same notion of dimension that physicists use when talking about space-time, because space-time
*  is a dimension. So it is nothing more or less than the number of independent, by independent we mean
*  perpendicular, directions in which you can move. So you can move forward-backward, up-down, left-right,
*  for example. Three possible directions, because the direction and minus the direction count the same.
*  I think that's pretty much the same notion in both physics and math. Physicists often use this, you
*  know, unit idea of dimension. Like I mentioned, energy, time, length, temperature, things like that
*  are quantities that have units, and that's also sometimes called a dimension. But it's very, very
*  related to the math notion. Gregory Kusnik says, will you be teaching any online courses at Hopkins
*  or otherwise making course materials available to the general public? I don't think the courses are
*  online, as far as I know, but I don't know. I'm not there yet, so maybe. And who knows also about the
*  future. But generally, whenever I have a course, I put on, you know, either lecture notes or
*  supplementary materials or something. In fact, you can go to my website and find such things for
*  various courses that I've already done in the past. Look, they're generally not very good.
*  They're generally, you know, handwritten or whatever, kind of sloppy. I mean, I shouldn't
*  even say generally. The last time I taught a course was at Caltech. I taught quantum mechanics,
*  the third quarter of a three quarter quantum mechanics course, and I put all my lecture notes
*  online in handwritten form because it was easy to do so, because my handwritten lecture notes
*  were actually done on an iPad, and so I was easy to turn them into PDFs and put them online.
*  For the seminars, that's not as easy a thing to do. It doesn't make quite as much sense. This
*  was a lecture course, and so I just put my lecture notes online, whereas seminars don't have lecture
*  notes. You're supposed to be having the students do most of the talking, or even if I'm talking,
*  it will be in response to something that is organically happening in the class discussion.
*  But there will still be a webpage for every course that has readings and things like that,
*  and, you know, a syllabus and so forth. I think that's easy to put online, but I don't think
*  there'll be any videotaping going on, which, you know, look, probably that's good. For a lecture
*  course, videotaping and putting online makes perfect sense. I actually tried to get my quantum
*  mechanics course videotaped and put online at Caltech. It didn't happen. One of the reasons
*  why I became frustrated at Caltech. They were not interested in doing that. But for a seminar,
*  it doesn't make sense. For a seminar, you want it to be about that moment. It's not just wisdom
*  being handed down from the lecturer. It's the conversation that is going on that is more
*  important. Christopher Matthews says, have you ever gotten into Formula One racing? With the huge role
*  of aerodynamics in it, I can't think of another sport where the study of physics plays a larger
*  part. So two answers here. One is a short answer. No, I don't really know anything about Formula
*  One racing. I do know I have a friend, Deandra Leslie-Polecki, who is a physicist who wrote a
*  book called The Physics of NASCAR, where she actually digs into the physics of car racing,
*  in general, NASCAR in particular, not the same as Formula One, but related, I think.
*  So you can check that out if you're interested. I agree that there's a lot of physics going on.
*  But the second part of my answer is, it's not my kind of physics. I don't say that in any way,
*  disparagingly. It's exactly the opposite. When you try to apply physics to the real world,
*  suddenly all of the complications of the real world generally become important,
*  especially with something like Formula One racing. You're absolutely right. There's a lot of physics
*  involved. But the physics involved is not the kind of physics where you can spherical cow your way
*  out of the complications, where you can ignore friction, things like that, or look at the
*  elementary particles and get anything like that. So that stuff's much harder than what I do for a
*  living. And so I don't pretend to be an expert on it. Alexandra Zani says, it seems like we humans
*  experience the universe in a particular basis, moving in time, looking at things in 3D position,
*  not frequency, etc. Do you think it's likely that there is a similarly interesting structure
*  in other bases? My guess is no, actually. My guess is that when you say that we, I agree
*  with the presumption of the question, we humans experience the universe in a certain kind of
*  configuration that we pay attention to, certain variables are those that are observable to us
*  in the low energy coarse grained world and others are not. We see positions most obviously,
*  and that's in part because as we said earlier, physics has interactions that are local in
*  position, not in momentum or anything like that. And I think of this as a feature of emergence,
*  right? There is a higher level emergent structure that supervenes on the lower level goings on.
*  And I think that those emergent structures, you know, they have a life of their own, even though
*  they could in principle be derived from the lower level structure. The point is you don't have to
*  derive them, okay? That's what emergence is to me. If I didn't know that my table was made of atoms,
*  I could still talk about the table and its solidity and its height and its color and its weight
*  and so forth, okay? It's compatible with the underlying structure, but I don't need to know
*  about the underlying structure to make sense of it. And I think that the existence of such higher
*  level structures, what Dan Dennett calls real patterns, is rare. I don't think that there's
*  many, many different sets of real patterns that are useful. I think that they are precious and
*  few in the set of all possible ways to coarse grain the underlying goings on. Because the point is
*  not only can I look at and see the features of the table in front of me, but I can use that
*  information to make predictions, right? I can predict that if I put the coffee cup down, it
*  will set itself down on the table without falling through. I can predict that if I try to pick up
*  this table with one hand, I will fail. There's an enormous amount of predictive structure
*  inherent in that pattern with very little information. I don't need to know almost
*  anything about the individual atoms making up the table, right? That's the wonderfulness of a higher
*  level emergent structure. It gives you an enormous handle on the world on the basis of very little
*  input data. And I think that's very, very rare in the space of all possible things to imagine,
*  bases, if you will, in your language to imagine observing the thing in.
*  Rue Phillips says, listening to previous podcasts, I've gotten the sense that you suspect
*  a world that largely rejected gods and superstitions would ultimately be preferable
*  to all rather than one that does not. The reason being a world that pursues and accepts truth is
*  typically better off for a variety of reasons. Do I have your thinking right? And if so, could you
*  elaborate on the costs you have in mind of having gods and superstitions as part of society in our
*  modern age? I mean, I think that's partly right. I wouldn't necessarily put in exactly those words.
*  I am in favor of truth. I suspect that everyone is in favor of truth, at least for themselves.
*  People might not be in favor of other people having the truth. That happens all the time.
*  But they want themselves to have the truth. I don't know of anybody who actually says,
*  I would rather be wrong about the world than be right about it, right? And therefore, the fact
*  that I don't think that gods and superstitions are correct, truthful descriptions of the world,
*  means that I would rather not only myself but other people understand that and accept it.
*  I've also been very, very clear that the empirical implications and consequences of religious belief
*  are messy. There are good aspects and bad aspects. If you said, well, is it mostly good or mostly bad?
*  I would have no idea how to start answering that question. It's very easy to point to individual
*  really good things or individual really bad things and ignore the others and therefore think you're
*  winning the argument. I don't think that there's a rigorous way of weighing all of them. I can sort
*  of mildly, casually suspect that in the modern world, those implications and consequences are
*  mostly negative, but I can't really back that up with a calculation or with evidence. The one thing
*  I would point to is we do in our world have morals. We have ethics. We have rules for behavior.
*  What we don't have is an agreed upon way of getting them or justifying them, right? So we
*  kind of agree that some things are right and some things are wrong. As a society, we are very bad
*  at actually justifying why this thing is right and this thing is wrong. We sort of appeal to
*  just insistence, right? Just like you must know this is right or then that is wrong and so forth.
*  You go to the obvious examples and try to agree on that. Different people have their objective
*  moral realists, their subjective moral people, etc., etc., etc. Certainly for many, many people,
*  the justification for their moral beliefs comes from some religious belief. I think those
*  justifications fail because I don't believe, I don't accept the moral, the religious starting
*  point that they have. I really think that when it comes to ethics and morality, we would have a much
*  better conversation if we started by admitting that we live in a natural universe rather than
*  a supernatural one. A lot of that was evidenced in my book, The Big Picture. I try to put forward
*  exactly that idea. So I think that's probably, in thinking about ethics and morality, is probably
*  where our current society falls the most obviously short of where I would like them to fall if
*  everyone was being a naturalist. Chris Shipton says, it seems as if humans, sorry, it seems as
*  humans that our knowledge of the universe is increasing but the universe is on a path toward
*  the state of highest entropy in the far future. Will there be a time that if there are humans,
*  we will be unable to gain new knowledge or make accurate predictions? I think the parentheses
*  there are the important part. There won't be humans eventually. There will be a time when there are no
*  humans. So, but there is something interesting going on here. Yes, of course, entropy is increasing
*  and as far as we know it's just going to keep increasing until it sort of levels off. It
*  asymptotes to some maximum value, at least within any observable part of the universe.
*  Things like knowledge are temporary. There's no knowledge at the Big Bang because there's
*  no agents having any knowledge. There's no knowledge in the far, far future because there's no agents
*  around. Everything is in thermal equilibrium. It's on that journey between the Big Bang and
*  the far, far future that agents come into existence with a property one can call knowledge of the rest
*  of the world. Some correlations between data inside themselves, memories, laws of physics, knowledge,
*  etc. and what happens out there in the world. This is a temporary feature that is enabled by the fact
*  that entropy is increasing, but it's also going to be disabled by the fact that entropy continues
*  to increase. So the reason why that's important is because it's easy to say entropy is increasing.
*  It's hard to say exactly the way in which entropy increases and what are all the steps
*  along the way and what are all the implications of that. You might remember that Scott Aronson and I
*  and some students in post-docs wrote a paper about the emergence and then disappearance of complexity
*  in a closed thermodynamic system. I'm still thinking about that stuff. In fact, I was talking
*  about it with people at SFI this last three weeks when I was there and there's a lot to be done
*  about the emergence of these words like knowledge and prediction as temporary features of a universe
*  going from low entropy to high entropy. It's not something I don't think is very well understood
*  right now. Vladimir Belik says, in your oral history interview when talking about your high school years,
*  you mentioned that you weren't good at giving talks back then. I'm also not a natural at this.
*  I get similar comments. I use too many words to convey a thought and I stumble a lot. I'm currently
*  trying to get better at speaking because I'm starting an educational YouTube channel for my
*  business soon. Do you have any advice on how to improve at talking to an audience that might be
*  helpful to me and any other listeners with a similar aspiration? It's an excellent question,
*  a very, very important question. I don't have super good advice here. I'll mention two things
*  that are true but I'm not sure how helpful they are. One thing is practice. Do it a lot.
*  The context in which I was talking about not being good at giving talks was that I was on
*  the speech team, speech and debate team in high school. There's an irony in that I was on the
*  speech team and I was very bad at giving speeches. That's how I got better at it, by just doing it a
*  lot and doing it not just thoughtlessly but thoughtfully, mindfully, thinking about what
*  was working and what was not working. Look, there are plenty of people out there who can listen to
*  you, give a talk and tell you what's going right and what's going wrong. It's hard to listen to
*  them. It's hard to take their advice to heart and really change yourself and work at changing,
*  but that's what you could try to do. The other piece of advice, again, not necessarily very
*  helpful is I don't know your personal style but there are a lot of people who are relatively
*  fluid and articulate when talking in conversation and then when you put them in front of a formal
*  crowd, they become stilted and boring and unnatural. Why is that? It's a whole other thing.
*  Some people just are always stilted and boring. That's too bad, but again, you can work at that
*  through practice, but some people are different levels of interestingness depending on whether
*  it's an informal conversation or a formal presentation. If that's the case, then you
*  can certainly just internally work at making your mode of presentation not different when you're
*  giving a formal presentation than when you're having an informal conversation. You can think
*  about why is it different? I've seen people, because I hang out with journalists sometimes,
*  I've seen examples of people being interviewed and before the tape starts rolling, they're
*  joking around with the interviewer and they're very clear and charming and articulate and then as soon
*  as they're being recorded, they stiffen up and they get all very formal and less articulate and
*  less interesting and that's what I was like when I was giving talks as a high school student.
*  So that's one trick anyway that you can think about. Think of it more as how you would speak
*  during a conversation. Tell some jokes, be relaxed. Don't tell too many jokes depending on how your
*  joke telling skills go, but that kind of mode is what you should try to think about being in.
*  Peter Soulfest says, if gravity can be derived from entropy, doesn't that mean it's an
*  emergent property that can be ejected from our fundamental ontology? If that's the case,
*  why is quantum gravity even necessary? Yes, if gravity can be derived from entropy, which is,
*  that statement is a bit of an exaggeration. Gravity can't be derived from entropy, but
*  it might have something to do with entropy. There might be a derivation that uses entropy in a
*  central way that gets you to gravity. If that's true, that does mean it's emergent phenomenon.
*  It does mean it can be ejected from our fundamental ontology. It doesn't mean it's
*  not necessary. As I like to say, there's no human being in the world that lives at the level of our
*  fundamental ontology. Just the word human being doesn't exist in the level of our fundamental
*  ontology. We live at a higher level. We live in a world where we can see certain things,
*  where we can predict certain things, where we can interact with certain things,
*  none of which are from our higher level, our fundamental ontology. Desk in front of me,
*  classic example that I've used several times already in this AMA. So we would like to understand
*  that. Just like I would like to understand how airplanes fly, I would like to understand
*  quantum gravity, how it emerges from these lower levels. There's more to life than the most
*  fundamental ontology we have. Brendan says, I was watching your 2015 God and Cosmology debate with
*  William Lane Craig a few weeks ago. Given the past seven years since the debate, has there been
*  any scientific breakthroughs or experiences that you would now include in your talking points for
*  naturalism? Short answer is no. I don't think that there's been any scientific breakthroughs
*  or experiences. If I were to do it again, which I have no plans to do right now, but you never know,
*  probably my specific talking points would be different just because I've changed a little
*  bit. I've written the book, The Big Picture. Since then, I think The Big Picture was after
*  2015, was it? I think so, yes. So I've thought about these issues a little bit more carefully
*  in certain ways, both the pros and cons of naturalism. I've dwelt on and talked with other
*  people, et cetera, et cetera. So none of the specifics would be the same, just like we all
*  change over time, but not because of any scientific breakthroughs. I mean, look, to be super duper
*  honest, I don't think it's a close call between naturalism and supernaturalism, naturalism and
*  theism. I think that sometime around the 19th century was the last time when one could really
*  say, well, maybe theism, but I'm not sure. By now, it's pretty clear. So I don't expect
*  ongoing scientific research to have any big impact on that set of points of view I have, unless
*  they actually are evidence for theism, which would change my mind by a lot, but I haven't seen any
*  of that in the last seven years. Chris Murray says, the holographic principle is reminiscent
*  of the fact that in complex analysis, a holomorphic function on a disk is fully determined by its
*  values on the boundary of the disk. Do you think this is an important connection or just a cosmetic
*  resemblance? So the idea here, for those of you who are not complex analysis experts, is that there's
*  a certain... So in complex analysis, what are you talking about? You have a complex number, you have
*  the set of all complex numbers. The set of all complex numbers is kind of like the plane, right?
*  The two-dimensional plane, X and Y axes. Likewise, a single complex number has two parts. It has the
*  real part and the imaginary part. So the set of all complex numbers, topologically, it's a plane.
*  We talk about the complex plane. And we can have a function of that plane. So it's a function of
*  the real part and the imaginary part of where you are on the plane. And generally, we think about
*  complex functions on the complex plane. So we map a complex number to another complex number.
*  There's a certain subset of those functions called holomorphic. There's mathematical conditions. You
*  can Google them. That will tell you what a holomorphic function is. And those conditions
*  are pretty restrictive. Most functions are not holomorphic, but some are. And a nice feature of
*  holomorphic functions is that it's so restrictive that if you just tell me, if you have some circle
*  in the complex plane, and you think about the function being defined inside the circle,
*  that's the disk inside the circle, then just telling me what the function is on the boundary,
*  on the circle that you've drawn, is enough to completely specify what the function is
*  inside on the disk. That does bear a family resemblance to holography, right? The holographic
*  principle of black hole physics is supposed to be that the entire interior state of the black hole
*  can be thought of in terms of information living on the boundary, on the event horizon of the black
*  hole. And it's not actually a feature, you know, this feature that a higher dimensional set of
*  things is determined by a lower dimensional set of things is true in both of those cases, but also
*  is true much more widely. Like you all know a very simple example of this, namely physics.
*  If I give you a physical situation at a moment in time, that's enough to determine what happens in
*  the future, if it's deterministic physics, if it's Newtonian physics, or the Schrodinger equation,
*  or whatever. As well as in the past, you're determining a whole space times worth, a whole
*  four dimensional worth of solution to an equation, just from a three dimensional slice of time amount
*  of information. So when you have some constraint, like holomorphicity, or the equations of motion
*  of physics, it's very common, it's not magical or weird to get a full extra dimensions worth
*  of dependence out of initial information. So that's the sense in which there is a family
*  resemblance. It's not a very close sense. The interior of black hole is not the complex plane.
*  In fact, it's in the macroscopic world in which we live is three dimensional, not two dimensional,
*  so it can't be exactly the same thing. Having said that, there is a slightly similar feature
*  that is not holomorphic function, but a related feature, which is that if you have something like
*  gravity or electromagnetism, you have Gauss's law. That's a way of saying the following thing.
*  If I tell you, let's put it this way, let's say the collection of charged particles, it's actually
*  easier to visualize for electric charge than for gravity, but it also works for gravity.
*  If I have a collection of charged particles, protons, let's say, and there's no electron,
*  so it's just protons, and I know that these electrons, these protons rather, are in some
*  region of space, then what Gauss's law tells me is that if I look at the electric field on the
*  boundary of that region, so I have some spherical boundary surrounding the surface of a sphere,
*  surrounding what we call in math the ball, which is the interior of the sphere,
*  the statement of Gauss's law is that I can integrate up the electric field on the sphere,
*  the boundary, and that tells me the amount of charge inside the ball. So we can figure out a lot
*  about the distribution of charges inside just by thinking, just by measuring the electric field on
*  the boundary. Maybe even not just the total charge, but a little bit about the distribution of charges
*  by looking at where the electric field is stronger or weaker on the boundary. We can't learn
*  everything about the charge distribution inside, because if you have a charge distribution that
*  itself is perfectly spherical, then the size of that sphere is completely irrelevant. It's going
*  to give you the same electric field outside. So in conventional, and again, the same thing exactly
*  happens for gravity. So conventionally, you can learn a lot about the gravitational or electric
*  charges inside a region by looking at the associated fields on the boundary, but not
*  everything. This has to do with the fact that it's a long range field, a gauge field, there's
*  symmetries, etc. You would like to promote that to something like what we think of as the holographic
*  principle. Believe me, people have thought about this. It hasn't quite turned into a rigorous,
*  careful identification, for example, for reasons like if you have a spherically symmetric
*  distribution, then it should look the same outside. But maybe there's something there. Maybe
*  there's something that is in the connection between long range fields and boundaries that
*  sounds kind of holographic. On the other hand, I kind of think that that's kind of too cheap and
*  easy, that there is something really non-local going on in gravity because of how gravity is
*  involved with the curvature of space-time that gives rise to this holographic effect.
*  But we'll have to see. This is a very good question. You're on the right track thinking
*  about things like this. Jace Forbes asks a priority question. If black hole gravity
*  caused time dilation and Hawking radiation causes the black hole to evaporate, would the time
*  dilation seem to accelerate this evaporation from the perspective of an infalling particle?
*  And why, if time dilation approaches zero, could said particle fall into a black hole before it
*  evaporates completely? So I think your first half and second half of questions, I'll allow you the
*  two questions, but they're different questions. From the perspective of an infalling particle,
*  it's actually really subtle and interesting and I am not going to claim I understand it correctly.
*  Usually when I say I don't understand something correctly, it's because either no one understands
*  it correctly or because someone does but I haven't tried. This is something that I think is
*  understandable and I have tried a little bit but I'm still confused about what happens from the
*  perspective of an infalling observer when you cross the black hole of enterizing. Roughly speaking,
*  we know what happens which is that when you're far away, you see Hawking radiation. If you start
*  falling in, you'll see a slightly blue-shifted Hawking radiation. You're going to see it. You're
*  moving now toward the black hole so the radiation you see seems to get more energetic in some sense.
*  But if you keep falling in as you cross the event horizon, you don't see anything at all
*  because from your point of view, the event horizon is not a special place.
*  So somehow you have to sort of be feeling or noticing the black hole as an object rather
*  than being so close up that it almost becomes indistinguishable to you. Somehow that's how the
*  vacuum of the quantum field theory works, that it looks like empty space right there at the horizon
*  and looks like there's a radiating black hole when you're very far away. So that's the first
*  part of the question. The second part, if time dilation approaches zero, could said particle
*  fall into a black hole before it evaporates completely? Yes. And that's an easy one. You
*  can do that calculation. It's a little bit subtle because when you have a black hole that doesn't
*  evaporate, you have an ordinary general relativity black hole like you'll read about in my textbook
*  or whatever. There's the event horizon, right? And the event horizon is well defined. We know
*  where it is and it's a global property. The event horizon is the point of no return. It's the point
*  past which if you go inside, you can never come out. If you let the black hole evaporate, in some
*  sense, everything that goes in comes out. We don't understand that sense completely, but the same
*  amount of energy, the same amount of matter that goes in comes out. Ideally, we hope the same amount
*  of information. So there is no event horizon really for an evaporating black hole. So that
*  complicates things. What can you do? What you can do is you can define an apparent horizon. There is
*  a way without making reference to the future evaporation of the black hole. There's a way of
*  saying, roughly speaking, the radius of the black hole in a Schwarzschild metric, a non-charged,
*  non-spinning black hole is a known quantity, 2GM, where 2 is 2, G is Newton's constant, M is the
*  mass of the black hole. So you can just draw a sphere at a radius of 2GM and say, that's apparently
*  where the horizon is now. And in that sense, that's where the Hawking radiation is coming from.
*  And yes, particles can pass by that apparent horizon no problem long before the black hole
*  evaporates. I mean, when you think about it, it doesn't take long to fall into a black hole,
*  but it takes a huge amount of time for black holes to evaporate. So that's what you would expect.
*  Christoph Piranski says, I still don't get how creativity, invention, discovery, and eureka
*  moments are all possible in the fully deterministic block universe. They all seem like theater in this
*  context. What am I missing? Well, I guess you're missing something subtle in the definition of
*  creativity, invention, and discovery. I mean, you seem to be smuggling in to the definition of these
*  human sounding words, something that is intrinsically non-physical or non-deterministic
*  somehow. But look, you can recognize creativity, right? You can look at someone's work and say,
*  oh, that's very creative. You made a discovery. You made an invention. And then God shows up and
*  God says, you know what? The laws of physics are deterministic. Why would that change your opinion
*  about whether or not that work of art or science was a creative or a discovery or whatever, right?
*  This is how higher level emergent phenomena work. At the level of the core theory of physics,
*  there are no fundamental words called creativity, invention, or discovery. There's just this quantum
*  state of the universe evolving forward according to the Schrodinger equation. Exactly as for La
*  Place's demon, in a classical context, La Place's demon knows where all the particles are and where
*  they're going. There's no such thing as temperature, pressure, entropy, any of those things,
*  because you know where all the particles are. It's only when you have incomplete information
*  at the higher level that it becomes useful and interesting to talk about temperature and pressure
*  and so forth. Likewise, it's only when you're talking about the human level, not the fully
*  deterministic fundamental physics level, that it's useful to talk about creativity, invention,
*  discovery, etc. Those levels, the best descriptions we have or will ever have, are not deterministic.
*  You're not going to get a deterministic theory of human beings that involves only knowable things
*  about those human beings. That's okay. Just like flipping a coin seems to be non-deterministic to
*  us, even though we think that if we knew the exact microstate of the coin and your thumb and whatever,
*  you could figure it out. You could predict exactly what was going to happen.
*  Owen asks, just wondering why anyone at all accepts the post-Humian commonplace that you can't or
*  shouldn't derive an ought from an is. If ought aren't to be derived from is-is, how should they be
*  derived? Well, you know, it depends on your attitude towards ought. The fact that you can't derive
*  ought from is-is is just logic. There's literally nothing other than that. I can write down a set of
*  axioms or postulates or premises, all of which say, this is true, this is true, this is true.
*  Conclusion, this ought to be true. You can't do that. It's just literally impossible simply as a
*  matter of logic. You can do it if you smuggle in to your premises some ought, some statement about,
*  well, that ought not to be true. That sounds bad. Let's not do it. Usually the way that people
*  pretend to get around the ought-is problem is they fake language. They prevaricate or equivocate,
*  I should say, about the meanings of words. You can say, it is true that I don't want this to be
*  happening, therefore I should not let it happen. Therefore I ought not to let it happen. But you
*  see you're sort of just cheating in natural language. You're not actually deriving anything
*  sensible. So if you want to know where the oughts come from, I mean, strictly speaking,
*  they're not derived. That's the answer. There is no moral realism. There is no objective fact
*  about what ought to be done. What you can do, which I advocate doing, is saying that, okay,
*  there are subjective claims that I can make as a human being. I have things that I want to be true.
*  I have ways that I want people to behave, et cetera. And I'm going to, in concert with other people,
*  talking to them and thinking about what they have to say, I'm going to propose that we use
*  the following regulations as moral guidelines. You're not deriving them from anything at all.
*  You're postulating them on the basis of what you want to be true. That's what moral constructivism
*  is all about. And I think that's the truth. That's the way the world actually works.
*  Again, if you think of what people actually do, it's that. They then justify it in all sorts of
*  fancy philosophical ways. But really, they have some feeling about how they would like things to
*  be. And then they justify it. But that's not really a derivation.
*  Fabian Rosdalen says, what is your relationship to visual art, paintings digital or not? Do you paint?
*  Have you ever tried painting? Do you have any favorite artists or style? I'm a big fan of
*  visual arts. I have art books lying around the house, et cetera. Not an expert, not super
*  knowledgeable. Here's something you might not know. When I was a postdoc at the Institute for
*  Theoretical Physics at UC Santa Barbara, one of the famous physicists there is Gary Horowitz,
*  string theorist, gravity person. And his wife, Corrine, was the education director for the UC
*  Santa Barbara Art Museum. So she ran a program where undergraduate students could work as docents
*  at the art museum. They could give tours and explain things to people. And so even though I
*  was not an undergraduate student, I was a postdoc, I signed up to be a docent with Corrine Horowitz.
*  And she loved having me because most of the young undergraduate docents were women, which they
*  actually were way ahead of me in knowing about art. But I was way ahead of them because I had a very
*  deep voice. And the kids who would come on, you know, elementary school, kindergarten trips to the
*  art museum were much more willing to listen to me because I had a deeper sounding voice. So I
*  commanded respect among the 10 year olds who would come to the art museum, even though I knew less
*  about what I was talking about. He didn't have to know that much to be a docent, just, you know,
*  given entertaining and mostly truthful exposition of what was going on. All of which is to say,
*  I like art quite a bit. I'm a big fan, even though not perfectly knowledgeable.
*  I have even tried to paint. I have even painted. It's been a long time since I've actually
*  actively done it. So I can't claim that I am a painter. But you know, my formative experience
*  was going to a modern art museum, having the reaction that many people have using it, looking
*  at these very abstract kind of color field paintings and saying, well, I can do that.
*  And then but because I'm me, I also said, well, look, if I'm going to say I can do that,
*  that's meaningless unless I do it, right? Let's actually do it. And you know, I bought an easel
*  and some canvases and some acrylics. Acrylics are just easier to deal with than oils if you're an
*  amateur. And then you paint and you realize, oh, guess what? I can't do that. It's actually harder
*  than it looks to achieve the effect that a really good abstract artist achieves. So my respect for
*  the art form went up a lot. I wish I did more painting. We don't quite have, you know, the sort
*  of space in the house right now. Maybe I will when I get to Baltimore. Maybe I'll fire up the old
*  painting studio again. Who knows? You never know. And then I can sell them as NFTs or something like
*  that and retire. That'd be awesome. James Nancarrow says, do magnetic monopoles actually exist?
*  And is it possible for us to create them in a particle accelerator or some other way? How much
*  energy would it take to create one if this is even a possibility? We don't know whether monopoles
*  exist. They could exist theoretically, by which I mean we can construct physical theories that
*  are compatible with all the physics that we know in the world and allow for the existence of magnetic
*  monopoles. In fact, famously, grand unified field theories generally predict monopoles. A grand
*  unified field theory is one that unifies not just electricity magnetism with the weak force,
*  like we have in the electroweak theory, but also with the strong nuclear force. Grand unification
*  has nothing to do with gravity. I know that the terminology can be a bit hard to follow sometimes,
*  but literally the strictly speaking defined word within the physics community for grand unified
*  theory is strong, weak, and electromagnetism combined together. Theories along these lines
*  were proposed, especially in the 1970s. Sheldon Glashow and Howard Georgi started that trend,
*  but many other people proposed different models. And there's a really interesting mathematical
*  fact. The whole point of a grand unified theory is that these theories that we have, strong, weak,
*  electromagnetic, are gauge theories. So they're based on some symmetry group. And why do you see
*  separate forces? Well, because the symmetry has been broken. That's why you see separate electromagnetic
*  and weak forces, because the symmetry between them was broken by the Higgs field. So grand unification
*  imagines a bigger symmetry group, but still what we call a simple group, usually, not always. And
*  simple in this case is not just a feeling that you have. It's a technical term in mathematics,
*  a simple group is a particular type of continuous symmetry group. So if you combine the SU3, SU2,
*  and U1 of the standard model of particle physics into a single simple symmetry group,
*  and then you break that symmetry down to what we observe, SU3 goes to SU2 cross U1, then you
*  inevitably get magnetic monopoles. That's kind of cool, right? That's kind of a cool result.
*  You cannot, I mean, it's a predictive thing. You cannot wiggle out of it. Of course, you can wiggle
*  out of it by making it a not simple group or something like that. But there's that conditional
*  statement. So that's a remarkable statement. And then it also comes with a prediction,
*  namely that the mass of the magnetic monopole particles should be of order the energy scale
*  of which grand unification happens. So if you think about protons and neutrons, limited energy
*  scale of about one GeV, one billion electron volts, Higgs boson top quark are 100 GeV or a little
*  bit more. So 10 to the 2 GeV. Grand unification is probably up at 10 to the 16 GeV, way, way higher
*  than we're looking at right now in particle accelerators. The Large Hadron Collider is at
*  10 TeV, that is to say 10,000 GeV, 10 to the 4 GeV, still way short of 10 to the 16.
*  So maybe you say, well, okay, you're predicting magnetic monopoles, but I can never make them,
*  right? So who cares? Well, if you're careful, my Caltech colleague, John Preskill and others
*  pointed out that in the early universe, where the energies were very high, you should make a lot of
*  magnetic monopoles. And in fact, you can predict using a mechanism called the Kibble mechanism,
*  after British physicist Tom Kibble, you can predict a minimum number of magnetic monopoles that you
*  had better make. And it turns out to be way bigger than we're allowed to have. We would have
*  easily noticed this, the overwhelming majority of matter in the universe would be in the form of
*  magnetic monopoles if this story were true. So people caught on to this in the late 1970s, after
*  grand unification came along, people predicted there should be monopoles. People predicted that
*  they should be abundant, and they're not. What's going on? And secretly, that fact, that puzzle was
*  the primary motivation for Alan Guth, pursuing the idea of the inflationary universe scenario.
*  These days, magnetic monopoles are less popular. Well, I should say grand unified theories are
*  less popular. They're not unpopular. But they did make one other besides monopoles, they made one
*  other prediction, which is that the proton should not be perfectly stable, it should decay.
*  Sadly, there's like wiggle room in exactly how fast it should decay. But for most of the plausible
*  parameter space, again, we should have seen them decay. Most grand unified theories in their
*  simplest forms predict we should have already seen proton decay. We haven't. So grand unified
*  theories have therefore lowered in their Bayesian credence by a little bit. And therefore the
*  motivation of getting rid of the monopoles, the so-called cosmological monopole problem, is less
*  now than it used to be. And so when people talk about inflation now, they talk about the horizon
*  problem, the flatness problem, roughly speaking, the smoothness of the early universe. But the
*  monopole problem is still there if you want to because grand unification is still possible. So
*  that's a good motivation for inflation. Roughly inflation can inflate away the monopoles, you just
*  have monopoles, but there's less than one per observable volume of the universe. That's why
*  we've never seen them. David Poole asks a priority question. It's been stated that early proponents
*  of the Copenhagen interpretation were not interested in what was actually happening during
*  decoherence with the statement shut up and calculate. However, with the many worlds
*  interpretation, it seems to me you are equally dismissive when you say the world just evolves
*  according to the Schrodinger equation. What does this actually mean? How does, say, a 60% probability
*  evolve into the real world that we observe? You know, I don't think I'm dismissive. I think I have
*  a theory that says that the world evolves according to the Schrodinger equation. You can be dismissive
*  of questions. You can think a question is not interesting and dismiss it, but this is just a
*  proposed theory of how the physical world works. You can't be dismissive of it. You can agree with
*  it or disagree with it or assign a credence to it. So my theory of the fundamental dynamics of the
*  physical world is it evolves according to the Schrodinger equation. What does it actually mean?
*  It means exactly that. It doesn't mean anything different. It means that there is a state that is
*  an element of Hilbert space. It evolves according to an equation that was written down by Professor
*  Schrodinger. You say, how does a 60% probability evolve into the real world? Well, you're already
*  not being a good everettian by saying, how does a 60% probability evolve? There's a wave function
*  that evolves, not a probability. What you need to do is follow the evolution of the wave function,
*  then ask, why does it appear to us in the world as if quantum mechanical events happen with
*  probabilities rather than deterministically? And the answer there is, as we discussed earlier,
*  because there are different branches on which different things happen. So there are different
*  definite experimental outcomes, but those branches are not created equally. They have different
*  amplitudes associated with them. And you can ask, there's a much longer conversation. Again,
*  I did write a book about this that you're welcome to check out. But you can ask if I'm an agent,
*  if I'm a person in one of these branches of the wave function, and I don't know whether I'm going
*  to be on the spin up branch or the spin down branch, is there a way to assign probabilities
*  that makes sense? You have to define what it means to make sense and so forth. One of the criteria is
*  that it's consistent over time. Things that people are doing over there in their experimental
*  laboratories on Alpha Centauri are not affecting the probabilities that I would predict here on
*  Earth. And therefore, what happens is that you get the right answer. The answer is the only way to
*  assign probabilities in this world of being on one branch or the other is what we call the Born
*  Rule. The probability is the wave function squared. So it's not a probability that is built into
*  frequencies in the world. It's a probability that is subjective, that comes out of our
*  trying our best to figure out where we are in the world. But it does get you the right answer.
*  Weston Manville says, How do you perceive, for lack of better words, the beginning of everything
*  and anything? Given all the amazing experience and knowledge you possess, both philosophical and
*  technical, I would just simply love to hear how you may describe or conceptualize that which is
*  understandably beyond human comprehension. Is the beginning of something a false concept when you
*  trace it back to the beginning to the series of events that are responsible for its existence,
*  all the way back to beyond the beginning of the universe and time only as we know it? So as usual,
*  there's a few things going on here in this question. I am someone who believes and again,
*  I'll just say it again, because I always get accused of dismissing things or of thinking that
*  things are certain, even though I'm trying to assign probabilities. This is what I think,
*  at a certain level of credence, I could be wrong. Okay. But with all that said, I think that the
*  laws of physics don't have a fundamental direction of time built into them. So I don't think that we
*  have to think about the current state of the world as originating in the beginning,
*  then flowing in to the current state. What we should think about is the whole history
*  of the world, including the beginning and now and the future, obeying the laws of physics in some way.
*  Now, we don't know among and this is something that it's not just, I don't know for sure, but I
*  have strong opinions, we truly don't know with any strong confidence whether the universe had a
*  beginning or not. That is to say, whether a physical clock measuring proper time that you
*  extended back into the past would reach a point where there was no past earlier than that,
*  or whether it could continue forever. We don't know that they're perfectly respectable models
*  that have to go either way, that have either property. Now, but you're completely right
*  about human comprehension. And there's a good news, bad news situation here.
*  The bad news is that the kinds of things happening at the beginning of our universe,
*  let's call the big bang the beginning, whether or not it really was right at the beginning of
*  our comprehension of the universe. Those things are very far removed from human experience.
*  It's a different kind of thing happening. It's not something which our experience growing up
*  as people in the world has equipped us to talk about, much less understand. And in fact,
*  as a practical matter, that lack of straightforward comprehensibility and discussion for that matter
*  gets in the way. It makes us make statements that upon further careful reflection just
*  aren't very sensible. And we sometimes, as mere finite human beings, we lapse into our everyday
*  way of thinking about the world, even in regimes where we shouldn't. Okay, that's the bad news.
*  The good news is, man, if you're at all fair about it, the remarkable thing is not our lack
*  of comprehension, but the presence of our comprehension, right? The remarkable thing is how
*  much of the world we have come to understand. I have no idea what fraction of it is. So I have
*  no idea how much of understanding the world we have versus how much remains yet to be discovered.
*  So I'm making not a relative statement about the fraction that we know, but just a list of things
*  that we know is, to me, utterly amazing. When you think about relativity and quantum mechanics and
*  the Big Bang, not to mention Darwinian evolution of molecular biology and sociology and psychology,
*  etc., we've learned an enormous amount just in a couple hundred years. We live in a 14 billion year
*  old universe, and in 200 years, maybe let's give it 500 or 5,000 years, doesn't matter. It's a short
*  period of time under which we have really been carefully using the scientific method thinking
*  about the universe. And not only do we understand a lot of it, we understand it in terms of highly
*  non-intuitive things like relativity, the Big Bang, quantum mechanics, most of all. But we get it.
*  We're able to do it. We use math, we use philosophy, we use rigor, we use data, we use Bayesian
*  updating, all that stuff. And using these tools as leverage, we were able to develop enormous amounts
*  of understanding. And best of all, when things are really going well, not only can we understand
*  things, but we can know where our understanding fails. We can understand that I can extrapolate
*  beyond a certain point, but it's just guessing after that. We're not very, very certain. That's
*  why I can say with confidence that we are not confident about whether the universe had a
*  beginning. We have data, we have empirical, phenomenological information about what the
*  universe was doing a minute after the Big Bang. The Big Bang, that would be there if
*  general relativity were right, which it's not, etc., etc., but hopefully you know what I mean.
*  But that's an enormous distance from our everyday experience. We understand what the universe was
*  doing. I've written papers about this myself. We understand the expansion rate and the density
*  of the universe a minute after the Big Bang, the temperature to a very strong level, the
*  composition of the universe. And we don't understand what it was doing a microsecond after the Big Bang.
*  We just don't. We talk about it all the time as working cosmologists, but we know that our
*  knowledge is given out, which to me is as impressive as the fact that we have that knowledge
*  in the first place. So what I suspect, now let me just get a little more poetic around it,
*  that I'm trying to be a good scientist there and saying we don't know what happened at the beginning.
*  I don't think that what happened at the beginning is beyond human comprehension.
*  I think it's different than our everyday experience, sure, but I don't think that it is
*  ineffable. I do not think that it is beyond our grasp in principle. This is like when people ask
*  me, you know, in 50 years, what is the most amazing thing you think will happen? My favorite
*  prediction is we'll understand what happened at the beginning of the universe. I could be wrong
*  about that, footnote as usual, but that's my feeling because I don't see any obstacles
*  to doing it except that it's hard, right? Except that we don't have any direct information because
*  the information about whatever happened at the very beginning of the universe is sort of
*  transformed over time, you know, rubbed out by either inflation or the microwave background
*  or whatever. It's hard to get direct empirical data, but it's not impossible to build a theory
*  that will be just so compelling and clear that it will make a statement about what happened
*  at the beginning and everyone will go, yeah, it's probably true. We're not sure because we can't see
*  it, but that seems to be the right way to go. That to me is the miracle of science, that, you know,
*  the world obeys patterns and we have the ability to discern these patterns even when these patterns
*  are way outside our comfort zone, way outside our everyday experience. That's the power of
*  math and logic and philosophy and science and so forth, tools of thinking about the nature of
*  reality. And then it's our human duty to accommodate our understanding to those very alien terms.
*  That's why quantum mechanics is hard because quantum mechanics talks about the world in a way
*  that is fundamentally different than our everyday experience and that's why a hundred years later
*  we don't agree about what quantum mechanics says because different human beings have different
*  levels of cope when they're thinking about quantum mechanics. Maybe some are too willing to be radical,
*  some are not willing enough, we're not sure yet. That's why we're talking about it, but I think
*  we are making progress. I'm optimistic that it will happen. Michael Blau says, your recent episode
*  with Andrew Lee and episode 19 with Tyler Cowan each bring up the question of evaluating humanity's
*  current decisions in light of their impact on future generations. So I'm editing a little bit,
*  but you already get the point, right? You know, how should we evaluate humanity's current decisions
*  in light of future generations? I'm not done talking about this on the podcast. I think this
*  is a very crucial question. I see strongly the arguments for two opposite lines of reasoning.
*  One line of reasoning is, you know, basically what Andrew and Tyler would both push, namely,
*  human beings in the future are just as real, count just as much as human beings now. Like,
*  you would feel bad if you knew that some mild decision you made now had terrible awful
*  consequences for the whole future of humanity and you would rightfully feel bad. You would think you
*  would you were doing something wrong and if you try to make that understanding kind of rigorous
*  and think about what's going on, you might say, look, there's going to be a lot of people
*  in the future and tiny decisions we make now can have enormous leverage over what's going to happen
*  to them in the future. Therefore, we should take that into account at a very, very high level of
*  concern. I get that line of reasoning. Here's another line of reasoning. We're terrible at
*  predicting the consequences of our actions over the very, very long term. There are time scales.
*  You can't ignore the time scales in the problem. There are things we do that have pretty clear
*  implications on the time scale of a year or 10 years. If you think about what people might have
*  said 100 years ago, trying to make predictions for what life would be like now, it's hard to
*  imagine they would have done a very good job, right? And if anything, the pace of change is
*  accelerating. I think it's kind of not hard to imagine that we're bad now at predicting what the
*  world will be like 100 years in the future. And 100 years is nothing. We could imagine
*  humanity extending a thousand, a million, a billion years into the future. A billion is hard. We
*  would evolve into something else. But you know what I mean. There might be something going down
*  the line. So my point is that even if I care a lot about those people, I have no idea how to make
*  their lives better. I think that's the humble, realistic reading of the situation. So it's not
*  that I wouldn't care about them. It's just that I try to be clear-eyed about what I can do about it,
*  which isn't that much. Whereas the decisions I make might have very predictable consequences
*  on the year or 10 year time scale. So to me, it makes perfect sense to, for all intents and
*  purposes, discount the value of lives in the future, just not because they're not important,
*  just because I don't know what they're going to be like. And therefore I can't judge what to do
*  now on the basis of that kind of analysis. Ford Prefect, probably a pseudonym, says,
*  in one of the AMAs you described how big chunk of your work comprises of, among others, stretches
*  of time dedicated to just thinking. Do you ever get sad, frustrated, or otherwise uneasy when you
*  don't seem to progress in any obvious way during such sessions, especially for a longer period of
*  time? Have you ever felt that you've wasted the time? And so how do you deal with that? If not,
*  why do you think that's the case? Excuse me. So yeah, I mean, there's long periods where progress
*  is not only stagnant or maybe even negative. Maybe you've realized that something you thought was
*  true or you thought that you had done, succeeded in achieving, goes away. That absolutely happens
*  all the time. I think you're not thinking about that mostly. You're thinking about the time when
*  you're just mulling or just musing over what's going on, hoping for a breakthrough or whatever.
*  Those are absolutely part of the deal. When I was at SFI, I was joking to someone,
*  how do you ever get work done around here? There's too many people that are interesting to talk to.
*  Correct answer was, that's part of the work. That counts. You never know when that little
*  conversation might spark something. It's less obvious than when you're just sitting silently
*  by yourself in your own office, but still your brain can be working and moving and
*  you can't skip that part. It's weird for people who have different kinds of jobs,
*  where work is a little bit more evident, a little bit more manifest in the world. You're
*  lifting something up or you're driving somewhere or whatever. If you're a writer or an artist or
*  a scientist, there's a lot of time that is spent sitting, not doing anything. There are things
*  happening inside your brain, but they're not evident to the outside world. How do you deal
*  with it when it doesn't work? You ask the question, do you ever feel you've wasted the time?
*  Look, you absolutely can waste time. You can waste time by thinking that something is correct and
*  trying to build on it, or by thinking that you have a strategy for attacking a problem that turns out
*  not to pay off. You can waste time by playing video games or watching TV or whatever. I'm going
*  to count playing video games or watching TV or eating a good meal as important self-care parts
*  of the routine, so that's not wasting time. The thing about the intellectual wasting time is you
*  don't know it ahead of time. You don't know what kind of directions are going to pay off. You can
*  be a really great scientist and just have some sixth sense about what is going to get you in
*  the right direction. Some people seem to have a real genius for choosing good problems and good
*  strategies, but no one is perfect. No one gets it right all the time. I don't have that much trouble
*  living with the idea that the observable part of progress is highly sporadic and non-linear and
*  non-predictable. You're working, you're working, you're working. It looks like nothing's getting
*  done and then you make a breakthrough, but really all that previous work was necessary to get to the
*  breakthrough. Even if sometimes the time is wasted, I don't know it ahead of time, so I'm not sad
*  about doing that. I just take that as part of the job. Jim Murphy says, do you have any cute stories
*  about meeting your wife or maybe one of your first dates? Yeah, we have a really cute story about
*  meeting. It was back in 2006, I want to say. Yeah, it was 2006. I was living in Chicago, but I was
*  already sort of knowing that I was going to be moving to Los Angeles. Jennifer was living in
*  Washington, DC as a freelance writer, part-time working for the American Physical Society, writing
*  for them. She had just come out with her first book, Black Bodies and Quantum Cats. It's a great
*  book that I can recommend you check out. If you think back then, 2006, this was still the early
*  days of the modern social media landscape. There was no Twitter, Facebook, et cetera, but there were
*  blogs. Remember blogs? I still have one. Occasionally contribute to it. I will tell you this,
*  my publisher for my new book, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe, Full of Equations, did ask in a
*  somewhat embarrassed tone of voice, are you on TikTok? The kids today like TikTok and they were
*  wondering whether or not there's anything I can do on TikTok to advertise this book. That's what
*  you would get today. The answer is no, I'm not really on TikTok and I don't think that it would
*  help with this book. We'll see. Maybe I'll have a genius idea. At the time in 2006, if you wrote a
*  new book, especially as a brand new author, you'd be told to start a blog. Jennifer started a blog
*  that was Cocktail Party Physics. I think the website still exists and you can check out all
*  the old blog posts. Again, back then, there weren't that many blogs, especially physics blogs. In
*  particular, there was a very small number of them. Single digits, maybe it was double digits by them,
*  but it was not a large number. We were a tight knit group and I emailed her saying,
*  welcome to the blogosphere. Here's some other blogs to check out, some tips, et cetera, et cetera.
*  We emailed back and forth and realized we were going to be at the same physics conference in a
*  couple of weeks. We arranged to meet up and that was that. Now we're married. I'm going to skip
*  some details in between, but that is how we met through our blogs, through reading each other's
*  blogs. When we did get married, our marriage was announced in nature. There was a little
*  blurb in the beginning of the pages of nature saying, two physics bloggers get married.
*  That's cute, right? I think it's cute. I have different opinions about what is cute than other
*  people. Cooper says, do you agree with the idea that if we find life on Europa or Enceladus,
*  I always say Enceladus, but it's Enceladus, then Bayesian reasoning would conclude that life is
*  highly likely to be found in most star systems. Not precisely, Cooper, you know better than that
*  because Bayesian reasoning has two parts. It has priors and it has likelihood functions. When you
*  get new data, like there's life on Europa or Enceladus, then you use the likelihood function.
*  What is the probability that life would exist on Europa if life were everywhere versus if life
*  were nowhere? Then you multiply it by the prior, right? Surely, if you find life somewhere in the
*  solar system, the likelihood of finding that is way bigger in a world where life is ubiquitous
*  than in a world where life is rare, or I should say universe or a galaxy where life is rare.
*  Absolutely, your credence that life should be frequent in the universe should go up substantially.
*  But what was it before? What was it before you had that measurement? If you had a prior,
*  that the probability that life was ubiquitous in the universe is 10 to the minus 100,
*  then finding life on Europa is not going to change that by that much. Now, I don't have a prior that
*  is nearly that tiny. So in practice, I think that finding life on Europa or Enceladus does give us
*  very good reason to believe that life is, maybe not most star systems, but life is frequent in
*  the star systems that have reasonable kind of planets. That would be given my priors,
*  that would be my conclusion. But I can't blame just Bayesian reasoning on that or give credit
*  to Bayesian reasoning. I have to tell you what my priors are to draw that conclusion.
*  John Shoning also asks a Bayesian question. To be a good informal Bayesian in life, is it possible
*  to replace choosing a prior with another Bayesian subproblem, pushing the choice of
*  prior further up the stack until you reach a point closer to the edge of the system?
*  Roughly, I think no is the right answer. You can sort of trick yourself into thinking that. You can
*  fake it. But really, when people talk about priors, they talk about your current credences. That's
*  really what you mean. What is a prior? You're not the born. You're not conceived. You're not a little
*  fetus having credences for different propositions about factual statements about the world. You
*  develop them over time. But we're not really talking about development in time. We're talking
*  about intellectual development. But the point is, priors are starting points. They're not finishing
*  points. You can argue for them. But when you're arguing for them, really what you're doing is
*  relating one prior to another. You're saying, is that really is the prior you claim? Let's say I
*  have a prior that life in the galaxy is very, very, very rare. But I also claim I have a prior
*  that the chemistry on different planets is all the same as the chemistry in the solar system.
*  And there are a huge number of planets. And that, given the chemistry of life on a planet,
*  it's pretty easy to make life. That's an inconsistent set of priors. And therefore,
*  I can change my priors because I'm not being internally coherent. But I'm just at some point
*  allowed to pick whatever I want. I think that the goal of justifying priors in some absolute
*  foundational sense is not the right goal to have. We human beings are not disembodied logical
*  reasoners. We're part of the world. We have pictures of what makes sense to us and what doesn't
*  make sense to us. And that's where we get our priors from. And that's okay. That's not a mistake.
*  That's not a bug. It's a feature of how the system works. Russ Dill says, in your podcast with Michael
*  Dine, there was a brief discussion of ruling out physics that predicts the universe would decay to
*  a lower energy state with some reasonable probability. Is vacuum decay actually a problem
*  with respect to the many worlds interpretation? Wouldn't we just be able to ignore any branches
*  of the wave function where vacuum decay occurs so long as there's a non-zero probability that
*  branches still exist where it has not occurred? So this is just, I mean, maybe you know this Russ,
*  but this is just the quantum suicide experiment, right? You're asking yourself if I have some
*  quantum event which is set up in such a way that on one branch of the wave function, I instantly die
*  painlessly, not knowing even what happened on the other branch of the function I continue to live.
*  That is literally an implementation of this vacuum decay scenario. And there's an argument that says,
*  look, on the branches where you don't exist, you don't care. You have no feelings. You're not sad.
*  You're gone. The only caring that is involved with you is on the branches where you exist.
*  And therefore, why is this bad? Why should you feel bad about this? But you kind of should be
*  suspicious about these words from the start because already you've made a huge classic mistake
*  in many worlds analysis. You're talking about you as if you exist on more than one branch at once.
*  You're saying there's the you on this branch, the you on the other branch. Those are separate people.
*  It's not that there's a you that exists and a you that doesn't exist. It's that there's a person
*  who has lived and a person who has died. Okay, those persons are both sharing a past you. That
*  is a feature of that is different in ever ready in logic than in the usual single world way of
*  thinking about the world. But they're different people. They're like identical twins. Okay,
*  no one ever says it's okay if I killed this one identical twin because they still have the other
*  identical twins living. They're different people. It's exactly the same for these kind of quantum
*  suicide vacuum decay experiments. The point is that right now I have value in continuing to exist.
*  I would be sad now if I thought that I was going to die in a minute even if that death was completely
*  painless and even if after death I didn't feel anything. I'm sad now about that future prospect
*  and my claim is you should be sad in exactly the same way if your quantum descendants on all the
*  different branches of the wave function are going to die. Exactly that amount of sadness.
*  Maybe not the same sadness as if all of them are going to die but there's still some sadness there.
*  So I think it does matter. I don't think you just ignore the branches on which you don't exist any
*  more than you ignore a future in which you don't exist. Which after all if you go far enough in the
*  future is all the futures. You will not exist in them. Josh Bauer asks on what basis does one
*  choose a meta ethical framework? In the vein of can't get an odd from an is, logic is out and
*  it seems like the only foundation comes down to personal preference. But if that's the case why do
*  philosophers debate moral frameworks? Is it my preference is better than your preference not just
*  begging the question of what better means? Sorry is my preference is better than your preference
*  not just begging the question of what better means? And is there any hope of finding a framework that
*  can be agreed upon across culture if it's all down to preference? So I think that again my analysis
*  of how you should build a moral framework is more or less what people actually do. The statement is
*  that there's no claim that is very effectual to the point of saying my preference is better than
*  your preference without as you say knowing what better means. But you can say here's what my
*  preference is and there's two things two places to go from there. One is as we said earlier
*  preferences are often not internally coherent okay. So there's the whole process of taking a
*  list of preferences each of which seems perfectly plausible and systematizing them and saying okay
*  what is the general principle from which these preferences might grow? That's how you get things
*  like utilitarianism or deontology or virtue ethics. It depends on what your preferences are. You can
*  actually land on an ethical system that says my preference is the most happiness for the most
*  people. And then you try to say look what does that mean right? What does what does happiness mean? How
*  do I add it up? How do I make it the most? What kind of people count? All those complicated questions
*  come out of that. And then the other aspect is you talk to people. You realize you're not the only
*  person in the world. Maybe other people's preferences are different and there's two things. One is that
*  you can shape each other's preferences. You can give a sales pitch saying look if you think that
*  that's important you should also think this is important right? That actually happens in the
*  world. That is not some weird mistake. That is how things work. And the other thing is you can
*  disagree. There could be people who will just fundamentally disagree and this dream of imagining
*  the correct moral framework in which everyone agrees that it's right and obeys it is entirely
*  implausible in my point of view. That's why I think it's very important to have political
*  social structures that allow for disagreement. Where people can accept that they disagree on
*  some things, agree to agree on other things, and on the basis of what they agree on build a society
*  in which they can work with people in which they disagree about some things. Sometimes the disagreements
*  will be so large that you can't live with them and that's when you throw them in jail or go to war
*  or run away or whatever it is you have to do. Again as you see from all the examples these are
*  all things that really do happen in the world. It's not just some hopeless mess. It's how life
*  is lived and what I'm really advocating is not a change in how life is lived but an acknowledgement
*  and that that's how life is lived rather than inventing false goals of having perfect agreement,
*  perfect foundational establishment of the moral rules or whatever you might hope to get.
*  Oleg Rovinsky says if you had to pick a philosopher living or otherwise to have a long
*  conversation with who would that be and why? So I'm not sure what to say about this. So the
*  answer is I don't know. That's a short answer. I don't know. I don't have an answer to this.
*  The reason why I chose to answer the question, I'm trying to do this without dismissing the question,
*  but I want to indicate that this is not my kind of question to which I have good answers. Okay and
*  maybe it's interesting why I don't have good answers to this question. The cheap and easy way
*  to say it is that I don't like heroes. I don't like hero worship and I know that you didn't
*  mention here. I'm not trying to pick on you here Oleg, but the kind of idea that there are great
*  people, great men, great women, whatever who you would really like to talk to that would change
*  your life. I just don't like that whole idea. I like ideas, right? I think that of the people
*  I've known there have been really good ideas that a lot of different people have had. Now of course
*  some people seem to be better at having good ideas than others. There is no rule that says that all
*  people are equally interesting or good to talk to, but the point is I just don't conceptualize what
*  I want to do as I would love to talk to this person. That's just not my goal in life. I would
*  love to talk about these ideas with people who are interested in it and have interesting things to say
*  about it and that'll be different for all sorts of ideas. So I'm sort of wimping out of answering
*  the question, but I'm trying to explain why I'm wimping out. I just don't have a list of people
*  who I really like to talk to. I'm reminded of the story which might be completely
*  anecdotal or even completely fake, but apparently Marcel Proust, the great French writer, and James
*  Joyce, the great Irish writer, once shared a cab where they shared a ride anyway and there was
*  someone else in the cab and the other person, the onlooker, was asked like, what did they
*  talk about, the great minds? And the answer was they were silent the whole ride. They didn't have
*  anything to say to each other. Just because a person has great ideas or is accomplished or moral
*  or whatever doesn't mean they're a great person to talk to always and vice versa. There can be
*  charming conversationalists who are not necessarily going to be building the next great
*  scientific theory or technological advance. So I'm just a pluralist about ideas and experiences
*  and people and all those things and I know that even some of the smartest and best people in the
*  world have their flaws. So again, I'm not so silly as to think that I want to talk to every person
*  equally, but I don't have a list of top five that I would really just be dying to talk to. Sorry.
*  G Clune says, I watched a video with you on the Institute of Art and Ideas player in a discussion
*  with Roger Penrose where you said, there are people in our past who think we are in their past. The
*  time runs in the opposite direction for them as it does for us. Could you elaborate more on that
*  idea? It's very difficult to wrap one's head around this concept. I'm not going to say too
*  much about it because I think it's some people here listening have heard me talk about it a lot,
*  but it's the whole subject of my book from eternity to here. If you want to dig deeper,
*  dig that far into it. The crucial thing is two crucial things. One is that I think that the arrow
*  of time, which defines the difference between past and future is entirely down to entropy increasing
*  over time. Entropy used to be lower in the past will be higher in the future. And within our
*  observable universe, entropy has just been increasing. So everyone in our observable universe
*  agrees on the same direction of time. The second thing is there could be more to life than the
*  observable universe. And so this is an outgrowth of a model that I proposed with Jennifer Chen back
*  in 2004, a cosmology model where there are baby universes. So there's individual small pockets of
*  universe, small compared to the whole thing, they're still very, very big, pockets of universe that
*  have a low entropy end and a high entropy end. And the collection of all of these takes the form of
*  there's a moment of time where the entropy is as low as it ever gets. It doesn't mean it's low.
*  That's the great thing about our model. It doesn't mean it's low. It's just lower than it is at other
*  times. Okay, it's a relative measure. And on one side of time, you have these baby universes being
*  created with low entropy and then increasing in entropy away from that middle moment. And on the
*  other side of time, you also have baby universes being created with low entropy and growing with
*  entropy in the direction away from that middle moment. So there's a crossover moment in which
*  the arrow time goes away from it in both directions. So therefore, oppositely oriented
*  on different sides of that moment. If you hear noises in the background, I have a big box
*  that Caliban just jumped into. So there's a kitty running around the box. The thing is Caliban,
*  let me check. Oh, I was wrong. It's Ariel. She's jumping around in the box. Caliban is more the
*  box jumper. But two kitties, you never know. Anyway, I hope that explained that. The point
*  is the thing that saves you from any conceptual worries here is that the people for whom we are
*  in their past are not only really, really, really, really far in our past, but so far that there's no
*  connection. There's no communication. There's no way of talking to them that would get you in trouble.
*  Okay. Franklin Merrick says, I would love to know how your thoughts on the cosmic censorship
*  hypothesis. I would love to know your thoughts on the cosmic censorship and hypothesis and naked
*  singularities. Do you think there is a way to get a black hole super-extremal? You know, roughly
*  speaking, no. So the cosmic censorship hypothesis, which goes back to former Mindscape guest Roger
*  Penrose, although he invented it long before he was on the podcast, basically says that there are
*  singularities in nature, but they're hidden behind event horizons. That's what we think is true for
*  ordinary black holes, right? And as far as we know from numerical simulations and analytic investigations
*  of gender relativity, this is almost true, but not quite. So you can actually show there was great
*  work done by Matthew Choptowick, for example, that if you pick your initial conditions with
*  infinitely precise specification of where you start, you can get a naked singularity. Strictly
*  speaking, by the rules of the game, the cosmic censorship conjecture is not true. And so I think,
*  I'm not going to remember the details of this, but you know, Kip Thorne has a bunch of bets with
*  Stephen Hawking and other people. And I think that one of their bets was about cosmic censorship. And
*  I think that I forget who was on what side, but they conceded the bet anyway, because of this work
*  by Choptowick. I think Hawking conceded the bet. I think he was wrong about this one.
*  But I kind of am not that invested in this particular result, because I don't think the
*  classical gender relativity is the right theory of the world, right? The world is quantum mechanical.
*  And I think that there's a whole way of thinking about classical gender relativity that pretends
*  the classical gender relativity is right and takes it to its extremes and ask what happens in these
*  incredibly dramatic situations. Whereas I think that in nature, once you get to these incredibly
*  dramatic situations, classical gender relativity isn't going to be right in a big way. So the
*  very vocabulary we use to talk about it, singularities, horizons, this is just not going
*  to make sense, not going to really apply. That's my actual feeling about cosmic censorship.
*  Bits plus Adams says, Brian Green tweeted, when you cross over to the edge of a black hole,
*  space and time interchange their roles. You are drawn toward the black hole center,
*  with the same inevitability as you are drawn to the next moment in time. Others have given similar
*  descriptions. Since space doesn't have an arrow, this is the question, and space is taking on the
*  role of time, what accounts for the arrow of time in this case? Is it still increasing entropy?
*  Okay, so I have to shatter a few idols here. Brian is a good friend of mine, Brian Green,
*  and he was a former Mindscape guest, and his statement in that tweet is entirely wrong.
*  It's just not true that space and time interchange their roles. I know exactly why he would say that
*  there are coordinates that we put on space-time, and we put them on space-time for good reasons,
*  having to do with the symmetries that exist in space-time, etc., etc. And in the usual
*  coordinate system that we use outside a black hole, you have a radial coordinate that tells you
*  how far away you are from the black hole, and of course you have a time coordinate as well as
*  angular coordinates, and the role of the radial coordinate and the time coordinate switch inside
*  the event horizon. Okay, so what that means is the coordinate r, the distance from the black hole,
*  the radial distance, the distance in the straight line from the center, is what we call a space-like
*  coordinate outside the event horizon. You move along r, you change your position in space, not
*  in time, whereas the t coordinate, the time coordinate, is a time coordinate. Those same
*  coordinates exist and can be discussed inside the black hole. By the way, I have a book coming out
*  that explains this in great detail. This is all explained in the Biggest Ideas. Inside the event
*  horizon, the r coordinate moves in a time-like direction, and the t coordinate moves in a
*  space-like direction. So that's why people say space and time interchange their roles, but they
*  didn't. What changed their roles was space and time coordinates, but who cares? Coordinates are made
*  up by human beings. They're not out there written in space-time. You don't bump into r and t. Those
*  are just a way that you use to describe it. You could, and very often do, use better coordinates,
*  in which case it's not true that they switch their identities at all. So what follows from that is
*  that the following statement, you are drawn toward the black hole center with the same inevitability
*  as you're drawn to the next moment in time. Not also, I mean, that's closer to being accurate,
*  but still not accurate, because what you're drawn to is r equals zero, the radial coordinate equals
*  zero. That's where the singularity is. But the point is, it's not the center of the black hole.
*  It's just not. It's a moment in the future. We know what a center is. It's a location in space
*  at the middle of some spheres, right? That is not what r equals zero is. It's not a location in space.
*  It is a moment in time, because now r is a time-like coordinate. So the point of the tweet is correct.
*  The point is, once you are inside the black hole, you are drawn toward the singularity with the same
*  inevitability as you move toward the future. But the words in which it's particularly expressed
*  there, I just completely disagree with as a correct way to think about what general relativity
*  is really saying. And so for the arrow of time, time is just time. It doesn't matter what coordinates
*  you use. And yes, it is still due to increasing entropy. Alex B says, if you were placed in the
*  plot of a scary ghost movie, how long would you make it before updating your prior to ghosts being
*  real? This is an excellent question. I know that it sounds like a silly question, but I think it's
*  a really important question. If you want to be a fair, legitimate, rigorously thinking,
*  Bayesian naturalist who doesn't believe in ghosts, you have to say, okay, what is the evidence
*  that would take for me before I started believing in ghosts? And it would be pretty far,
*  let's put it this way. I think it'd be pretty far now compared to what it would have been a thousand
*  years ago, both because our knowledge of the physical world was not as good back then,
*  and therefore it was much more reasonable to believe in ghosts, but also because we have
*  experience now with magicians, with illusionists, with fakers, right? And so we know that there's a
*  lot of data, a lot of experiences, a lot of things you could notice that might naively point you in
*  the direction of believing in ghosts that could be easily faked. And you have to take that into
*  consideration. You have to admit that that's a possibility when you're doing these kinds of
*  calculations. But the thing is, if ghosts really existed, it wouldn't be subtle. It wouldn't be
*  hard to notice. It wouldn't be like you heard a bang in a room you thought was empty, or you saw
*  a smudgy reflection in the mirror or something like that. The other ghosts could just come up and say
*  hi, right? Why not? I mean, if they really existed. I think this is a more logical argument in the
*  case of God existing than ghosts, because I don't know what the rules about ghosts are.
*  But somewhere along those lines, you know, almost no collection of bangs in the night, and things
*  falling over and smudges in the mirror or in photographs would make me change my priors very
*  much. But some very noticeable manifestation of someone who I knew to be dead, who could give a
*  convincing description of who they were and what they knew, and answer some questions about the
*  afterlife, etc. I would be willing to change my priors. I don't know exactly how quickly you would
*  take, but I would get there, I promise. Jimmy Summer says, there seems to be two irreconcilable
*  views of progress that both posit a fundamental difference in how we create knowledge and how it
*  grows. In one view, the differences between our theories of physics in say, 1000 years and 5000
*  years should be relatively similar, assuming, of course, we continue to make steady progress.
*  On the other view, our theories of physics in 1000 years and 5000 years will be radically
*  incomprehensibly different because the growth of knowledge has no cutoff even in any specific field.
*  Which of these two views are you partial to and why? I'm not completely sure I understand the two
*  different scenarios, but I think I have a vague idea. And the short answer is I don't know. You
*  know, I think that it's important to stress two things. And these are two things that I think are
*  just obviously perfectly unmistakably true, yet people like to emphasize one and forget about
*  the other. One thing is we don't know what's going to happen in the future as far as scientific
*  knowledge is concerned. We've lived through a series of revolutions in science that have
*  completely changed our point of view of the world. And so it's completely allowed to imagine that
*  revolutions will continue. And like you say, things are going to be completely different
*  in the future. Like there's no way that you can principally argue sorry, argue in a principled
*  way that that's impossible. Okay, that there can't be huge revolutions coming. The other thing that
*  is true is, as I said before, we know a lot more about the fundamental nature of reality now than
*  we did 500 years ago. Maybe we're close to being done. That is absolutely a possibility.
*  Scientific progress doesn't have momentum. It's not like well, we've had a bunch of revolutions
*  in the last 500 years. Therefore ergo, you will have a bunch of revolutions in the next 1000 years
*  or the next 500. We don't know it's possible. You're literally asking a question about something that
*  is precisely what's impossible to know. Because if we knew the answer to that, we'd be much closer
*  to just doing it today rather than 1000 years from now. If I don't know what the revolution is
*  going to be, I can't tell you how likely it is that it's going to happen. So I'm kind of wishy
*  washy on this one. I think we should just absolutely keep an open mind. I know a lot of people like to
*  argue on the basis of history or logic or whatever that either things are almost done or they're
*  nowhere near done. I have no idea. And of course, this is something where I am always misunderstood
*  because I make the point that the laws of physics underlying everyday life are completely known in
*  terms of the core theory. People because people have short attention spans and have difficulty
*  having ideas stick in their minds. They think I'm saying we're close to understanding everything,
*  which is explicitly what I'm not saying. And I try very hard to make the difference clear. People
*  don't want to hear the difference. So that's why I'm completely happy to say I have no idea
*  whether or not we will have revolutions in our fundamental understanding of reality. But 1000
*  or 5000 years from now, there will still be atoms, we will still believe in the electric magnetic
*  force, and in electrons and protons and neutrons evolving according to the core theory. Nick G says,
*  What's your take on Gerard de Tuft and Susskind's holographic principle as a solution to the
*  information paradox? I just read Susskind's black hole wars and wondering if there's any dissenting
*  opinion among physicists. Well, I think it's a crucially important insight. You know, maybe not
*  everyone agrees. But I think that the standard view among working theoretical physicists these
*  days is that holography, the idea that what's happening in a black hole can be represented
*  by information spread across the boundary of the black hole across the event horizon,
*  is both true and important. I think that's the consensus. It's not maybe consensus is too strong.
*  I think that's the most common view. Okay, there's absolutely some dissent there always is dissent.
*  Physicists love them. They love the dissent. And I love them for it. It's not by itself a solution
*  to the information paradox. There had been over the last, let's say, five years, a couple of times
*  when people have claimed to have solutions to the information paradox. And I think that some of them
*  represent genuine progress, genuine, you know, new ways of thinking that might very well be helpful.
*  Here on the podcast, we talked to Neda Anklehart, who's one of the leaders in this field, and she
*  and her colleagues have have done absolutely important work that sheds light on how information
*  might come out of black holes. But as she said, as I said, we're not done yet. It's not the solution.
*  We're not there. Okay. So I think it's an important step along the way. It's insight.
*  And it's not the final answer. That would be my opinion. Derek Bain says, now you'll be coming
*  to Hopkins moving to Baltimore. Will there be lots of speaking events and the like open to the
*  public here that other philosophically inclined Baltimoreans with an amateur's interest in physics
*  will be able to attend? I suspect yes. I suspect that's the answer. You know, there are I mean,
*  Johns Hopkins has a pretty vibrant community interest in interested in science and communication
*  and outreach. Okay. The you know, the science, science is a big part of the university,
*  science, engineering, medicine, as I said, but there's also humanities departments and
*  writing departments, etc. Humanities institutes, there's a lot of social science things going on.
*  So it is a very rich source of things like that. So I cannot say exactly what they will be,
*  but I predict that they will exist. There you go. Nick Sablevada says, Do you have any advice for
*  aspiring students of physics? I feel it's self doubt can become a hindrance on one's ability to
*  learn the material, especially if the foundations of math aren't there to support them. Do you
*  have any habits while you were an undergraduate that helped you focus on your goal? These are,
*  again, really important questions to which my own ability to give advice is very limited, I think,
*  in part because it's one thing to do it, you know, I made it through graduate school became a
*  professor, etc. It's a completely different thing to be able to say what you did. There's plenty
*  people who are good at basketball who couldn't coach basketball to save their lives. And so I
*  don't know whether or not I could articulate what was important along the way, some things that I
*  did, some things I didn't. And the other reason is because everyone's different, right? So the
*  things that work for me might not work for you. I don't think that self doubt was one of my biggest
*  obstacles. I had obstacles. In fact, if anything, my obstacle was I used to think, Oh, everything
*  will be fine. And that was my obstacle. Maybe I should have had a little bit more self doubt.
*  But it's not but that's not the right way to spin it. The right way to spin it is not doubt
*  versus confidence. But I do think that it's crucially important to constantly be aware
*  of what you're doing and why you're doing it. Right? It can be easy, you know, academia for
*  better for worse, you know, think about academia versus becoming a musician, right? Yeah, there's
*  there's similarities. There's many more people who want to be professional musicians than can be just
*  like there are many more people who want to be professors who can be. There's a lot of knowledge
*  and work you need to do. There's a good amount of luck you need to succeed along the way.
*  But academia has a more or less structured way of doing that success, right? You go to undergraduate,
*  you go to graduate school, postdoc, junior faculty, senior faculty, whereas being a musician,
*  you can toil away for years and then be an overnight success. Many overnight successes
*  toil for years and years to get there, but it's much less predictable. It's much harder to know
*  what the next step should be in order to succeed. In academia, you very often know what sort of
*  you're expected to do next. Expected to write a PhD thesis, defend it, get a postdoc, write papers.
*  The expectations are pretty clear. And actually, that can stifle creativity a little bit, right?
*  You can have your mind focus on that next step to the detriment of thinking about the longer term.
*  Am I working on the right projects? Am I in the right place? How should I maximize my opportunities
*  going forward when I take the next step, etc.? So that was my flaw, that I was too focused on the
*  next year, not on the next 20 years. And again, I thought I would continually think that it'll be
*  fine. If I'm blaming myself for not getting tenure at Chicago, it's because I thought, look,
*  I'm doing great. I'm writing all these papers. They're cited. I've had a lot of students.
*  The idea that they would not give me tenure like literally never occurred to me as a serious thing
*  to worry about. I had plenty of friends who were assistant professors at the time who were just
*  fretting about getting tenure. And I just didn't. I'm like, they'll recognize that I should be
*  tenure. And I was totally wrong, because I was not very smart. But of course, that's not, you know,
*  there's absolute reality to the worry about self-doubt, right? There are other people,
*  I've known people who are brilliant, who are great at doing science, and who didn't seem to
*  know it themselves. Students of my own who I've had to say, Oh, no, you'll be great. Like, I worry
*  that I don't say that enough to my students, because to me, it's obvious they're great.
*  The ones who are great, most of them, maybe all of them. But maybe they don't say it enough,
*  because to me, it's obvious. And I have a standard for comparison that they don't. So,
*  sorry, I don't have good advice for dealing with the self-doubt other than,
*  you know, I tend to think that self-doubt itself is not the target. Right? Like, in other words,
*  if you're trying to say, how do I deal with self-doubt, the cheap answer, which is, which
*  I suspect has some correctness to it is, do awesome things, and your self-doubt will go away.
*  Right? You know, be, you know, really put whatever abilities you have into succeeding. You know,
*  like, again, I've known a lot of people, graduate student level, who thought, like,
*  if only they could be introduced to the famous professors at conferences, then they would be
*  fine. I have to tell them, like, it doesn't do any good to be introduced to the famous professors,
*  if they say, So what are you working on? What do you do? And you don't have a good answer.
*  You got to have the stuff, you got to have the accomplishments. And those accomplishments might
*  be, you know, passing your qualifying exams, or getting a good grade, or even just coming to
*  understand something difficult in physics. But that's got to be your focus. And I tend to think
*  that the other things will come along with it, not painlessly, not without work. But once you keep
*  doing good things, you'll eventually say, Huh, yeah, maybe I can do this. Maybe I'm pretty good
*  at this after all. It's doing the good things that has to come first. Bruno Texera says, I really like
*  the podcast with Dr. Sherry Turkle. You asked her something about chat bots to keep company,
*  keep people company. And her answer was something like, totally wrong. That's a job for people.
*  I get her point. But I would like to, I would like your take on my more utilitarian view. Why not
*  both? People will continue to be selfish, sons and grandsons will continue to forget about their
*  elderly, etc. While we struggle to make the world more humane, can't we in parallel try to help
*  people in some other less than perfect way? So I am inclined to be on your side, Bruno, in this
*  point, like, why not both, right? Like, if there is a chat bot that helps someone feel wanted or
*  loved, or whatever, why not? If the alternative is not having that, and they don't feel love,
*  that doesn't, from a utilitarian perspective, if you want to be utilitarian about this, that doesn't
*  seem like the way to go. Let me just put and I'm not going to conclude with any definitive statement
*  here. But let me put two other thoughts into your mind. One is, it can certainly be easy to say,
*  oh, we're just helping a little bit, it's better than the alternative. And use that as an excuse
*  to not do something really better, right? To, to say, well, you know, we can't do everything
*  perfectly. So we'll give them a chat bot, we can't give them a real human being who cares about them,
*  so they can talk to the computer, and kind of use that either explicitly or implicitly, as a reason
*  not to do something more meaningful with a real human being that loves them in some way. Okay, so
*  I think as a practical matter, you cannot get around the idea that that's a possible failure
*  mode in that particular way of thinking. And the other aspect is, even if it works in some sense to
*  let, you know, an elderly person or, you know, someone who doesn't have a lot of friends,
*  or whatever it is, to feel human connection by talking to a chat bot, I think the cherries point
*  is, it's not human connection. It's just not right, it's fake. And so even if again, in a utilitarian
*  way, you're giving them some momentary pleasure, you're not giving them what they think they need
*  to get that pleasure, it's kind of fake pleasure. This is not a perfect analogy. But you know,
*  imagine the classic science fiction example of a happiness drug, we have, we have drugs that are
*  pretty close to that, right? There's a drug that you can take years happy all the time. If you
*  thought that the goal of life was to be happy all the time, maybe just take that drug and sit in your
*  chair and waste away and die, but you're happy all the time, right? There's something in that,
*  that is unsatisfying to us, even if we started by agreeing that we just want to be happy all the
*  time, there's something that is not genuine about it. And so I think an argument can be made. And
*  again, I don't know how far to push the argument. But I think an argument can be made that even if
*  a chatbot does a really good job of cheering someone up, it's not a replacement for an equally
*  good job and a precisely equally good job done by a real person. There's something genuine about it.
*  And again, I would love to articulate that in a more complete way. But I'm just gonna put the
*  idea into your head that maybe that is something to take seriously in this discussion. Preston
*  Justice says, you've done a wonderful job explaining the Schrodinger equation. I particularly enjoyed
*  the Socratic dialogue in chapter eight of something deeply hidden. Well, by the way,
*  thank you for saying that Preston is interesting. The dialogue in chapter eight was an experiment.
*  And my publisher was willing to let me do it, but was a little bit skeptical. And I think that some
*  people loved it. And some people hated it, which is more or less, I guess, what I should have
*  expected. But I'm thankful to the people who loved it. Because of your well articulated explanations,
*  I'm about 70 20 on the side of many worlds interpretation. And you say I'm a good Bayesian,
*  but I think a good Bayesian should have credences that add up to 100 and maybe mean 70 30. I fear I
*  can't truly take sides or understand the theories to the greatest extent possible without the math.
*  And when I look at the equation, I'm completely lost. Could you briefly outline the steps for
*  understanding the equation mathematically, the prerequisite courses, and how much can someone
*  really understand these theories, such as many worlds without the math? You know, I think you
*  can understand them without the math. But it's not this there's two things happen when you don't have
*  the math. One is you're not going to understand it as well. I do think you can get the point. But
*  because you're learning it through words and analogies and things like that, the sort of
*  penumbra of the point is harder to get, right? All the implications of the point are harder to
*  get. If you knew the math, then you could figure out what the implications of them are. But as long
*  as things are in words, they're going to be fuzzy. And therefore, the further you go away from what
*  you really and truly know, the less confident you're going to be. So that is a problem.
*  I forget whether I just said there are two things I want to say. But let me just say that for the
*  for the moment. But I do think you can understand things at a pretty good level, if there's but
*  you're going to understand points rather than the whole landscape, if you know what I mean.
*  Second thing is that I am writing a book. So the book that is coming out in September,
*  the biggest ideas in the universe is just the classical stuff. Okay, so Hamiltonian mechanics
*  in there, black holes are in there, general relativity, but no quantum stuff. That will be
*  the second volume, which will hopefully come out next year. But we did do the videos, you can check
*  out my videos where I do the math, starting from not doing the math, right? It's for people who
*  don't know the math ahead of time. It's hard. It's hard to follow without knowing the math ahead of
*  time. But I try to teach you calculus and complex numbers and things like that up to the Schrodinger
*  equation. You don't get very far into the Schrodinger equation, solving it and things like
*  that, because that requires more time. But the videos are there if you're interested.
*  For your actual question, briefly outlining the steps. Well, you need calculus, all the calculus
*  you can get. So integrals and derivatives are what are important in calculus. For quantum mechanics,
*  there's two other things and sorry integrals and derivatives, but also differential equations,
*  that's crucially important. So an equation that does not just say the derivative equals a number,
*  but derivatives of some functions are equal to other functions of other things and other
*  derivatives. And that's the whole field of differential equations, crucially important
*  to understanding quantum mechanics. And two other things crucial for quantum mechanics. One is
*  complex numbers, complex variables, the wave function itself is complex. There you go. And
*  the second thing is linear algebra, which is the theory of matrices and diagonalizing them and
*  finding eigenvalues all over the place. I mean, literally the name of Schrodinger's paper where
*  he invented the Schrodinger equation is quantum mechanics as an eigenvalue problem. The word
*  eigenvalue appears in linear algebra, the theory of matrices. Okay. And Heisenberg's version of
*  quantum mechanics was matrix mechanics. You need to know matrices and you can learn all those things.
*  Those are all things that typical math or physics students learn their first or second year of
*  undergrad. So it's not like it's very, very, very far away if you want to dive in.
*  Justin Wolcott says priority question, how can libertarian free will exist if all events,
*  including the thoughts and actions of gods are either deterministic or random?
*  That's an easy one. They can't. In that case, libertarian free will, the word libertarian is
*  very important here. It means that it is not reducible to the laws of physics. So somehow
*  agents have to violate the laws of physics. So there are not laws, either deterministic or random,
*  that tell you what's going to happen. That's it. I don't believe in libertarian free will.
*  I'm a compatibilist about determinism and free will. So I believe in both deterministic laws
*  and free will at the level of an emergent higher level description. Jeff B says last AMA you
*  mentioned something about different branches of the wave function potentially having different
*  laws of physics. If that's the case, is there a mechanism by which the branches could develop
*  new laws? What were the original laws at the Big Bang? So we don't know. I mean, this is all
*  speculative stuff. Okay, the short answer is that we don't know. I'm actually thinking about it,
*  though. You know, quantum mechanics, cosmology, these are things that don't go well together,
*  but we can sort of speculate on the basis of we know a lot about individually,
*  quantum mechanics and cosmology. So one thing, you know, I wrote a paper last year with Jackie
*  Laudman, who was an undergraduate at Caltech on energy, non conservation in quantum mechanics,
*  the idea being that a measurement could change the average energy of the branch of the wave
*  function you're on. And I think that people will debate about the words, the meaning of the word
*  energy and whatever. But I think the physics that we describe in that paper is rock solid. It's
*  baby quantum mechanics. There's not a lot there to disagree with. But what it implies from the many
*  worlds perspective, is that if you can think about the wave function of the universe as a
*  superposition of different kinds of states, right, that's what quantum mechanics says.
*  And what happens as time goes on is that you narrow down what parts of the wave function are
*  contributing to the superposition you're on. That's why the energy can change because you're not
*  participating in all of the previous states, you're sort of, well, there were a lot of
*  possibilities added together, but now I picked out one. Okay. I think it's true, and this is far
*  from established, but I think it's true that that can appear as changing the laws, changing the laws
*  that apply on your specific branch of the wave function. So to answer your question, the original
*  laws, or whatever laws govern the whole collection of all the branches of the wave function of the
*  universe. And the ones that you observe on any one branch might be a subset and therefore look
*  different than that. So it's not really that the branches are developing new laws, it's that the
*  apparent laws you observe seem to be changing with time because you're sort of participating
*  in less and less of the wave function of the universe. Again, speculative stuff, we don't know
*  if that's what actually happens. Dragon-Sided D says, many of us are still reeling at the loss
*  of friends, coworkers, family members, to what we now understand to be intentional disinformation
*  campaigns. Otherwise fairly normal, seemingly reasonable people have firm beliefs in all matter
*  of easily falsifiable theories about diseases, political events, and so forth. Over the past two
*  years, have you observed this in any people in your social or professional circle? And can you offer
*  any thoughts about ways that civil society can overcome the pandemic of disinformation?
*  Well, it's a crucially important question, and my thoughts are not very strong on this, and in part
*  they're not very strong because I appreciate the difficulty of the social science question that is
*  being asked here. Research in these areas are hard and it's easy, as T Nguyen would remind us, it's
*  easy to fake yourself into clarity to go, oh, this is the reason why people are so susceptible to
*  disinformation. And then the data turned out not to bear that out, but you stick with your previous
*  opinion. We're all susceptible to disinformation depending on our pre-existing prejudices,
*  so I don't like to be very definitive about how to combat these things. I have people in my family
*  friend circle who have been susceptible to this, but not really my close friends or professional
*  circles. No one in the Caltech physics department is falling prey to these conspiracy theories and
*  disinformation that much, or at least I haven't noticed. Of course, we've also been in a pandemic,
*  so maybe I haven't talked to them enough, maybe I don't know. How can civil society overcome it?
*  There's two things, there's sort of like the blunt thing and then there's the more subtle systematic
*  thing. The blunt thing is we have to be good role models, we have to give good information.
*  You know, it's kind of easy and fun to point out people being dumb, but that's not actually very
*  constructive. It doesn't convince them to be right. Even when people are in the grips of some terrible
*  disinformation conspiracy theory, you still got to treat them like a person and make them want to
*  change their minds. You don't make them want to change their minds by berating them and telling
*  them that they're stupid. You have to give them an off-ramp. You have to explain, well, does this
*  thing that you're saying really compatible with this thing? Have you ever thought of the possibility
*  that something else is going on? They have to make the journey themselves and you can guide them and
*  help them, but you can't just say, oh, you're an idiot, please believe me instead. That will never
*  work. The other thing, the more systematic thing is ask why they believe it in the first place.
*  Why would some people fall for these things? Let's take an extreme example. As a basketball fan,
*  I'm well aware that Kyrie Irving, who's one of the best basketball players on the planet,
*  is also a conspiracy theorist, a literal flat earth conspiracy theorist. Didn't take the vaccine
*  for COVID, et cetera. Many people have made fun of him. I don't need to add to that.
*  Instead, let's ask why would any someone who has all the resources in the world, why in the world
*  they believe in the flat earth conspiracy theory? Ask it in a sincere way. Don't ask it just in an
*  eye rolling way like why in the world would that happen? No, really, why would someone believe that?
*  It's not because they actually have been thinking about all the possible scientific evidence and
*  said, okay, in my considered opinion, I think the scientific evidence is better explained by flat
*  earth. That's not why. There are other reasons why. One big factor is maybe the people in the
*  establishment had been telling them that the earth is round, not flat, and the people in the
*  establishment had been telling them a lot of other false bullshit at the same time. Maybe that is what
*  they believe. Maybe they are built to be skeptical of received wisdom. And maybe that's not completely
*  crazy. Maybe they have been lied to, or maybe they've been misled or discriminated against,
*  or whatever. Try to open yourself up to the mental space that these other people have and ask, okay,
*  why would anyone feel that way? Why would they feel like they've been lied to? Is it because
*  they've been lied to? Is it by the good people as well as the bad people, the people we would call
*  good and bad? And ideally, this is just impossible in practice, but the sort of
*  ideal state would be one in which people in our society didn't feel that way. And it's because
*  all people in our society were respected and successful. I think that if we live in a society
*  where people were educated and not discriminated against and were told the truth by the establishment,
*  etc., etc., susceptibility to crazy conspiracy theories would be a lot less. It's much
*  harder to achieve that kind of systematic societal change in any easy way, but I think that's where I
*  would ultimately want to go. V. Shannon Klein says, are there questions other than conditions
*  in the singularity at the beginning of the cosmos or conditions inside a black hole that require a
*  theory of quantum gravity? Well, it depends what you mean by require. Again, what questions do
*  you want to ask? Okay, look, my favorite example is the sun, the sun in the sky, depending if it's
*  daytime or nighttime where you are, if there are clouds, but you know what the sun is, right?
*  Well, what is it? What do you mean you know what the sun is? What is the sun? Well, you say it's a
*  collection of plasma, protons and helium and things like that. Well, okay, what are those things? What
*  do they do? Well, one thing is they are a source of gravity, right? The sun creates a gravitational
*  field. It warps the space-time around it, affects the evolution of the Earth's orbit, right? We can
*  all agree on that. That is described in our best scientific understanding by general relativity,
*  the theory of gravity that Einstein gave us. There's another thing the sun does for us. It
*  gives us energy, light coming from the sun. How does that happen? Well, through nuclear fusion,
*  ultimately, fusion of protons via various cycles into heavier elements, which is a completely
*  quantum mechanical process. You cannot describe nuclear fusion without quantum mechanics.
*  So, to understand what the sun is, you need to describe it simultaneously using the language of
*  general relativity and quantum mechanics. But we can't. We can't do that, at least not completely.
*  We can fake our way in to get the right answer, okay, because we know what the right answer is.
*  But we don't have a single principled, fully rigorous theory that describes the sun
*  simultaneously as a source of light and a source of gravity. Now, again, in the regime where it's
*  the weak field limit, et cetera, we can do fine. But a full theory isn't there for that. So,
*  there's very few, I mean, to get to the spirit of your question, there's essentially no conditions
*  that you bump into in your everyday life where you need quantum gravity. But the world is both
*  quantum and gravitational. And I'm a believer that there's a way of describing the world that
*  is correct and complete, and that requires quantum gravity. Vicki Ramsey says, priority question,
*  although it is a true statement that all clocks tick at one second per second, the GPS system and
*  the NIST relativity experiments at Boulder prove that the duration of a clock second can be longer
*  or shorter as compared to that of a comparison clock. In examining the engineering calibration
*  process of GPS atomic clocks, in the frequency and energy proportional, when a clock engineer
*  calibrates an atomic clock, does it require more energy in order to cause the clock to tick faster?
*  I know this is a priority question. I'm going to address it without answering it because I
*  need to unask it because I don't think that the words quite hang together in the right way.
*  First, you say these experiments prove that the duration of a clock second can be longer or
*  shorter as compared to that of a comparison clock. The comparison there is just not an innocent,
*  clear thing because the only time that the clocks move at apparently different rates is when they're
*  in different positions, when they're not located at the same place. So how do you compare them?
*  You need to look at how they are reading things out with light, with photons coming from the clocks
*  to your eyes, and it takes time for the light to come to your eyes. It takes time for light to go
*  from one clock to another. So you're not actually comparing them at the same time, at the same point
*  in points in space time. You're inventing a procedure for comparing them, and the procedure
*  might be good or bad, but there's a reason why I don't like to say that clocks change their rates
*  in a gravitational field because it relies on else extra baggage that I don't want to have to
*  assume. What I can say is that if you start two clocks at the same position in space and time
*  and then move them around and then bring them back, they will not necessarily have measured the same
*  elapsed duration, but that's a different kind of thing. That's more accurate than what you said,
*  but it's not exactly what you're trying to get at because what you're trying to get at is, like you
*  say, frequency and energy are proportional. Frequency is one over time, so therefore does it
*  require more energy? I have to once again say, what do you mean by energy?
*  Energy is not a Lorentz invariant concept. Energy depends on your frame of reference. Just think
*  about a photon going by, right? You can measure the energy of a photon, collect it in your little
*  calorimeter, measure its energy, but then the same photon, had you been moving toward it,
*  would have a shorter frequency and therefore more energy. So there's no fact of the matter
*  about what the energy of the photon is. It depends on your reference frame, and that's true
*  not only for motions, but also for locations in a gravitational field. So that's why I don't like
*  to talk this language. I like to talk a language of what is happening in the reference frame of
*  the thing you're talking about. And in that reference frame, the amount of energy, which is
*  a well-defined quantity now because I told you what reference frame you're in, to make a clock tick
*  is the same for every physical clock made out of the same stuff. That's how I like to say,
*  your mileage may vary for other people. John says, can an electron be coerced to evolve around a
*  positron? And if so, wouldn't this have the same spectrograph as hydrogen? So for the first part,
*  yes, it absolutely can and has been. There's something called positronium, which is an electron
*  and a positron in a bound state with each other. Wouldn't this have the same spectrum as hydrogen?
*  No, because the mass of the proton is very different than the mass of a positron. So
*  therefore, you're going to get a different spectrum. One way of thinking about this is,
*  you know, think about the sun going around the earth, right? If you replace the sun with something
*  the size of the earth, the period of the earth's year would be very different, right? The energy
*  involved, the binding energy between an earth and an earth is very different than the binding energy
*  between the sun and the earth. Likewise, the binding energy between a proton and an electron
*  is different than the binding energy between an electron and a positron. So the spectrum is going
*  to be different. Ken Wolf says, You had a very interesting discussion with Brian Kloss on power
*  and the temptation of corruption. Looking back on your own experience with academia and other
*  organizations, have you reached any conclusions on what aspect of the organization's structure
*  or culture best works to discourage corrupt behavior? So here's the bad news. There's a very,
*  very good question. The bad news is, I think the thing that the most important aspect of making
*  sure a culture discourages corrupt behavior is having non-corrupt people at the top of it.
*  Having the best people, the most influential, important people in the culture be good people.
*  That is not, sadly, a fact about the organization. That's a fact about the people. But if you have
*  bad people at the top, it's just hard for any amount of organizational safeguarding to prevent
*  bad behavior throughout the whole organization. I'm not a social scientist, I should say,
*  and that is my very personal, very non-evidence driven judgment, so I might be wrong about that.
*  But there you go. If you insist on organizational aspects that might help along the way,
*  I kind of would point to transparency. A lot of organizations, certainly universities and
*  university departments, instantly try to protect themselves and cover their asses.
*  When something bad happens, it's like shut down communication, don't talk to anybody,
*  we'll figure it out. This creates a culture of not discussing bad behavior because no one's
*  listening, they can just cover it up, et cetera. I think more transparency, more openness are very
*  helpful, but I don't know how to really achieve that in any systematic way. So there you go.
*  And last question, Tyler Creighton says, if you were offered the opportunity to host a
*  popular science podcast alongside the entertainer of your choice, do you think you'd take it? If so,
*  who would you choose as your co-host? No, I wouldn't take it. Good question, Tyler. I know
*  there are people out there, we have friends, very good friends who do exactly this, host popular
*  science podcasts or shows or give live talks, both a science professor or scientist and an
*  entertainer of some sort. I love the format. I think it's great. It's a wonderful way of
*  making things seem a bit less intimidating, a bit funnier, and especially, crucially important,
*  reeling in the scientists when they get a little too deep into the woods, into the details, right?
*  Some scientists, even the great ones at explaining and being popularly understandable,
*  even the best need some reeling in sometimes. So I get the format. It is not my format.
*  As I said before, I'm in some sense not here for outreach. That's not why I'm doing this right now.
*  Outreach in the sense of taking things we know and explaining them to people,
*  both because I'm interested in learning myself. So my goal here isn't to say things I already know.
*  If I know them, it's much less interesting to me. In the podcast format, my books that I'm writing,
*  the biggest picture, biggest ideas books, that's all pedagogy, that's all outreach,
*  that's all explaining things that we know. I very explicitly in choosing the topics of the book,
*  eliminated the parts that were speculative. I don't talk about
*  bariogenesis much less. I don't even talk about inflation for that matter that much.
*  Super strength theory, quantum gravity, none of that stuff. It's about the well-established stuff.
*  But that's not the podcast thing for me. For me, the joy of the podcast is that number one,
*  I'm learning things as I'm saying, I'm talking to people who I want to learn from.
*  That's crucially important for me. I think that having a co-host who was an entertainer would not
*  help me in doing that. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But I think that I can ask the questions that I
*  want to know the answers to in a more direct way. The other is even more lofty, I'm not sure if it's
*  achieved, but a harder goal that I still am going to cling to is not just me learning new things,
*  but actually generating new ideas, doing real intellectual work. I want the podcast not just
*  to be a recitation of known true things, but an exploration of learning and creating new true
*  things, giving ideas to me and to the guests and to the audience, ways of thinking that weren't
*  previously there, a true intellectual contribution, not just explaining ideas, but generating them.
*  And again, that's not going to be abetted by having an entertainer alongside. So again,
*  I think that the reasons to have an entertainer along with a scientist as podcast hosts make
*  perfect sense for certain goals. Those are not my goals. My goals are to really be out there
*  at the edge. I'm going to be demanding of you folks. I'm going to stretch your brain sometimes.
*  Sometimes it'll be easy and fun, but sometimes it will be a little bit brain twisty. Hopefully,
*  the goal is every single podcast makes you think in a new way. And I think there's only an hour
*  or so. I know that some people have three hour or five hour podcasts, but I have people whose time
*  I respect who I don't want to take that much time. So between one and two hours is about how long I'm
*  going to talk to somebody. It's hard to have a sufficiently efficient conversation in that
*  period of time that you can really gain new knowledge and get to the frontier of ideas and
*  play around with them. And that's what I want to do. So in my incredibly hubristic thought process,
*  I think that I do that better by myself than with an entertainer along my side. So that's my choice.
*  But again, let the ecosystem be diverse. Let everyone do their own thing. Listen to lots
*  of different people. Hero worship goes both ways. I don't worship other people. No one should be
*  worshiping me. Thankfully, that's not the world's biggest problem right now. So I don't need to worry
*  about it too much. But listen to lots of different people. Think about it, draw your own conclusions,
*  get some thoughts. That's why we're here on the Mindscape podcast. Thanks so much for the support
*  of Patreon members who are asking the questions here. I forgot to mention this in the introduction
*  I'm supposed to say. The AMA is funded by Patreon supporters. Thank you very much for all that
*  support. I appreciate it immensely. It keeps us going, keeps the podcast humming along, I think,
*  at pretty high level. I'm very happy with how the podcast is going as we near our 200th official
*  episode. We'll have to do something for that. All right. Thanks very much. Take care. Have a good month. Bye-bye.
