Einstein's theory of general relativity has been our best understanding of gravity for over a century, withstanding a variety of experimental challenges of ever-increasing precision. But we have to be open to the possibility that general relativity -- even at the classical level, aside from any questions of quantum gravity -- isn't the right theory of gravity. Such speculation is motivated by cosmology, where we have a good model of the universe but one with a number of loose ends. Claudia de Rham has been a leader in exploring how gravity could be modified in cosmologically interesting ways, and we discuss the current state of the art as well as future prospects.

Claudia de Rham received her Ph.D. in physics from the University of Cambridge. She is currently a professor of physics and deputy department head at Imperial College, London. She is a Simons Foundation Investigator, winner of the Blavatnik Award, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Her new book is The Beauty of Falling: A Life in Pursuit of Gravity.

# Mindscape 271 | Claudia de Rham on Modifying General Relativity
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZqDJVsRSzg)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  There's a talk that I sometimes give, I've been giving for the last year and a half, I'm sure you can find versions of it online.
*  It's related to volume one, the biggest ideas in the universe where I go through classical mechanics, space-time, all the way up to general relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity.
*  So in the talk, I have the high aspiration of in one hour explaining to you Einstein's equation in all of its specific real glory, the real equation, R mu nu minus one half Rg mu nu equals 8 pi g T mu nu, not just E equals MC squared.
*  That's easy enough. Everyone can understand that.
*  And one of the themes of this talk that I give is the equations are smarter than we are.
*  This is why I think it's worth the effort in a book like the biggest ideas series of talking about the equations.
*  Not that it's the only way to talk about physics, etc.
*  Just because I have some equations in my recent book doesn't mean that I'm suddenly looking down upon people who don't have equations in their books.
*  I think that all different levels, all different approaches are interesting and important.
*  But one of those interesting ones is the equation based one.
*  And the reason why is because, as I said, the equations seem to capture more than we put into them.
*  I mean, Einstein was a smart guy, but his equation implied things that had never occurred to Einstein himself from the expansion of the universe to gravitational waves to black holes.
*  Right. They're right there implied in solutions of the equations.
*  But Einstein himself didn't come up with these ideas.
*  And so it's therefore kind of interesting to imagine changing a theory like general relativity.
*  Einstein had this wonderful theory of gravity that is done better than we ever had any right to expect.
*  Not only does it explain things like the deflection of light and the procession of the perihelion of Mercury,
*  it also works for all these very, very far flung regions of the cosmos where we had no direct empirical evidence about when Einstein was doing his stuff.
*  Having said all that, of course, we don't think that Einstein's theory is the final answer.
*  General relativity, as we know, doesn't play well with quantum mechanics.
*  You can approximate, you can get a pretty good theory of quantum gravity if you're just in weak fields like here in the sun.
*  But when it comes to the interior black holes or the beginning of the universe, quantum mechanics is going to be important.
*  That's what leads people to explore ideas like string theory, where gravity is part of a bigger picture and maybe the whole bigger picture holds together.
*  But if you talk to people who do quantum field theory, they will say the expectation is that general relativity will work well on long-term
*  scales. In field theory, we have a connection between large distances and low energies.
*  Basically, you should expect your field theory to break down at high energies, short distances, but there's no general reason to expect it to break down at long distances or low energies.
*  Here, though, we have a special situation with gravity because we have the whole universe.
*  There's a very, very explicit case where the long distance low energy behavior of the theory is of special interest, let's just put it that way.
*  And also, it kind of fits and makes sense.
*  We have good theories to explain the cosmological observations that we have, but there are some lingering puzzles, most obviously the cosmological constant and the acceleration of the universe.
*  So despite the fact that Einstein's theory is so good, his equations are so smart, and it's been so successful at fitting all the data, it is still worth thinking about ways to modify or change
*  Einstein's general relativity, both at short scales and high distances and at long distances and low energy scales.
*  That's what we're talking about today in the podcast.
*  Claudia de Rham is a theoretical physicist who also has a new book out called The Beauty of Falling, a Life in Pursuit of Gravity.
*  But we theoretical physicists know her as the world's expert in what we call massive gravity.
*  So you know that gravity, once you have a little bit of quantum mechanics in the game, implies the existence of graviton particles, and they can be very, very important.
*  And they're massless.
*  The graviton has zero mass, just like the photon does.
*  What if you imagine giving gravitons a little tiny mass?
*  Is that good? Is it bad? Does it make your life easier? Does it make it harder?
*  What you will find out in the episode is that in fact, it's actually super difficult to do that.
*  In any coherent way, because there's just so many constraints, so many rules you have to play by in quantum field theory.
*  But Claudia and her collaborators have figured out a way to do it.
*  And these days, they are applying their ideas to cosmology to see if maybe we can do even better than Einstein did himself.
*  It's an ambitious kind of thing, but that's why theoretical physicists get paid the big bucks.
*  So let's go.
*  Claudia Duran, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thank you. Hi.
*  So you, of course, do all these fancy things with gravity and field theory.
*  And you're a very, very good
*  But they're all starting with general relativity.
*  And let's imagine that the typical podcast listener has heard of general relativity, but doesn't exactly know the details.
*  In fact, coincidentally, recently on social media, people were arguing about whether or not gravity is a force.
*  So why don't you tell us what you how you think of how you conceptualize what general relativity is trying to do?
*  Yeah, it's amazing because there's a big emphasis in saying that according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity is unlike the other phenomenon and it's not a force.
*  And I guess I like to defer a little bit.
*  And I'm not going to say anything controversial there.
*  So far, maybe for the first five minutes, it's going to be quite standard.
*  But still, we're going to be talking about the general relativity.
*  So far, maybe for the first five minutes, it's going to be quite standard.
*  But still, we can very much think of gravity as a force, I would say, like electromagnetism or the weak force or the other fundamental forces of nature.
*  But it's true that what we typically experience as gravitational attraction, let's say,
*  it's better understood as being the representation, the manifestation, I would say, of the curvature of space time we live in.
*  And so in this sense, it's much more an embedding in where we are,
*  with in mind the fact that if we are living on that space time, if our planet is living on that space time, it has an effect on the curvature of space time.
*  And in turn, this curvature of space time is dictating to us how we should evolve and move in that space time.
*  I think what is quite remarkable about gravity, let me say really about gravity and at the core of everything,
*  and perhaps what is really, really exciting about gravity is that it's entirely,
*  it's really completely equivalent to everybody.
*  It has this equivalence principle, which tells you that it will affect everything, everyone in exactly the same way.
*  So the gravitational pull attraction on different masses, no matter what the masses are,
*  and you can have something as light as light itself if you want to, and it will still have a gravitational effect on them.
*  And so from this equivalence principle, it became clear to Einstein that it had to be something a bit more fundamental than just you have masses,
*  which are sort of the chart with respect to gravity, and they affect, they get affected in this way.
*  It had to be much more internal in some sense, much more related to intrinsically the evolution in space and time
*  and this understanding that it's not just something outside that will act on different masses in different ways,
*  on different charges in different ways, is very much more internal and related to the motion in space and time
*  and therefore related to curvature or how we affect curvature around the space time around ourselves
*  and how this space time curvature affect us in return.
*  So I think that is the standard picture that gravity from that perspective is much more of an embedding,
*  is much more omnipresent than your typical forces, but you still have a force deep down, there is still a force in gravity.
*  And we have observed it. We don't experience it in everyday life.
*  When we think of us falling down, whether I drop, I'm going to drop my pen, or maybe we have the apple falling on Newton's head,
*  and we have things which are even bigger, like the orbit of the planets around the stars,
*  those are all gravitational phenomenon and it's perhaps not exactly what we think as the gravitational force per se,
*  but there is still a gravitational force.
*  Something maybe before we get there is how, one way I like to think about it is if we imagine,
*  try to think of what does gravity feel like? You can wonder what does the question even mean?
*  What does gravity feel like? And I don't know, you don't know, no one knows because gravity is not something
*  we can feel at a given point, we can't, I can tell you, you can't as a human being feel gravity.
*  It's impossible. It's impossible for us because it affects every single cell in a body, every single molecule,
*  every single atom, every single fundamental particle in your body are affected in exactly the same way
*  through this gravitational way we experience the curvature of space time around ourselves.
*  So there's no stretching of any cells apart, there's no e-drum cells which are being pushed apart,
*  there's no chemical reaction in our tongues, there's no light coming in our eyes, there's no pressure on our skin,
*  we can't feel gravity, we can't feel gravity in the same way that we could say we can some sense feel or see light or electromagnetism.
*  It's quite different because every single fundamental particle in a body experiences gravity in exactly the same way
*  so they can't be distinguishing it in any possible way. So that is the typical sense in which gravity affects us
*  and there's no feeling in that sense.
*  Okay, but once you get to my age it certainly feels like you can feel gravity.
*  I can feel the gravity of time, I can definitely feel that.
*  And I can feel the gravity of space as well when I propagate myself and I can feel the gravity of my mass as well sometimes.
*  So I can feel a lot of things related to gravity but the fundamental effect of gravity actually is the gravitational force
*  which you're not going to be able to experience at any given one point.
*  And already if you think of the notion of gravity manifesting itself through curvature, curvature of space-time,
*  that very notion of curvature already requires connecting between different points,
*  requires comparing what happens at a given point and then comparing it with the other points.
*  If you think of you sitting here on Earth, okay, we are both of us, we are in different places on the planet,
*  but myself, I feel around myself is pretty flat and probably you feel the same thing for you.
*  And it's only if we started trying to wave at each other or trying to look at each other or try to look,
*  we both start looking at the stars and comparing what we see,
*  then if we were very clever and if we would be able to see that what we observe is different,
*  so we do comparison between you and me and we see that what is different and from there we should be able to determine
*  that actually the surface of the Earth is curved because we're not seeing the sky in the same way.
*  So we are, our perspective of the sky is rotated with respect to one another.
*  And so there is a curvature on the surface of which we live and we can infer the notion of curvature.
*  So the reason I'm saying that is already the notion of curvature, experiencing curvature
*  and then in some sense experiencing gravity does really require comparing between different points,
*  communicating between different points.
*  There's not such a thing as gravity, there's not such a thing as curvature really locally,
*  it always requires comparing between different points.
*  It's relative, so the name relativity kind of makes sense in this case.
*  That's right, that's right, exactly.
*  It's general relativity, so relative, it's general, it's as general relative.
*  And actually the name does really make sense, it's interesting.
*  Now, still I would back to say that there is a force in gravity,
*  in a very similar way that there is an electromagnetic force.
*  And also just in the same way that fundamentally electromagnetism is a quantum phenomenon
*  and all of the fundamental forces are quantum phenomenon,
*  I would say that gravity also is a quantum phenomenon.
*  And we do understand very, very well that the quantum phenomenon is a quantum phenomenon.
*  And we do understand very, very well how to describe this up to some given extent
*  at the quantum level to describe gravity as a force, as a quantum force up to a given level.
*  Well, let's get into this because that's a provocative statement that you just made
*  and I think that one that I agree with, but it does require some unpacking for people
*  who might have simply heard that we don't know what quantum gravity is, right?
*  And you're not someone who is taking sides about string theory
*  or loop quantum gravity or anything like that,
*  but you are kind of thinking about quantum mechanics and gravity together.
*  So how is that possible?
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  So first, maybe I should say why I think gravity is a force
*  and how I want to put it in the same footing as the other phenomenon,
*  fundamental forces of nature.
*  And then I think maybe it'll be simpler to think of why what I'm saying is not at all controversial.
*  I think string theorists and quantum gravity people and also people that do find challenging
*  to quantize gravity would still find what I'm saying not at all controversial.
*  So we have observed gravitational waves.
*  We have and I think there's little debate now that gravitational waves are real phenomenon
*  in nature and they correspond to a distortion.
*  Space and time around what we call a quadrupole.
*  So you should really think of comparing along not only two points,
*  but really along two directions to see gravitational waves.
*  But this distortion of space time is really waves of gravity,
*  gravitational waves propagating through space time.
*  This is very similar than light, actually.
*  Light are waves of electromagnetic nature.
*  They're electromagnetic waves, they're fluctuation in the electromagnetic field
*  propagating at the speed of light through space time.
*  And if you think of the same thing for gravity,
*  the fluctuation of our gravitational field,
*  so of what corresponds to the space time through space and time themselves,
*  they are gravitational waves and we have observed them.
*  And it is through this pull, squeezing and pulling of the gravitational waves
*  and this pull, squeezing and pulling and pushing and squeezing
*  and tearing us apart a little bit.
*  If we were close to a black hole, we would feel that much, much more.
*  But since we're quite far away from there, it's very, very subtle.
*  But this strain of gravitational waves that they have
*  between different bodies on different directions,
*  they are fundamentally the force of gravity,
*  just like there is an electromagnetic force.
*  And so if we think of it like that, it's very similar
*  than electromagnetism and it is very similar
*  than the weak force, for instance, or the strong force to some extent.
*  Although the strong force has some complications
*  which are really due to the strong force itself.
*  And this is why, you know, when we have, for those of us
*  who have seen pictures of the gravitational wave observatories
*  like LIGO and Virgo and so forth,
*  they're pulling strong tubes at right angles to each other, right?
*  Because they're testing that squeezing that you just talked about,
*  that quadrupole is exactly that you're squeezed in one direction
*  and stretched in the perpendicular direction.
*  That's right, that's right, that's right.
*  It's exactly that. That would be, if we were able to experience
*  that in our body ourselves, that would be us feeling gravity.
*  But we need such extraordinary experiments to feel that
*  on such big scales that it's quite unlikely we're going to feel that
*  in our body. And if we do, probably that's the last thing we feel
*  because we're probably falling into two black holes merging
*  into one another or something like that.
*  So it'll be a quick feeling.
*  But yes, we do, we can't think of it just like,
*  now this is good because we see
*  the gravitational force is sort of a quadrupole phenomenon,
*  a quadrupole phenomenon,
*  a quadrupole force. We have these two long tubes
*  at right angles to one another. We need to compare
*  those two directions to experience it.
*  And the electromagnetic force
*  is, we just need a dipole
*  if we want to. We can, for instance, experience it
*  through the variation of two electrons
*  accelerated with respect to one another.
*  They would lead to the propagation of light,
*  the propagation of an electromagnetic field.
*  And similarly, they would receive the electromagnetic field
*  and that would affect them. We can measure it like that.
*  But from in some sense, then it's very similar.
*  The fundamental properties of one, it's a dipole.
*  The other one is a quadrupole.
*  The subtleties are a little bit different and that has a big impact
*  for some of the effects, but at a
*  quite fundamental level,
*  there are just two forces.
*  One, which we think of it as a dipole, the other one as a quadrupole.
*  Maybe if I put that more in terms of
*  quantum field theory, because I want to go there.
*  That's where we're going.
*  One is what I would call a spin one
*  and then the other one is a spin two.
*  And that is, it's just a technicality at this level
*  related to how they behave under rotations.
*  We're under the rotation of space-time, but if you don't want to think of
*  rotational space-time, what we call Lorentz invariance,
*  so we can rotate space, but we can also
*  sort of rotate time, and that's also related to
*  this relative notion of special relativity.
*  If you move in with respect to one another,
*  then not only your space is affected,
*  but your time is also affected.
*  And so you have rotational space-time.
*  And then there's the photon, which is the particle propagating
*  or mediating the electromagnetic force
*  from a quantum field theory perspective.
*  There's a quantum of this electromagnetic field,
*  which is a photon.
*  And that is, from a particle point of view,
*  we can think of it as a particle which spin one,
*  so it rotates in a particular way under Lorentz transformation
*  and under Lorentz rotations.
*  So you can think of it a little bit like an apple
*  with a stern on top, and you need
*  a full rotation to see it again.
*  And a graviton would be then, by analogy,
*  if I make the exact same analogy,
*  a graviton would be the same thing as a photon,
*  it's a fundamental particle, but for gravity.
*  So it would be the particle responsible
*  for the gravitational mediation,
*  and you can think of the gravitational waves
*  that we have observed.
*  They are a classical phenomenon,
*  but they're not made of a completely continuum
*  of waves.
*  Really fundamentally, there's a quantum of this wave,
*  which we call a graviton.
*  The gravitational waves we have observed,
*  they have a lot of those gravitons,
*  about 10 to the 40, 44 gravitons.
*  If in principle we could make an experiment
*  as precise as possible, more precise than
*  what would be valid by Heisenberg uncertainty
*  in principle, then in principle we could think of
*  detecting one graviton, but that's maybe for later
*  of another story.
*  I'm sure that there's going to be some people
*  who are listening and they've been told that
*  we'll never detect gravitons, so how do you know
*  that's a well-established theory?
*  There's multiple reasons for that,
*  but for one thing is that,
*  first of all, let me just say there's no problem
*  thinking about a graviton.
*  Maybe let me just say that what I'm saying so far
*  is not at all controversial.
*  It's not that I have come up with a new theory
*  of quantum gravity that I'm trying to unveil
*  because everything, if you look at the back of my blackboard,
*  is related to gravity and is related
*  to quantum field theory, and there's no problem
*  thinking about a graviton, thinking about
*  quantum gravity within a given regime.
*  In our everyday life, that's absolutely possible.
*  If you think at sufficiently low curvature,
*  sufficiently low energy scales,
*  then you can quantize gravity
*  in a perturbative way.
*  What we do actually, we think of flat spacetime
*  and we think of gravitational waves
*  leaving on flat spacetime, and those gravitational waves,
*  they have a quantum of them, which is a graviton,
*  and from that perspective, there's no issue whatsoever.
*  That's absolutely fine.
*  Really, what becomes problematic
*  if you try to think of this quantum
*  and of the quantum nature of gravity
*  when you're reaching very high energy scales
*  or very high curvature scales or very short distances,
*  that close to the Planck scale,
*  the Planck energy scale, for instance.
*  If I were performing particle collision
*  at energy scales, which is way beyond
*  what is currently at CERN,
*  so at CERN, we are at TV energy scale, roughly speaking,
*  so 10 to the 12 electron volt.
*  But if I was going to 10 to the 19 giga electron volts,
*  so 10 to the 27 electron volt,
*  so that's 25 orders of magnitude.
*  No, sorry. 15 orders.
*  Thank you.
*  15 orders of magnitude more than CERN,
*  than the large Hadronik Collider.
*  15 orders of magnitude, that's a lot.
*  If I were to do it at energy scales,
*  which is way larger than that,
*  then when I start colliding particles,
*  I would expect to produce black holes,
*  but also I would expect that it is going to be quite difficult
*  to understand, to predict what the outcome is precisely
*  because it requires me understanding
*  the quantum nature of gravity at those scales
*  and that maybe some of my colleagues know what it is.
*  I don't know.
*  Actually, I really don't know.
*  I'm quite agnostic about that.
*  I'm happy to believe whatever they may think
*  and consider it from perspective,
*  but I don't know for sure.
*  What we know is that we don't have yet
*  a fully complete theory of everything at those scales
*  and so we don't have a fully complete theory
*  of what it is.
*  I think it's a very high energy process
*  of colliding any particle.
*  If you were to collide any particle,
*  even if you wanted to think of it as electrons or protons
*  and you were colliding them,
*  even if you're not colliding gravitons per se,
*  you can't prevent them from interacting with gravity.
*  This is the beauty of the equivalence principle
*  that everything connects with gravity.
*  Gravity plays along.
*  It will come into play whether you want it or not.
*  In our everyday life,
*  when we do particle collisions at the LHC,
*  I guess that's my everyday life.
*  That's not really my everyday life,
*  but in what we do,
*  the gravitational effect is quite small
*  and we don't need to worry too much about it.
*  We can't prevent it, but worry about it.
*  It will come in for sure
*  and it will have a dramatic effect on the outcome.
*  This is crucially important,
*  so you're admitting
*  that we don't know what happens at the Planck scale.
*  We don't know what the fundamental theory
*  of quantum gravity is deep down,
*  but nevertheless we can do quantum gravity
*  in the sense of thinking of gravitons
*  and thinking about ways to understand
*  and even modify our theory of gravitons
*  in various cases.
*  Exactly.
*  The other thing to just drive home
*  because it's really important
*  and almost never gets explained,
*  this dipole versus quadrupole thing
*  is related to the spin of the particles, as you said.
*  The gravity jiggles up and down,
*  that's a dipole, that's spin 1,
*  the graviton squeezes and then stretches,
*  which is a different thing, and that's spin 2,
*  and all that's going to matter,
*  what we're about to say.
*  If we just explain it like that,
*  it looks like it's very similar,
*  but when we're trying to implement that
*  which may seem a bit technical and innocent,
*  let me just say nonetheless,
*  because this is interesting.
*  If you take this spin 1, for instance,
*  of electromagnetic force,
*  it means that if I'm starting having some collisions,
*  I take particles and I collide them with each other,
*  let me take electrons, for instance,
*  and I collide them with each other,
*  and the probability of a given outcome
*  will typically grow for some of the effect of that,
*  if I'm trying to pick up a particular effect of that,
*  will grow in energy like the spin of the particles.
*  If I have the photon,
*  it will grow like spin 1,
*  so it will go actually like twice the spin,
*  so like energy squared,
*  it will go like energy squared.
*  But if I take another,
*  I can take the same thing,
*  and in prior you could also exchange graviton
*  in that process,
*  and that would be quite a weak interaction
*  because everything interacts quite weakly
*  with gravity to start with,
*  but the probability of the outcome
*  will sort of grow like the energy for that process,
*  to the power twice the spin,
*  so that's to the power 4,
*  and to start with it's not very much,
*  it's very weak at very low energy,
*  like the energies we're probing nowadays,
*  but because it grows faster in energy,
*  it comes to a point where this is really the process
*  that dominates and it starts really growing too fast
*  for us to make sense of it
*  when it gets close to the Planck scale.
*  So spin becomes really important,
*  and if we wanted to think of something,
*  particles of higher spin, even higher than spin 2,
*  higher than a graviton,
*  then we know that we wouldn't be able
*  to fully make sense of them by themselves,
*  we need to mitigate them in different ways.
*  So gravity, the spin 2, is the last thing
*  we can sort of try to make sense to some extent
*  if it is a fundamental particle,
*  then it just goes a bit too crazy.
*  If it is a fundamental particle.
*  This is actually a wonderful thing,
*  I'm glad that you mentioned that technical point
*  because it opens the window a little bit
*  into how real physicists spend their time
*  thinking about things.
*  I get a lot of emails, I don't know if you do,
*  and they're all falling,
*  so your number of emails is going to increase
*  once the book comes out,
*  and they're proposing a new theory
*  and they say, well, what if gravity is time?
*  And that is not how physicists think.
*  They're thinking about all of these constraints
*  from the behavior of scattering processes
*  as a function of energy and the spins of the fields
*  and there's a whole bunch of ideas
*  you've got to keep around at all times
*  when you're even imagining different approaches.
*  That's right.
*  You and me and many of our colleagues
*  have thought a lot about gravity
*  and also if we can challenge it
*  and if we can think of something else.
*  One thing is we really need to understand
*  how the fundamental physics beyond it
*  and how it connects also with quantum field theory.
*  We need to understand all of this to a huge level
*  to then make an indent into how we can think of it
*  and challenge it slightly differently
*  because it is working so remarkably well.
*  It's annoying, yeah.
*  We really need to have all of this under track
*  before we can try to understand
*  how to challenge it slightly.
*  We're thinking of it very much in terms of
*  the symmetries and energy scales
*  and how they relate to one another
*  and how things transform and how we can push them
*  to the limits is very important.
*  We can't just start over from scratch
*  and think of a different concept.
*  The other thing that you mentioned,
*  again I'm repeating things you said
*  we have mostly, most of the universe around us
*  looks like spin one half particles
*  like electrons and quarks
*  or spin one particles like photons and gluons.
*  There's the Higgs boson which is spin zero
*  the graviton which is spin two, that's it.
*  Those are the only options that we can imagine others.
*  We've never found a fundamental particle
*  with any spin other than that.
*  The spin two nature of the graviton
*  comes from general relativity.
*  Einstein didn't think of it that way
*  but the modern particle physicists will think of it that way.
*  Exactly, yes.
*  It's there in Einstein's theory of general relativity
*  whether he didn't build general relativity
*  in thinking, aha, let me think about
*  we have the photons so let me think of spin two now
*  and in the other case, that's very much
*  the way I think about it.
*  I'm very much down to earth and say,
*  okay, we have these different possibilities of particles
*  and so if I have a spin half, if I have a spin zero
*  if I have a spin one, if I have a spin two
*  and if I start to understand how to make sense
*  of a theory of massless spin two
*  so particle which mass
*  inertial mass I should say is zero
*  like the photon which is a particle of spin one
*  which inertial mass is zero
*  I would be, and this now there are theorems
*  done for instance by Feynman, by Dessert
*  by all sorts of amazing physicists
*  in the past century that show that
*  the only consistent theory that I can have
*  within some given assumptions about how they couple
*  things like that and the symmetry level
*  is general relativity, that's the only thing we can have
*  so we're really able to build Einstein's theory
*  of general relativity from the ground up
*  and I think that's quite beautiful
*  because we typically are taught
*  or we hear about Einstein's theory of general relativity
*  as relying on some pillars, Einstein's pillars
*  of general relativity requiring some of
*  the fundamental things that we can hear about
*  special relativity as being
*  requiring that nothing propagates faster than the speed of light
*  or the speed of light being this fundamental thing
*  and nowadays I would say we almost think of it
*  the other way around, we can very much think of
*  the fundamental particles and the fundamental symmetries
*  and a lot of those things come out of that
*  that nothing can travel faster than light
*  and we need to have general relativity
*  which is the theory of mass less spin 2
*  which encodes a metric that describes
*  how space and time are evolving all around us
*  this is the only possibility, it's not because
*  it's beautiful, it's because it's the only thing
*  that makes sense. It's also beautiful but you're right
*  It is, yes. Ok so you want to take this
*  beautiful structure, Einstein came up with this theory
*  as you said, something that I just think is a
*  remarkable fact that if Einstein hadn't come up with it
*  but we knew that there was gravity
*  some day much later people might have started thinking about
*  spin 2 particles and invented general relativity
*  which is a wonderful idea, so you want to mess it up
*  I don't understand
*  If there's one thing, that's one of the things
*  if there's one thing I learned about all of the things I've done
*  is how beautiful, how fundamental
*  and how challenging it is to challenge general activity
*  so if anything I don't really want to challenge it
*  per se, but for us to understand
*  how fundamental it is and how much
*  it is the only possibility that we can ever think about
*  we need to think a little bit beyond the box
*  and then we understand
*  how challenging it would be, what it would mean to have
*  a source slightly different than general activity
*  so that we can compare it with it
*  when we have observations, we can understand what it would mean
*  because if the only game in town is general activity
*  we can take it for granted
*  but if we have no reference
*  and it's all relative, right, so if we have no reference
*  then I don't know what to say
*  so yeah, let me give you some
*  of what makes me a bit uncomfortable
*  for some of the aspects that we think about
*  so of course I spent now maybe half an hour
*  telling you how there's absolutely no problem
*  with quantum gravity, we know how to deal with that
*  but we do know that
*  there will come a point where we need another theory
*  than general activity, we know general activity
*  is not the theory of everything, that we know for sure
*  we know there's going to be new layers of physics
*  I'm not going to tell you what they are because I don't know
*  because that's a very very challenging question
*  but I'm telling you that because already
*  in our way of thinking as physicists nowadays
*  we don't really ever think of
*  this is the theory of everything
*  and there's nothing else to be learned
*  and this is a theory which is applicable
*  and already in telling you that we understand
*  Einstein's theorem of general activity
*  we can treat it as a quantum field theory
*  up to a given energy scale
*  in those statements we make it clear that
*  the description we do of the world around us
*  the way we describe nature around us
*  adapts depending on precisely what we're interested in
*  and the type of energy scales we're interested in
*  and we do that every day
*  for instance if I want to understand
*  how flow dynamics works
*  to a good approximation I don't really need to look
*  at the particle descriptions of the electrons
*  and the protons inside the atoms
*  and the molecules of water, I don't need to do that
*  I can have a much more effective description of what's going on
*  and then I can dive deeper into the underlying
*  fundamental physics that goes on
*  so in the way we describe the world around us
*  we try to understand what it is we're interested in
*  and then we have a particular description
*  which is relevant for those scales
*  and so we know that within energy scales
*  we're dealing with here for instance in the solar system
*  for instance in the galaxy
*  we can treat general relativity as an effective
*  but we also know that if I wanted to understand
*  what's happening very close to the singularity
*  of a black hole then I would need to have something else
*  if I wanted to do a particle collision at energy scales
*  which are of the order of the Planck scale
*  I would need to have something else
*  if I wanted to look at what happens at the very beginning
*  of the universe very close to the Big Bang
*  I would need to understand what is the underlying structure
*  but now I'm going to ask myself the question
*  is general relativity really a good description
*  we know it's a good description for the scales
*  we're interested in we know it's not such a good description
*  for too high energy scales
*  and how about very low energy scales
*  what do I mean by that maybe that's a bit harder
*  to appreciate so let me just say
*  in physics we always have this notion
*  of high energy corresponds to small distance
*  and low energy corresponds to long distances
*  I don't know how familiar you think this would be
*  I think that you just said it and I think that's good
*  we can get it
*  I guess the only thing to say is that
*  that idea is so ingrained in physicists
*  that they almost forget which one they're talking about
*  short distance just is high energy
*  long distance is short energy
*  long distance is low energy they mean the same thing
*  yeah and I think of it if you want
*  if you think of it as a wave
*  if I have a wave with a very long wavelength
*  with a very long spread then it's actually
*  a very low frequency towards the red if you want
*  and so that has a low energy
*  and vice versa if it's very peaked it has a very short
*  wavelength then it's very high frequency
*  and so that's the notion of energy
*  again here mixing all sorts of different units
*  and notion and we just exchange them
*  it's very hard to think about which one we're thinking
*  in fact people call them the infrared and the ultraviolet
*  for long distances and short distances
*  the notion of color and wavelength and frequency
*  and energy and curvature it's all mixed into
*  one pack
*  you don't claim, I don't claim to understand
*  gravity in the ultraviolet
*  the short distance high energy regime
*  maybe there's room to learn something about the long distance infrared regime
*  that's right exactly so I want to think
*  of gravity in the IR
*  infrared and by that color of gravity
*  it's a friendly concept but what I mean by that
*  is very very long distances so what do I mean
*  imagine the longest possible distance you can imagine
*  and that is the scale of the
*  observable universe today
*  so I don't know if the universe is infinite
*  in size or finite that's also a very complicated
*  question maybe we'll never know
*  I think most people maybe would believe it's infinite
*  or maybe it was infinite in creation or maybe it was
*  I don't know truly don't know
*  I don't think we know
*  I think it would be hard to really claim for sure
*  but we have a finite size observable universe
*  which means we can only see up to a given distance
*  because the universe is expanding
*  that means that the structure of space and time is stretching
*  and so the further away you look the
*  fastest objects seem to be moving away from you
*  and if you look far enough
*  then the objects will really it's the structure of space
*  time between us but it would look
*  as if the objects are moving away from us faster than light
*  and so that would mean that if you look
*  too far away you can't see the objects anymore because
*  it's moving faster than light it doesn't mean
*  that information is propagating faster than light
*  there's no information propagating there it's just the structure
*  of space between different objects between different galaxies
*  if you want in the universe is stretching so fast
*  that if you're looking very far away then it's
*  it seems like it's going faster than light
*  so because of that and also if you want because
*  of the fact that the universe has a finite life
*  lifetime there's only a finite size for
*  our observable universe we can't see further than that
*  and so that's the longest possible
*  distances that I can picture in my head
*  I can think of distances longer than that but then they never
*  be observable they never really make sense nowadays
*  maybe if we if we wait I don't know that will depend on
*  on the future of our universe I don't know
*  so let me think of gravity on those
*  very very large distance scales
*  and it's very likely that
*  it is if I think of gravity if I think of
*  the structure of space time on those very very large distances
*  it is well described by Einstein's theory of general relativity
*  but who am I to know I don't know
*  because I have no other experiments done at those scales
*  I have no way to compare the only thing I can do is
*  is think of it but
*  it's not like I can do another experiment in the lab
*  measuring these big distances the behavior of
*  gravity on those big distances or if we want the
*  behavior of gravity on very very low curvature
*  scales very very low it's almost solo it's
*  it's flat almost it's not quite but it's very
*  very low it's something we have never measured before
*  we can't compare and say okay it is
*  well described by Einstein's theory of general relativity because we don't
*  know so this is just the premises
*  it doesn't mean that it's wrong but that's just the premises of where
*  we stand I don't think anything I'm saying so far is controversial
*  something else I'm gonna say which is not
*  controversial is that we do observe that
*  the expansion the universe is expanding
*  but not only it is expanding this expansion is
*  accelerating and that
*  led to the 2013 Nobel Prize
*  I think it was for the sorry
*  2011 it was earlier yeah yeah
*  I think it's for 2011 right yeah 2011 2013
*  was discovery of the Higgs former mindscape guest
*  Adam Reese was one of the winners of the Nobel Prize
*  yes exactly for the discovery
*  I don't know the exact citations but it's something
*  like the redshift of
*  supernovae yeah but it's really the acceleration of the universe
*  obviously yes yeah yeah
*  so we do so see that the universe
*  is expanding but that expansion is also accelerating
*  so maybe most of you have heard
*  some things along those lines and also the fact that
*  we may have some notion of what could
*  lead to this accelerated expansion
*  but it's not entirely clear
*  and if we for lack of a better name we can say it's dark energy
*  there's some sort of dark energy out there
*  I just really I might say anything
*  any other word I want I can call it
*  whatever I want I don't know what it is
*  it's just a placeholder and it's we can think of it
*  as a fluid with negative pressure
*  we often we sometimes say it's
*  a negative it's a what is anti-gravity fluid
*  and I think that's that's not quite right because it's actually
*  very gravity it's gravity yeah I never use those words
*  right yeah it's not it's not at all
*  counter gravity in any way really acts with gravity
*  and acts with gravity in its favor there's nothing anti
*  but it's a fluid which we can describe
*  with positive energy density
*  but negative pressure and that's that's this negative pressure
*  that would lead to the accelerated expansion
*  of the universe so that's fine that's an effective
*  description of what's going on but this effective
*  description is not really explaining
*  what is happening is not telling us where this dark
*  energy is coming from however
*  this is where I think the quantum nature
*  of the world we're living is important
*  we also know that every particle
*  in that we know of let's say the electron
*  the Higgs the top quark and everything they are
*  they are fundamentally quantum objects that that is not
*  controversial I think all of those particles we know they're quantum
*  objects they're quantum field and they have
*  they lead to quantum fluctuations
*  in the vacuum they sort of our soul wherever you
*  are you can be in a galaxy you can be in a
*  cluster of a galaxy you can be near black hole
*  or you can be near in the middle of a cosmic void
*  in a completely empty region of the universe
*  with nothing absolutely nothing around you for
*  for millions of light years around you
*  and yet you have this constant bubbling up
*  out of nothing of fundamental particle that come in
*  out of existence for a little instant and then
*  disappear their virtual particles to detect them really
*  you should have you should make something else
*  but we we can we can see the effect
*  of this constant bubbling of vacuum
*  particles in other effects like at the LHC like
*  at CERN this virtual effect is present
*  not necessarily directly from the vacuum but it
*  it is something we have very strong reasons to believe
*  has some level of reality that is not
*  just a mathematical artifact it's actually something real
*  and so this soul if you want quantum
*  soul of all the particles that we know
*  we would expect them to lead to an energy
*  density in the vacuum and this energy
*  density locally is quite small
*  but it's everywhere it's absolutely everywhere in the universe
*  it doesn't doesn't care about the local
*  environment it would be everywhere in the universe
*  and so integrated out it leads to a huge contribution
*  in the universe it would really dominate the whole
*  energy content of the universe by many many
*  orders of magnitude and this contribution
*  because it is constant everywhere in the universe
*  everywhere in space everywhere in time
*  we can call it a cosmological constant
*  and actually that is a term that Einstein had introduced
*  himself from very early on in his Einstein
*  theory which he then retracted
*  but it's probably one of the most
*  moment he had to introduce this cosmological constant
*  it can lead to an accelerated expansion of the universe
*  so in some sense so far it seems
*  things seem to fit in together that we have
*  the quantum fields of
*  all the particles that we know lead to some vacuum energy
*  that looks like a cosmological constant that can lead
*  to an accelerated expansion of the universe which is precisely
*  what we observe and so this seems all consistent
*  the only thing is that the level of the contribution
*  of vacuum energy to this cosmological constant
*  is too big by at least
*  56 orders of magnitude if I just consider
*  the particles that I do know for sure do exist
*  in nature like the Higgs like the electron
*  just by themselves they lead to a huge level
*  of vacuum energy and therefore I would say to a cosmological
*  constant which is way too big
*  to be consistent with the observations
*  of the current accelerated expansion of the universe
*  we would have expected actually that the universe would be
*  accelerating far far far
*  faster
*  so this is really where the
*  some of you may have heard of this discrepancy
*  of 120 orders of magnitude
*  this is really if you consider that you have
*  contribution that would come in
*  all the way up to the Planck scale
*  and that I'm going to remain agnostic about because I have no reason
*  to believe for or against I don't know I haven't
*  we haven't seen particles beyond the Higgs or beyond
*  of mass larger than the top quark so
*  I don't have anything to claim anything about that but from what we know
*  we know there's a Higgs field
*  with a given mass and already that mass leads to a contribution
*  to the vacuum energy which is way too fast
*  to be consistent with our current observation
*  any observation that is not
*  everybody would tell from the beginning that it would otherwise
*  have been way too fast. So this is a problem?
*  So this is I think
*  the community would agree
*  that it is probably one of the biggest problem we have
*  the biggest discrepancy at the very least of the whole history
*  of physics, of science, of everything
*  it's a huge discrepancy
*  it's a huge paradox in some sense that we have this
*  theory of general relativity on one side that works so well
*  and everything seems to be fitting in
*  perfectly together
*  and on the other hand we have quantum field theory
*  which has been working
*  remarkable precision for the particles that we know of
*  and all of the sea of virtual particles
*  we go within so deep layers
*  of those loops of fundamental particles
*  to do calculations, to look at predictions of what will happen
*  at CERN and other particle accelerators
*  and that works so well
*  really incredibly well
*  to such a high precision
*  and so we have those two
*  descriptions of nature which are not at all
*  contradictory, I would say
*  in everyday life we can really put gravity and the quantum world
*  together and there's not at all any contradiction
*  but the real contradiction is coming into the effect
*  of the vacuum energy of those fundamental particles
*  into gravity, into the curvature of space time
*  and into how fast you would want it to make the universe
*  expansion accelerate, this is the real contradiction
*  and that's the motivation for messing with gravity
*  at long distances in these events
*  so all of this is my excuse
*  yeah okay, your excuse, I think you have a very very good
*  motivation there and so there could be many different
*  ways to mess with gravity
*  yes, I've played this game myself but
*  what you want to say if I'm vastly oversimplifying
*  is that that starting point when we were talking about
*  particles and spins and you say that the graviton
*  like the photon is a massless particle
*  it moves at the speed of light, you want to say maybe it doesn't
*  that's right, I want to say all of this
*  is a big paradox because
*  I'm assuming that the graviton is a massless particle
*  that moves at the speed of light and that has an infinite range
*  that means that I really need to include all of the
*  vacuum energy throughout the whole universe, throughout the whole past
*  of the universe and that has
*  an effect on the universe which is way too big
*  but maybe this is because we're
*  actually just starting to probe the fact that
*  gravity itself has a finite range
*  has a finite range maybe in space but what's
*  even more relevant is that it has a finite range in time
*  so it's sort of a little bit lazy
*  just a tiny little bit lazy
*  after 14 billion years I think you can forgive it
*  if you want to say okay enough with this vacuum
*  energy, I've been carrying it along
*  maybe it's been much longer than that, we don't know, maybe the universe is even older
*  than that and it's been carrying this vacuum energy and taking it
*  very seriously for such a long time
*  and I'm saying okay enough, I'm a bit tired out
*  I'm not going to let it affect me as much as
*  Einstein wants it to be
*  let me just relax a little bit
*  and slowly the effect of this huge vacuum energy
*  could
*  not be so important on the curvature of space time
*  after some time, after billions and billions of years
*  the effect could be weakened
*  and that could come out a little bit
*  and so these are just words
*  but to make that concrete
*  if we think of gravity as being the propagation
*  of a spin-2 particle
*  and I don't really want to mess up with that because we have observed
*  gravitational waves because there's so many fundamental aspects
*  that really rely on this
*  I don't want to mess up with that too much
*  and the thing of investigating
*  which apparently doesn't seem completely crazy
*  is to wonder whether this particle could have a mass actually
*  and this is not completely crazy
*  because we do know actually from the Higgs mechanism
*  that fundamental particle
*  that carry a mass, sorry, that carry a force
*  can have a mass, that is the case of the W
*  and the Z boson, they are actually spin-1 particles
*  they carry a mass
*  and they carry a force which is the weak force
*  and maybe we're not all very familiar with the weak force
*  it's not something I think I spend all my
*  well I do spend my day thinking
*  in my everyday life
*  because it's a weak force
*  and the reason it's weak is because it's been propagated by
*  very massive particles, the W and the Z boson
*  and so this is just to give you a little bit more intuitively
*  how the Higgs mechanism
*  that can give a mass to fundamental particles
*  for instance to the W and the Z boson
*  are related to the fact that it weakens
*  some of the forces, it weakens the force mediated
*  by this particle, in this case the weak force
*  and you can think of that because
*  if you have a massive object
*  this is an analogy, it's not exactly like that
*  if you have a massive object
*  by massive I mean inertia
*  then it will be harder to drag it along
*  so it's not going to want to be
*  if you give it a kick it may not want to go
*  along until the end of time
*  it may want to stop at some time
*  that's just an analogy, Matt Strasler will be very upset with us
*  but that's ok, I think it does convey
*  exactly what you're trying to get to
*  so this is just an analogy to say that
*  effectively if I want to weaken out gravity
*  but I still want to think of it at the particle level
*  and I still want to think of it as a spin-2 particle
*  then one of the things I can start thinking about
*  is to give it an inertial mass
*  so rather than being a massless spin-2 particle
*  as a quantum field theory of general relativity
*  it can be perhaps a massive particle
*  as in massive gravity
*  and massive gravity doesn't mean that gravity is genormous
*  it just means that the particle that propagates it
*  is massive, it has an inertial mass
*  so that is the idea behind what we're trying to do
*  but as we said before
*  the particle physicists out there, the quantum field theorists
*  have to struggle with a million constraints
*  that nature puts on you
*  so is it easy to imagine
*  let's give the graviton a small mass
*  or do you have to work very hard at this?
*  I know the answer to this one
*  if it was easy I wouldn't be there to talk about it
*  it would have been done on day one
*  thinking of this type of things
*  thinking about at the very least
*  what it means to give a mass to a spin-2 particle
*  that is something that is not
*  motivated as something which is quite natural
*  and so people naturally have tried it very early on
*  Fierce and Pauli have tried it already in 1939
*  so now it's almost 100 years ago
*  but it's important, that's Wolfgang Pauli
*  the same guy behind the exclusion principle
*  so you tried to give the graviton a mass
*  yes they tried that very early on
*  because it's such a natural thing to do
*  it's not extravagant if you think of it like that
*  it's very much from the particle physics point of view
*  you can try that
*  if the mass is sufficiently small
*  it should be identical to general relativity
*  so let's try it and see how big the mass can be
*  it's a phenomenological question in some sense
*  so let's try that
*  and already then, Wolfgang Pauli and Marcus Fierce
*  tried that in 1939
*  and one thing they realised was that
*  if you think of
*  gravity as being propagated
*  by a spin-2 particle
*  it has
*  different polarisations
*  just like the polarisation of light
*  light has two polarisations
*  and if you had polarised sunglasses
*  you filter out one polarisation
*  and just see the other one
*  and the same thing happened for gravitational waves
*  I don't think we're going to have polarised sunglasses
*  for gravitational waves very soon
*  and gravitational waves have two polarisations
*  the fact that it's the same number as light
*  is just an accident of four dimensions
*  in higher dimensions it would be different
*  but so be it
*  those two polarisations, as you mentioned
*  when we think of the gravitational wave observatory
*  they have these two tubes
*  at a 90 degree angle
*  so we can think of one polarisation
*  will fluctuate in one particular way
*  and then the other one will cross 90 degrees
*  from that
*  I don't know if people are familiar with the plus
*  and cross polarisations
*  I think 45 degrees, right?
*  yeah sorry, absolutely 45 degrees
*  so a plus sign and an X 45 degrees apart
*  according to Einstein's theory of general relativity
*  but if the particle that mediates gravity
*  had a mass
*  if it was a massive graviton
*  you could actually have additional polarisations
*  and some of those polarisations wouldn't be just
*  transverse to the line of propagation
*  of the gravitational waves
*  they would also be along the line of propagation
*  so if you think
*  for instance of sound waves
*  they are waves
*  they are not fundamental particle
*  but they are still waves
*  those are much more longitudinal waves
*  they are compression of the air along the line of propagation
*  so those are longitudinal waves
*  that's how we hear
*  so in principle
*  if you consider a slight modification of gravity
*  and if you add a small mass to the graviton
*  you could have those additional polarisations
*  this additional channel of propagation
*  additional channel of communications
*  of gravitational waves
*  and what's quite interesting is that
*  in principle it doesn't matter how small the mass is
*  it could be extremely small
*  it could be smaller than anything you could ever measure
*  but conceptually it doesn't make a difference
*  on whether it is zero
*  and those polarisations are not allowed to be there
*  there's a symmetry reason
*  the underlying symmetries that Einstein relied on
*  which tells you those extra polarisations are absolutely forbidden
*  and if the mass is infinitesimal
*  there or if it's large
*  as soon as you have the possibility of a non-zero mass
*  then you open up the possibility of these additional polarisations
*  additional channel of communication
*  so let me call it a force
*  I'm going to provoke people
*  the force of gravity would then have new ways of communicating
*  between any two things, any two objects in the universe
*  and that changes in principle things dramatically
*  absolutely dramatically
*  one thing I should say though is that
*  that already seems like a problem
*  a problem from observations, but it gets worse
*  that may be a problem in the sense that
*  maybe if you're unlucky
*  the observables may not be the same
*  as what you would have expected from general relativity
*  that's one thing
*  but the more problematic in that is that
*  gravitational waves are not just innocent waves
*  they're actually fluctuation in space and time
*  so when they propagate
*  they do affect the flow of space
*  for the standard gravitational waves
*  but if you have additional polarisation
*  they can also start messing up with the flow of time
*  and there is this connection between time and energy
*  and if you start messing up with that
*  and if you have a system of energy
*  which has negative energy
*  we call them ghosts
*  and so some of these longitudinal modes
*  they are actually ghostly
*  they are modes which have negative energy
*  it costs them a negative amount of energy to get produced
*  which means they will get produced
*  whether you want it or not
*  yeah, I wrote a paper about that once
*  I think people are a little bit
*  once again a constraint that you have to worry about
*  you invent a new theory, you think it's all fine
*  but then you realise it causes instant doom
*  for everything in the universe
*  and so, Fiat St Pauli in 1939 knew that
*  they already knew that
*  and at the time they were just looking at a theory
*  called the linear level
*  so the first effect around flat spacetime
*  they didn't even think too much about doing something
*  which is fully gravitational
*  and looking for instance at the curvature
*  in the solar system or anything like that
*  let's just think of the simplest thing we can think of
*  just gravitational waves living on flat spacetime
*  and already they realised there was this huge problem
*  which is what we call ghost
*  and they already had to work very hard to make sure
*  there wasn't any such pathology occurring
*  around that very simple case
*  I just want to let everyone know
*  you said it but it went by very quickly
*  particle physicists called these negative energy particles ghosts
*  which is very funny
*  that's right, that's right
*  there's even little doodles of ghosts in your book
*  I know
*  this is actually the correct scientific terminology
*  believe it or not
*  they are called ghosts, that's the way we call them
*  they are different from other type of instabilities
*  you may have heard of
*  like tachyonic instabilities
*  you can argue for instance the Higgs
*  underwent a period of unstable phase
*  where its potential got changed
*  and the potential was unstable for a little bit
*  until the Higgs found a new vacuum
*  a new ground state
*  that tachyon can exist
*  and maybe they are not very comfortable with
*  for a given time but we know how to deal with them
*  ghosts are really negative kinetic energy
*  and that is beyond uncomfortable
*  it's simply unviable
*  so why do we still need to keep talking
*  why can't we just say it didn't work
*  we failed
*  this is where it becomes interesting
*  at the linear level as described by Fiat-Saint Pauli
*  they could make it work actually
*  but quickly it was realized
*  that that wasn't good enough
*  because the world is not just flat space time
*  with small ripples living on top of us
*  we are there, we have curvature around us
*  and perhaps even more so
*  you could have the other polarizations of gravity
*  coming in into massive gravity
*  and we haven't observed them yet
*  so what is going on
*  so what happened in the quantum theory
*  Fiat-Saint Pauli did it
*  which was what I'll call a linear theory
*  a perturbative theory
*  it had to be a fully fledged non-linear theory
*  of massive gravity
*  Einstein's theory of general relativity
*  is a fully fledged full theory
*  we don't know the full quantum theory of gravity
*  we have black holes
*  and the evolution of the universe
*  and the solar system
*  and very non-trivial systems
*  in order to pass any test
*  we need to be able to do the same thing
*  for massive gravity
*  and this is where the complication came
*  because it seemed very
*  impossible at the time to make it work
*  and not only impossible
*  but people came up with all sorts of arguments
*  in showing how this would never be the case
*  there was what we call no-go theorems
*  as the name says
*  it's a theorem that tells you there's no way
*  impossible, there's no go
*  there wasn't just one no-go theorem
*  in that language, in this way, in this formulation
*  it's impossible, so stop talking about it
*  let's move on
*  it's not like I came in and said
*  I'm going to want to challenge everybody
*  and make everybody hate me
*  it wasn't like that actually
*  with Gregor Gabbardazzi
*  independently but at the same time
*  we saw models with extra dimensions
*  and in the way gravity
*  leaks into the extra dimension
*  it did look like from the four-dimensional point of view
*  as a theory of massive gravity
*  and in that case we saw that
*  the problem is that people were talking about
*  didn't manifest themselves
*  didn't manifest themselves in higher dimensions
*  they didn't manifest themselves in four dimensions either
*  and I was sure we were making a mistake
*  we spent ages and ages just going back and forth
*  and trying to understand
*  and of course he was relying on extra dimensions
*  but all of that formalism couldn't actually be captured
*  just from a point of view of four dimensions
*  and all of the arguments was claimed until then
*  should have applied and the no-go
*  and the no-go was preventing us to find the result
*  that we were finding so that seemed very
*  very unlikely and the most likely reason
*  was that we made a mistake
*  so we spent ages but really ages
*  going back and trying to see where we made a mistake
*  until we realised that there was actually no mistake
*  in what we've done
*  it's just that all of the no-go theorems
*  were beyond it
*  underlying it I should say
*  and maybe one of the most common assumptions
*  it wasn't just that but one of the most common assumptions
*  was that at least to start with in the 70s
*  wasn't to chart all the possibilities
*  because this is really very hard to do every possible case
*  so what one can do to start with
*  is you look at a given region
*  you look at the way things are
*  in a given situation
*  and from there you extrapolate
*  assuming things are never going to look too different
*  if you charted the whole allowed region of possibilities
*  but that's sometimes also a bit circular
*  because you'll never know if something different can happen
*  if you haven't actually gone further and looked for other things
*  so that was one of the reasons
*  some of the no-go theorems that were developed
*  they weren't exactly no-go theorems for all possibilities
*  they were no-go theorems for the simplest models
*  and then that was extrapolating to
*  lots of models thinking surely there's nothing else to think about
*  but actually that wasn't quite the case
*  but the upshot is that you now think that you have a way
*  to give the graviton a really tiny mess
*  that's right
*  that really pushed us to understand much more
*  what was going on with these no-go's
*  and then to come up with a fully fledged
*  four-dimensional, not relying on extra-dimension
*  four-dimensional theorem of massive gravity
*  which evades all of those problems related to these ghosts
*  and to these instabilities
*  and so where the graviton could in principle have a mass
*  have an inertial mass
*  are also in themselves quite uncomfortable
*  which we need to deal with
*  it's not a perfect theory by any stretch of imagination
*  but no one would expect that
*  and if it was too comfortable, if it was too close to GR
*  it wouldn't play any role either
*  we want to have it something quite different
*  the way it interacts with the rest of the world
*  has to be slightly different, particularly for cosmology
*  it's a very complex theory in some sense
*  if we can allow ourselves a simple cosmological constant
*  and something which has a lot of symmetry
*  not to affect space-time in the same way as you would do in GR
*  it makes it much more complicated
*  that's exactly what I want to get to
*  because I know that we're going to run out of time here very soon
*  tell me how we would ever know the difference between your theory
*  and Albert Einstein's theory
*  what is the observation or experiment we could do?
*  there are different things that can happen
*  the thing is with gravity
*  being general relativity or massive gravity
*  is that they are fully fledged theories
*  so it's not like you can just have one observation
*  there's loads and multitudes of observations
*  just like general relativity has black holes
*  and the solar system and cosmology and the bending of light
*  they have to be consistent with one another
*  and the same thing has to be true for massive gravity
*  there are loads of different things that should happen
*  that can happen and some of them will be observable
*  some of them will not
*  one of the simplest things to think about
*  if we go back to gravitational waves
*  is in the way they propagate
*  so in the way we build the theory of massive gravity
*  we are still very like those of general relativity
*  so you're not going to produce many of the other polarizations
*  but you're still going to produce the same ones
*  as in general relativity
*  however, if gravitational waves are massive
*  then those at low frequency will be more affected by the mass
*  and will start propagating at a slightly lower speed
*  than those at a higher frequency
*  that travel close to the speed of light
*  so the gravitational waves that have been observed by LIGO
*  so far, they're relatively high frequency
*  compared to the mass of the graviton so far
*  and so even though we have strong reason to believe
*  that within the realm of what we have observed
*  all the frequencies travel at the same speed roughly
*  so there's no distortion of the signal
*  and that speed more or less is very close to that of speed of light
*  we have observed that from the neutron star merger
*  in one part to the 10 to the 15
*  so this doesn't put yet a very strong constraint on the graviton mass
*  it puts a constraint on the graviton mass
*  that it has to be smaller than roughly 10 to the minus
*  22 electron volt or so
*  so just for comparison, what we have in mind
*  is a graviton mass which is of the order
*  again I'm going to have different units
*  a graviton mass which is of the order of the Hubble parameter today
*  so 10 to the minus 32, 33 electron volt
*  because that's the size in distance
*  that's the size of the observable universe today
*  the Hubble parameter today roughly
*  people would see, we know that in terms of km per second per megaparsecs
*  but I like to think of it in terms of electron volt
*  the Hubble parameter today is roughly 10 to the minus 32 electron volts
*  so we want a graviton mass
*  which is roughly of that order of magnitude
*  so we have different constraints from LIGO
*  and from neutron star mergers
*  multi-messenger are roughly 10 to the minus 22 electron volts
*  so we're still within a 10 orders of magnitude margin
*  that's good, that's fine
*  but as we go and observe gravitational waves
*  which are much lower frequency
*  then we can hope to put better constraint on the graviton mass
*  and maybe if one day we were able to observe
*  gravitational waves with a wavelength as long as the whole observable universe today
*  then we could actually tell
*  whether gravity is massive or not
*  that would be one way
*  so for instance if we were able to observe
*  primordial gravitational waves
*  gravitational waves that have been emitted at the very beginning of the universe
*  and propagating throughout the age of the universe to us
*  and they would have an imprint for instance
*  on the cosmic microwave background
*  on the CMB through B mode polarizations
*  so if you were able to observe B mode polarizations
*  and you were really sure that they came from
*  primordial gravitational waves and nothing else
*  and if you were able to observe the power spectrum
*  of these B mode polarizations
*  then you should be able to say whether it's consistent
*  with general relativity or whether it's consistent with massive gravity
*  for massive gravity at low frequency
*  you would have a plateau as opposed to a production of gravitational waves
*  because the mass would inhibit
*  the production of the gravitational waves
*  unlike in massive gravity
*  so that's a possible way
*  so it does seem very testable, very constrainable
*  do you get a benefit from giving the graviton a mass?
*  did you actually explain why the cosmogel constant is small?
*  that is the hope, right?
*  so I can do a back of the envelope calculation
*  not me but that's the origin motivation
*  which would take two lines based on linearized gravity
*  and say yes, if I come in myself
*  I can think of gravity
*  the effect of a cosmogel constant on gravity
*  would be tuned down after a while
*  and therefore I can explain observations
*  in reality to make that work
*  in the real cosmogel setup is extremely challenging
*  and it is extremely challenging
*  mainly because the typical cosmogel solutions
*  that we have, the way we construct them
*  in general relativity, that doesn't work anymore
*  for massive gravity
*  that is a huge challenge
*  I would say it's perhaps
*  actually this is a good sign
*  it's a sign that it's not working quite the way
*  you would have expected in general relativity
*  you didn't want it to work in the same way
*  you don't want it to have a simple relation
*  between the cosmogel constant
*  and having homogeneous and isotropic universe
*  with a huge acceleration
*  because then you won't do anything
*  the gift and the curse
*  has changed, that has happened
*  but into what? I don't know
*  and what I can tell you is that it's extremely challenging
*  and probably the fact that it's so challenging
*  would tell us that we can't do it at the end of the day
*  but I don't know
*  you've already explained how there were literally theorems
*  that convinced people that this whole thing couldn't work
*  there are loopholes in the theorems
*  that motivates us when we have such a big puzzle
*  like the vacuum energy, the cosmogel
*  the history more generally
*  let's explore the different alternatives
*  exactly, that's exactly the way we think about it
*  and I would say with that in mind
*  we are in a much better position now
*  because rather than having an answer
*  I think that's much better
*  that's good and I hope that we at least
*  help some people be more convinced
*  that gravitons are real things
*  we don't know all their polarizations
*  so cloud eat around
*  lots of things to do
*  so thanks so much for being on the Mindscape Podcast
*  thank you very much
*  music
