# Mindscape Podcast: Episode Zero
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 02, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3MrWRQpmOQ)
*  Hello everybody and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and this
*  is Episode 0, by which I mean it's not a regular episode, it's more like a teaser trailer, trying
*  to give you the general overview of who I am, what we're going to be doing over the course of the
*  podcast. I want to confess I was tempted to dedicate Episode 0 to an hour-long disquisition
*  on the nature of rationality. That would be very true to who I am, but I thought that we're getting
*  to know each other, we're starting a new endeavor over here. Maybe I should try to keep things
*  short and sweet, not give people too much of the right idea, and try to get to the bottom of why
*  I would even do this in the first place. You know, by vocation I'm a physicist. I work at
*  Caltech right now. I do theoretical physics, that is to say I think about quantum mechanics,
*  space-time, the nature of the universe. Increasingly these days I'm thinking about
*  complex systems, entropy, information theory, and things like that. But I've been interested
*  in lots of things for much longer than that, not just physics, philosophy, economics, literature,
*  art, history, all sorts of different things. And as an academic, I'm not really allowed to think
*  about those things in a professional capacity. I'm allowed to think about them in my spare time,
*  but my job is thinking about theoretical physics. And in the meantime, I've been on plenty of
*  podcasts, you know, from Joe Rogan to the Rites for Ricky Sanchez, always had a good time. As
*  someone who enjoys doing new and interesting things, I've often thought about doing it myself,
*  but the usual things got in the way. It's not my job, how much time would it take, and so forth.
*  What finally pushed me, nudged me over towards actually doing it is the idea that these podcast
*  hosts get to talk to whoever they want, as long as they can get them to say yes on the podcast,
*  but there's no restrictions on topic. They can talk about basketball if they're a basketball
*  podcast, if they want to, but they can also talk about other things. People don't have to listen,
*  it's okay. So I realized that this, for me, would be a license to talk about all sorts of ideas that
*  I don't get to confront and deal with as an academic in my day-to-day environment. Not writing
*  papers about them, not being an expert myself, but talking to the world's experts, both other
*  academics and people in other fields of endeavor, really smart people who are working on some of
*  the most interesting ideas out there. So that's going to be the focus of this podcast. In terms
*  of format, it's pretty conventional. I'm expecting most of the episodes will be me interviewing one
*  other person. Sometimes it will just be me talking about something I have something to say about,
*  but mostly it'll be me picking someone who I think has something really interesting to say,
*  and rather than looking for fun personal anecdotes or jumping from topic to topic,
*  really digging into a particular big idea, a particular thing that we'd like to get to the
*  bottom of. At a popular level, in the sense that it should be accessible to everyone, no special
*  technical jargon presumed to be known, but in a way that we have time enough to really get into it,
*  to really try to understand what's going on. So for me, that's where the fun is. It's very
*  unlikely that someone like Lady Gaga is going to be a guest on this podcast, but if she did,
*  she did come on. I wouldn't be asking her about celebrity gossip or the latest thing that was
*  going on. I would ask her about performance and writing and the artistry of being a rock star or
*  pop star in the modern age. Everyone has something interesting to say if they're at the top of their
*  profession in that way. So by the way, Gaga, if you're listening to this, we would love to have
*  you on the podcast. Have your people contact my people. We will definitely set that up. But
*  meanwhile, whether or not anyone else is interested in these things, one of the things about this
*  format that appeals to me is that I will get to learn something. I will get to learn smart ideas
*  from very interesting people. Hopefully, I will also get better at dealing with ideas that I'm
*  both unfamiliar with myself or even disagree with myself. You know, in the modern world,
*  especially when we have the internet to mediate many of our conversations, we're not always good
*  at confronting and thinking about things that we don't immediately agree with, whether it's anger
*  and dismissiveness, or just sarcasm or snark, we tend to respond instantly and unreflectively to
*  such ideas. And I bring this up not to accuse anybody else, but to say that I've been very bad
*  about this. I'm just as guilty as anybody else of being snarky or dismissive when something comes
*  along I don't agree with. And I think it's important to disagree with things sometimes. But I would like
*  to usually disagree with them in a thoughtful, careful, considered way. So that's the kind of
*  thing I'm going to be looking for on the podcast. I'm sure I will be often interviewing people who
*  I do agree with, but hopefully there'll be more than enough people who challenge me in some way.
*  And I'm going to try to get better at dealing with those in a way that is useful, that is useful to
*  me and useful to everyone listening. And with that in mind, I do have something I want to say
*  about the nature of rationality. If you've gotten this far into it, indulge me a little bit because
*  I think that this is important. Here's the thing about rationality. It's hard. It's hard to be
*  reasonable about things. Not utterly, not reasonable at all. We can be slightly rational about things,
*  but being perfectly rational is very, very hard. The human brain was not trained to do this. We
*  grew up over evolutionary time scales to solve certain problems and logical reasoning wasn't
*  always among those problems. Very few human beings could take the square root of a ten digit
*  number, but any pocket calculator can do that with no problem. There's other things we human
*  brains are very good at, but not simple mathematical logical kind of constructions. Interestingly,
*  the human brain is very efficient computationally. Human physicists know that when you have a
*  computational process that includes both analyzing information, but also recording it and deleting
*  it from a hard drive, this creates heat. You might have noticed this in your computer, your laptop
*  sitting on your lap heats up. If you have a gaming rig, you need to spend money to keep it cool. This
*  is the generation of entropy. This is the second law of thermodynamics in action. All computational
*  processes do this, but some do it more efficiently than others. The human brain, it turns out, is
*  actually really efficient. Unlike your laptop, even when you're thinking really hard, your brain
*  doesn't melt. Part of that efficiency is that the human brain is not just brute forcing its calculations,
*  it's taking shortcuts. We develop heuristics and rules of thumb to deal with the universe,
*  and these are usually very helpful, but sometimes they lead us astray. Sometimes they lead us to,
*  for example, cognitive biases. Most people have heard, for example, of the idea of confirmation
*  bias. If you like an idea, if you want it to be true, you tend to look at evidence that favors
*  that idea. You tend to not pay attention to evidence that goes against it. And the subject
*  of cognitive bias and how we deal with it, how we train ourselves to do better in the face of
*  these biases has been very, very well studied. There's something that I don't think has been
*  as well studied, which is another aspect of rationality, namely what we pay attention to
*  in the first place. When I was an undergraduate, I took a philosophy class and one of my philosophy
*  professors started one of the lectures by saying, how many facts are there in this room right now?
*  How many facts? It's kind of a rhetorical question. There's no answer to that question,
*  or the answer is just infinity. Even if there's only a finite number of things in the room,
*  there's an infinite number of things that might be in the room but aren't, right? The fact that
*  there is no elephant in the room is a fact. And this simple fact about facts is something
*  that has enormous implications for how we think, how we try to make sense of our world. We ask
*  journalists or scientists to be objective in what they do, and we don't quite give credit to how
*  impossible it is to be fully objective. When a journalist reports something, they can be
*  objective about the facts they report. They can report facts truthfully and accurately,
*  but there's necessarily a subjective component to deciding what facts to report. Whenever we
*  tell a story about something, we are choosing what aspects to emphasize. And this choice is
*  seemingly automatic, but it can be trained out of us. Psychologists have done studies,
*  for example, where they show people a picture and they say, we're gonna ask you questions about
*  this picture, so study it carefully. And they look at how people's eyes track across the picture.
*  To no one's surprise really, professional artists look at pictures very differently than non-artists
*  do. Regular human beings tend to look at people. They look at the faces of people,
*  they look at other animals. Artists who are trained are much better at giving equal attention
*  to different parts of the foreground and background of a picture. And this idea of
*  training our attention, I think, is really crucial to becoming more rational in this
*  complicated world with our imperfect brains. Let me just give you two examples that sort
*  of span the spectrum from science to high emotional impact human drama. On the science
*  end of things, there's the question of interpretations of quantum mechanics. This question has its own
*  human drama in it also, but it's one of my favorite scientific questions. You might know
*  that quantum mechanics is our best theory of how the world works at a deep level. You might also
*  know that physicists don't agree on what it is that quantum mechanics says fundamentally about
*  what reality is and how it works. So we have competing formulations of the theory. My favorite
*  formulation is what's called the many worlds formulation. I'm writing a book about that. I'm
*  sure we'll talk about it in the podcast. But the basic idea is that when you make a quantum
*  measurement, there's different possible outcomes and each one of those outcomes becomes real in
*  a separate world. Now there's many reasons to like this, to not like it, good reasons, bad reasons.
*  I think that one of the reasons why some people don't like it, which maybe is not what they
*  articulate but is nevertheless there, is that in this many worlds formulation there's a huge gap
*  between the mathematical formalism and the world we immediately see. If you ask someone who believes
*  in many worlds what is nature at its most fundamental level, they'll tell you something
*  like it is a quantum state described by a vector in a very high dimensional complex Hilbert space.
*  And an ordinary person will say I don't get it. The world around me has tables and chairs and
*  objects and things like that. Where are those things? Where is space-time itself in your
*  abstract quantum formalism? So there are competing formulations of quantum mechanics where the
*  tangible things of everyday life are much more front and center, much more evident where they're
*  located in the formalism. And I think that there's a matter of taste that comes in here. If what you
*  care about most, if what you pay attention to most in a scientific theory is the directness
*  with which that theory accounts for the world that you see around you, then you're going to try to
*  favor an interpretation of quantum mechanics that puts those aspects right in the foreground. If
*  what you care about more in a scientific theory is the underlying formalism, is it powerful, is it
*  simple, is it mathematically elegant, then many worlds is your bet. Everyone agrees, even people
*  who don't think that many worlds is right, everyone agrees that its underlying formalism is as simple
*  as you can possibly get. So there is a matter of taste. It's not just a matter of equations or
*  experimental data. Because we're talking about two different theories, we don't know which one is
*  right. Someday we'll figure out which one is right. But until we do, your personal what you pay
*  attention to question is really, really important when we favor or disfavor one version of quantum
*  mechanics over the other. The other end of the spectrum, let's look at sexual harassment. You may
*  know this is 2018. There's been a lot of effort recently, a lot of news about people in very high
*  profile places who have been accused of sexual harassment with enormous amounts of evidence
*  against them, really credible accusations of sexual harassment. And they've gotten in trouble
*  for this and rightfully so. And this has been true, especially, you know, we've heard about
*  Hollywood, but it's also been true in physics and astronomy and academia. A famous example is
*  Geoffrey Marcy, who was an exoplanet researcher. He looked at planets around other stars, the
*  other than the sun, and he was very famous in line for the Nobel Prize. He was very successful. And
*  a couple years ago, it came to light that he was a serial sexual harasser going back many, many
*  years. There's enormous amounts of evidence against him and he resigned his position at UC Berkeley,
*  etc. But when the news first broke, there was an email that went around to the faculty at Berkeley
*  from the department chair, so his boss in some sense, and the email I'll quote what it said,
*  it said, of course, this is hardest for Geoff in this moment. For those who are willing and able,
*  he certainly can use any understanding or support you may offer. Now other people pointed out fairly
*  quickly that maybe a sexual harassment situation is actually not hardest on the harasser, maybe it's
*  hardest on the victims of the harassment. People who might have had their lives ruined, left the
*  field, really suffered from depression or questioned who they were or whatever. If something like this
*  has happened for many, many years, it can be very devastating to many other people. And yet that was
*  not what occurred to the department chair when he was writing this letter. What occurred to him was
*  his friend and colleague was going to be upset, and that is correct. I'm sure he was upset, I'm sure it
*  was hard on him. The difference is what are you paying attention to? I think this goes beyond the
*  specific example. I don't think even the department chair was especially evil or conniving about it.
*  I think it's a simple matter that when we're faced with a situation like this, our attention
*  immediately leaps somewhere, right? When we hear that someone famous or someone we respected or
*  knew personally has been accused of something terrible, does our attention immediately go to
*  the victims of that terrible thing they did? Or does our attention immediately go to, well, what
*  about them? What about the person being accused? Was it a wrongful accusation? Are they being treated
*  fairly? And there's no right or wrong here. In some sense, we can all learn to sympathize across
*  the board a little bit better than we do. But this underlying issue of what we pay attention to,
*  what matters to us, is to me a crucially important part of being more rational,
*  of understanding the world better. I'm hopeful this will be a theme in the podcast across the
*  episodes, not just what is this good idea or what is this interesting finding, a little bit less of
*  this sort of whiz-bang, latest news from the science frontier kind of stuff, and more like,
*  why are we doing this? Why are we thinking about this? Why is this interesting to us? Why is this
*  important? And hopefully, as I said along the way, not only will I learn things, but I might even
*  change my mind. I could be wrong about any of my favorite ideas. So it will certainly be useful
*  for me. I'm hoping it will be equally interesting for you people out there. At the very least,
*  I think the journey will be a lot of fun. Thanks for joining along.
