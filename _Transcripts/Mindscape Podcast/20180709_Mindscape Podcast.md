For the first full episode of Mindscape, it's an honor to welcome social psychologist Carol Tavris. Her book with co-author Eliot Aronson,  Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), explores the effect that cognitive dissonance has on how we think. We talk about the fascinating process by which people justify the mistakes that they make, and how that leads to everything from false memories to political polarization.

# Episode 1: Carol Tavris on Mistakes, Justification, and Cognitive Dissonance
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 09, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j055VZN8Xys)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean
*  Carroll and I have a confession to make, namely I have made mistakes. Over the
*  course of my career as a scientist and a writer, for that matter over the course
*  of my life as a human being, when faced with decisions I have sometimes made the
*  wrong choice. Maybe you have too. And happily we have on today's podcast the
*  perfect person to talk about this idea that people make mistakes, Dr. Carol
*  Tavris, who's one of the world's experts not on making mistakes or the ways that
*  we make mistakes, but on what happens after we make mistakes. In a masterful
*  book that she wrote with her co-author Elliot Aronson called Mistakes Were Made
*  But Not By Me, Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts,
*  Dr. Tavris talks about the idea of cognitive dissonance and how we are
*  forced by cognitive dissonance to come up with excuses and justifications for
*  the mistakes that we make. We might like to imagine that we are perfectly
*  rational, reasonable beings, but the psychological truth is very much the
*  opposite of that. We make up reasons why something was the right choice after all
*  or why we couldn't have had any other option but to make it. Cognitive
*  dissonance theory explains why we do this and in some sense it's the mother of
*  all cognitive biases. It helps us understand why we're not the perfect
*  rational reasonable people that we pretend to be. And Carol Tavris is a
*  perfect person to talk about this with. She's the author of several popular
*  books and also a famous textbook on psychology that you might have used in
*  your intro psych course way back in the day. Other books include Psycho Babble
*  and Biobunk using psychology to think critically about issues in the news, The
*  Mismasure of Women, Why Women are Not the Better Sex, the Inferior Sex, or the
*  Opposite Sex, and in September she has a new book coming out called Estrogen
*  Matters, Why Taking Hormones and Menopause Can Improve Women's Well-being and
*  Lengthen Their Lives Without Raising the Risk of Breast Cancer. Now I have to
*  confess I'm not an expert on either estrogen or menopause or hormones so
*  that's not what we're talking about in this podcast but then again maybe that
*  is a mistake that I'm making. That's what we will be talking about how we make
*  mistakes so maybe I should read up on estrogen and hormones that we can bring
*  Dr. Tavris back and have a conversation about that. Today we're going to be
*  talking about cognitive dissonance and why it makes us think that we never
*  actually really make mistakes so let's start.
*  Carol Tavris, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Very happy to be talking with
*  you. So you're a social psychologist right? Is that the correct descriptor? It
*  is. As opposed to cognitive psych, what are the different kinds of psychologists
*  one could be? Alright, hardly anyone knows what a social psychologist is. They think
*  you know you're a therapist who gives a lot of parties, you know, you're just very
*  sociable. You're social, that's what it must be. Social psychology was a field
*  born at the intersection of sociology, the study of groups and society and the
*  individual and fundamentally it is the study of every social influence on human
*  beings which is to say everything. Influences on how we think, how we
*  behave, influences of the environment on our behavior, influences of our thinking,
*  culture. The thing that's interesting about social psychology to me is that
*  it's the field that really looks at something that many Americans don't like
*  which is the idea that we really are influenced by our environments in ways
*  that we don't realize and don't really want to realize because after all we're
*  all individualists, we make up our own mind, we're very independent. American
*  dream. The American dream. So I always found social psychology wonderfully
*  interesting and rich because there's no topic it does not cover from love to
*  hate. My dear co-author and very good friend Elliot Aronson said that when he
*  was a student he was drawn to social psychology because clinical psychology
*  is about repair but social psychology is about change. It's a more optimistic
*  approach to the world because by understanding how we as individuals and
*  how what is happening in our world influence us we can actually take some
*  steps to improve things. But you don't see patients. No. So you're not, that would be a
*  clinical psychologist. That would be a clinical psychologist. The field of
*  psychology, we actually speak about the difference between the way clinical
*  psychologists are trained or I should say psychotherapists are trained and the
*  way psychological scientists are trained. This creates what we speak of as the
*  scientist practitioner gap if you will because many psychotherapists, which by
*  the way is an unregulated word, you know you you could put out a shingle tomorrow
*  doing broccoli therapy and it would be completely legal but please don't do
*  that. Not broccoli, not broccoli really. So psychotherapy anybody could be
*  anything and call themselves a psychotherapist. Clinical psychologists
*  have a PhD in that field of clinical psychology and their field is to study
*  psychological disorders and problems. Their training varies from very good
*  scientific training to zero. Okay. So the rest of psychology, the psychological
*  sciences if you will, specify particular areas of study. So developmental
*  psychologists study development from the infant to death. Social psychologists do
*  what I just described. Cognitive psychologists study the mind, thinking,
*  memory and so forth. So those are different specialties within psychological
*  science but most people to this day when they hear psychologists they think
*  you're a therapist. Yeah they think that there's a couch. Absolutely and not just
*  a therapist by the way. The couches have been out for decades, decades. Nobody
*  has a couch. Well there you go. That's your shingle. Your therapy can have the couch if you want.
*  How about chocolate instead of broccoli? Chocolate therapy, couches, candles, the
*  whole bit. In our textbook that Carol Wade and I did for so many
*  years we actually proposed chocolate immersion therapy as probably the most
*  beneficial thing you could do. If I weren't so damned ethical I could be really rich.
*  We all have that problem exactly and so you have various arrows in your quiver.
*  I know you've written a number of books but you've written one of my favorite
*  books of all time, Mistakes Were Made but Not by Me and this is on the subject of
*  cognitive dissonance. So why don't you tell us a little bit about number one
*  you have a co-author who you already mentioned, Elliot Aaronson and how the
*  book came to be and what cognitive dissonance is. In one sentence or three?
*  You get all the hours you want. I have many sentences. Well so I guess first I should say what cognitive
*  dissonance is. Every social psychology student learned this. I did when I was in
*  graduate school a million years ago. It's a simple mechanism but it's
*  developed over the decades into a really rich theory of understanding why it is
*  that when you tell somebody in a kind and warm and friendly way, here's some
*  information that shows why you're wrong, they rarely thank you. They tell you
*  where you can go with your findings and what you can do with them and they're
*  just not inclined to be grateful. No idea what you're talking about. You've never experienced this.
*  So you know my friends still say to me to this day, oh Carol you're so delusionally
*  dear to think that just by explaining to people here's an important finding you
*  need to know that they are not always grateful. So all the cognitive dissonance
*  really means is that it's the uncomfortable feeling we have when two
*  ideas clash with each other, conflict with each other. It can be two ideas, two
*  beliefs or it can be more commonly an attitude and behavior. So the classic
*  example is smoking. A person who smokes knows that smoking is dangerous and
*  stupid so they will be in a state of dissonance. I smoke but I'm doing
*  something dangerous and stupid. This discomfort is cognitive dissonance and
*  Leon Festinger who developed this theory in the late 50s described it as being as
*  uncomfortable as being hungry or thirsty. It's so uncomfortable that you're really
*  motivated to reduce it in whatever way you can. Well if you're a smoker you need
*  to quit smoking or you need to justify smoking. You need to say well it's
*  unhealthy but I'll be thin and being thin is good. Besides Aunt Myrtle lived to be 97.
*  I look cool. I look really cool. So cognitive dissonance, you know I don't
*  think I took it terribly seriously. I thought it was really an interesting
*  theory but I didn't have much appreciation of its depth of application
*  and then after George Bush got us into the Iraq War, Elliot and I were sitting
*  around talking about... Sorry which George Bush and which Iraq War? W. So this was
*  2003. So several years later when it was abundantly clear that the
*  justifications for going into Iraq were completely wrong there were no weapons
*  of mass destruction and so forth and of course the whole country had noticed
*  that Bush did not say gee we were wrong so sorry we made a really bad mistake
*  about spending a trillion dollars and going into Iraq. Instead he found other
*  justifications for the war. Well we're bringing democracy to the region and so
*  forth. So Elliot and I are having this conversation and he said you know he
*  said I disagree with those Democrats who thought that Bush was lying to the
*  country. He said I don't think he was lying to the country. I think he was
*  lying to himself. He was doing what all of us do when we have made a decision to
*  do something is we screen out discrepant dissonant information that suggests our
*  decision is wrong. We focus, we cherry-pick the information that tells us
*  our decision is the right one and we go forth. So we make the decision and then
*  we justify it. He said I think that George Bush had made the decision to go
*  into Iraq and therefore ignored the arguments from his own intelligence
*  community that that might not be a good thing to do and I said my goodness I
*  said and from that conversation because that war was so devastating to our
*  country and so palpably wrong we thought well how do we want to analyze this how
*  do we want to talk about this and from that conversation came the idea to do a
*  book that would apply the many domains of our lives in which the need to reduce
*  dissonance gets us into terrible terrible trouble not just politically but
*  in our relationships in our understanding of memory in therapy in
*  really every aspect of our lives. Right yeah so one of the things and we could
*  do an entire podcast on just this but your book is filled with these wonderful
*  juicy examples of people being in possession of an idea faced with new
*  information that conflicts with that idea and coming up with the
*  justification so I have many questions but let's just give a reward to our
*  podcast listeners by telling them some of these juiciest examples in love in
*  the law right in like you said politics already doomsday cults is one of the
*  best well what doomsday cults well doomsday cults yes two filmmakers in
*  England actually made a little film about a doomsday guy who predicted the
*  end of the world doomsday is particularly it's a particularly good
*  story because it was one of the stories that got Leon Festinger involved with
*  his whole notion of cognitive dissonance which was this he got involved with a
*  cult many years ago I'm sorry he was the originator of the idea yes Leon
*  Festinger he was a social psychologist at Stanford so what years are we talking
*  here in late 50s okay late 50s and Festinger and two colleagues infiltrated
*  a doomsday cult in which a woman whom they called Marion Keach predicted that
*  the world would end on December 21st of that year and they they know they joined
*  this group now what they found was so when they joined the group they were
*  pretending to pretend to be believers pretending to be believers so there were
*  several people there were many people who believed the world was going to come
*  to an end now if you believe the world's gonna come to an end you could
*  do one of two things you could sit quietly in your house and wait for the
*  world to end or you could proselytize you could sell your house and your cow
*  and go off and live with Marion Keach on you know go go be with her on the night
*  of the great event or chocolate immersion therapy it wasn't invented yet
*  what's the matter with you all right if you invent the doomsday cult I will
*  offer them this fine it's a lot healthier and safer by the way do
*  the doomsday cult so so they go to sit with her on the night of December 21st
*  meanwhile her husband slept soundly through the whole night having not
*  believed one single word of this fine at 2 a.m. at 2 a.m. there's no sign of any
*  magic spaceship coming to whisk them away and save them you see they were
*  gonna be saved because they understood that the world was coming to an end no
*  spaceship nothing's happening what to do what to do and finally very late
*  mrs. Keach has a vision and the vision is that the world has been saved because
*  of the devout belief of her little band right this is a lot better way to reduce
*  dissonance between I just made the stupidest mistake I could ever have made
*  what kind of an idiot am I to have made this prediction this allows you to think
*  of yourself as a smart kind and wonderful person and have your prediction
*  fail this is the essence of what Elliott Aronson did in advancing the theory of
*  dissonance by turning it into a theory of self justification tooth two ideas
*  can be dissonant you know you like Woody Allen films and your friend doesn't like
*  Woody Allen films and so you might try to decide your friend is it's okay to be
*  stupid about what the Alan films or whatever it might be but the distance
*  that most stings is when information about a belief or something that we've
*  done directly causes us to question our self-concept something about ourselves
*  that we feel is really important about ourselves if you criticize something
*  about me that I don't consider important or I don't think I'm good at
*  well so what you can deal with that but if you show me how I've not been
*  skeptical about something I really should have been skeptical about I've
*  let gullibility take over I'm going to be really embarrassed and I'm going to
*  try to reduce that dissonance either by defending myself and by dismissing the
*  evidence that I've been a gullible fool so that's why it's so important to
*  understand how dissonance works because when the self-concept is threatened I'm
*  a good worthy smart person and now you're telling me I've done something
*  bad cruel harmful and wrong well piss off and take your information with you to me
*  one of the most important findings of this theory is that it explains why
*  people who are good compassionate caring people will often find themselves
*  continuing practices that are wrong harmful and outdated precisely because
*  they see themselves as good kind compassionate people I'm a doctor you're
*  telling me that this thing I've been doing in my practice for 20 years is
*  harming my patients the hell it is I'm a good competent doctor so I'm gonna keep
*  doing this and you give examples for example of in the legal system people
*  being found guilty by prosecutors but then obviously exculpatory evidence
*  comes along clearly mistakes have been made and yet the people who did the
*  prosecutions or the detectives who arrested the person in the first place
*  don't see it that way they do not because they're the good guys by
*  definition prosecutors and police are the good guys we're the ones in the
*  those bad people are bad and now you're telling me that I a good person put
*  another good person in prison well that's not even possible therefore okay
*  so if he didn't commit this particular crime he certainly committed other
*  crimes and so but I'm not doing anything wrong anyway I mean that truly is their
*  reasoning the the inability to I mean of course there are many venal and reasons
*  that people might not admit mistakes that's not what we're we're talking
*  about I mean people will fail to admit a mistake because they don't want to be
*  fired they don't want to be fine they don't want to go to prison I mean that's
*  those are obvious reasons that people lie dissonance explains why we lie to
*  ourselves that's why it's so pernicious and so dangerous and so important to
*  understand and so we've done politics and the law and doomsday cults love
*  lights marriages does it ever happen that we are dissident in a personal no
*  okay good okay just check now one more thing about the law though because this
*  is so important throughout the legal system and in the military once people
*  believe that they are interrogating a guilty person nothing that person does
*  or says will disconfirm their belief this is true of the psychotherapists
*  and social workers who believe that they could tell if a child had been sexually
*  abused say if the child admitted it well the child had been abused but if the
*  child denied it well the child was in denial so there was no way if you are
*  convinced that you know what has really happened in a situation with a child or
*  a suspect or a convict or anybody everything that person does will
*  confirm your belief to make your belief consonant with what you're doing it's
*  the way that's many police officers are even trend detectives are trained in
*  interviewing is if a suspect seems nervous that's a sign of guilt what if
*  it's a sign of nervousness because you've just been arrested and you're
*  innocent yeah there might be alternative explanations exactly which they are not
*  trained to think of that's right and and that parallels what he said about George
*  W and the Iraq war and but clearly in our it's not just high stakes courtroom
*  dramas in our everyday lives in our personal lives in marriages this is
*  going to be something where our partner accuses us of a certain kind of behavior
*  maybe there's a twinge of truth to that accusation and we're able to justify it
*  somehow yes we are aren't we yes yes indeed well Elliot puts it this way he
*  said here's how it works he said you fall in love and the person is the most
*  wonderful person it this person is just adorable everything about this person is
*  a lovable thing you are in a state of blissful consonance because everything
*  this person does conforms to what you think the ideal partner should be then a
*  tiny blip occurs on the landscape of love wait crab grass in the lawn of life
*  whatever it might be and your beloved turns out to have a habit that you
*  really don't like so much you know you like getting places 20 minutes early and
*  your beloved likes to get there two days late right this okay now at first what
*  people do is just dismiss this dissonant information about the perfection of the
*  beloved and say it's really not important and most of the time it's not
*  but what happens next is going to be key for how couples maintain their
*  relationship in the sense that all of us do things that the other person is
*  annoyed by or doesn't agree with and then the question is whether you come to
*  see those things as as behaviors that are too dissonant to live with or
*  whether you reduce dissonance by saying you know what this person is so
*  wonderful in so many other ways that this particular problem is trivial and
*  I can live with this but those are the negotiations we do all through our lives
*  you can see what happens when people have made the decision to divorce is
*  suddenly they they have a meant they have a little memory surgery and
*  immediately forget everything they ever once loved about the person and now
*  everything about the person is demonic terrible and wrong and I always knew
*  forever that this person was the worst possible person well no you didn't a
*  switch flips right a switch flips and the switch flips because now you are
*  seeking to be consonant in your view that this person is too damn terrible to
*  live with any further and so everything then gets rewritten to conform to the
*  new story in my book the big picture I talk about similar ideas because I'm
*  trying to talk about some kind of coherence in one's view of the world so
*  I introduced the idea of a planet of belief that you have a set of beliefs
*  that are kind of like rocks or asteroids that come together under a mutual
*  gravitational pull because they seem you know to fit together and you have you
*  develop a coherent view of how to look at the world and this is your planet of
*  belief and these planets develop their defense mechanisms right if something
*  comes along a stray rock from outer space that threatens to undermine the
*  integrity of the planet you try to blast it out of space right you don't try to
*  fit it in necessarily and it's very interesting why cosmological dissonance
*  here I think so it's very interesting I mean you might say given these examples
*  why don't people just change their minds right right is it just a matter of it's
*  too much work like why don't they get a new worldview is it is it all about
*  status and their self-image or does it go deeper than that well it's both of
*  those things it depends what the worldview is about in particular so and
*  how important it is to you whether this is really a worldview that governs how
*  you see the world and how you behave in that world and we all have our narratives
*  as the trendy word now is our stories that govern our lives as George Govner
*  once said we're the only species that tells stories and lives by the stories
*  we tell that's really the key thing so for example if we can see this with with
*  memories everybody comes up with a story of their lives I was raised this way
*  this is the kind of person I am this is what happened to me that has made me
*  what I am today that story is often a very powerful one because it explains to
*  us who we are so now I come along and say to you you know what that memory you
*  have of what your father did to you when you were seven turns out that didn't
*  happen at all that way and it's jarring it's jarring to learn that a memory you
*  have that seems to fit the story you tell about your life isn't so that's why
*  we get so upset to learn that our memories are fallible and are wrong so
*  as I said earlier in Elliott's view about the dissonance that hurts the most is
*  the dissonance that most blows up the planet if you will that most questions
*  something we've so we've lived by whether it's religion or atheism or a
*  life story a belief about why we are the way we are and moreover where it's not
*  just changing one idea but change but where one idea is going to pull out a
*  thread that's going to unravel the whole thing so these ideas of cognitive
*  dissonance it's slightly different but clearly related to cognitive biases that
*  we have right the little bugs in our reasoning capacities that motivate us to
*  think one way or the other motivated reasoning my brain is not giving me any
*  cognitive bias he's on top of my head confirmation bias well that's the key
*  one well cognitive dissonance is based on and I want to say that this is a
*  theory of mental functioning that has more than 2,000 experiments supporting
*  it in every aspect of social and cognitive psychology it has a lot of
*  evidence underlying it and one reason is that that the component cognitive biases
*  really are subsumed under it in a way that is cognitive dissonance rests on a
*  number of particular biases one is the confirmation bias which we might call
*  the consonants bias I'm going to look for information that confirms what I
*  believe and will keep me in a state of consonance and I'm going to dismiss and
*  throw out and tell you you're a jerk if you give me infinite evidence that's
*  dissonant right so the confirmation bias is key to how we keep our thoughts
*  consonant there's the the bias that we're not biased that is a very good
*  bias I really love that bias Lee Ross's I don't have that bias I think it is the
*  cutest bias ever but you see it think how it plays out you and I are having an
*  argument I am an unbiased person therefore if I can just sit here and
*  tell you why you're wrong and I'm right you will understand that you are wrong
*  and I am right and that will be fine because you are biased and I'm not and
*  we'll have a lovely conversation only I understood that progress would be made
*  there you go and the fact that you do not accept what I have told you and
*  instead have your own beliefs oh unthinkable that means you're biased and
*  I'm not I mean it's it's a central filter of how we get through our days
*  and it is the reason that quarrels and arguments not only continue but escalate
*  because the determination to show that other person why they're wrong why
*  they're wrong and you're not continues so many of the information biases that
*  govern us in a way can be subsumed under this overarching need to be
*  consonant to keep our beliefs uniform and motivating I mean motivated reasoning
*  is is exactly the more recent term for this as Elliott says every few years
*  somebody renames dissonance theory something else so that they can get
*  their publications and to show why it's not cognitive dissonance at all it's
*  their new thing well that's the same thing so I mean in some sense this is
*  we'd rather be coherent than right mm-hmm that's how our brains work anyway
*  you wouldn't say that out loud but sort of under the hood this is the machinery
*  working to make everything smooth out remove the conflicts wherever we can yes
*  and and we would add that that is evolutionarily speaking a very adaptive
*  strategy you don't want to keep changing your mind four times before
*  breakfast you don't want to sit there saying hmm should I brush my teeth
*  although then you read a study of flossing and you think I'm just being
*  silly but if we had to change our minds with everything that came along every
*  day we wouldn't get anything done and so we choose what kind of package of
*  hold and for the most part spend our energy following those then then
*  investigating every new thing that might presumably there is some evolutionary
*  pressure to be correct about the world also but there is clearly a trade-off
*  right somehow whether it's there might be some physics explanation for this I'm
*  not sure some Bayesian reasoning some efficiency some thermodynamics
*  explanation but coherence like you say somehow the coherence of the worldview
*  has been so important as we've gone through the generations that that is is
*  almost utmost when we try to make sense of the world well that's right and of
*  course so many of the things that evolved to suit us when we lived in
*  tribes little little bands were effective ways of keeping us rooted to
*  and connected to our tribe mates and of course the corollary of that is that
*  anyone who is not in our tribe was an enemy who had to be stomped out
*  immediately and their beliefs are definitely wrong okay so happy you've
*  all passed that yes indeed so those were you know adaptive strategies for thinking
*  and behaving but they don't always service well today and you pointed out
*  that there's almost an inverse correlation in our ability to deal with
*  these cognitive biases with how smart somebody is their intelligence or their
*  level of self-esteem if the better you are at reasoning the better it turns
*  out you are at reconciling these dissonances in a way that doesn't change
*  your mind oh now reconciling the differences better at justifying just
* ifying yourself yeah yeah exactly it's you know it's it's your most skeptical
*  skeptics don't tell me I've been gullible or the people who think of
*  themselves as being most competent in a particular sphere who are going to
*  resist being told they put an innocent guy in prison or they've just killed a
*  patient and so forth of course I want to make it clear there are many many
*  exceptions of people who really want to improve how they do their jobs and how
*  they live in the world but they are not generally the majority I would like to
*  mention because I find so many people have found this metaphor to be really
*  helpful in their lives so I'll mention it now we call it in the book the pyramid
*  of choice and as I say it's been very touching to me to find people have
*  written and said I know this really works for me so it started because
*  somebody did a study a long time ago of school children they were kids and this
*  question is what's your view of cheating so imagine a pyramid or a triangle if
*  we're two-dimensional here at the top of this pyramid and your views you you and
*  your pal have the same views of cheating you don't think it's a great thing to do
*  but it's not the worst crime in the world okay you're neutral about cheating
*  now you're taking a test it's really an important test it's the final exam your
*  grade is going to depend on this exam we all know how students are if I don't
*  pass this everything will go south my cat will leave me you know you've seen
*  this in my world will end okay but you freeze on a crucial question you do not
*  know how to answer this question your grade is gonna you're gonna fail this is
*  horrible and suddenly the student next to you makes her answer abundantly clear
*  and so you have in one second cheat or don't cheat now so in this study some of
*  the kids were given a situation which they were able to cheat some not so
*  forth and here's what they found the second you make that decision even
*  impulsively you cheat some you cheat because the grade is really important
*  you don't cheat because your integrity is more important now the minute you
*  make that decision you must make your behavior and your belief about cheating
*  consonant so if you cheat your attitude will now shift to be cheating is really
*  not such a bad thing everybody cheats it's not important and I'll never cheat
*  again if you resist the impulse to cheat you say wait a minute cheating is not a
*  victimless crime we all suffer from it it's a terrible thing cheaters are bad
*  so in our in our metaphor of this pyramid you make that first step down
*  the pyramid you cheat or you don't cheat over time what happens is you become
*  more and more entrenched in your view of cheating as a good thing or a bad thing
*  until over time if you are both at the bottom of this pyramid standing far
*  apart from each other in your views about cheating the one who cheated will
*  think it's completely trivial and not important at all and the one who
*  resisted will want to hang you by your ankles outside the school door having
*  started almost the same belief state having started exactly and what's really
*  interesting about this when you visualize it you can see how difficult it
*  is to go back up and say wait a minute I was wrong to cheat and that's why I mean
*  there are many metaphors for this with slippery slope and so forth but it by
*  seeing it in a dissonance way in a self-justification way you can see how
*  hard it becomes to go back and say you know that little jump that little random
*  thing I did has led me far from what my original views of cheating were so that
*  metaphor applies to so many decisions that we make in our everyday lives
*  from an impulsive decision somebody's accused of rape or accused of some other
*  horrible act and what do we do as citizens reading the newspaper or the
*  I just say reading the newspaper please forgive me I'm so sorry what is a
*  newspaper okay but we all listening to the podcast listening to the podcast we
*  all make impulsive decisions that person's guilty or that person's
*  innocent and then we don't want to hear we don't want to wait for God forbid
*  evidence oh please suggesting that we're right or wrong and so we see these in
*  today's world where everybody instantly jumps to an opinion about everything
*  without necessarily waiting for evidence or further information and that's how
*  quickly you can get enmeshed in justifying that initial jump off the
*  pyramid and when you turn out to be wrong not so easy to say I love the
*  pyramid of choice I think I'm in the crowd who once you explained it to me
*  was like oh my goodness that just explains so many things you know the
*  faculty at Duke University when that lacrosse team was accused of raping the
*  stripper that they'd hired and so forth and the the faculty 80 members of the
*  faculty took out a full-page ad saying you know the culture of the rape culture
*  of our athletic teams and so forth is disgraceful da da da da da in other
*  words assuming that the allegations against the team were accurate and when
*  they turned out not to be and when they were false yeah they were false and when
*  the district attorney was disbarred for not sharing appropriate information with
*  the defense was there a letter from the faculty saying gee we made a mistake you
*  know we shouldn't have been so quick to judgment maybe we should have waited for
*  the evidence that's been that many letters that's so many human history yes
*  this is related to what I'm sure is a cognitive bias I've not seen it talked
*  about in psychology or whatever but when dealing with probabilities human
*  beings are very bad at estimating probabilities but also they're very bad
*  at accepting that probabilities go from zero to 100% right I think that when
*  faced with something that might happen you're not sure it's going to happen it
*  seems to me people will only really deeply accept three possibilities that
*  the chance of this thing happening is 0% that it's not going to happen that it's
*  100% it's definitely going to happen or that it's 50% though we have no idea
*  whether it will happen or not the idea that it's 70% and that sometimes the 30%
*  thing happens I think that Nate Silver got in a lot of flack after Donald Trump
*  got elected because he gave something like a 70% chance that Hillary Clinton
*  would get elected and afterward he was like that wasn't wrong like 30% things
*  happen all the time and but we have this inability I think to correctly judge
*  probabilities that are not 50-50 or one or zero does that make sense is it
*  absolutely well and it's completely true and of course as we know when people
*  make decisions medical decisions right do I want this treatment it has a 10%
*  chance of success and a 90% chance of failure I mean we are asked to make
*  medical decisions often on the basis of likelihoods right and risks and it's
*  very hard to very often to make those decisions or we look at the the chance
*  of something happening rather than the chances of it not happening so that's a
*  that's a difficult skill to acquire but truly an important one a lot of poker
*  players have become very wealthy off of people's inability to correctly judge
*  these probabilities and probably also the same the pyramid of choice also feeds
*  into the idea of not only how we justify our own beliefs but how we view others
*  you know our this goes back to the couples divorcing right like you were
*  in love with this person at one point now you decide you don't want to be with
*  them anymore and they're now Satan and talking to other people about them
*  afterward must lead these people to say well why were you ever in love with this
*  person right but it helped but but you change how you view the other you change
*  on their side that's right well what you say is we have this guy in our book who's
*  a friend of Elliot's who having left his wife of 37 years said to her said to her
*  I never really loved you well really no for the first 35 years he did right so I
*  just found online this thing's just been going around how Democrats and
*  Republicans view each other so not how they view themselves but how they think
*  actually that's I think the study did ask how they view themselves but who cares
*  about that those are more or less accurate but they ask questions you know
*  they asked Republicans what percentage of Democrats are agnostics or atheists
*  the correct answer is about nine percent and the answer given by Republicans was
*  ninety-six percent of 36 percent yeah some reasonability there the one I liked
*  was how many Democrats are gay or lesbian and 38 percent is you know the
*  average Republican thinks over a third of Democrats are gays or lesbians and
*  the correct answer is closer to six percent and the same thing for blacks
*  and union members but to be very very honest the Republicans bad ideas about
*  Democrats were less crazy than Democrats bad ideas about Republicans so how many
*  Republicans are 65 or older Democrats thought it was 44 percent of Republicans
*  are over the age of 65 which even a small amount of thinking probably the
*  numbers don't really work out that way right it's closer to 20 percent and my
*  favorite how many Republicans they also thought Republicans tended to be
*  evangelical Southerners but they also thought the Republicans earned over
*  two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year the average Democrat thinks that 44
*  percent of Republicans earn more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a
*  year and the real number is two percent not forty-four percent and partly
*  misinformation but it has to be partly part of the cognitive distance story
*  right like we tell a caricature and story of the people we disagree with
*  that makes us look better
*  yes well yes I mean that you've packed a lot into that those answers stem from
*  stereotypes that we have of another group a group that we don't know much
*  about I mean I remember reading a story about some New Yorker who had moved to
*  Idaho and everybody in Idaho thought he was well you can imagine what they
*  thought of him a crazy liberal Jewish communist pinko gay guy I don't know but
*  the people in Idaho had no experience with New Yorkers they knew nothing
*  about New Yorkers and he goes to Idaho with plenty of assumptions and
*  expectations about people in Idaho they're all gun toting idiots or
*  whatever the hell he thought they were and what happens when you have people
*  living in the same community who have different opinions is that you see
*  diversity in attitudes and behavior amongst them my good friend and co-author
*  Carol Wade who lives in Northern California in a very gun toting
*  conservative area but she said we disagree politically but we see each
*  other as the real human beings that they are I see Republicans I disagree with
*  but they are caring members of their community and they are active in
*  feeding the poor and the hungry and they would stop by the side of the road if
*  you were in any kind of trouble to help you and so it's not stereotype thinking
*  so what asking questions like this of Democrats and Republicans is asking
*  about a stereotype right or something about that group that you don't like
*  they're rich they're gay they're crazy whatever I was just amused that
*  Democrats thought that so many Republicans were at once really rich
*  and also evangelical southerners. I'm quite sure that it all fits together.
*  Logic and coherence do not enter into stereotyping you should know that by now.
*  But yeah and I think that maybe does this help also explain I don't even want
*  to open the Pandora's box but social media and how vitriolic things are and
*  how we respond viscerally and badly to the slightest amount of disagreement
*  online because we don't appreciate the humanity of the people behind the words
*  right it's not a face-to-face conversation all you're seeing is this
*  one little snippet of belief or opinion and you can react instantly and badly to
*  it in a kind of safe way. Nobody counts to ten let alone a hundred and fifty
*  right you know the first book I wrote anger the misunderstood emotion a very
*  long time ago was an examination in part of the catharsis hypothesis the idea
*  that it's really good and healthy to express your anger when you feel angry
*  and it will reduce your heart rate then it will you'll prevent you from getting
*  ulcers and all kinds of other good things wrong. This was my first
*  experience with explaining kindly to people why these clinical assumptions
*  and Freudian notions about catharsis not only were wrong but harmful because the
*  more people express anger the angrier they get generally speaking and it
*  doesn't calm you down it riles you up and so forth and in that book and
*  everyone instantly agreed and as you can see evidence yes I had wonderfully
*  interesting evidence and of course as you can see thanks to the diminution of
*  anger in our society that everybody that was your fault thanks yes so no they
*  told me what I could do with my ideas about catharsis one guy wrote to me and
*  said when my wife dents the car I want to yell at her I want to yell at her I
*  want her to feel even worse than she does therefore really the right
*  strategies to yell at something. So this one researcher had identified the
*  conditions under which the expression of anger is likely to be cathartic that is
*  to make you feel good conditions okay the first is no retaliation from the
*  target right so you say to your sweetie you are a toad and the target says
*  you're right you know I really am a toad okay so if there's no retaliation that's
*  good game you are anonymous so the target can't respond to you your anger
*  is proportional to the offense so if somebody does something trivial and you
*  hit them with a howitzer you're gonna be embarrassed and sort of overkill but if
*  you feel your response is the appropriate righteous thing you're gonna
*  feel good so that's the gist of these conditions all of which are met by the
*  internet you get to just rant immediately you get to zap somebody you
*  get to be self-righteously satisfied I showed that person what what and once
*  again people just failed to take my advice about this you know I wrote I
*  remember writing a letter to a columnist Russell Baker who was funny guy and he
*  wrote something that I disliked about the women's movement I don't even
*  remember what it was and I wrote him an angry letter I was terrific let me tell
*  you I was funny and smart and stupid because you know how you feel when you
*  writing something in anger hmm so I send him this letter and he sent it back
*  to me edited he had written in the margins and commented and basically of
*  course I get this thing back and I realized how really rude I'd been and
*  how I was not gonna persuade him of anything in my rudeness and so then I
*  replied I'm sorry this is not what I meant to say let's try again I sent him
*  that one and he wrote back and said I think this could be the beginning of a
*  lovely and civilized correspondence it was a great lesson for me because with
*  anger there's two reasons to be enraged one is you want to punish the other
*  person and the other is you'd like to change the other person or fix the
*  problem between you and a lot of people confuse those motives I think and this
*  brings us to the question of what can we learn from cognitive dissonance theory
*  about how to actually change people's minds if that were to be our goal I
*  think as you're implying sometimes that's not our goal sometimes we just
*  want to let loose a little bit right and maybe we should squelch that impulse but
*  sometimes we want to reach people knowing that people are defensive about
*  their existing views and knowing that they want to justify themselves does
*  that give us a clue as to how to be better persuader it gives us a very
*  important clue one that's not always successful of course we can do better
*  with our own views perhaps than trying to change the other guys but the the
*  rule the guiding rule number one is do not make the other person feel stupid
*  for what they believe and this is of course what people do what's the matter
*  with you what were you thinking when you did that how could you spend five
*  thousand dollars on magazine subscriptions you know what are you an
*  idiot well what is the person gonna say you have now exquisitely put them in a
*  terrible state of dissonance between I'm a smart person I spent these money
*  this money on magazine subscriptions because I'm hoping I'll win the lottery
*  and my children will have money forever my motive was a good one so when you
*  make people feel stupid for believing what they believe you guarantee that
*  they will hold on to that belief even more strongly you've just guaranteed it
*  so instead you look to understand or talk to the person about why they
*  believe what they do what it what that belief serves for them how it helps
*  them whether they themselves see any problems with it whether they see a
*  better way of getting what it is they want so that you don't make it an
*  adversarial I'm right and you're wrong because that one's gonna go nowhere for
*  me Anthony pin who's another podcast guest talks about giving people a soft
*  landing he talks about why certain communities have different beliefs that
*  they do and you say well you know what all you're telling them is that they're
*  idiots and that they're irrational they don't understand reason and evidence and
*  no one has ever been really persuaded by that that's exactly right he's he's put
*  it exactly in dissonance terms if you're gonna make me feel stupid I'm out of
*  here and by the way it may be that the accuser we the smart questioner really
*  don't understand what that belief is serving for the other person what they
*  gain by believing as they do how it comforts them how they've lived by it
*  how much investment of time and emotional energy they've put into that
*  belief one of Elliott's classic experiments severity of initiation on
*  liking for the group it's a famous funny study but basically what he found is
*  that the more work and pain and effort you put into joining a group the more
*  you're gonna like that group even if it turns out to be really a stupid and
*  uninteresting group so all of us have beliefs that we have spent a lot of time
*  and sometimes sometimes pain as well and investing I think for ourselves in
*  understanding dissonance the story we tell in our book which which I just love
*  because I think it's a it's such a good guideline for us all is this is a true
*  story when Ronald Reagan went to Bitburg Germany to lay a wreath there at the
*  cemetery where it turned out that 47 Nazi officers had been buried there was
*  an enormous protest over this he's going to this cemetery and honoring these
*  Nazi war dead and Reagan's good friend Shimon Peres then Prime Minister of
*  Israel was of course particularly outraged so were many others around the
*  world but Reagan didn't back down so someone asked Peres how do you feel
*  about the fact that your good friend Ronald Reagan went to Bitburg to do this
*  ceremony and Peres said when a friend makes a mistake the friend remains a
*  friend and the mistake remains a mistake that is the goal and how we ought to
*  think about cognitive dissonance because the usual impulse friend has made a
*  mistake is to drop the friend or minimize the mistake you can see this in
*  news reports all the time somebody we really think is a fabulous person has
*  been convicted of some crime or accused of something and we really you know
*  people don't know which which way to which way to go I know that guy I know
*  that's so sweet doesn't sound like him at all exactly or or you know them and or
*  the mistake please what he did oh it's just trivial you know 43 children really
*  you know so that's the usual thing that we do and we usually do that
*  unconsciously we make those those reductions of dissonance under the radar
*  to allow ourselves to feel comfortable because living with dissonance is
*  painful I want to go back to that point it's really uncomfortable Sarah
*  Silverman has a fantastic three-minute video that she did when her good close
*  friend Louis CK was discovered to have been committing these awful sexual acts
*  and she heard her video is a perfect statement of a person in dissonance she
*  says what he did was wrong it disgusts me and I hate it but he's been my very
*  good friend for many years I know what a great humanitarian he is what a great
*  father he is what a great friend he's been so she's able to separate these two
*  things and she said I don't know where I'm gonna resolve this but that that's
*  the struggle that's worth doing rather than throwing him under the bus or
*  minimizing his actions it's harder it's harder it seems to me like empathy is
*  important here I know Paul Bloom psychologist who I'm hoping to get as a
*  future podcast guest he wrote a book he had a brilliant idea let's write a book
*  called against empathy empathy is bad and very very roughly speaking his idea is
*  that it having empathy tends to be something we do for people who are like
*  us and therefore too much empathy pushes us away from the direction of reason
*  and rationality and thoughtfulness because it just makes us instantly
*  identify with other people but it sounds like if we're really trying to
*  understand people who seem to be doing something we don't understand ourselves
*  putting ourselves in their place understanding where they came from like
*  you said understanding the reasons why those beliefs are so valuable to them
*  would be useful to us well it is the question is the consequences of
*  understanding you know the French say to understand all is to forgive all no it
*  isn't no to understand all this to understand all period that's all it is
*  and then once you understand then you can decide do I want to forgive is this
*  important to forgive does my understanding give me greater compassion
*  for why this person has behaved as they have and make me more forgiving of it or
*  not that's a separate question and that's a moral issue a moral choice for
*  each of us but we all live by the attributions we make of other people's
*  behavior this is another big part of social psychology which is how the
*  explanations we make of why people do what they do affects everything so if you
*  think your beloved has been rude to you or thoughtless because your beloved's
*  had a horrible day at work and in Los Angeles a 19-hour commute home okay
*  you'll be more forgiving than if your attribution is to their personality
*  they're just the way they are and even talking to people in public if we want
*  to say this person disagrees with me is it because they have a principled
*  objection to what I'm saying or just because they have bad motives and are
*  not acting in good faith and clearly don't understand the force of my reason
*  exactly well it's why the goal really of what it means to be open-minded is to
*  make ourselves open to other people's points of view without the the the
*  dissonance reduction reaction is get that other point of view out of here I
*  don't want it in the room but when you can if you have to make important
*  decisions if you can surround yourself with people who aren't yay sayers who
*  aren't just going to agree with you but who might show you where you might be
*  wrong that's extremely useful and then we have the idea of persuading others we
*  also have the idea of fixing ourselves right I I've been in the crowd when
*  you've given talks to audiences TAM for example and it's amazing you know you
*  explain how cognitive dissonance makes people justify their mistakes and things
*  like that and everyone in the audience is going yes the people I disagree with
*  do justify the mistakes that way and almost no one says hmm maybe I am
*  justifying my mistakes like what is there a toolkit or a checklist or some
*  set of strategies we can have to notice when we're doing this when we're doing
*  this self-justifying behavior sure you notice that you're justifying your
*  behavior it's a really simple tool well that's we're so good right at coming up
*  with the excuse so when it's an excuse and when is it just a correct rational
*  reconstruction of why we're thinking in such a way oh well that's a very fine
*  question the one of the things that's been interesting to read the Amazon
*  reviews of our book is how many people say well I started out reading this book
*  and I was this explains all my friends then halfway through oh this explains
*  the government too and then at the end it oh it explains me I see science in
*  general as a form of arrogance control in the sense that it's one of the most
*  organized methods we have of forcing us to put our beliefs to the test and
*  forcing us to face dissonance if the test does not confirm what we believe
*  that's that's the method we have set up to test our beliefs and you don't have
*  to do a scientific experiment to do that to take some belief that you hold and
*  say well hmm really what is the evidence for this is there you know it's the
*  evidence changing what I once thought to be true I look back on my writing and
*  social psychology and I'm it's interesting to me how many ideas have
*  have changed irritatingly because the evidence has changed or has become more
*  persuasive I do I personally agree that you know acting as an informal scientist
*  is a good way to correct yourself against some of these biases like you
*  say much of the scientific method informal and crazy and non-systematic as
*  it is is about putting off the possibility that we will fool ourselves
*  one way or the other I'm always very amused as a cosmologist as a physicist
*  if I say something about the Big Bang or Einstein or relativity there's some
*  fraction of people out there in the world who will say oh you're just
*  defending the establishment views of the cosmos and I want to say you know all of
*  my incentives are in the other direction right like you don't become a famous
*  physicist by saying that Einstein was right the whole point the whole you know
*  incentive structure in science is to say the great people of the past were wrong
*  and we can do better than them and that's that's a wonderful sort of
*  self-corrective to try to do now on the other hand at the same time I realize
*  I'm telling a flattering story about myself because I'm saying that
*  scientists are the best at correcting their false impressions because they
*  have the scientific training in them well no scientists are human like
*  everybody else I think is that true I mean aren't you guys very flawed human
*  beings most of us there's a couple of outliers but yes so even scientists are
*  not always happy that the results when results don't come out the way they
*  would like them to I mean we all you know they'll say well that I guess I
*  didn't do that study well enough you know I bet I better redo that another 45
*  times till it comes out right right the ideal scientists we might all aspire to
*  but everybody knows the feeling of thinking you know how can I redo this
*  so it will come out the way I want it to come out but certainly empirically
*  there's a million examples of people doing exactly yeah yeah but indeed
*  science is self-correcting or at least it moves forward in certain lurching ways
*  and you're right people do have an incentive to find something new and
*  different to say I mean you know and in my field it's always so interesting to
*  me that all the studies that show that similarities between women and men and
*  personality traits or abilities and skills and so those never get published
*  is the differences that are sexy I want to know what what differences there are
*  and the news that there aren't differences isn't news and it isn't
*  interesting but but the the goal is to feel free enough to investigate
*  questions wherever they might lead and one of the problems of course we're
*  facing in our polarized society is that it's getting harder for people to do
*  that to question received wisdom certainly in the social sciences oh my
*  god you know to ask provocative questions to be a naysayer to right you
*  mention the brain did I mention about I think you mentioned the brain I think you
*  just did maybe I projected it on to you I don't know we've been talking in
*  psychological terms of course there's a sexy thing going on right now which is
*  the neuroscientific way of talking about these things actually looking in the
*  brain not just talking to the person but doing fMRI or MEG studies of what's
*  going on inside their head do these concepts of dissonance and
*  justification map on to parts of the brain is that a something that we aspire
*  to or we can say now or is just crazy yes yes and no yes number of researchers
*  have tracked cognitive dissonance into the brain they find out which parts of
*  the brain are lighting up light lighting up I love that language lighting up it's
*  it's an artificial light up but okay when the brain is in a state of dissonance
*  one of the cutest experiments was to have Democrats and Republicans process
*  information about their favorite political candidate positive information
*  about their favorite candidate positive information about the opponent oh that's
*  dissonant okay bad information about your guy you know and when they were in
*  a state of dissonance my guy did something bad the other guy did
*  something good you could see you could see it in their brains and he said they
*  said it was like when consonance was restored it was like twirling a met the
*  twirling a mental kaleidoscope to get the pieces to fit right people really
*  were happy when the pieces fit right that said I don't know what we've learned
*  from this that we didn't know otherwise and I'm very interested in brain
*  research of course but I've also written about pseudo neuroscience which is the
*  notion that if we just have a brain in there we're really doing science and very
*  often a lot of those studies are just somebody's got a scanner and I'm gonna
*  do what I can with it I love the term neuro bollocks for the temptation to
*  find things going on in the fMRI and the brain that likes rutabaga and what do
*  you know now that you didn't know before now of course neuroscience is very
*  important but it's also hard to do right right and maybe it's a little bit easy
*  to over claim what you're getting oh yes of course it is of course it is and you
*  know it's like really like all new technologies you know give a boy a
*  hammer and everything needs pounding give researchers a scanner and everything
*  needs scanning but what am I looking for and it's very early days we don't you
*  know we're pre Galileo right we're trying to collect data understand that
*  the brain is way more complicated in the solar system ever was but you also
*  mentioned or talked about the idea of memories and how memories aren't always
*  accurate and this is something that I first came to from neuroscience from
*  studies actually from I was studying the arrow of time the difference between the
*  past and the future and there was these wonderful studies and I don't pretend to
*  be able to judge the scientific credibility of various neuroscience
*  studies maybe it is neuro bollocks but here's what the study said that if you
*  put someone in fMRI machine so you're basically taking pictures of where the
*  blood is zooming around in their brain and you ask them to imagine a past
*  experience remember what it was like in your birthday last year what you know
*  where you were having dinner and whatever certain parts the brain light
*  up in excitement because you're turning around memory remembering this scene and
*  then you ask them to imagine the future scene imagine what your next birthday
*  will be like and you're somewhere else and so forth the claim was it's exactly
*  the same parts of the brain that are doing the same thing of course they're
*  doing something different but evolution is sort of cheap right evolution reuses
*  things that are that are already there maybe the hypothesis goes the way that
*  we learned to imagine the future is by taking advantage of the fact that we had
*  a part of the brain that could remember the past and just putting it to use
*  again and the idea being that the memory of the past is not a videotape right
*  it's not a recording that is stored as a jpeg file or an mpeg file somewhere
*  it's more like a screenplay and when we remember the past we download the
*  screenplay and put the play on again just like we do when we remember the
*  future when we imagine the future no it's more like it's more like cells of a
*  film where you have a you have a couple of those cells of a film and you are
*  you are interpolating the connecting elements in a strip of film in a film
*  strip which I didn't mean to interrupt you but I would say something a little
*  different which is when you're asking them to remember a past a childhood
*  birthday or imagine a future one you're you're imagining both of those things
*  you don't know that the recall of the birthdays is accurate what you're asking
*  for is tell me a story about what that birthday is that you think you remember
*  you're not actively or accurately retrieving every detail about that fifth
*  birthday party you have a few details about it you've seen pictures of it your
*  mother has told you what the color of the cake was you know or whatever it
*  might be mostly you've seen pictures of it and heard stories about it and so
*  you've made up a little memory of your fifth birthday party that may or may not
*  be true and by the way every time you talk about your fifth birthday party
*  you're gonna embellish it and with every embellishment your memory of it will
*  change and you reinforce the newest story yes exactly it's why it's why it's
*  so dissonant for people to accept the evidence that memory is fallible in
*  these ways and it's we we keep our memories consonant with whom we think we
*  are now I mean my brother my I had an older half brother who had a terrible
*  stepfather who was really pretty mean to him and Bill's memory of his stepfather
*  was how mean his stepfather was to him and all the time and he could tell you
*  these stories but years later when he confronted his stepfather about it the
*  stepfather was you know disciplinarian and cold the stepfather said but you
*  were a difficult kid you didn't listen you didn't want to talk to me about
*  reasons for things I had to be a strict disciplinarian with you because
*  otherwise you'd go headfirst out the window and get into more trouble my
*  brother had written out of his memories his own part in the story and that's a
*  common thing that we do so in that way he created a story about how his stepfather
*  was mean to him and made him do this that may have so past and future you know
*  is is a lovely arrow but what we know about memory is well you know with with
*  all the research on how unreliable memory is I think it's important to say
*  it's also pretty damn good right overall overall overall I'm glad I have one
*  random I'm losing it rapidly and so I'm glad what what remains I'm happy for it
*  but but that is a hard thing for us I think to understand that it's more
*  efficient for the brain to jettison elements of an event or a memory that we
*  really don't need to have and to give us the gist the centerpiece of it but it's
*  also what allows us to rethink events that happened and to reconsider their
*  causes or other things that were happening at the time and it was
*  interesting to me to realize that utterly false memories can be just as
*  vivid and just as absolutely convincing to the remember as accurate one so it's
*  so I guess oh people hate that people wrong right but it's wrong to have the
*  metaphor in your mind of like a photograph that is aging and and getting
*  blurred out over time you can have a very crisp very vivid very believable
*  memory that is a hundred percent false exactly and so that the brain is doing
*  something crazy there I mean it's not just a that's what I mean it's not a
*  jpeg image in your brain you're somehow sharpening up and and as we said
*  telling the story over and over again I think this is going to be part of my
*  chocolate immersion therapy tell yourself a story you want to hear just
*  keep repeating it you know tell yourself this version of the conversation you
*  just had in which you come out victorious pretty soon you'll forget it
*  wasn't the version that actually happened I think that's very effective
*  therapy I think it's a very effective therapy the French have an expression
*  you know Les Spries de Scalier, the wit of the staircase which is the witty deft
*  retort that you think of making as you're leaving the party and walking
*  downstairs it was exactly we're gonna we're gonna recreate that memory to have
*  be it's something you said at the time I live in fear of this and I live in fear
*  that I'm gonna have be regretful that I didn't ask you a whole bunch more
*  questions but Carol Tavris thank you very much for being on this podcast and
*  a pleasure thanks Sean
*  you
*  you
