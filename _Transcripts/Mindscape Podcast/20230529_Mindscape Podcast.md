Modern computers are somewhat more secure against being hacked - either by an inanimate virus or a human interloper - than they used to be. But as our lives are increasingly intertwined with computers, the dangers that hacking poses are enormously greater. Why don't we just build unhackable computers? Scott Shapiro, who is a law professor and philosopher, explains why that's essentially impossible. On a philosophical level, computers rely on an essential equivalence between "data" and "code," which is vulnerable to exploitation. And on a psychological level, human beings will always be the weakest link in the chain of security.

Scott Shapiro received a J.D. from Yale Law School and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia. He is currently the Charles F Southmayd Prof of Law and Philosophy at Yale University. He is the Director of the Yale Center for Law and Philosophy and also Director of the Yale Cybersecurity Lab. He is the Co-Editor of Legal Theory, and Co-Editor for philosophy of Law at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. His new book is Fancy Bear Goes Phishing: The Dark History of the Information Age, in Five Extraordinary Hacks.

# Mindscape 238 | Scott Shapiro on the Philosophy and Technology of Hacking
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrbLRbqvi10)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll
*  It's kind of a cliche to say that even though in some sense our lives
*  Change quite rapidly because of the advance of technology
*  Often it doesn't seem like it's changing that rapidly like we anticipate certain things like where's my jetpack and rocket car and whatever?
*  And we're not seeing those things
*  So we miss the changes that are actually happening the most obvious example here is the computer, right?
*  When I was growing up, we did not have computers in my house
*  When I was in high school, there was a computer lab
*  You could go to when I was in college you could go to the department and work on the computers there
*  But I didn't have my own that wasn't until grad school that I really late in grad school that I really started
*  that I bought my first personal computer and
*  The very idea of a computer and what it is should not be taken for granted
*  Even though that's what we do, you know a computer is not just a calculator
*  Computers do lots of things the miracle of the computers we use now is that they are general-purpose
*  Machines you can use a computer to watch movies listen to podcasts read your email play games
*  Calculate important integrals if that's the kind of thing you'd like to do and it kind of goes back to
*  Alan Turing the one who really first argued for the generalness of computers it turns out
*  That this feature of computers their generalness their flexibility is closely related to their vulnerabilities
*  We all know that there are worries that we have about computer hacking bringing down the internet stealing our emails things like that
*  Today's guest is Scott Shapiro and he's going to tell us a little bit about the philosophy and technology of
*  computer hacking it's
*  Somewhat reminiscent of our recent conversation with Nita Farahani who is a law professor and philosophy
*  Professor who talked about the privacy issues that come up when you have the possibility of reading your mind with technology
*  Neuroscanning and part of the lesson there the worry was that human beings when faced with a trade-off
*  between
*  privacy and
*  Convenience are almost always going to choose convenience. We really like convenience. We will give away our privacy
*  Today with Scott we're going to talk about computer hacking and the danger that that has for us and part of the lesson is that when faced with
*  Security versus convenience human beings often choose
*  Convenience but it actually is going to go deeper than that even people who are pretty well-meaning and try their best to choose
*  security
*  Human beings they're always the problem they they get in the way
*  That's where it becomes a philosophical issue as well as a tech issue and a legal issue
*  How do we think about the way to shape human beings and their relationships with the machines they use in such a way?
*  To make us a little bit more secure Scott Shapiro has a new book out called fancy bear goes fishing
*  That's fishing with a pH ISH and the subtitle is the dark history of the information age in five extraordinary
*  Hacks it's a detailed book very readable and fun to read but there's a lot of stuff in there
*  But the five hacks that he chooses historically, you know
*  These five examples of when people hacked into the computers in one way or the other
*  They're very fun. You learn a lot about who becomes a hacker why they do it and what the rest of us who are hopefully not hackers
*  Canon should do to stop it from happening to us. So that's useful advice. I think for all of us. Let's go
*  I
*  Got Shapiro welcome to the mindscape podcast. Thank you so much for having me. I think this is one of those
*  episodes where a little bit of history is going to help us a little bit of path dependence as to how we got here because
*  You're a philosophy professor. I know also in the law school. So that's a that's kind of a natural
*  Intersection, but now we're talking about
*  Hacking and cybersecurity which is maybe not so natural. How did we get here? And what do these things have to do with each other?
*  Yeah, sure. So I got so two things. So first of all, I have
*  computer science background like so many
*  Young boys people my my age
*  I grew up in the 1970s and 80s when the personal computer revolution came along and my
*  Classroom in ninth grade had a TRS 80 from Radio Shack and my parents bought me an Apple 2 and you know
*  For the first time in the history of the world you could go into a store and buy a general
*  All-purpose computer and you know, I mean for so many people
*  I was intoxicated by it and you know coding all the time and then when I I
*  I
*  Stay computer science at Columbia and I had a computer company and
*  Before the in before before the World Wide Web came, okay
*  Came on and so I was just I I was a computer person
*  Until I switched to be a law school
*  Until I switched to be a law and philosophy person. So that's the first thing but really
*  The the way I got into this was that my previous work had been on the history of war that is the
*  in a book I had published before the the
*  Fancy bear called the internationalist. It was a story about
*  How war had gone from being a perfectly legitimate way in which states enforce their rights?
*  to
*  illegal
*  that war is is
*  illegal except in cases of self-defense and then people so it was like from 1600 to
*  2015 that was like the history and then of course people said well, what about
*  2016 what about 2017? What about cyber war? I was like, oh what about cyber war? That's super interesting and
*  That sucked me into this space
*  and it was it was
*  It was incredibly interesting journey, I mean it's incredibly interesting field of cyber security
*  Are you teaching philosophy courses that relate to this topic?
*  So it's funny because when I first started teaching I taught this course with two other colleagues one a
*  law professor on a halfway and another one a mathematical cryptographer
*  Joan Feigenbaum and we taught a class called the law and technology of cyber conflict
*  We are half the students were computer scientists half the students were law students
*  And so we'd explained the law to the technology people and the technology to the law people and it was just terrible
*  Just like the absolute worst course I ever taught in my life
*  and that is because
*  you know both law and
*  Computer science they're technical subjects
*  and so at any given time half the class was bored and the other half was confused and
*  We just switched back and forth throughout the semester and then I realized that you know
*  You can't well at least I hadn't figured out how to teach all of it together
*  So I so I've taught just a pure hacking class just pure technology then a pure law class and then just a pure philosophy class
*  To try to figure out
*  How to get how to get into the subject in the book and in some sense is a combination of all those
*  What is the name of the philosophy class? Oh?
*  It's it was called the philosophy of internet hacking
*  Okay
*  I mean one of the main ideas of the book is that
*  that hackers don't just exploit computer code
*  But also the philosophical principles of computation and so it says something I hope we'll talk about but to me
*  the
*  technical
*  Philosophical and legal are really tightly connected. Yeah, okay, and I could not be too
*  Professorial here, but let us define the term hacking
*  What do I mean exactly because this might not even mean the thing that people think it means? Yeah, so I
*  when I use the term hacking I
*  Use it as an activity that attempts to defeat a security control
*  So there are all these controls that are put on our computers like have to enter credentials
*  username and passwords
*  That's a security control and if you can defeat that security control you have hacked
*  that
*  system and so like if you just leave your computer open and
*  Somebody comes over and reads your email
*  They have not hacked your computer because they have not defeated anything that was designed for you not to do it unless they picked your lock
*  Into your into your into your room or something like that
*  But if they tricked you into sending them your email address or your password I should say
*  Right so that so that that's exactly right, so if they if they somehow
*  Use fraud deception in order to
*  Work around something that was designed for you not to get gain access to the account that is hacking
*  but I think a lot of people probably have in mind the idea of
*  Viruses or some kind of tools that let you get around a firewall
*  So is that still a lot? I mean getting people sending you their passwords is great
*  But is there still a lot of
*  Trixiness with viruses and worms and so forth and do we need to know the difference between a virus and a worm?
*  Yeah, right exactly. So, you know, I'm a philosopher
*  So whereas you know other people may not be that obsessed with what is the difference between a virus and a worm?
*  I was particularly obsessed with like trying to come up with it
*  You know why they're different and I can talk about it
*  But one of the things I try to show is that viruses and worms
*  Which very basically one might consider to be self replicating computer programs
*  they all
*  use forms of
*  trickery, but they use trickery in different ways viruses use trickery to get users to
*  Execute them to click on links to download them
*  worms
*  trick not users
*  But they're operating systems or there are other other types of
*  Network protocols or like so there's always trickery going on. The question is who's being tricked?
*  I guess I'm not sure how that relates to what I had in mind
*  Maybe I'm taking the biological metaphor too seriously
*  But I think of viruses as things that live within another program and worms that things that are living organisms by themselves
*  Yeah, no that so in some sense
*  That was the historical origin of the terms virus and worm so for example
*  worms from tapeworms and tapeworms are hermaphroditic
*  Organisms that can reproduce by themselves and so that was the idea of a worm
*  The biological metaphor helps but as I try to show in the book, it doesn't actually really work
*  There are
*  Fully self-contained viruses. There are worms that are part of other computer programs. So
*  It's the difference between new virus and worms is not whether they're standalone or part of something else. They're really
*  two main differences one is
*  Who who executes them?
*  Is it is it the user? Does that did does the user need to click right on the thing and
*  Whereas a worm can
*  Can is autonomous can operate by itself and the second is like how does it spread?
*  Does it spread through networks worms spread through networks?
*  And that's why worms are so dangerous on the internet because the internet wins a network of networks and viruses are
*  Local that is they infect your computer, but they don't move from one computer to another via networks
*  Okay, how do they move from one computer?
*  Well, you know they used to
*  The main way in which viruses used to travel what was called sneaker net
*  Which is like you just get a get a you'd have a flop
*  You you'd have a game that had a virus in it
*  You'd put your floppy in there and you'd give it to your friend
*  And they would put the floppy into their hard drive into their into their floppy drive and then they would get the virus
*  That that's the way it normally happened
*  In the early 1990s
*  It was estimated that it took two weeks for a virus to get from
*  Europe to the United States
*  That's i'm glad we uh went over that because you and I are indeed part of that generation that used floppy drives during our formative years
*  But i've had a lot of people listening. I have no idea what we're talking about here
*  The floppy disks are known only as a joke, right?
*  That's an ancient technology
*  No, absolutely. And so I mean, so there's the floppy disk. So there's the eight and a half
*  Floppy they were really floppy if you held them by the corner. They really did flop over
*  Then you had the five and a quarter which was less floppy
*  But still pretty floppy and then you had the hard the the hard floppy disks the three and a half inch ones
*  And that's what you know, yeah, I try to tell my students this because they're also
*  Upsettingly young
*  But like when you save your your word document you're clicking on a floppy drive
*  icon that they
*  Maybe they haven't seen or haven't remembered the iconography will live forever
*  And then before getting into the so let's sorry. Let's back up. You've written a book
*  uh fancy bear goes fishing and
*  You will talk about you talk in the book about these
*  You pick out five
*  Paradigmatic I suppose hacks that that we'll get through because they're all really great stories and they illustrate some of the points
*  But before we go into the details about I do want to get some of the philosophical background on the table you
*  you talk about how
*  The idea of just stopping hacking is a little bit
*  Utopian it's not going to happen. It's sort of in the notion of a computer that it can't do anything
*  In the notion of a computer that it can be hacked could you is that is that an accurate paraphrase?
*  Yes, exactly. It's not like people are silly or they make mistakes. It is part of the
*  ultimate fabric of the universe
*  You cannot make computers that are unhackable and this goes back to alan touring who gets name-checked a lot
*  Yes, it does go back to alan touring what I think is so
*  Um fascinating about touring of I mean touring is one of the one of the most fascinating figures in the history of science
*  um, certainly of the 20th century and
*  You know when you know some of the listeners might have heard of things like touring machines that are named after alan touring
*  alan touring, uh in 1936
*  He's 20. He wrote it when he was 23 published in 24 comes up with this theory
*  Of how general computing devices are possible like you can make a mechanical
*  General computing device and and this is just this is of course
*  um a massive intellectual breakthrough and
*  And the principles that he lay lays out for how general computing devices are possible
*  Which we can go into
*  Um turns out to be exactly the principles that hackers
*  exploit
*  When they hack a computer
*  so and i'm happy to talk about this because I think this is one of the message main messages of the book is that
*  The very things that make computers possible
*  Make hacking possible and you can't get rid of one without the other and that's like a such a deep. Yeah
*  A part of the world of the the metaphysics so to speak of the world that no amount of money time or effort is ever
*  Going to change that
*  On occasional rare moments
*  I begin to think that i'm a little bit smart and then I remember people like alan touring who when they're 23 years old
*  Invent the general theory of a computing machine
*  Oh, it's just crazy and not only see not only does he come up with this idea that general computers
*  Uh general computing devices are possible. He he does that to show that computers can't solve every problem
*  Which you know talk about you know, like that is um, that is galaxy brain stuff like you can like, okay
*  Computers are possible actually general computing you can solve any solvable problem
*  But you know what there are problems that not know
*  No finite devices ever going to solve like in one article
*  I still struggle with that fact that he got a hundred years ago. Yeah
*  Yeah, it's just it's just astonishing to talk about
*  You know going from first principles and just into driving just through pure reason to figure out something
*  Unbelievably deep about about the universe is just it's mind-boggling and like you
*  Makes me feel bad about myself. Yeah, I think so. I think it's okay
*  But if i'm if i'm gonna like package
*  The the connection there and you can fill in the details. It's because touring appreciated that there's not
*  Quite as sharp a distinction between data and code as you might have expected
*  Yeah, so I mean this this turns out to be
*  I think of this is like, um, you know one of the two or three greatest
*  Philosophical discoveries of the 20th century that no one knows about or I mean I shouldn't say no one knows about I mean
*  Lots of people know about it, of course, but they don't appreciate it as a just an um
*  massive
*  Intellectual breakthrough. So the idea is that you know, we we have these two categories of things
*  code and data so code
*  instructions
*  active
*  does things data
*  Information passive has things done to it
*  And so, you know, so shut the door print your resume add two numbers. That's code
*  Two
*  That's data. It's 80 degrees outside. Um, and so you might think like these things are so different
*  From one another one does something other thing the other
*  Thing has something done to it
*  Um, once active once passive, so you might think like they're so different they can't
*  Possibly be represented by the same symbols. I mean we normally think of code as represented by
*  You know at least for programmers we think of it as like english or english-like words natural language
*  Data we think is normally
*  Represented by numbers, although it doesn't have to be so these seems to be so like numbers and words seem to be so different
*  and what what what
*  Turing did building on the inside of of of um, kurt girdle the great logician
*  Which is that you can always take code and turn it into a number
*  um and a unique number
*  um, and so you could have code and data represented
*  By numbers by the same symbols and since all numbers can be represented by binary
*  Symbols ones and zeros you could have code and data these very different things
*  Represented by the same strings of ones and zeros which means that your computer need only
*  Understand one language the language of ones and zeros and it it means that you don't have to rebuild your computer every time
*  You want to run a different program?
*  Which is what you know team of women programmers you had to do in the 1940s with the eniac
*  They they didn't have software everything was hardware. So you had to change everything
*  if you use the turing process of
*  Converting code into numbers what you could do is have a computer that accepts
*  numbers
*  And then runs it as code accept numbers
*  Treat it as data and then run the code on the data which makes
*  That's why I only have one laptop as as opposed to
*  87 for every application that I use because I can just always download or load
*  Code into my computer
*  Part of me, this is very unfair
*  but part of me thinking like a physicist wants to say of course code and data are the same because they're all atoms and
*  Thinking about them as either code or data is a human choice that we make for our convenience and and touring is really just
*  Reminding us that there's a commonality there that this human invention is not absolute
*  Yeah, so but you know right now you're I mean, that's that's absolutely true
*  but you know, I just want to notice that
*  point out that you're
*  I mean quite naturally because in some sense this was another great advance
*  of turing's which is that you're trying to
*  Assimilate a computer computing device to a physical system
*  And that was another great discovery actually of turing that
*  computation is a physical process and
*  That you could build a contraption a mechanical contraption that just manipulates symbols according to the laws of physics
*  somehow
*  through
*  some very basic
*  manipulation
*  Actions like you know writing the number one erasing the number one moving along a tape that was
*  Sufficient for solving every solvable problem. So when you say yes, of course
*  You know words are atoms or you know, actually the the the
*  String is made up of atoms
*  Well that is to that is to use the other insight of touring which is that computer devices?
*  computing devices are physical devices and
*  And these insights together are what underlie the claim that hacking is always going to be with us
*  Yeah, yeah
*  So let me just take the first that second thing that I just mentioned about, you know
*  Computing devices are physical devices for manipulating symbols, you know, that is one of the main ways in which hacking occurs
*  which is that hackers exploit the
*  physical limitations of
*  physical systems
*  You know think of it think of polygraphs
*  so a polygraph is a way of trying to
*  Let's assume that they're good, you know that they work okay for the moment
*  Okay, the idea of a polygraph is to try to peer into your mind
*  not by
*  Asking and not by actually reading the neural patterns in your head
*  But you try to see that your brain is connected to your body and that we might be able to discover
*  through increased heart rate or sweating
*  That you think something and and that's a way of hacking
*  The the physical body human body to figure out what's going on in
*  Cybersecurity this is called a side channel attack. It's to try to read off information from the
*  Changes in the physical system that's being studied. So, you know, there are all these cool things where
*  You know hackers can discover your passcode because you have an accelerometer in your in your smartphone
*  Which can tell which numbers you've pressed
*  Because the the the phone shifts a little bit and so they're very sophisticated
*  Exploits that use this the second one is
*  In the book I call this duality
*  We had been talking about that code and data are can be represented by the same symbols
*  Well if they can be represented by the same symbols when the computer or the user is expecting data
*  The hacker can send code
*  And that is the other major way in which hacking occurs
*  so
*  One thing I think you can see is that the very thing that makes computers possible
*  That is that their physical devices and that they can
*  Manipulate both code and data through binary symbols are the very things that get exploited by hackers and when I I mean
*  Thinking about it this way I think kind of takes things that seem very
*  Disconnected from one another and they show the common things
*  commonalities, so
*  fishing attempts
*  Are attempts to exploit
*  imperfect human psychology
*  That's
*  We have imperfect human psychology because we need shortcuts
*  The same thing with side-channel attacks on computers. They're they're also exploiting the physical nature of the system. So
*  That's a way of seeing how how to group packs together and and there's one other
*  Distinction that you raised that I really liked between up code and down code while we're talking about code. So
*  What is that? Yeah, sure. So
*  so so
*  You know think think when you're typing on your computer
*  Down-code is all the code below your fingertips. So your
*  Operating system your application network protocols how your router works firmware all that kind of stuff
*  Up code is all the norms and rules and code above your fingertips. So your psychology
*  social norms legal norms
*  Professional ethics terms of service employment contracts all the norms that go above and I call that up code and I
*  the I the
*  Standard way that people think about cybersecurity and hacking is is is almost purely through a down code
*  Lens, so they think okay, we got some technical vulnerability
*  we got some bug let's fix it and
*  the argument that I make in the book is that this is a
*  bad way to address cybersecurity that we ought to be looking at the up code the norms which provide
*  incentives for
*  For coders and for users to use their computers in a certain way to develop code in a certain way
*  And so what we ought to be looking for is not so much the technical vulnerabilities and the down code
*  But the human and political and social vulnerabilities in the up code and let's look at exactly those
*  So you have these wonderful examples and I like the very first one
*  Robert Morris and in
*  1988 because I remember I was a first-year grad student at that time at Harvard and
*  The first this is big news. The internet went down. The internet was a very tiny thing at the time, but
*  It shows one of these human psychological aspects because I was at Harvard the first guess
*  Was that this is somehow affiliated with MIT, but then at some point there was a
*  Idea that in fact the person who did it was affiliated with Harvard and they were very proud
*  They were happy like that. We beat MIT
*  It turned out not to exactly be the full story in either way, but tell us what the story was
*  Yeah, sure. Did you know Cliff Stoll?
*  I've seen him give talks
*  I've seen him give talks and I read his cuckoo eggs cuckoo's egg. Okay, because he was a he's astronomer
*  And a computer security expert who was at Harvard at the time and who also spent
*  Essential role in trying to remediate and explain what had happened. So here's what happened
*  Right. It's 1988 November 2nd
*  1988 the Robert Morris jr
*  Who's a first-year graduate student in computer science at Cornell University had been a Harvard undergraduate
*  Logs in to Richard Stallman's
*  Email a computer account
*  in
*  at MIT because Richard Stallman who is the
*  Often known as the father of free and open source software
*  um, he
*  Didn't have a password on his account. Um, and um, you know, so so Robert Morris did not hack
*  the MIT
*  Computer, but what he did was he released three binary files which
*  He released as an experiment
*  The basic idea of the of this worm that he created was it exploited some
*  Multiple vulnerabilities in the unix operating systems particularly
*  unix
*  4.2 the berkeley software distribution 4.2, which was the first
*  Operate first unix distribution or I should say first major unix distribution that was hooked up to the internet
*  and so what Robert Morris did was
*  He exploited those vulnerabilities because he was kind of a he was a he was
*  extraordinarily
*  knowledgeable and he was really just interested in figuring out
*  Like how big the internet was, you know
*  It was a science experiment for him and for reasons which I can go into
*  The worm was so effective at infecting
*  Computers that it reinfected those computers over and over again
*  And so these computers crashed not because he was trying to crash them but because they were so busy
*  Copying worms and distributing them the it's a it you know, one of the things that so i'm the same age as
*  Robert
*  Morris jr
*  He has right now a tenured professor at MIT
*  Um his best his friend that I talk about in the book paul graham paul graham is the one of the founders of
*  Y Combinator
*  Um the giant uh
*  Tech uh venture capital
*  Firm that you know is responsible for funding dropbox and airbnb and stuff like that
*  But this is a story of like when they're grad students
*  And um, you know when the whole when the internet goes down
*  It's on the cover of the new york times on the you know on the national on national news
*  Robert Morris jr has to call robert morris senior bob morris who's his dad
*  Who's the head of cyber security for the nsa?
*  Just imagine, you know crash crashing the internet and you have to tell your dad who's responsible for
*  um, uh cyber security for the national security
*  Agency, I mean just an incredible
*  um, uh, like just it makes it just makes me cringe every time I I think about it and then he
*  He gets um prosecuted and convicted for the first one to be convicted of violating the computer fraud and abuse act
*  and he does not go to jail, but um, it's uh, it's a very
*  It's a harrowing story of what he went through and just so people are correctly
*  Normalized in their expectations here the internet existed in 1988, but it was a different thing
*  What we call the worldwide web did not exist
*  That's right. So one of the things I try to explain in the book right is that you know the web and the internet are often
*  conflated for you know for for good reasons, um
*  in part because the web is a
*  protocol for
*  That they that works on top of the
*  internet
*  Um, and so like just like email uses the internet browsers use the internet
*  Um, and um it the the the the worldwide web is
*  Created I think a year later
*  In 1989 and then it comes online with the first browser in the 1993 with mosaic which becomes netscape
*  So we're talking like right before
*  um, everyone starts thinking about the web and the internet and one of the things is fascinating and I didn't realize this from my
*  Um from my research first time americans or anybody had ever heard
*  Um the word internet before um, I was kind of shocked about this and they don't even know how to like when when
*  When newspapers are writing this up, they don't even know how to how to refer to it. Is it the internet?
*  Is it internet? Is it the internet network? Is it the internet with the n?
*  Second n capitalized a lot of experimenting but the first time people know that the internet exists is
*  It basically is when it crashes and it was
*  Essentially, it wasn't malicious, right? It was like you said it was kind of a science experiment
*  It was not an attempt to bring down the internet. It was kind of like yeah, we're young and it's a brave new world
*  Let's see what we can do
*  Yeah, I mean so much, you know, I I the the thing is that um
*  I think it was so shocking to people precisely because it wasn't malicious
*  Um, it was like, you know, reverend morris jr had found security vulnerabilities in internet protocols
*  um before
*  Um, he was he was like basically the network administrator for harvard before he went to cornell
*  I mean he was you know, he was
*  You know a white hat, you know, he's one of the good guys. Um, and one of one of our one of our people
*  Um crashed the internet. What would a black hat do?
*  And that that that that I think that just freaked everyone out scared everyone. Of course. Everyone was worried about
*  Connect as it was the internet connected to
*  the nuclear arsenal
*  the the movie war games
*  Which maybe you know
*  Some of your listeners remember I bet you remember it i did matthew matthew broderick film which um tells the story of how this teenager
*  uh kind of
*  uh
*  What's now we call it war dialing after war games is randomly
*  Dialing numbers through his modem and then connects to a norad computer which he thinks is a video game
*  Uh repository and he almost starts world war three and this I mean it's amazing that ron reagan sees this movie
*  at the white house and then
*  freaks out and then gets everyone to like
*  Get like can this really happen and we get the next year the computer for the first
*  Iteration the computer fraud and abuse act first federal law against hacking
*  Um, you know, it's it's too perfect, you know movie star president
*  Sees this movie we get this law
*  And then a couple years later you the whole internet goes down and then people, you know
*  See these things connected and they get very very very
*  Anxious and that anxiety in many ways has not gone away
*  I'm always fascinated by the similarities
*  but also differences between a complex system like the internet or even a single computer and complex systems like
*  A living organism or an ecosystem which the biggest single difference is that one was designed at least partly in the other one
*  Kind of evolved
*  Uh, does that difference make the internet more or less vulnerable?
*  You know, it sort of hasn't grown up through being buffeted by a whole bunch of different evolutionary challenges
*  But on the other hand, there's people trying to keep it safe. Is there is that an easy question to answer?
*  Um, no, it's really I mean, you know, like any question involving complex systems is not easy to answer
*  Um, and so um, and it's not even I I would be honest. It's not even my
*  area
*  um, I will say
*  um that
*  uh two things of
*  of real importance, um
*  comparing computers to biological systems
*  So the first one is that the person who
*  was most
*  Moved by the analogy was the you know, when another
*  um genius of the 20th century john von neumann
*  and john von neumann, uh was he was
*  involved, um
*  Uh in the eniac, which is the first electronic computer
*  and then he built he's very
*  Um, uh central to building the first digital computer the ed vac
*  Which uses a system that we talked about earlier of loading
*  Code into your computer and then loading data so you don't have to rebuild it every time. And so one of the things that
*  von neumann discovered
*  when he um
*  Was trying to build this computer was how ridiculously vulnerable they are like one little one little vacuum tube and it's gone
*  Um, and he's like but human beings or like, uh, you know moths or foo flies. It's not like that at all
*  Yeah, you know things get messed up all the time and yet
*  and yet, um
*  Biological systems are so resilient
*  So he he set out to figure out how could it be that that biological systems are so resilient?
*  But computers are the computers that he had seen were so fragile
*  And he came up with the idea that what we need to understand that what what biological systems do
*  Is that they're so resilient because they're self replicating that they're parts that can rebuild their parts
*  um, and this idea of like
*  Von von neumann has how can how is self replication possible?
*  Becomes the basis for how computer viruses and computer worms are are possible
*  So the very things that make life possible
*  Um, also are the things that make computer viruses possible. Um, and that's a really fascinating
*  um, uh, this is again another one of these ideas
*  Which is that you can't have the good without the bad you can't have computers without hacking you can't have life without the possibility
*  of cancer
*  Or you know malware?
*  um
*  Of sorts so the the connection between biological systems and computer systems has been incredibly important
*  Um historical and intellectual
*  Uh analogy have has any progress been made at getting computer systems either hardware or software?
*  To be more self-repairing than they would be it doesn't seem that way from my novice point of view
*  Yeah, no, so there the um, you know, there are
*  Lots and lots of mathematical models out there for self-repairing automata
*  um, uh, and
*  people have tried to
*  Uh, they there's now
*  Efforts to um
*  To create especially using ai engine self-repairing code right? Um, uh, and so there there have been all these
*  Um attempts, um, it will be
*  Fascinating to see
*  When automata are
*  sophisticated enough to take human form
*  And they can regenerate their own parts
*  That will be that'll be unbelievable good
*  All right, uh, we don't want to get too hung up. Robert marz was a pioneer. Absolutely
*  But then we take a turn for the slightly darker with literally dark avenger
*  These people are not, you know the most creative at coming up with uh names for themselves, but dark avenger captures something
*  Right. Yeah. No. So so the second story is like the bulgarian virus factories in the early 1990s. So
*  For people who remember this stuff, um
*  Bulgarian viruses were like the big thing in the early 1990s and I was just fascinated by
*  Like why like why bulgaria that country right of all of all places
*  Why why were the bulgarians so into virus writing and why were they so?
*  Good at it. And besides what are viruses? Um, and um, so it turns out the story so
*  what I did talk about is like
*  What what computer viruses are the self replicating programs which are user executed and don't use networks to to to travel
*  Which makes a lot of sense at the time because in the early 1990s you don't really have
*  Um personal computers hooked up to networks. It really viruses really do work. Um, um travel via
*  sneaker net
*  um, and um
*  The the the so I was really interested in like what are viruses and how do they work but um, there was
*  This one person named dark avenger who was a cut above
*  everyone
*  else in writing viruses and they
*  Traveled around the world and it caused a lot of problems for people and this person
*  Was named dark avenger because he was really
*  um
*  into heavy metal
*  and um and in particular, um, uh, I believe it was metallica, um, and
*  No, i'm, sorry iron maiden. Excuse me. Not metallica iron maiden
*  Um, and he names he he names his viruses after them
*  He's got strings of the of the songs in his viruses. Um, and people don't know who he is now
*  That by itself is kind of interesting but dark avenger does something
*  which
*  threatens to
*  destroy the
*  personal computer industry, which is that he figures out how to create
*  a
*  polymorphic virus engine meaning taking a virus which is down code which is computer code and
*  Introducing mutations so that every new virus that gets spread has a new genetic signature
*  So it's like crisper, um, but um, uh for uh
*  for computer code and the way in which
*  Most antiviral software had had worked at the time was was called signature based. It scanned computer
*  scanned programs to see does it have the kind of
*  Signature that we can identify with known
*  Uh viral samples and what uh, the mutation engine did was which was written by dark avenger
*  um is um
*  Scrambled it every single time it was copied which defeated the
*  the the
*  Antiviral software and everyone was really really freaked out because how are they going to solve?
*  this problem, um
*  It I will also say it gave me the opportunity to talk about
*  up code like why bulgaria bulgaria because
*  At the time in the 1970s and particularly in 1980s bulgaria was the silicon valley
*  Of the eastern bloc and what you did was you had all these
*  Basically young men who were were underemployed. They had excellent engineering educations. They you know, they were
*  Very good coders, but they had no outlet
*  They had no job to go to and so they sat around doing fun stuff making viruses that you know
*  So this becomes a kind of a main theme in the book, which is that so much of cyber
*  crime
*  um
*  Uh is a response to underemployment in in less developed tech economies
*  Do we know today who dark avenger is slash was?
*  so um
*  uh, we
*  I do
*  I do not
*  Uh, so I don't I do not. Um
*  the person who did the most work understanding the mind of virus writers and
*  And um tried to uh and and got very close to
*  Dark avenger. She knows she will not tell me um, because she believes she owes this person
*  anonymity because as a research subject, um, I will I I
*  After the podcast is over. I will tell you some communications i've gotten
*  um
*  But um, I don't know who it is
*  But I do speculate there's a bunch of speculation in the book about
*  Who?
*  He or they are
*  And this is sarah gordon the researcher who yes exactly so we know who she is
*  Right. Yeah. So sarah gordon is um, she gets a virus
*  She buys a used computer and she gets this ping pong virus and she's like what's a virus and she gets she goes on
*  The internet and there's no like web yet. So she goes to this thing called phytonet
*  Which is all these viral bulletin boards hooked up together and she starts talking to people and she was a I mean
*  She's a fascinating person. She's uh, she did
*  Um, uh crisis counseling for young men and she kind of got them. They were like immature
*  um, slightly stunted young men who hadn't aged out yet
*  Of the process of virus writing but they probably would
*  And she got into she was a pioneer
*  um, she is a pioneer, um, and she got a lot of
*  Blowback from saying that virus writers are not
*  evil maniacs
*  um, and i'm really happy because she she
*  She was very courageous went out there made these uh made these claims and got pilloried
*  By the by the anti-virus community and i'm really happy that like maybe like 30 years later
*  I've been able to kind of at least tell her side of the story
*  How much is this related to?
*  Ongoing concerns just about young men being alienated and uh
*  Online extremism incel communities, you know, I mean as a as a world at least in the western world
*  Are we just failing boys between 15 and 25 and and some of them become hackers?
*  Yes, I do think I I do think that that's right
*  So before there were there were hackers before incels there were hackers before people who?
*  Posted um pepe or elon musk tweets. Um, you you you know this you know
*  Uh young young boys and let me just say something about the gender issue. They are almost all
*  Boys and young men
*  It is a well unknown phenomenon
*  that um in the virus in the hacking community there are of course
*  Women hackers, they're of course excellent excellent women hackers women have be have um achieved in
*  very important leadership positions, um in the cyber secure cyber security community, um,
*  But it is still on the the gender imbalance is quite
*  um
*  Uh bad. Um, I always joke about like the only time I the only time
*  I ever have to wait to get into that men's room
*  Um, uh is at a hacking conference, um, you know women there's no line outside the women's bathroom
*  So these boys are just bored. They have these skills and I understand it
*  I I I learned and I know how to hack sometimes I want to do it and break the law because it's
*  I mean breaking the law is not fun, but but hacking is really fun. And you know, of course they wanted to do it
*  um, and one of the suggestions that I make is and and this is
*  Um been implemented by
*  The uk, uh, the netherlands united states is catching up to this which is to try to create legitimate hacking
*  Venues and to try to divert young offenders into the legitimate cyber security industry
*  um as opposed to the um, you know the black hat, uh,
*  activities and you emphasize in the book that
*  Despite what you might think hacking has an absolutely crucial social
*  Aspect even even if people are anonymous or pseudonymous on the internet. They want credit for the cool things they've done
*  Yes, I mean this is the I mean I would say this was the most shocking social
*  Insight for my research which was that hackers are not loners
*  Um, the picture that they have is that they are freaks
*  You know, they suffer from any sort of neuro divergent syndrome they have multiple personalities
*  um, um disorders they you know, whatever
*  But that's just kind of not true. Um, you know, they're like
*  They're like you and me. Maybe they're a little kind of stunted maybe they're little
*  You know, uh, they they have social anxieties about face-to-face
*  Activities, but really they want clout they want their
*  their
*  um peers online to think that they are excellent hackers one of the things that
*  Shocked me. I i've been uh fortunate to be able to talk to some of the hackers that I write about
*  One of the hacker one of the hacking groups, uh for the mariah botnet came to my class
*  Um my cyber security class and spoke to my class along with
*  The fbi agent that caught them and one of the things I was really fascinated by the the just
*  We'll talk maybe we'll talk about it later, but the mariah botnet
*  Three teenagers who who created this botnet which took down the internet
*  They uh, they get caught in part because they released the code
*  onto the internet
*  Coders really want to know what other coders think of their code
*  And that is really
*  amazing
*  and um, you know
*  People are really
*  Social you know human beings are social and even hackers are social and if you really want to
*  divert them away from
*  Uh, uh kind of the dark side you should give them social incentives to participate like
*  You know capture the flag competitions mentoring things like that, which is programs which have been created which I think are really
*  um, uh, um
*  Really promising ways of addressing this problem. Well, let's talk about the mariah botnet
*  We don't need to go in the same order that you went in your book
*  But it naturally leads in because this question of motivations is just a crucial one and as I understand it
*  Paras jah was just upset. He couldn't get into a certain class at rutgers and that set him down a path
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's just
*  I mean he he doesn't want to take his calculus exam
*  And so well, you know the the first thing he does is he wants to get into um an elective class
*  He so he gets in he's a first year student at rutgers. He wants to get into a
*  a
*  Um in a higher. Yeah, um, you know upper level elective in advance an upper level
*  Computer course i'm a professor. I can't even remember the terms for for for for for academic courses
*  Right. So once again to an upper upper level course and as as as we know, you know, normally
*  First year students are not given priority in registration
*  More advanced students are so what he did was is he didost the registration?
*  website, so no one was able to do it and then when
*  when
*  When the thing comes back on he then signs up for it and then he uses he didosts the the the basically the the the
*  the main rutgers system because he doesn't want to take his calculus exam and then he keeps on doing this he
*  he really does not like the fact that rutgers in order to mitigate the
*  I should just define a ddos is a distributed denial of service attack. It's an attempt to take
*  a computer website network offline by overloading it and consuming its resources. Um, he
*  He's really upset that the firm that rutgers hires in capsula, um to mitigate these ddos attacks
*  Doesn't use his firm because pruss had this
*  A firm called protraf where he did ddos mitigation. So it's like a classic, um
*  Offer you can't refuse. He says, you know, basically he sent to rutgers
*  You know use my
*  Um my mitigation
*  Company because your medication company is terrible because I can break it
*  And which he did he just kept on breaking and cost
*  Um
*  The rutgers had to increase their tuition by several percent in order to pay for
*  All the cyber security stuff. So there's you know fun and games
*  But actually it it it spread costs to the entire student body
*  And even though it's fun and games there legally it's just good old-fashioned racketeering. He was a shakedown
*  Yeah, it's a it's a classic offer. You can't refuse
*  It's racketeering
*  And it's it is a very standard story in the history of cyber security
*  That the ones who purvey
*  The cures are often the ones who are also purveying the diseases
*  Um, it's really
*  Amazing. So you offer protection services for problems that you yourself create
*  There's a very kind of standard mob
*  Um technique and that's what that's what happens a lot when it comes to ddos protection
*  and the interesting wrinkle
*  technologically downstream from this was
*  The actual mirror ibotnet took advantage of the internet of things, right?
*  It sort of spread itself to devices other than computers and so forth and that's a scary new thing. We're going to have to confront
*  Right. Yeah. So one of so one one argument that I make
*  In the book about why up code we should be thinking about up code rather than down code is that up code shapes?
*  Down code gives people incentives to produce code of certain certain type another reason why up code is
*  The thing we should be focusing on rather than down code and this story exemplifies this reason is that
*  the down code
*  Uses data produced by the up code. So just think about it like this, you know
*  So it doesn't matter how good your operating system is it doesn't matter how good your
*  Cryptography is none of that matters is if you go to human resources and you add or it of your of your
*  Company or a different company and you ask them for credentials to somebody else and they is somebody else's account and they give it to you
*  so the the up code here would be the
*  Corporate policies or the academic policies about who who's entitled to what data?
*  So it doesn't actually matter how good your operating system is if like the up code is just
*  Undermining it. So this is exactly what happens in the marai botnet
*  The marai botnet takes advantage of what you said the internet of things the internet of things like smart toasters and camcorders and things like that which
*  Are devices which are hooked up to the internet and which communicate with each other rather than communicating primarily with human beings
*  um, and what um
*  When these internet of things came online in 2014 2015 2016
*  um, you know they
*  They don't really come with any security controls. Um, they you know, the passwords are default passwords like
*  123 or password or admin or whatever because who's gonna worry about the security of their toaster?
*  um, and
*  You know the these marai guys they realized wait a second if there are these all these default
*  Passwords default passwords, which they just found through google because they're in the manuals
*  So they download the pdfs in the manuals. They look at the passwords they build they build
*  A worm like not a worm but a worm like botnet that exploits these default
*  Passwords and then are able to create and just such an enormous
*  Digital canon that I remember in october 21st
*  2016 right before the election. I remember my internet goes out
*  They for the end for for most of the day and of course everyone thinks it's russia
*  And it turns out to be these kids who just exploit this very simple
*  um up code vulnerability, you know using default passwords and so they just enter it into
*  um these toasters, um, and then
*  Generate this enormous botnet which can take down the internet. Um, and it's a
*  Again, it's another example of you know, it doesn't matter how good your tech is
*  If your policy surrounding it are bad
*  And this is the case where they uploaded their code to the internet so anyone can do it my impression is that this
*  These sets of worms are still going around
*  Yes, exactly. I'm the mirai there are many many many different variants of
*  The mirai botnet still around the it's um, one's called satori. I mean one of the things also that you learn
*  Um from doing this stuff is like, you know hackers lie
*  um, I hate to break it to you, but um, so what what what they'll often do
*  Is they'll often take the same malware and they'll rename it with a different anime name
*  And then say it's the new
*  Improved malware
*  Um, or somebody will take it and they will package it as their own and they'll rebrand it
*  um as the
*  matsusuko
*  Variant or something like that, but there's this is this is still causing um, uh,
*  significant problems around the world
*  through their
*  quite
*  irresponsible action of
*  You know just releasing this very powerful malware onto the internet
*  You know the p you know boys young men make
*  terrible mistakes
*  The the these three um, these three boys young men
*  Have they get they they plead?
*  they are
*  They're facing many years in jail, but um the fbi and the fbi agent who catches them
*  A special agent elliot peterson has this idea that what if we we can use these?
*  um, um skilled professionals, um for law enforcement and so
*  Instead of putting them in jail the court, uh orders them for
*  2500 hours of community service where they are helping the fbi catch a lot of these malware perverters
*  So you have this kind of catch me if you can patch me if you can type
*  Type situation. So I I think this is an a really excellent model for how to deal
*  um
*  With some of these offenders
*  And they're almost finished with their community service, um in october they'll be finished
*  and um
*  And they're they're they're they're fascinating people. Well speaking of young men and uh,
*  Exploiting the up code there's we can't get away without talking about paris hilton's cell phone
*  Yeah, right. Yeah, so I I you know, um, so paris hilton
*  What i think is so upsetting is that like some of my students don't know paris hilton
*  Which really I mean this doing this doing this book really made me feel old
*  Um, so paris hilton, of course it girl in 2005
*  um big news that her cell phone was hacked and nude photos were posted on the internet and
*  You can't get them down and the big question is how how in the world does this happen? So paris hilton?
*  She comes on the scene around 2001. She's like everywhere
*  Like every form of media is paris hilton paris hilton paris hilton and then we want to um,
*  And then her phone her cell phone gets hacked and people like how can how could you hack her phone?
*  She's constantly surrounded by
*  by bodyguards, um, who's gonna like
*  You know snatch her phone
*  People don't realize that in 2004 2005. We have this new invention called the cloud
*  Um, and that in not her cell phone is not hacked
*  It is the cloud that is hacked and it is hacked by a 16 year old boy
*  um known as cameron lacroix who um
*  figures out how to exploit web interfaces in order to um in order to
*  Gain access to data on um on cell phones. Um, and he manages to get
*  paris hilton's
*  Phone number he knows that she has a t-mobile account because he sees a commercial which he's in with snoop dog
*  And then calls up a t-mobile
*  calls up a t-mobile
*  office in california and says that he's from corporate headquarters and he wants the
*  Username and password to their system to check if everything is okay and the manager gives it to him
*  That's the phone right there and he looks up paris hilton's, um, uh number he gets it and then he
*  Realizes that if he wants to register his um
*  uh
*  Uh a t-mobile account all he has to do is use a sidekick because sidekick at the time had a deal with t-mobile
*  Uh that um that uh, they would use um that that would be the carrier
*  And so um, if you tried to register your phone from the sidekick t-mobile assumed that you had it that you were t-mobile
*  customer
*  once he realized that he
*  Went to his browser told his browser to pretend to be the sidekicks browser and then entered
*  Paris hilton's number and got all her data. I mean so it's it's just
*  You know, it's a story and name when you why did he do it?
*  Why did he do it because he wanted to be famous?
*  So like there's just like the up coat, you know
*  So you have parasilton who's of course famous for being famous you have this, you know
*  16 year old boy who you know his mother dies when he's two years old from a fentanyl overdose. He has depression
*  he's suffering through various types of
*  um, you know, uh
*  mental
*  mental health concerns
*  Um, and he wants to be famous
*  Um, and he exploits these terrible corporate policies of t-mobile like give your password over to somebody who claims they're from corporate
*  Um, or let's build terrible terrible authentication systems that don't work
*  Why are they doing it because they're trying to gain as much?
*  market share as they possibly can
*  so
*  you know, you know the hackers out there can be disappointed because
*  It turns out that the hack was so simple by the way, nobody knows the story now
*  Now people will know the story. I was able to
*  track uh, Cameron LaCroix down
*  After four years because he was in jail and jail during covid
*  Um, and it took me a very long time to catch to track him down
*  It took me about three years
*  And then two weeks before the book had to literally go to press
*  I found out the story the true story of how he hacked her so
*  Oh, okay. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well and it's it's there there are themes emerging here, right?
*  I mean things are there's an intrinsic worry with computers because code and data are not two separate things
*  things become more
*  Difficult to control when everything is connected to everything else where there's a cloud where there's these devices
*  And the human beings are the weakest link in in almost all of these stories
*  Yes, absolutely. I mean when when it all bottoms out, it's like
*  You know human beings behind the keyboard. Um, yeah and um
*  one of the things
*  so, you know people might say what is
*  a law professor
*  Doing writing about cyber security and I I want to say, you know
*  one of the things that law professors do is that we're coders we're up coders we
*  We think about and we help teach students how to design and how to
*  implement up code
*  And I teach students how to hack because I want them to understand the down code the technology
*  but really what I want them to understand
*  is how might we
*  Change the rules to give people the proper incentives either to produce really good down code
*  or
*  to ensure that they don't get fooled
*  by
*  bad down code
*  And so that's that that's the that's the mission I think it's a much more efficient
*  cost-effective way of trying to solve these problems and telling these stories
*  Our ways of getting people to see so I explain all the technical stuff what a buffer overflow is what how sequel injections work
*  Yada, yada, yada
*  But I also want them to appreciate that there's this other story going on actually there are two other stories
*  There's a philosophical story, which we talked about earlier and then there's the social
*  Upcode story
*  Which is in many ways doing so much of the work and it gets hidden because people get
*  Understandably freaked out by a technical subject
*  Like cyber security and they shut off and they think what can I contribute actually?
*  A tremendous amount because you understand how human beings work
*  And I think it kind of all comes together
*  But in a slightly darker way in the fancy bear story which gives your book its title
*  And I know that it was the fourth of the five that you talk about but to me
*  It's the culmination of the whole thing because it was malicious from the start. Uh, it was not a 16 year old
*  Just messing around so I don't know there's a lot of
*  Threads that come into it. Where do you like to start telling that story? Yeah, so so um, so
*  So so many of the people in my book
*  um that
*  Initially, I mean it's all there's a standard trope which runs through so much of cyber security history, but certainly this book
*  There's a hack. It's spectacular
*  uh, some nation state probably russia did it and it
*  Kind of often turns out that it's like teenagers. Um, okay, but sometimes it turns out to be russia
*  and one of the things I wanted to show was like it's
*  If you just look at the technical indicators. Yes, of course
*  attribution is always hard and um,
*  And you can trick people and you know bubble at false flags and all that stuff disinformation all but you know, it's
*  Unbelievably hard to say that russia did not hack the dnc
*  When you actually just kind of lay out what we know from publicly available sources
*  Um, that's the first thing the second thing is I really was so fascinated by
*  Just like with the bulgaria case, why are why is all why are all viruses coming from bulgaria?
*  I was like, why did this happen?
*  one of the
*  Central mysteries of the dnc case is the fact that the fbi it took the fbi
*  A year from learning that russia was in the dnc networks to actually getting them to focus on it meeting up with them
*  To take care of it and the question is why did the fbi take so long?
*  To contact the democratic national committee that russians were in their network
*  The second question is it takes about six months for um for the dnc to get back to the fbi
*  Why don't they take it seriously? So it feels like everyone's messing up everyone's acting irresponsibly
*  But if actually you understand the up code you'll see that everyone's acting perfectly rationally because there's this one thing
*  That is so central to the way the world works that most people don't know which is that when hacking is done
*  For the purposes of collecting national security information. It is known as espionage spying
*  And the spying is legal under international law. That is why every state hacks every other state
*  so the fact that the fbi knows that the
*  russia has hacked or is
*  Inch gained a foothold in the democratic national committee network. I think the response is you know
*  Tell me something. I don't know
*  You know the russians had tried to get into the white house the pentagon joined chiefs
*  um earlier
*  Um, they get thrown out. And so what do you do if you're an intelligence agency you start looking?
*  Um wider you start looking for
*  Um, you know softer targets
*  The russians aren't just in the dnc. They're in brookings. They're in, you know political science departments around the country
*  They're just looking everywhere. So like it's like dog bites man news at 11
*  It's like not news for people so they don't take that seriously
*  Um, and then the dnc on the other hand, why doesn't dnc respond?
*  Well, one of the things you also have to understand about the fbi is that it's a very unusual
*  Institution because it's a hybrid one half
*  intelligence
*  Agency, they catch spies in the united states, but another half they're the main federal law enforcement agency
*  and so at the time that the the
*  Dnc is being hacked. Hillary clinton is being investigated for
*  private email server
*  and so
*  It's highly likely
*  Bordering uncertainty that the dnc is worried that the fbi
*  Is contacting them because they want information about hillary's emails. Here's another upcode piece that most people don't know
*  FBI prosecutors may not lie
*  FBI agents are they are allowed to lie the person who contacted the dnc was from the
*  law-enforcement side
*  And it was an agent
*  He wasn't lying, but he was allowed to lie. So on the one hand you have the
*  the fbi, you know
*  Basically calling around to everyone saying, you know, you probably have russians in your system
*  Um, the dnc is like you're not gonna fool me
*  And so everyone's kind of acting rationally given given the circumstance of the way
*  Intelligence and the fbi works and the cultural social political
*  Setting at the time and it it all comes together because there's one other change in upcode that nobody predicts
*  that is the basic principle is that of course other states are allowed to
*  uh
*  invade the
*  digital systems of another to collect at least national security information
*  But you're supposed to keep it quiet. You're not supposed to dump it and a cozy bear
*  Which is in the the network for a year. They just keep the information because they're trying to you know produce analysis for
*  for the kremlin whereas fancy bear
*  Takes this information and does something which had not been done before which is this massive dump
*  of information which takes something from espionage and turns it more into
*  Something that some people have been tempted to say is cyber war
*  So everyone's following the upcode at the time and the big disaster happens because there's a change
*  And I think when you think about it that way things become much more explicable
*  It seems to make sense. It's not a mystery and then we should start thinking how do we deal with these situations?
*  And I always like to imagine that you know, someone 50 years from now is listening to these podcasts
*  so just to be perfectly clear, uh, this was
*  A hack that we're pretty sure is done by the russian government of the democratic national committee
*  Uh the political party and they released a lot of emails right before a presidential election
*  And it might have had a kind of big impact on that presidential election. Yes. I'm sorry. You're absolutely right
*  I was assuming that
*  Everyone knows about the dnc hacks
*  um of uh by russia in 2016 but
*  You know now we think about it's seven years ago. I know
*  It's so real to me, yeah, um, it's so live but you're right
*  That's exactly what happened and I should have explained that and
*  You do a pretty good job to the extent that it's even possible
*  Which is very hard of like painting the reality of this russian agency like we know a little bit about it, right?
*  Yeah, actually, we know a lot about it because as it turns out
*  um, you know
*  I was speaking to somebody very high up in the cia who once told me the biggest problem that the cia faces that no one
*  Can be a spy anymore?
*  um
*  Why because unless you are raised in a hermetically sealed box?
*  um
*  The you know, you have you know, you have social media accounts. You have tons of things that you
*  Um that we say on the internet especially like if you're 13 14 15 16 years old
*  And then maybe you get recruited by the russian government, um at some point and you go into the intelligence agency
*  um, and uh, then you have all these people, uh, like bellingcat and these
*  open-source intelligence firms going around looking at russian facebook and trying to see do these people have a
*  Um a facebook account and yes, they do and you know the amazing things that you can find like fancy
*  Bear
*  When they when they when they registered their cars they used fancy bears address
*  um
*  They they don't have very good operational security
*  As it turns out but one of the I mean, I think the big lesson here
*  Is that in a world where everyone is connected in a world of social media?
*  Um, it's unbelievably difficult to be anonymous
*  Um, and so now if you if you look up you can learn a lot about um the various bears
*  I talk about some of these people in the book
*  But you can learn a lot about them if you google because there are researchers out there that are mining the internet for all this
*  and yet despite the
*  According with the themes that we've been talking about despite the massive resources of this state-sponsored agency, uh
*  Technologically and so forth the crucial step as I understand it was john podesta
*  Giving up his password to the russians
*  Yeah, you know this this makes me cringe so
*  so bad because um
*  so the so I mean it's
*  Let me begin by saying that
*  Securing a political campaign is incredibly difficult. It's incredibly difficult because lots of times people come in from
*  Outside as to be part of the campaign and they have a zillion social media accounts
*  They have they have different phones. They have different, you know, and so there are just so many ways to kind of
*  Get into um a political campaign. So let me just um, uh begin
*  By by saying that it's a very very, uh difficult problem to to secure a political campaign
*  So the it person they don't actually have a dedicated it person. It's a consultant
*  um, and um
*  uh he
*  I'm sorry. I'm gonna back up because um
*  Let me back. Um, okay john podesta. Um
*  when one of the ironies of
*  But her emails
*  Uh, the hillary clinton, uh email scandal is that her campaigning had excellent cyber security
*  They used two-factor authentication
*  um
*  Robbie mook, um the campaign manager had signs on the bathroom mirror saying you don't share your toothbrush
*  Don't share your password the russians
*  Initially were not able to get into hillary for america. So what did they do? They started looking around
*  And they started going after the personal accounts
*  in this case the gmail accounts of people high up in the
*  Campaign and they targeted john podesta john podesta got a phishing email which had said that
*  Google it was ostensibly from google. It was not it was from fancy bear. It was sent out
*  um, you know, uh during russian, uh during mosco working hours, um, and it said that
*  Uh, somebody has it as somebody has your um password you should change it and john podesta
*  sends his email to um to it saying hey, um, is this legitimate?
*  And the guy writes back
*  This is a legitimate email
*  And he claims he meant to say this is not a legitimate email. I love that story
*  It's even plausible makes you just want to die
*  Um now I would say I you know, it sounds like a lie
*  But I believe it and the reason why I believe it is because
*  Like it had been seeing these phishing emails come across their
*  Their their the network for several weeks before they caught
*  um, um podesta
*  So it's highly unlikely that
*  Oh, I should say
*  You know from the outside it seems unlikely that um that they were fooled
*  Um, I think he meant to say this is not a legitimate email
*  and he just you know, sometimes we mistype and
*  Oh my lord, um, you know, he changes his password
*  um
*  which
*  Is handing
*  his password
*  to credentials to
*  russian military intelligence
*  They immediately go in change the password get all of his files and it becomes a scandal when they release
*  podesta's shrimp risotto
*  Recipe it just shows how um
*  It was the appearance of something the the doxing
*  Um, well, it wasn't exactly doxing the exfiltration and dumping of the information
*  There wasn't that much in the information that was so
*  Um important um, or politically damaging there were some things that were but it was more the appearance of people dumping all this
*  Information and saying oh my god. Look at this. This is a corrupt organization and people like oh, yeah, I guess you're right
*  um, and so that just um, you know again, um, and a serious, uh human vulnerability which
*  led to um
*  very uh damaging political consequences
*  And presumably it's not the last that we're seeing of this
*  I know that it's hard to predict the future
*  But I mean maybe say for our final wrap-up thought here a little bit about how you tried to write a book that
*  uh straddle the line between
*  Uh crazy alarmist and oh, don't worry. Well, here's how to fix it
*  Yeah, no, that's right. So like so I think cyber security books have this on the one hand
*  We're all gonna die
*  um
*  Uh part to it. I mean and then we're seeing this with ai we're all gonna die
*  And then the other side is like eat your vegetables. Make sure your password is 20 characters long
*  You know, it's just like this just bummer
*  um
*  And so what I try to do is I try to kind of steer between alarmism and complacency
*  So here's here's a kind of bottom line. I would say to people
*  Most people you know hackers don't care about you. They don't even care about your data so much
*  um
*  By which I mean like your you know, the pictures of your kids or the kind of um, you know
*  Arch thing you said about your friend
*  um
*  Over over email. Um, what they want is to make money
*  and um, and it's a high volume
*  Uh business, you know, they're scanning the internet. They're sending out these phishing emails
*  Um, and basically they do not want to get into your computer because they want to spy on you
*  See you make dinner what they want is to
*  either
*  You know pull your your your laptop into a botnet or they want to use it
*  They want to exfil if exfiltrate your banking information credit card information. Maybe they want to encrypt your hard drive
*  Um
*  They don't want to spend that much time on you
*  And so they want to catch the people who are kind of reckless who don't really take any
*  Precautions who essentially leave the keys in their car with the door unlocked running?
*  Um, don't click on links from people you don't know
*  You know, don't don't wait
*  20 months before you update your computer. It doesn't mean you got to do it, you know this second
*  Just don't be reckless if you are not reckless for most of us
*  We will be fine because we just have to be faster than the next guy
*  We just have to make sure that we are not an easy target. That is not true
*  for so-called high value targets
*  High value targets which i'm including journalism politicians people in the c-suite, you know co cfo coos
*  Um, you know human rights activists people like that
*  Um government government officials. They are high value targets
*  They must you they must assume that they are being targeted. They should have professional help
*  unless they're sophisticated, um, and
*  I i'm not being an alarmist to say if you're a human rights activist or a journalist or c
*  Ceo you really need to be really
*  Battened down because people will try to get you another thing. I want to say is that there's no way
*  We will ever stop
*  the hacking of nation states against nation states for the purposes of
*  Getting national security information because that's what states do
*  Um, their job is to protect their
*  their state
*  Maybe their power. Um, and it is legal. It's probably beneficial for states to
*  know secrets of other states
*  so, um, you know the the person who reads this book who's not a high value target, I think it's
*  You know some very basic things
*  That you can do not to get yourself harm in harm's way
*  But if you are a high value target, I will describe the various ways in which you could get caught and you really ought to
*  Seek expert help
*  Well, I think that almost by definition every listener of the mindscape podcast is a high value target
*  So I think that they should all buy your book and uh, that will be very helpful to them. Yeah
*  That's that's absolutely right, I mean it's it's reckless not to buy my book it's reckless we wouldn't want that so scott chapiro
*  Thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast. Oh, thank you so much. This was really fun. I really appreciate it. Thank you
*  You
