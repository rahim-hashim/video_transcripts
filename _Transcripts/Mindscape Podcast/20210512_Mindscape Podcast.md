Welcome to the May 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic.

Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | May 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRNpOZc8prU)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the May 2021 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape podcast.
*  May already, 2021 has been a long year for me, I'm sure for almost all of you also.
*  I'm vaccinated now though, that's good, light at the end of the tunnel and all that.
*  I even went into my office at Caltech where I had like actually just to do work, not to
*  pick up mail or whatever, and which I had not done in over a year.
*  So that's a sign of normalcy returning.
*  Not a very optimistic sign yet, there's no one else around basically.
*  There's still clamping down quite heavily on the number of people who can be in the
*  same place at the same time.
*  So working remotely, working from home is actually still more efficient at this point.
*  But hopefully you all are out there getting your vaccines if you can.
*  The United States here has been doing pretty well at getting vaccines into arms, shots
*  into arms. And so hopefully wherever you are, you can get it also and we can get the
*  pandemic over with.
*  So on to the Ask Me Anything questions.
*  As most of you know, this is a benefit for supporters on Patreon where they can ask
*  questions and then the answers are given out to the Patreon audience right away.
*  And then a week or two later will be given out publicly.
*  You can become a Patreon supporter yourself by going to patreon.com slash Sean M.
*  Carroll. It's quite affordable, dollar an episode or whatever you want to offer.
*  If you want to do more than that, then that's great.
*  You don't really get many benefits.
*  You get ad free versions of the podcast and you get to ask questions for the AMA.
*  Mostly it's about just people who feel that it's nice to be able to give something back
*  to someone who is doing something, providing content, which is a nice thing that I try
*  to do for everybody.
*  We've reached a point where there's too many questions, so I cannot answer all of them
*  every month. So I try to pick and choose some and group them together.
*  I have to say the questions this month are really good.
*  It was very difficult to erase some of the questions.
*  I did not answer a whole bunch of perfectly respectable, very good questions.
*  I think that the fact that not every question gets answered now is making people raise their
*  games perhaps about asking really good questions.
*  So my apologies as always if I didn't answer your question.
*  As usual, it's not mostly about the quality of the question so much as the interestingness
*  of whatever answer I might have to give about that question.
*  And you don't know.
*  You don't have any way of knowing whether I have anything interesting to say about it.
*  So don't feel bad if your question is not asked, especially if the questions of the
*  form, you know, tell us an interesting story about X and I may or may not have an interesting
*  story.
*  That's a perfectly legitimate kind of question to ask.
*  But don't feel bad if I don't answer it just means I don't have any interesting stories.
*  There you go.
*  Sometimes my life is interesting.
*  Sometimes it's not.
*  We are having a different strategy this month trying something out, a different rule, which
*  is that the questioners, people asking questions, can put in the beginning of their question
*  that is a priority question.
*  And if it's a priority question, then I guarantee I will answer it.
*  I will try to answer it anyway.
*  And the only catch is you only get to do that once in your life.
*  So if you have one question you really, really want answered, you can ask that in the AMA
*  as a priority question.
*  If you're a Patreon supporter, I'll do my best to answer it.
*  A couple of people did, in fact, use that this month.
*  So we'll see what that looks like.
*  But anyway, lots of good questions, many good topics, whole bunch of things.
*  Let's go.
*  Daniel Westwater says, if UFO sightings are legitimate, which I'm not suggesting they
*  are, do you think it's more likely they have found a way to traverse the multiverse and
*  are actually beings that live on Earth in another multiverse rather than faster than
*  light travel from other star systems galaxies?
*  So I would put here is the ranking.
*  So I'm happy to go along with your hypothesis that UFO sightings are legitimate, even though
*  I think they're clearly not.
*  But I would say, number one, no FDL travel nor universe hopping in any sense.
*  That's my most likely possibility by like 99%.
*  Second most likely is faster than light travel.
*  Third most likely is hopping between universes.
*  There's no reason that you need to travel faster than the speed of light to go from
*  one star system to another.
*  You just have to be patient.
*  As I said before, probably on these AMAs, we have this picture that since a human being
*  lasts a century or a little bit less, and it might take more than a century to get from
*  one star system to another, you need to go faster than light to make it interesting.
*  But that's clearly not true once you solve aging and getting older and dying of old age,
*  things like that.
*  That is a much more tractable problem technologically than faster than light travel.
*  Aging aging is just a biology problem.
*  Faster than light travel is a how do you violate the laws of physics problem.
*  So I have no trouble whatsoever in believing that advanced civilizations will either be
*  able to live for thousands or millions of years, even as individuals, or just learn
*  to put themselves to sleep for the course of a journey.
*  Again, very, very tractable problem.
*  So even if UFOs are real, I don't think you need to violate the laws of physics to do
*  it.
*  Of course, the laws of physics as we know them now might not be complete, might not
*  be the final word.
*  So maybe it's possible you can travel faster than the speed of light.
*  There you go.
*  I'm willing to consider that possibility.
*  Probably it would involve some kind of warp drive kind of thing where you're taking advantage
*  of general relativity rather than literally going faster than the speed of light.
*  You're changing the curvature of spacetime so that it appears that you're traveling faster
*  than the speed of light.
*  Still not very realistic in my mind, but at least something I can imagine.
*  Hopping between universes is something I cannot even imagine, honestly.
*  Like, well, I can't I can I can imagine doing it.
*  I cannot imagine the physical mechanism that would bring it about.
*  So I would put that last on my list of plausible things to think about as I'm constructing
*  my Bayesian priors for this problem.
*  Second question, I'm going to group two questions together.
*  They're both about infinite splitting of worlds in the many worlds interpretation of quantum
*  mechanics. The first is from Linh U Miziara, and it is labeled priority questions.
*  So as I said, this means I got to answer it or at least got to try.
*  And Linh U is never allowed to answer to ask a priority question ever again.
*  So it's good that you know, put yourself out there the first time.
*  Question is, suppose I'm a working physicist waiting for an atom to decay.
*  The probability of the atom to decay will increase as time passes.
*  What happens according to many worlds?
*  Does an infinite number of copies of me split as I wait since as time passes in each
*  fraction of a second, there will be a different universe in which the atom might decay.
*  Then another related question comes from Kristof Piranski, who says, I am almost able to
*  imagine and believe a finite or countable countably infinite number of my versions in
*  the universe. But as far as I understand the wave function of the universe swells rather
*  than branches, for example, a nucleus emits a neutron and radioactive decay anytime in
*  any direction. How do you even imagine a continuum of yourselves?
*  Could that be an indication that space time is discrete?
*  So both of these questions have to do with the fact that in many worlds we tell a story
*  where, for example, if you're measuring something discrete like the spin of a particle that's
*  either up or down, it's pretty simple to imagine the universe in one branch splitting into
*  two. But when you have a continuous variable like the position of a particle or the time
*  at which a nucleus decayed, then it sounds like you instantly have an infinite number
*  of universes, right? In many worlds, an unstable nucleus has well in quantum mechanics, let's
*  put it this way, in quantum mechanics, no matter what your interpretation is, the wave
*  function for an unstable nucleus has a part of it that says I've not yet decayed and another
*  part that says I have decayed and that part that says I have decayed increases with time.
*  And so there's a probability where you to measure it that you would see the nucleus
*  has decayed. But that part that says the nucleus has decayed is different depending on whether
*  it decayed now or a minute ago or 10 years ago or whatever, you know, the actual particle
*  being emitted is doing different things. So there's a continuum of possibilities. How do you deal with that in many worlds?
*  And I admit that it does seem harder to conceptualize, but that's no barrier to anything, right?
*  You know, here's something where you have to trust the math. We'll get to this later in the AMA.
*  Sometimes you have to believe what the math says. The it's a it's a perfectly legitimate
*  question to ask. How should we think about the number of worlds we're branching in or how to
*  do the course grain, et cetera, when the branching is continuous?
*  And I think the best answer is exactly what you would do in calculus for any other problem that goes back to,
*  you know, Zeno and his paradoxes, right?
*  When you have something that is a continuum, don't talk about exactly where you are in the
*  continuum. Talk about the probability you're between X and X plus delta X.
*  OK, that's a sensible thing to do.
*  Likewise, like if you're if you have a position just in classical mechanics on the real line between
*  zero and one, what is the probability that you're at point three?
*  Well, it's zero because point three is of measure zero between zero and one.
*  But you can ask what is the probability you're between point three and point three one, right?
*  That's a sensible thing that will have some possibly non zero answer.
*  Likewise, what you think of as a world in many worlds, when there are continuous variables, you
*  should think about the set of worlds in which the nucleus decayed between time t and t plus
*  delta t. OK, that's a sensible thing to think about.
*  The number of worlds in that interval is infinite in some sense, but you can't tell the
*  difference between them if delta t is very, very small.
*  You sort of group them all together.
*  David Wallace talks about this more of your interest in the details in his book, The Emergent
*  Multiverse. So I think I answered both questions there.
*  Then we have Gerard Droyvin, who also asks a priority question, and it says in a short YouTube
*  video called The Big Bang and Creation Myth, you suddenly hold up your hand and show I presume this
*  means me, although I have no idea what YouTube video is being referred to here.
*  You suddenly hold up your hand and show the scale.
*  Maybe it doesn't mean me.
*  I really don't remember this at all.
*  Show the scale of our visible universe compared to the whole universe.
*  And I think I didn't hear the word maybe when you said it is tiny, namely the visible
*  universe. My mind made it into a compressed visible universe there between your thumb and
*  index finger. So I thought of the Big Bang, which was tiny in its first moments.
*  So time in there would feel different than the time we experience on Earth today because it was
*  tiny and compressed.
*  So for the Big Bang, inflation would not occur at top speed, as has been calculated.
*  But since time feels different when you're compact and solid, it would have taken ages, at
*  least at the Big Bang had eyes and a brain to sense its night sky.
*  So the question is, does it make any sense to have thoughts like this except that it is fun for me as
*  a non-scientist? Is there any touch of reality to it?
*  So I think that there's two things.
*  Just to be super clear, a clarification first.
*  The first thing is that I have no idea how big the universe is beyond our visible
*  universe. We have a very good idea of how big the visible universe is.
*  Beyond that, it might go an inch in every direction past that and then suddenly stop.
*  That's possible. We'll find out one microsecond later when the horizon grows a little
*  bit. But it might grow, you know, it might be twice the size of the visible universe.
*  It might be 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 size times the size of the visible universe.
*  We have no idea.
*  We can guess and that's OK.
*  So maybe what I should have said or tried to say or whoever you're talking about said is that it
*  is completely possible that the observable universe is a tiny, tiny fraction of the
*  entire universe. Now, this time of the Big Bang stuff, it's just not true that time flows
*  differently or moves at a different rate near the Big Bang.
*  Just the fact that things are dense doesn't mean the time moves any differently.
*  Time moves at one second per second.
*  You have to specify the reference frame of the clock in which is measuring the time.
*  But in the Big Bang cosmology, there is a rest frame.
*  The rest frame that we now see is the rest frame of the galaxies in the microwave background.
*  That was true even during inflation.
*  There was a rest frame for the inflaton field.
*  So there was a normal, sensible way to measure time.
*  And when we say inflation happened at whatever it was, 10 to the minus 33 seconds, that's
*  measured in that reference frame.
*  Charon says, The politics of our post World War Two world has been dominated by nation
*  states that are sovereign unto themselves.
*  Currently, however, we are facing crises that are global in scale, like climate change and
*  the current pandemic we're all living through.
*  Do you think the institution of nation states can effectively deal with global problems
*  without developing into a worldwide tragedy of the commons?
*  Or do you think an international body that actually can hold them accountable would be
*  needed? So I intentionally agreed to answer this question because I have no idea what
*  the answer is, but it's a really interesting and important question.
*  I mean, it's perfectly obvious that international cooperation would be a very, very good
*  thing. I'm tempted to say a necessary thing, but at least would be very, very advisable on a
*  whole bunch of questions, whether it's climate change, resource management, pandemics,
*  nuclear proliferation, bioterrorism, you know, a whole bunch of different things.
*  There have been, you know, when I was your age, we were living in the era when the European
*  Union was coming together, et cetera.
*  And there was the Iron Curtain fell and people were optimistic that we'd be entering an age
*  of more and more international cooperation.
*  Things have gone backwards a little bit since then, as you may be aware of.
*  I still think it would be a good idea.
*  I'm not sure that something as all encompassing as a world government would be a good idea.
*  You know, governments work or at least democratic governments work when the people in the
*  country under the government feel they have common interests.
*  Right. People in Pennsylvania are willing to pay taxes to help people in Idaho.
*  And they might not admit it, but that is the compact.
*  That's the social contract that they're under.
*  And I think that worldwide here in the year 2021, people don't feel that way about
*  people in other countries.
*  So, you know, democracy is an experiment that requires buy in.
*  You can't impose it.
*  And if we're thinking of a sort of democratic world government rather than just a world
*  dictatorship, then we need to live in a world where people want to live under an umbrella,
*  a common umbrella.
*  And I don't think that's true right now.
*  I think the different nation states want to advance their own interests.
*  Right. Even here in the United States, I mean, we're not any better than anybody else.
*  You know, America first is very popular amongst a lot of people.
*  And both it's weird, you know, both political parties have more or less come to a consensus
*  that we should be protectionist and put up trade barriers.
*  You know, the economists don't like it, but the politicians do.
*  So I don't think we're close to that.
*  I think in the meantime, we're going to have a lot of attempts at getting individual
*  agreements between different sets of countries and things like that.
*  But that's that's hard to do.
*  So I'm not really optimistic that we are quite mature enough to tackle these global
*  problems in a sensible way.
*  I don't know how to make it different there.
*  That's that's just my feeling.
*  And I could be wrong. This is not my area.
*  Pablo's Papa George says, how do you check your ideas in theoretical physics?
*  You mentioned writing equations.
*  Do you then do proofs on paper, numerical models?
*  Is there a social aspect of convincing colleagues?
*  Basically, what happens before someone agrees to do an actual experiment?
*  Yeah, there's a great question, actually.
*  And you have almost put your finger on all the things that happen.
*  The one thing I would edit is we don't do proofs in theoretical physics, usually.
*  Like sometimes you'll have an idea for something that follows
*  straightforwardly from some assumptions in a particular physical model,
*  and you'll prove that it's true.
*  There are some famous examples of things like that, but mostly you sort of derive
*  implications of your equations, right?
*  You say, like, OK, if this set of equations is true, then we should observe
*  the following signal in a dark matter detector or something like that.
*  So it's writing equations, pencil and paper or chalkboard or tablet
*  or whatever you want.
*  Certainly, it's talking to people a lot, right?
*  Most if you go on archive.org,
*  a r x i v dot org, you can see all the theoretical physics papers
*  and all the experimental physics papers, for that matter,
*  that are currently being written.
*  So you can see what they're like. Right.
*  And on the theoretical side, most papers are written by collaborations,
*  by small collaborations.
*  On the experimental side, they're often written by large collaborations.
*  But people work together because they're reality checks.
*  And also theoretical physics is a little bit modular.
*  Like you can write a paper together and different people can do
*  different parts of the calculation and things like that.
*  And then, yeah, you want to give a talk, right?
*  If you're invited to give a talk, you can talk about your recent work
*  and people in the audience will be skeptical and give you a hard time
*  and you try to defend yourself.
*  All of those things actually happens.
*  So it's very much a bottom up kind of thing, right?
*  It is no like Pope of theoretical physics who says, you're right, you're wrong.
*  You work on it yourself and you try to convince other people of it.
*  And then you see how it goes.
*  Submit the paper, get peer review, all that stuff, all that comes into it.
*  OK, I'm going to group together the next two questions because they are about
*  universes where there's an infinite number of fluctuations
*  long term through the history of the universe.
*  So first, Anonymous says in the idle game cookie clicker,
*  the goal is to get as many cookies as possible.
*  One of the ways you can get cookies is through shipments of cookies
*  from the cookie planet.
*  In Brian Green's book, The Hidden Reality, he claims that if space is infinite,
*  you can not only expect to find every possible arrangement of matter
*  out there somewhere, but there will be infinitely many copies
*  of each possible arrangement.
*  Is it reasonable to assume that if space is infinite,
*  there will be an infinite number of cookie planets and similar absurdities
*  simply because the laws of nature don't technically forbid things like that
*  from existing? And then another question is from Josh, who says,
*  it's a related question. It's not exactly the same.
*  You said that Boltzmann brains could not come into existence
*  because the quantum because the vacuum state is never observed.
*  What about non vacuum quantum states that are observed like my chair?
*  Isn't there some tiny probability of my chair turning into a Boltzmann brain?
*  So the reason why these are connected is because there is a very plausible
*  cosmological scenario in which the universe expands as it's doing now,
*  continues to expand forever because there is vacuum energy,
*  a cosmological constant.
*  And within any one observable patch of that universe,
*  the local physics is like empty space, but at a certain temperature.
*  OK, there's a certain temperature you can associate with an accelerating universe.
*  It's a very, very tiny temperature, 10 to the minus 30 Kelvin
*  or something like that. I forget the exact numbers.
*  So but if you wait forever, infinitely long.
*  So the logic goes, then you will have fluctuations
*  into all sorts of different crazy things, including Boltzmann brains,
*  including these configurations of materials that just have the minimum
*  requirement to be a conscious creature of some sort.
*  So I wrote a paper with Kim Boddy and Jason Pollock a few years ago
*  that pointed out that that scenario, as it's usually thought of,
*  relies on a misinterpretation of quantum mechanics.
*  It's just not true that empty space fluctuates in the vacuum,
*  even if it's at a non-zero temperature.
*  If you were to observe empty space, it would fluctuate.
*  But there's no one there to observe it because you're in the vacuum.
*  So, in fact, the future vacuum state of the universe is static.
*  Is there's no there's nothing dynamically fluctuating when we use words like
*  fluctuations in the quantum mechanical vacuum.
*  That's just because we're always thinking classically.
*  We're always thinking of quantum mechanical states as kind of like
*  statistical superpositions of different fluctuating classical states,
*  but they're not. They're really, really different.
*  So these Boltzmann brains that you might worry about
*  do not fluctuate into existence in the quantum mechanical vacuum.
*  If it's truly the vacuum, if you've actually reached the vacuum state,
*  there are other scenarios that are very similar,
*  which you don't reach the vacuum state, and then it's a little bit different.
*  So the question was from Josh, is there a tiny probability of your chair
*  turning to Boltzmann brain? Yes, there is.
*  But it's very, very tiny.
*  And the point is that we're going to reach the vacuum
*  before an infinite amount of time has passed. Right.
*  So we ordinary observers cosmologically only exist for a finite period of time.
*  And the probability within that finite period of time of your chair
*  turning into a Boltzmann brain is very, very small,
*  even if you integrate over that whole time.
*  The reason why Boltzmann brains are talked about fluctuating
*  into existence from the vacuum is not because it's easier
*  to get a Boltzmann brain from the vacuum, it's because the vacuum lasts forever.
*  So if there's even any non-zero probability,
*  you multiply the non-zero rate of making these brains
*  by the infinite amount of time you spend in the vacuum,
*  and you get a non-zero, in fact, an infinite number of Boltzmann brains produced.
*  If they were produced at all, that's what it would be.
*  But here in the ordinary universe, you can get random, crazy quantum fluctuations.
*  They're just really, really, really unlikely.
*  Likewise, for anonymous's question, if space is simply infinitely big,
*  that doesn't guarantee that everything happens somewhere.
*  It could be. It's compatible with the fact that everything happens somewhere.
*  But, you know, you might put restrictions on what happens.
*  So, in other words, if space is infinitely big,
*  it might be infinitely big, but with the feature that
*  the same thing happens over and over again, right?
*  It could be just like a checkerboard extended forever and ever and ever.
*  If a checkerboard is made of black squares and white squares,
*  you're never going to get a green square, even if you extend it infinitely far.
*  So, it depends on the specific way in which matter is arranged
*  in an infinitely big space-time.
*  If it's infinitely fluctuating, then yeah,
*  then you're going to get cookie planets,
*  and you're going to get all sorts of crazy things.
*  This is all, of course, just completely speculative,
*  things that we don't have any right to talk about
*  from the basis of what we know empirically about the universe,
*  but we can sensibly try to say what fits in the best with what we
*  understand within the universe that we do see and what happens when we extrapolate it.
*  That's an okay thing to do.
*  Bendy Bruce says,
*  How do you feel about the amount of investment the richest men in the world
*  are pouring into space travel?
*  Well, I have mixed feelings, I think, to be honest.
*  You know, I'm in favor of space travel.
*  I'm in favor of both exploring space scientifically
*  and, you know, increasing the likelihood that human beings
*  can live and travel into space.
*  I think that's a good thing overall.
*  I don't think that the concentration of wealth that we currently have in the world
*  that gives a handful of people the right to decide how that's going to happen
*  is a sensible way to run an establishment.
*  You know, I do think that I would rather just have big taxes on those people
*  and take a lot of their money so they're still only super rich,
*  not filthy, crazy rich,
*  and then we can collectively decide what to do with the money that we collect.
*  Maybe help some poor people,
*  maybe invest in science,
*  maybe invest in education,
*  maybe invest in space travel.
*  I think that's just, you know, as many people have pointed out,
*  no one becomes a multi-billionaire without help, right?
*  You don't become a multi-billionaire just by going out into the fields
*  and using your muscles,
*  or by, you know, sitting alone and using your brain.
*  You use it because there's a system that allows you to do certain things,
*  and talent helps, of course,
*  but the system has to be set up for you to make a whole bunch of money.
*  The system should benefit.
*  The people who are in that system should benefit as well, I think.
*  Okay, the next two questions, I'm going to group them together,
*  grouping a whole bunch of questions together here today.
*  The next two questions are about Bell's theorem in different senses.
*  So Ross Hastings says,
*  as one of the few people in history who managed to make Einstein look like a knob,
*  one would imagine John Stuart Bell would be a bit more famous than he is,
*  and I can't help but wonder if the reason is
*  because of how difficult it is to understand what he did and how he did it.
*  I've seen videos featuring demonic clowns, etc.,
*  being a master of wizardly explanations,
*  I figure that if anyone can show us what it all really means, it's you.
*  And then Joe Gravinsky says,
*  could you explain Bell's theorem?
*  It's the same question said in fewer words.
*  Can you explain Bell's theorem and why it eliminates the possibility of hidden variables?
*  Are there other reasons why hidden variables have been ruled out?
*  So I need to undo a couple of assumptions in both of these questions.
*  Number one, Bell's theorem did not eliminate the possibility of human variables.
*  Number two, Bell did not make Einstein look like a knob.
*  Everything that he said about quantum mechanics for print was very, very sensible.
*  It's not all right.
*  Everyone makes mistakes, including Einstein, but he was on the right track.
*  It was Einstein who gave us the EPR experiment
*  that led Bell to invent his inequalities.
*  Without Einstein, he wouldn't have gotten there.
*  So I'll do my best in a very quick period of time
*  because it is subtle, Bell's theorem,
*  but I don't think that the fundamental thing is difficult to understand, honestly.
*  The idea is simply, look, if you have a system that consists of two parts,
*  one part is somewhere, another part is somewhere else,
*  so they're very far apart from each other, okay?
*  And you're going to do measurements on these two parts of the system.
*  They could be, classically, they could be perfectly correlated.
*  If there was some event in the past, right,
*  that said, well, I have two balls, red ball and a blue ball,
*  and I'm going to send one to the left and one to the right,
*  I'm not going to look which way they go,
*  then obviously there's a classical correlation.
*  Once you look at one of them, oh, it's the red ball,
*  then you know the other one is blue, et cetera, right?
*  So classically, they can be perfectly correlated.
*  But in quantum mechanics, you have this opportunity,
*  and this is the important part, so let me just skip ahead.
*  The point of Bell's theorem is that quantum mechanically,
*  you cannot know what answer you're going to get
*  when you measure either one subsystem or the other,
*  but there can be correlations between the different things.
*  As you know from EPR, from the sort of Alice and Bob
*  with their spins example, they can be perfectly correlated, right?
*  These two different things.
*  You can have a spin that is either up or down,
*  the other spin is also either up or down,
*  and you can know with 100% certainty that if you observe one up,
*  the other will be down and vice versa.
*  So the tricky part of Bell's theorem is that
*  you don't have to observe the spin in the same direction, right?
*  When we say you're observing the spin up or down
*  and there's 100% correlation between them,
*  we're imagining that you're assuming you're measuring
*  both spins along the same axis, like the z-axis typically, okay?
*  And then what quantum mechanics says is if Alice measures her spin
*  and it's up in the z direction and then Bob measures his,
*  it would be down, but what if Bob measures his along the x-axis, right?
*  Then it might be 50-50, then it would be 50-50,
*  whether it's going to be up or down.
*  So Bell says, well, what if I just look at all the different ways
*  that I can measure the spin, right?
*  I mean, what would the correlations be?
*  And what he proves is that in quantum mechanics,
*  there will be greater correlations between those two things
*  that you can possibly measure than you can possibly reproduce
*  in a purely local theory, okay?
*  By purely local theory, we mean both what exists in the world
*  exists only at local locations in space, right?
*  There's a spin here, there's a spin there,
*  and also that signals cannot travel faster
*  than the speed of light.
*  So you cannot touch a system in one place
*  and instantly have it affect something somewhere else.
*  So what Bell's theorem says is that
*  the quantum mechanical correlations,
*  even if they're not perfect, which they're not,
*  if you measure a spin up and a spin x,
*  you're not going to get perfect correlations with those,
*  but they exist, there are some correlations
*  and they will be better in quantum mechanics
*  and they possibly could be in a local theory.
*  Now, the word local is hugely important there.
*  That's the entire point of the theorem
*  is the word local in there.
*  I did not use the words hidden variables there anywhere, right?
*  So what Bell's theorem rules out
*  is the possibility that Einstein did want,
*  although he never explicitly wrote down a model,
*  he wanted to imagine that someday
*  we would find a hidden variable theory
*  that was local, where both the variables
*  and their interactions were entirely local.
*  And Bell's theorem says you can't do that.
*  That does not prove that Einstein was a knob
*  because Einstein didn't claim to do it.
*  Einstein hoped it was possible,
*  but he said no, it's not really,
*  he never actually proposed a model to do it,
*  all he says is that quantum mechanics
*  didn't fit his criteria for what he thought
*  things should be, okay?
*  So there are non-local hidden variable theories.
*  That's what Bohmian mechanics is
*  or de Broglie-Bohm theory,
*  as it's sometimes called, pilot wave theories.
*  These are all theories where what one particle does
*  influences another particle non-locally.
*  And that's 100% compatible with the observation
*  and it's a hidden variable theory, okay?
*  So hidden variable theories are fine,
*  they just have to be non-local.
*  Whether or not you count many worlds
*  or something like that as non-local is trickier.
*  I mean, that depends on what you mean by local,
*  depends on how you do the branching of the wave function,
*  I don't really think it's a very interesting question,
*  so I don't care that much,
*  but that's the point of Bell's theorem,
*  that you can't get in a world with unique outcomes,
*  so in other words, not in many worlds,
*  but in a world where experiments give you unique outcomes,
*  there's gotta be some non-locality going on somehow.
*  Maybe there is, there you go.
*  Okay, the next question is,
*  oops, I lost where I am, there we go.
*  I'm gonna group two things together once again,
*  because these are on branching of the wave function
*  and irreversibility, so Ron Jacobson says,
*  entanglement and branching of worlds
*  or collapse of the wave function if you like
*  sound like an irreversible event,
*  is it and is this fundamentally relevant
*  to increase in entropy and the arrow of time?
*  And then also Siraj Rajan says,
*  are there quantum mechanical interpretations
*  that satisfactorily explain the arrow of time
*  of our universe?
*  So let me do Siraj's question first.
*  The arrow of time of our universe
*  is explained by the fact that entropy was low in the past,
*  right, entropy was low near the big bang,
*  that's all you need, that explains,
*  that and the typical understanding of what entropy is
*  and how physics works, that explains it.
*  So maybe what you mean is,
*  are there quantum mechanical interpretations
*  that explain why the early universe had low entropy?
*  No, not as far as I know.
*  There are quantum mechanical interpretations
*  that have intrinsic time asymmetry in them
*  where the rules of physics are not the same
*  going forward in time as backward.
*  For example, objective collapse models are like that.
*  You have models like what are called GRW theory
*  and Roger Penrose's theory
*  where wave functions simply collapse,
*  they really do collapse,
*  it's not just an apparent collapse,
*  it's a real thing and they collapse
*  only going forward in time.
*  So there's a very clear unambiguous violation
*  of time reversal symmetry in these models.
*  By itself, that does not apply to the real world.
*  By itself, that does not explain the arrow of time
*  in our universe because if you started the universe
*  in thermal equilibrium,
*  so with a high entropy state,
*  it would just stay high entropy
*  even if you had collapsing wave functions.
*  So you just have high entropy forever,
*  that's not the arrow of time at all.
*  No matter what happens,
*  no matter what your theory of quantum mechanics is,
*  you have to explain why the early universe
*  had low entropy.
*  And no attempt to interpret quantum mechanics does that.
*  To get to Ron's question,
*  the branching of the wave function
*  is exactly an irreversible event
*  and why does it happen toward the future
*  and not the past?
*  Well, because the wave function of the universe
*  was incredibly low entropy
*  at early times.
*  Now I say that it's true what I just said
*  but I shouldn't give the impression
*  that it's clear.
*  You know, we would like to understand much better
*  what exactly are the features
*  of the wave function in the early universe
*  that give rise to the branching structure
*  that we have, okay?
*  So classically, the fact that the early universe
*  needed to have low entropy
*  to make the arrow of time
*  is much better understood than the quantum mechanical version.
*  I don't think it's especially hard
*  but it's just that, you know,
*  the simple examples where we understand
*  many worlds very well
*  are laboratory-like experiments, right?
*  Where we have a clear division
*  into system and environment
*  and we have decoherence and the whole thing.
*  And of course, it's not even clear
*  what the right degrees of freedom are,
*  how to divide the world into system and environment,
*  all that stuff becomes a little bit trickier.
*  What do you mean by low entropy?
*  So there's work to be done there
*  but basically the answer is yes.
*  It is not an explanation of the arrow of time
*  but the fact that branching happens
*  toward the future rather than the past
*  is a consequence of the arrow of time.
*  The arrow of time is sort of more fundamental
*  than that fact.
*  Okay, two more
*  questions grouped together
*  and these are superficially not exactly
*  asking about the same thing
*  but you'll see the relationship.
*  Rob Butler says,
*  As I was daydreaming last week while agitating my morning coffee
*  I noticed the gentle rocking of my mug
*  had created two perfect spiral galaxies
*  in the milk froth.
*  Is it possible that the universe's missing gravity
*  isn't due to a particle
*  but rather an extrinsic force
*  acting on or within the universe
*  similar to a centrifugal or Coriolis type effect?
*  And then Maxime Alexandrovitz says,
*  Recently after a jogging session
*  I've noticed something that caught my interest
*  in my sports tracker app.
*  It shows a diagram of every training
*  and where whenever the altitude above sea level
*  rises, my speed drops.
*  Which is obvious, it's hard to run uphill.
*  You slow down.
*  But those two values when compared together
*  resemble a quantum harmonic oscillator.
*  Whenever the real part of the wave drops
*  the imaginary part goes up.
*  So this is a long shot but I can't stop thinking about
*  the two questions of additional spatial dimensions
*  which you mentioned as a possible result of the recent
*  muon affair in your solo episode.
*  Could this correlation be a possible
*  macroscopic hint
*  for something like that or is it my only
*  my vivid imagination?
*  So besides the fact that these are
*  poetic little stories being told here
*  the common thing about these two questions
*  is trying to draw
*  inspiration from a common
*  everyday occurrence to some deep feature of the universe.
*  Which in principle is a good thing to do.
*  Totally respectable
*  kind of line of reasoning
*  to do.
*  But here's the problem.
*  The problem is that these systems
*  cream swirling into coffee
*  or you jogging up and down the hill
*  these are so simple
*  these systems.
*  They're very common toy models.
*  They're paradigmatic.
*  They're examples of
*  simple kinds of physical behavior.
*  So you expect very very
*  similar kinds of behavior in
*  wildly unrelated things.
*  The phenomena you're looking at here
*  are sufficiently simple.
*  Swirls and sine waves.
*  These are going to appear all over the place
*  in contexts that really don't have any
*  deep fundamental true connection
*  with each other at all.
*  So in both cases I'm going to say no.
*  This is not going to work.
*  The gravity that we use to understand
*  dark matter is general relativity.
*  It's very very well tested.
*  There's no room in our galaxy
*  which is very very tiny compared to
*  the whole universe for something
*  acting on it from the outside
*  to other than just the gravity of the stuff
*  to be causing this
*  rotation curves to be like they are.
*  And as you know
*  as I've said over and over again
*  let's put it that way. Maybe you don't know.
*  But dark matter
*  the best evidence for dark matter comes from
*  the cosmic microwave background.
*  Not from galaxies. So if you want to get rid of
*  dark matter, explain the cosmic microwave background.
*  That's what you have to do.
*  And for the jogging up and down
*  yeah it's a sine wave.
*  There's lots of sine waves that have
*  the property that one variable goes up
*  and down and the other variable also goes up and down
*  but out of phase.
*  Many many many things like that
*  has nothing specially to do with quantum mechanics
*  or extra dimensions in principle.
*  That would be my answer.
*  Okay. Sandro Stucchi says
*  can a photon spontaneously decay
*  into two lower energy photons?
*  And if so, is this process reversible?
*  This is a good question.
*  So the answer is no. Roughly speaking
*  it cannot happen.
*  Why not?
*  So you might think well
*  if I have one photon with a certain energy
*  then
*  well let's put it this way.
*  If I have a particle with a certain energy
*  and it could decay
*  it's allowed kinematically
*  to decay into lower mass particles
*  then it does eventually.
*  It might take some time but eventually it will
*  because there's sort of more room
*  in phase space and the space of all possible
*  situations for there to be
*  multi-particle systems than single-particle systems.
*  Roughly speaking
*  this is entropy increasing.
*  There's more ways for the system to be
*  many particles than just one particle.
*  So if you have one photon
*  with a certain energy couldn't you imagine
*  wouldn't that logic tell you
*  that it could decay into two photons?
*  There are ways to be two photons than to be one photon right?
*  But it doesn't work
*  because the photon is traveling
*  at the speed of light basically.
*  So not only do you have to conserve energy
*  you also have to conserve momentum.
*  Momentum is not just a number
*  it's also a direction.
*  So if you go through the math
*  you might temporarily think it could happen
*  a single photon with a single energy
*  E you might say
*  well that could decay into two photons
*  also going at the speed of light
*  in exactly the same direction
*  with half the energy each right?
*  What's the difference between one photon with energy E
*  and two photons with energy E over 2?
*  And it even works out
*  with conservation of momentum.
*  But one problem with that
*  there's a technical problem with that
*  which is you haven't really
*  increased the phase space of what's going on.
*  There's zero phase space
*  to go into because you have to get
*  exactly the energy and momentum of
*  both photons to line up in exactly the right way.
*  If the photons you decay into
*  go off back to back
*  then the sum of their two
*  momenta is not moving at the speed of light.
*  The only way that their two momenta
*  can add up to moving the speed of light
*  is if they move in exactly the same direction
*  as the original photon did.
*  So there's kind of no room for this to happen.
*  But you might think well I don't know
*  I'm still not quite convinced that's a little bit too
*  persnickety for me.
*  Well here's the other answer you also have to conserve
*  angular momentum right? Not just linear momentum.
*  If a photon is a spin-1 particle
*  can one spin-1 particle
*  decay into two spin-1 particles?
*  Well not unless they are orbiting
*  each other with a total spin of one
*  to get rid of the other spin-1
*  and that's not going to happen if they're both moving in the same direction.
*  So once you take
*  all of the conservation laws
*  into account, no. One photon
*  cannot spontaneously decay into two.
*  If they could, we would notice.
*  We would have seen that a long time ago.
*  EndersHedlund says
*  I'm just kidding with preposterous universe.com.
*  Everything you teach us is that the universe is far from preposterous
*  looking forward to hearing the story behind this.
*  Well yes.
*  So spoiler alert, it's a joke.
*  I'm just kidding with preposterous universe.com.
*  You know it came about because
*  back when I first got my website
*  I was also working on dark energy
*  and the accelerating universe
*  and I wrote a paper called
*  Dark Energy and the Preposterous Universe
*  because at that time
*  when it was still new and shiny to have dark energy
*  and to try to explain it
*  we theorists were still sort of
*  a little bit shaken
*  with the fact that there was a non-zero
*  cosmological constant, an acceleration to the universe.
*  We didn't expect that.
*  We had good arguments based on naturalness
*  that the cosmological
*  constant should be zero.
*  So the point of calling the universe preposterous
*  is not that it is preposterous
*  it's that it appears
*  preposterous to us. It's that there is
*  a mismatch between our theoretical
*  guesses
*  as to what the universe is going to be like
*  and what the experiments actually show us.
*  So calling the universe preposterous is not
*  calling the universe names. It's calling
*  us names. It's reminding us
*  that we're not done yet
*  trying to understand the universe.
*  The universe cannot be preposterous. The universe is the universe.
*  It cannot be unnatural.
*  The universe is by definition
*  the most natural thing.
*  It can appear unnatural to us and that's our fault.
*  That means that we need to do better.
*  Okay, another grouped question
*  both about string theory.
*  Rebecca LaShua says
*  Is string theory a quantum field theory?
*  Can you speak a little about the relationship
*  between string theory and quantum field theory in general?
*  And Marcus Curran says
*  I have a question about string theory.
*  The sense I get from a layman's perspective is that
*  its selling point is in the beauty of the theory.
*  That it hints at a way to make known
*  physics and also a concept of quantum gravity
*  fall out from deeper fundamentals
*  in a way that seems too good to be just a coincidence.
*  The problem seems to be
*  the ideas are fiendishly hard to prove experimentally.
*  Could it be that this is as far as we get?
*  Could it be that string theory
*  is probably on the right track but is just beyond
*  the practical limit of what science can do
*  in the real world?
*  So the quantum field theory question is a very good one
*  because as you
*  study physics and you learn about
*  particles and Newtonian mechanics
*  and you learn quantum mechanics and you learn
*  quantum field theory, you're left with the idea
*  that the fields are more fundamental than the particles.
*  And in some sense
*  string theory seems like a step backwards
*  from that. When you first learn string theory
*  it's like you're going back to the particle
*  language but you replace
*  particles with strings, okay?
*  What happens to the fields?
*  The fields were supposed to be progress
*  are we undoing that progress?
*  And I'm not an expert
*  I'm not a working string theorist.
*  I've written a couple papers that are string theory
*  adjacent but I'm not a real
*  expert in string theory so I'm not the one to ask
*  but I will give you my impression here.
*  The best we have
*  in terms of understanding
*  how string theory works
*  does not come from thinking of it
*  as a version of quantum field theory
*  but at some higher stringy level.
*  There is something called string field theory
*  Ed Witten has written about it
*  and other people have also.
*  It just seems like a cumbersome mathematical
*  apparatus that
*  doesn't really help us
*  in understanding what string theory actually predicts.
*  But
*  we also, since the second super string
*  revolution in the mid 90s
*  the motto is string theory
*  is not a theory of strings either
*  right? There are higher dimensional
*  objects, D-brains
*  there are different numbers of dimensions
*  not only 10 dimensions but 11 dimensions
*  where the theory can be defined in
*  and in 11 dimensions there aren't strings at all
*  and there's some underlying
*  theory that presumably isn't stringy
*  at all that gives rise to what
*  we know of as
*  the famous 5 different kinds of
*  string theory plus the 6th
*  11 dimensional super gravity theory
*  as different low energy limits
*  of some big underlying theory
*  called M theory.
*  So no one knows really what the fundamental
*  unique most beautiful definition
*  of M theory really is.
*  So maybe
*  string theory
*  is just not worth trying to make into
*  a string field theory because
*  there's something even deeper
*  that we don't know or maybe
*  we haven't figured out yet
*  the efforts that have been made
*  in the direction of string field theory just haven't been up
*  to the task yet. I don't know
*  again like this is not quite my area so
*  that's my impression but you would have to ask a real
*  expert about that. And
*  to Marges' question
*  you know I always
*  I always object a little bit
*  when people say including string theorists
*  when they put the selling point
*  of string theory as the beauty of
*  the theory because
*  the string theorists know
*  but the people who are listening
*  them don't that what they
*  mean is it's a
*  purportedly very beautiful explanation
*  for the data that we have.
*  It's not just beautiful
*  right? Who cares if something is
*  just beautiful but has no connection to the world
*  we observe. What makes
*  string theories compelling is that
*  we know we live in a world with space time
*  with gauge theories
*  for the forces of nature with
*  gravity and curvature
*  and string theory gets us all that stuff
*  that's what makes string theory
*  interesting. It gets us that stuff in a
*  particularly beautiful way if you know
*  the theory and how it works
*  so it's not just the beauty
*  that is there and of course
*  it fails at getting us all the way
*  to where we want to go. No one has yet been able to
*  sort of explain why
*  we live in a world that is 3 plus 1 dimensional
*  with SU3 cross SU2
*  cross SU1 forces and things
*  like that. That's a problem
*  for string theory. So
*  yes it is possible that
*  this could be as far as we get. I encourage you
*  actually to listen to the podcast
*  I did with Brian Green who's a working
*  string theorist and he was
*  remarkably honest about
*  exactly that fact. He said yeah it's completely
*  plausible to him
*  that a few
*  years from now whatever it is
*  however many the number might be
*  string theory will be done in math departments
*  you know the ambition of string
*  theory was absolutely to relate to
*  the real world of experiments you know to
*  predict things that we could not otherwise
*  explain in our
*  accelerators and so forth but that
*  has not happened. Maybe it will happen tomorrow
*  right who knows but maybe
*  it won't and if it doesn't then you could
*  absolutely see people deciding that
*  math departments were more
*  more appropriate
*  place to put our
*  string theorists and maybe the mathematicians
*  will think we don't need as many string theorists as the
*  physicists do. So I think that's a very
*  important question for string theory to face
*  up to. We'll see what happens. We'll see where it
*  goes. I mean I should say that actually
*  makes it sound overall a little bit too
*  pessimistic as any
*  string theorist will tell you correctly
*  so doing string theory
*  even though it is not latched on
*  to experiment in any direct way it has been
*  an incredibly fruitful source of ideas
*  ideas on black hole information
*  on dualities, gauge
*  gravity dualities you know things like
*  that so string theory is still
*  useful to physics even though it hasn't
*  quite explained the standard model or anything like
*  that quite yet.
*  Rodrigo Nader says
*  about the emergence of consciousness
*  or sentience do you believe
*  that consciousness emerges from a certain condition
*  some neuron structure or that
*  it grows continuously like that there are
*  degrees of sentience would you say that every
*  living being is a bit conscious?
*  Well you
*  say every living being
*  I'm certainly I'm not panpsychist
*  we talked about panpsychism on the podcast
*  with Philip Goff panpsychists
*  really believe that everything
*  is a bit conscious right or at least has
*  some mental properties in some sense
*  I don't go that way
*  myself but I do think
*  that consciousness is not an
*  on or off switch either there can be degrees
*  of consciousness or sentience
*  absolutely I think that I am
*  more conscious than my cats
*  my cats are more conscious than an earthworm
*  earthworm is more conscious than
*  a bacterium bacterium is more conscious
*  than a rock
*  okay now that's
*  probably not just because there
*  is a single spectrum of consciousness
*  and you just grow as you go
*  in that direction but there are different aspects
*  of consciousness that come along
*  the way so I don't think it's either
*  on or off nor
*  is it univalued right
*  there's different things you learn to do along
*  the evolutionary tree that a bacterium
*  just it's not so when you think about
*  you know I don't know
*  imagining
*  the future I don't think a bacterium
*  does that at all
*  imagining the future might play part of a
*  role in consciousness and
*  I can do it and I can do it better than my cats
*  and a bacterium can't do it at all
*  okay so it's not that it's doing it
*  a little bit so I think it's very complicated
*  and we don't have the complete definitions yet
*  we should be open minded and develop
*  a phenomenological theory of how those things
*  come to be before deciding ahead of time
*  what they are
*  Dan says have you ever considered
*  selling merchandise for the podcast
*  for example the logo on a t-shirt or cup
*  I've considered it yeah considering
*  it is easy doing it is more work
*  I even set up a
*  shop I designed a t-shirt
*  got that far and I made a t-shirt for myself
*  it's pretty awesome I have a mind scape t-shirt
*  I'm the only one who has a mind scape t-shirt
*  I'm not wearing it right now but it's a very good t-shirt
*  you know if there were huge
*  up swelling of
*  demand for something like that
*  then I would do it
*  but you know it takes time
*  and I've got to like I've said before in other contexts
*  things that take time are not things
*  that I'm very good at doing because
*  I have other things to do right
*  I mean you know I've got to make the podcast
*  I've got to write books I've got to do some science
*  stuff like that so again if there's huge demand for it
*  let me know
*  good two questions
*  I'm going to group together about the quantization
*  of time Fabian Rose-Dolin says
*  one visualization of multiple worlds
*  is a sort of timeline
*  splitting into multiple different
*  timelines like a tree
*  but if time is also fundamentally quantum
*  so that not only the physical world
*  as we know it splits into multiple worlds
*  but time itself splits into multiple
*  times does this mean that kind of visualization
*  is misleading and Robert
*  Rualana says
*  is time quantized good so I'll take the second one
*  first no
*  as far as we know time is just not
*  quantized but then again as far as
*  we know space is not
*  quantized either you know
*  in quantum mechanics
*  so in just well not not
*  quantum mechanics in good old
*  non relativistic
*  quantum mechanics like you need to do
*  to explain the hydrogen atom
*  or the double slit experiment okay when you have
*  a bunch of particles with wave functions
*  etc etc space is not quantized
*  in those theories
*  space is
*  the location of a particle is an observable
*  you can measure it
*  and it's a continuum you can get in principle
*  any answer so as we said before you should
*  think about is the probability
*  what is the probability the particle is between
*  point x and point x plus delta x
*  because it is not quantized
*  now once you get to
*  quantum gravity
*  then we don't know maybe space
*  is quantized maybe not but we don't know
*  very much about quantum gravity at all
*  right we have ideas some of us have ideas
*  but we shouldn't trust those ideas
*  quite yet and time
*  is even less likely to
*  be quantized than space you know
*  the Schrodinger equation
*  is the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics
*  and it has
*  time in there as a smooth continuous
*  variable it might
*  not be the Schrodinger equation might not
*  survive into the fundamental theory
*  of everything there might be a better version
*  and there are impact options
*  for what that might be but there is no
*  established sense about
*  how those options might work the Schrodinger
*  equation is still the best thing we have
*  people will often say you know the
*  Planck time which you get by combining
*  Planck's constant and Newton's
*  gravitational constant and the speed of light
*  in the correct way is somehow
*  a quantum of time
*  that's just false
*  no one thinks that no one who knows what's going on
*  thinks that it might represent
*  a fundamental
*  measurement precision
*  right a fundamental limit to the precision
*  that you can measure the time interval
*  between two events or something like that
*  but it does not imply
*  that time is somehow discrete
*  in any simple way
*  and for Fabian's question
*  because the Schrodinger equation
*  does have time in it
*  when we visualize the branching of worlds
*  as you know one branch
*  branches into two and draw them going
*  upward let's say on a diagram
*  and time is flowing upward
*  it is the same time it's not multiple
*  times it's multiple
*  space times
*  but it is there's a
*  single time variable that is
*  clicking off in the Schrodinger equation
*  that brings both of those space times into existence
*  so the visualization is actually
*  not that misleading the only thing
*  that could be misleading about it is if you want to
*  imagine that the space in between
*  the different branches of the wave function
*  that you're visualizing somehow exists
*  that part is completely
*  crazy it's just we need to draw
*  it somehow it's not because there's really
*  anything in between the different branches of the wave function
*  Philip Herdlichka
*  says
*  I would like to ask you a question
*  about the double slit experiment
*  let's have some neo-Copenhagen
*  psi epistemic interpretation
*  where the wave function or really its square
*  is just a probability of finding
*  a particle at a given place
*  now in the double slit experiment the wave packet
*  which is just a probability of finding a particle
*  splits into two wave packets due to the
*  slits and interferes with itself
*  the question is if the wave packet
*  is not real and is
*  only a probability of finding the particle there
*  then the particle must have gone through only one or the other
*  slit so what causes the interference
*  if we have psi epistemic interpretations
*  and the particle really only goes through one slit
*  what causes the interference
*  I don't know
*  I really don't so I
*  debated with myself
*  about whether or not I should answer this question
*  because I don't have a good answer to it
*  but I can at least alert people to the
*  existence of the question
*  what's going on here is that
*  among the different possible options
*  for one's favorite interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  there are options that are called
*  psi ontic
*  where the wave function psi
*  really exists you know here it is
*  it's the fundamental stuff of reality
*  or at least part of it so we mentioned
*  hidden variable theories before and the hidden
*  variable theories the wave function
*  is part of reality and the hidden variables
*  are another part of reality in many
*  worlds or in objective collapse
*  models it's just the wave function that is
*  reality in the psi
*  epistemic models
*  what they're saying is that
*  the wave function is just a tool
*  that we use
*  to predict the probability
*  of certain measurement outcomes in fact
*  in some versions like in cubism
*  different people can
*  assign different wave functions to exactly
*  the same physical system because
*  they have different amounts of knowledge and so they
*  know different things about the system and give it
*  different probabilities for doing things
*  now the question you're asking is
*  don't we have evidence from things
*  like the double slit experiment
*  don't we have evidence that the wave
*  function interferes with itself
*  probability distributions don't interfere
*  with themselves because they're not real
*  they're just you know ways of measuring our
*  ignorance but the wave function does
*  because it creates slits it creates
*  interference patterns on the other side
*  of the double slit so what's going on
*  I don't know what is going on
*  here is and I've tried
*  I've tried to understand what
*  psi epistemic people would say
*  about this but I'm not a psi epistemic person
*  I don't spend that much time
*  trying to think about it because I have other things to do
*  I'm thinking about my theory that I think is more likely to be right
*  so you should really ask one of them
*  but I would
*  I think that what they would say is
*  look our job is
*  to predict the outcome
*  on the screen
*  our job is not to tell you what's
*  happening when we're not looking at it right
*  the idea of a psi epistemic theory
*  is to make predictions for the experiences
*  of observers
*  not to tell some mechanistic story about
*  what happens along the way
*  there may or may not be some mechanistic story to tell
*  I think that's what they would say
*  but what I care about is my ability
*  to make predictions and so if I use
*  some machinery to make predictions like a wave function
*  interfering with itself that's fine
*  I'm allowed to do that but what I care about
*  is the predictions
*  are the experiences of observers
*  that's what I'm after at the end of the day
*  again don't
*  trust me on this one I'm not
*  completely sure that's true but I think that that is what they
*  would say anyway I'm not an expert
*  because I don't think that's a very fruitful way to go
*  I think that
*  the wave function really is real
*  and that's the better way to go
*  alright I'm gonna yet again
*  group these three questions together
*  you'll see why Eric Chen says
*  any updates on the physics of democracy
*  what is the main motivation behind this project
*  and what do you think are the main sources of value
*  in bringing ideas from physics to the analysis
*  of political, economic or other
*  multi-agent systems
*  Luca Morticini says
*  I first met you in the great courses plus
*  with your courses dark matter and dark energy
*  the Higgs boson and time
*  my question is do you intend to record any new
*  courses on that site
*  and Herb Bergovitz says do you have a new teaching
*  company course in the works if you do
*  what's the topic teaching company and the great courses
*  are the same company
*  so you see why I've grouped these together
*  they're all about questions about what I'm
*  doing in the future and you know
*  I think that I let my guard down a little bit here
*  because usually I just don't say anything about
*  what I'm working on in long term projects
*  for the future because you know sometimes they don't
*  pan out, they don't happen or they don't happen
*  at the time scale that you might want
*  them to happen or if they don't happen at all
*  but I have revealed that I am
*  working on a book called the physics of democracy
*  and
*  it's actually been delayed I'm
*  very willing to say that and it's been delayed
*  for a couple reasons one is
*  that I mean the major reason
*  is
*  that when I went into it
*  I was working on the physics of democracy
*  you know I had an outline I had some ideas
*  the idea is basically to use ideas
*  from the physics of complex systems
*  multi-agent systems
*  emergent phenomena
*  in multiple component
*  aggregations of things
*  to talk about political issues
*  right and I know that some people
*  have worked on this obviously but
*  I am going to write a trade level book
*  so I'm going to talk about other people's
*  interesting work to sort of
*  let people know how a physicist
*  would think about these things so when
*  I started to work on it and started to go like from the
*  brief outline I had to
*  real work you know reading other people's stuff
*  talking to people what I realized is
*  there's an enormous amount
*  of work in this area but it's
*  just not labeled as such
*  you know if you look up
*  econo physics on the internet
*  or anywhere else
*  econo physics is a whole field I mean
*  there are textbooks in econo physics
*  it's almost a joke
*  physicists going in and trying to do
*  economics but there are no
*  political physics books
*  and so you might get the impression that no one
*  works on it but lots of people
*  work on it they just don't call it that
*  so it turns out that I have more work
*  to do than I thought I would
*  which is fine that's actually good news
*  right I'm going to learn a whole bunch of fun things
*  like half the reason why you write these books is you can learn
*  new fun things yourself
*  so it's going to take more time to do that
*  another reason is we had a pandemic
*  even with the original plan
*  I was still definitely planning on talking to a lot of people
*  traveling you know
*  picking people's brains and things like that
*  spending time at the Santa Fe Institute
*  you know we have an idea of maybe
*  having a workshop at Santa Fe on exactly this topic
*  none of that happened
*  none of that happened in the time scale
*  that would have been reasonable so we've delayed it
*  until later
*  what I am hoping to do again I'm talking out of turn
*  I really shouldn't say this but the hope
*  don't hold me to any of my hopes
*  because they can't go away but the hope is
*  to instead write
*  the biggest ideas in the universe
*  the videos that I did
*  last summer where I talk about
*  the classical universe and the quantum mechanical laws of physics and field theory and normalization
*  and then a little bit about complex systems and criticality and things like that all that stuff
*  what I really realized
*  what I realized while doing the videos
*  was that it's a level of discussion
*  that just doesn't exist out there
*  almost not at all
*  I mean the one place maybe
*  that tries to do something like that
*  is Roger Penrose's book The Road to Reality
*  but you know
*  it's idiosyncratically Penrosian
*  okay
*  and the idea of
*  really doing modern physics
*  but giving some of the equations
*  right not teaching people
*  how to do the product rule for derivatives
*  or anything like that
*  or you know complex contours
*  contours in the complex plane to do integrals
*  none of the nitty gritty
*  techniques you use to do mathematical analysis
*  in theoretical physics
*  but enough of the conceptual framework
*  to say oh look here's a derivative
*  here's an integral
*  it's not that hard learning what a derivative is
*  and learning what an integral is
*  is very easy learning how to
*  calculate them is very hard
*  and so you either
*  there's a bifurcation
*  there are popular level discussions
*  where you just don't talk about that stuff
*  there's just words, no equations
*  equations are considered scary
*  or you do the textbook
*  you just learn everything like you're going to be a professional physicist
*  and what I tried to do in the videos
*  was to say well there's a middle ground
*  where I can just tell you what the equations mean
*  without telling you how to manipulate them
*  without pretending you're going to grow up
*  to be a professional physicist
*  I want to give you the ideas
*  and so I would like to develop that into a book
*  that is a project that is going to go
*  first and then physics and democracy second
*  for the great courses
*  or the teaching company
*  again yes I would like to do another
*  course for them
*  and the obvious thing to do will be
*  quantum mechanics
*  I wrote a book on that right? Something deeply hidden
*  so many worlds maybe particularly
*  because they have a lot of courses on quantum mechanics already
*  if they didn't
*  I might just do a course on quantum mechanics in general
*  but they have quantum mechanics courses that are perfectly good
*  they don't need that
*  so I might just do a course on
*  some version of
*  what I talked about in something deeply hidden
*  so it will be about
*  quantum mechanics itself but only a little bit
*  and then why many worlds
*  is such an attractive version of quantum mechanics
*  and why the foundations of quantum mechanics
*  are important in the first place
*  maybe a little bit about immersion space time
*  who knows but that is the hope
*  no more talk about future projects
*  until I like to have them done
*  otherwise I am just putting pressure on myself
*  alright what is next? Fred Alexander says
*  people are always searching for meaning
*  i.e. our purpose
*  from the big bang to decaying particles
*  the least common denominator seems to boil down
*  to entropy
*  is increasing entropy at the core of why all things happen in our universe
*  so in a sense yeah
*  actually
*  I am not quite sure what ends are you expecting here
*  but I am sure
*  there is a sense in which the answer to this question is yes
*  but let's be clear about what
*  that sense is
*  so for one thing it is crucially important to separate out
*  as I always try to do
*  time as a notion
*  as an idea
*  time you know
*  what time is it now how long will this thing take
*  stuff like that from the arrow of time
*  so when I say that entropy is responsible
*  the fact that entropy is increasing
*  is responsible for the arrow of time
*  so I am not quite sure what ends are you expecting here
*  so time is responsible for the arrow of time
*  that should not be translated in your mind
*  to increasing entropy is responsible for time
*  although that happens a lot
*  I see people sort of paraphrasing things I say in that way
*  and that is just wrong
*  I mean there is no arrow of space
*  but there is still space
*  time exists
*  and it also separately has an arrow
*  those are two things
*  so I would not say exactly the phraseology you used there
*  is increasing entropy at the core of why all things happen
*  so I am not quite sure what ends are you expecting here
*  so I would not say exactly the phraseology you used there
*  is increasing entropy at the core of why all things happen
*  we could have a universe in which time existed
*  and things happened
*  but entropy did not increase
*  it would be a very very different universe than ours
*  but there would still be time and all that stuff
*  having said all that
*  having cleared that brush work a little bit
*  if there are
*  for anything that does happen in the universe
*  if that thing has the property that
*  it does not happen
*  equally well forward or backward in time
*  then entropy lies behind it
*  that is what I would say
*  even the expansion of the universe
*  only happens one way
*  but it could happen the other way
*  you could imagine running it backward
*  and there would be nothing weird about that
*  so that is not to do with entropy
*  whereas an ice cube melting
*  you do not really imagine that an ice cube would unmelt spontaneously
*  that is not something that you would expect to happen in the world
*  that does have to do with entropy
*  when it comes down to human beings
*  meaning and purpose
*  well if you have a purpose
*  generally I suspect
*  your purposes are related to things that will happen in the future
*  you do not have as a purpose
*  I would like the following thing to have happened in the past
*  because
*  you have no causal leverage over the past
*  the past is done with
*  the future you think you can affect by your doings here and now
*  and so the future is the thing about which time
*  you have the opportunity
*  to do things
*  and you think you can affect by your doings here and now
*  and so the future is the thing about which time
*  you could have a purpose
*  and I think that is a fundamental difference
*  between the past and the future
*  that is ultimately due to entropy
*  because entropy is increasing
*  that we think of the past as being fixed
*  and the future as being influenceable
*  so whenever you talk about things like purpose or meaning etc.
*  in the background of those discussions
*  is the fact that
*  we treat the past and future very very differently
*  and the reason why is because entropy is increasing
*  so the short answer is yes
*  and the second reason is that
*  entropy is increasing so the short answer is yes
*  to your question
*  John Shoning says
*  if particle position momentum uncertainty
*  can be explained completely classically
*  due to matter waves and Fourier transforms
*  why does applying
*  that same logic to water waves
*  seem inconsistent
*  since an individual ripple in a wave of water seems to be
*  a concrete thing as opposed to a more conceptual
*  infinite sum
*  so well this so I don't know how much
*  background the people have in general
*  here you've heard of the uncertainty principle
*  that in quantum mechanics
*  you cannot have a quantum state
*  for which if you were to measure
*  either the position or the momentum
*  you can know ahead of time
*  what either one of them will be
*  to very very high precision
*  that is not allowed in quantum mechanics
*  there are quantum states for which
*  were you to measure the position
*  you can predict ahead of time what answer you will get
*  there are quantum states for which
*  you can predict ahead of time what answer you will get
*  there are quantum states for which
*  if you were to measure the momentum
*  you can predict ahead of time what you will get
*  there are no quantum states for which you could
*  predict both accurately ahead of time
*  that's the uncertainty principle
*  delta x the uncertainty
*  in x times delta p
*  is at least h bar or h bar divided by 2
*  something like that
*  and that sounds very mysterious
*  and you know a lot of crazy talk has been
*  expended thinking about the uncertainty principle
*  once you know what a wave function is
*  all that craziness goes away
*  it has to do with Fourier transforms
*  and it has to do with the fact that wave functions
*  are waves
*  and if you think about the wave
*  as a wave in position
*  so what you mean is
*  when you have a wave function you don't
*  attach a wave function
*  both to position and momentum
*  you draw the wave
*  as just a function of position
*  and then the momentum
*  is the wavelength
*  or the frequency really of that wave
*  that you've drawn as a function of position
*  so if
*  the wave that you've drawn for
*  position is highly peaked around
*  just one value
*  then in terms of momentum
*  it's a sum of as the
*  as the questioner says it's an infinite sum
*  of many many different momenta
*  and vice versa so classical
*  what we call Fourier analysis
*  reducing a wave to its individual
*  frequencies makes
*  the uncertainty principle
*  seem almost
*  like not even a physical option
*  just a mathematical necessity
*  right they couldn't have been any other way
*  so why isn't the same thing true for something
*  like a water wave or something like that
*  right well
*  there is a difference the uncertainty
*  principle is not classical at all
*  there is analogous things
*  for classical waves you cannot
*  have a classical wave
*  whose that is both
*  localized in position
*  and localized in Fourier space
*  the difference is
*  that in quantum mechanics position and
*  momenta are both things you can observe
*  and get specific answers for
*  right so there is a relationship
*  between that wave
*  and the outcomes of observations
*  in quantum mechanics that is
*  not there in classical mechanics
*  in classical mechanics if you have a water wave
*  you just observe the water wave that's it
*  in quantum mechanics there's a wave
*  but you don't observe the wave
*  you see either the position or the momentum
*  observable and so it's
*  that relationship between
*  the fact that you cannot localize
*  both in position and momentum and
*  the fact that position and momentum are both things
*  you can observe that gives
*  the uncertainty principle its oomph in some
*  sense
*  Tim Kennedy says how do you feel about the
*  new political leadership in the United States
*  are you pleased with the first 100 days
*  I think fairly
*  I think I'm pleased yeah
*  honestly by any
*  reasonable standard
*  given the previous 4 years
*  one has to be over the moon happy
*  with the current political leadership
*  in the United States
*  and just so I'm very very clear about this
*  people can disagree with me that's fine
*  but I want everyone to know what I mean
*  when I say the words whether or not you agree
*  with the words
*  Donald Trump was just the worst
*  president we've ever had in the United States
*  it's not because of his policies
*  his policies weren't that great I could complain about his policies
*  it is because of
*  the complete lack of respect
*  for what you call democracy
*  and the institutions of government
*  the corruption the incompetence
*  the
*  the
*  cult of personality
*  the you know the
*  never putting the American people
*  first before the interests of
*  Donald Trump and his family
*  he's treading over all the norms of how things happen
*  in the democratic government
*  all that stuff
*  still to this day
*  it's May still not even accepting
*  that he lost the election right
*  that's what makes him the worst president of all time
*  he's still saying that you know it was a cheat
*  and people believe him
*  and this has done incalculable damage
*  to the project of
*  democracy in the United States of America
*  democracy is hard enough
*  to get it to work
*  when everyone believes that we are in a functioning democracy
*  because people disagree with each other
*  about what the policies should be
*  but when you have substantial numbers of people
*  who will just never accept the outcome of an election
*  that doesn't go their way
*  that democracy can't work
*  and that's enormously more damaging
*  than any particular policy
*  that Donald Trump might have had
*  so it's not that you know
*  I'm democratic or republican
*  I do end up on the democratic side
*  most of the time
*  but my objections to Donald Trump
*  weren't that he was a republican
*  in fact he wasn't a republican right
*  he was a democrat for a long time in his life
*  and I like to say it this way
*  imagine some horror scenario
*  in which Donald Trump had stayed a democrat
*  and had run for president
*  as a democrat
*  and had won the nomination
*  to be the democratic nominee
*  for president
*  and the republicans had nominated someone really terrible
*  like Ted Cruz you know would I have voted
*  for the democrat rather than Ted Cruz
*  even if the democrat were Donald Trump
*  and the answer is not only in that situation
*  would I have voted for Ted Cruz
*  I would have very loudly announced
*  to everyone that I was voting for Ted Cruz
*  and I would have donated money to Ted Cruz's campaign
*  against Donald Trump
*  Ted Cruz is a terrible person and his policies would have been terrible
*  but he would work
*  within the system of our democracy
*  much much better than
*  Donald Trump would have
*  and I know how bad he is
*  compared to Donald Trump he still would have been good
*  anyway so just the restoration
*  of a functioning government at all
*  you know if you look at the press conferences
*  and so forth the press briefings
*  if you look at what kinds of executive orders are being signed
*  what kinds of legislation is moving forward
*  all of that stuff
*  it's just a back to normal feeling
*  that is enormously helpful
*  in terms of actual actions on the ground
*  you know the
*  we went from one of the worst
*  policies for dealing with the pan-American
*  policies for dealing with the pandemic
*  to one of the most effective
*  vaccine distribution
*  policies in the world so that's pretty good
*  they're finally putting
*  actual effort into
*  restoring the economy
*  and jobs after the effects
*  of the pandemic so there's plenty
*  of things to complain about like I don't
*  agree with Joe Biden about everything
*  or even close to everything I think that you know
*  on certain issues like as I already
*  mentioned free trade I think that trade should be
*  a lot freer than he's very protectionist
*  immigration and the refugee crisis
*  he's done terrible at you know so I can
*  nitpick those things but compared
*  to the absolutely abysmal
*  rock bottom presidential leadership
*  that we had before Joe Biden
*  he is unimpeachably
*  wonderful there you go that's what I would
*  say about the first hundred days
*  Jan Smith says
*  what scientific discovery would disappoint
*  you the most so that's an interesting
*  question this is another one where I thought
*  about this like do I have anything interesting to say about
*  this because in some
*  sense the respectable
*  answer is you can't
*  be disappointed by scientific discoveries
*  the world is the world
*  right the universe is the universe we don't
*  know what it is we're discovering
*  it we're not bringing it into existence we're finding
*  out what it is by doing science and
*  so every scientific discovery teaches us something new
*  about the world how can you be disappointed
*  by that okay but then
*  in the real world we're only human
*  I'm only human and I would certainly
*  prefer things to be some ways
*  rather than other ways
*  but I'm not
*  it is hard to think because basically
*  if you think about it you're
*  rooting for certain scientific theories to come
*  true because you think that
*  they probably are right because
*  you sort of favor them in terms of
*  your current tentative state of knowledge
*  you know if
*  I don't know if
*  the many worlds deputation of quantum mechanics was not true
*  or if general relativity was not true on large
*  scales that would be really really
*  interesting I don't think it's going to happen
*  so in some sense I'm rooting for the theory that
*  I spend my time thinking about
*  but it would be fascinating if it
*  weren't actually true so
*  the kinds of scientific discoveries
*  that would disappoint me would be ones
*  that somehow represented a retreat
*  from
*  intelligibility
*  in the universe right
*  the whole reason why science is so great
*  is because the universe is
*  understandable it's hard
*  but we make absolute progress
*  and sort of features of the universe
*  that seem kind of inexplicable
*  would be the worst
*  now of course
*  what counts is that you know
*  one of my favorite stories is with Joe Polchinski
*  the famous physicist who passed away
*  a couple years ago
*  back in the day back in the mid 90s
*  when I was a post doc in Santa Barbara
*  and Joe and I joked about
*  the anthropic principle
*  and he said yeah if the cosmological
*  constant were ever discovered to be not zero
*  this is in like 1997
*  if we discovered that the cosmological constant was not zero
*  I would resign from physics
*  because the only way to explain that
*  is with the anthropic principle
*  and I hate the anthropic principle
*  and so I said well okay if that happens can I have your office
*  and he said yes
*  and then like a year later they discovered the cosmological
*  constant and not only
*  did I not get Joe's office but he did not resign
*  and in fact he became a big booster
*  of the anthropic principle
*  he never really liked it like he boosted it
*  because he's a respectable
*  intellectually respectable scientist and he said yeah
*  we have data
*  and the best way that I have to account for that data
*  is with a multiverse
*  you know I don't need to like it
*  it's the best scientific explanation that I have to hand
*  so that's the kind of thing where
*  you learn something about the universe
*  you know I'm not sure it's true
*  it's certainly not settled
*  but one could argue
*  that the fact that we found the cosmological constant
*  means that
*  lowers the hope
*  of finding a formula that once and for all
*  predicts the cosmological constant
*  because the anthropic explanation becomes bigger
*  for me the version of that
*  would be something like dynamical
*  collapse models for
*  quantum mechanics if you thought that wave
*  functions really collapsed
*  as an objective fact
*  and just randomly right
*  like just every so often a wave
*  function collapses and it only happens
*  toward the future not toward the past so it
*  violates reversibility also
*  that would just rub me the wrong way
*  if it were true I mean again I'd be
*  thrilled to have learned something about
*  the universe this is an experimental
*  question we're doing experiments to look
*  for this kind of behavior and if it's there
*  I'll believe it and I'm not giving anyone my office
*  but
*  it's just so ugly in my mind so that
*  would disappoint me in that sense I'm not quite sure
*  I would probably
*  think of another way to think that it was really
*  beautiful because again the universe is the universe
*  presumably the universe
*  if we understand it better
*  we'll grow to like it
*  Hannes Stark says if I understand
*  correctly we are wondering where all the anti
*  matter is how do we know that some arbitrary star
*  is made of matter and not
*  anti matter so
*  the simple answer is that the universe is not as empty
*  as you think it is okay
*  if you think about galaxies that are very
*  far apart forget stars you know stars
*  are surrounded by
*  interstellar gas and dust
*  and they would constantly be running
*  into each other if a star were made
*  of anti matter and
*  the rest of the universe were made of matter
*  or even if they were 50-50
*  the matter and anti matter would constantly
*  be hitting each other and
*  annihilating giving off gamma rays
*  that's even true if individual
*  galaxies were matter and
*  anti matter they are still
*  an intergalactic medium
*  it's very rarefied
*  it's very dilute but the universe is big
*  so you can predict the amount of gamma ray
*  radiation in the background light
*  that would exist if galaxies were half and half
*  and it's way more than what we actually observe
*  to make things worse
*  the universe used to be much
*  smaller and denser right and so if you say
*  well now I have a galaxy or whatever
*  that is anti matter and another one
*  that is matter and they are far apart
*  well in the past they used to be right on top of each other
*  certainly that would be even more true
*  with stars so all this matter and anti matter
*  would annihilate very very quickly
*  in the early universe so we are very
*  confident that what we see in our observable
*  universe is almost all matter
*  not anti matter
*  Thomas Pruszicki
*  says
*  imagine a star trek style transporter
*  with a twist it disassembles
*  a person and then supposedly reassembles
*  two identical copies of them on
*  transporter pads 1 and 2
*  you have been through this transporter hundreds of times
*  and every time you were assembled on pad 1
*  how do you decide
*  whether to accept your experience as a reasonable
*  statistical anomaly or to
*  suspect there is something else at play
*  so to repeat to forget this
*  scenario correctly you are told
*  that when you get in the transporter
*  it's a 50-50 chance you go to
*  transporter pad 1 or pad 2
*  but what you actually observe
*  is you are on pad 1 every time
*  so how do you judge what's going on
*  so I think that you know this is
*  absolutely perfect case study
*  for a good Bayesian analysis right
*  who cares what you are told
*  you have a prior
*  belief that the transporter
*  really does
*  put you randomly on transporter pad
*  1 or transporter pad 2
*  and you have a prior
*  probability that it actually always
*  puts you on transporter pad 1
*  and there is a prior probability will always put you on
*  transporter pad 2 and another
*  prior probability that it will alternate
*  and all these different things you have a set of ideas
*  of what the possible credence is
*  you should put with all these different theories are
*  now maybe the person who told you
*  that it was random is very believable and your
*  prior probability that you always
*  go on transporter sorry your prior probability
*  that it's random is 99.99%
*  that's fine
*  but every time
*  that you do the experiment and you keep
*  appearing on transporter pad 1
*  you just run it through basis formula
*  and basis formula gives you a way of saying
*  given this new data
*  how should I change my credences
*  so no matter how high your credence was
*  that the transporter
*  is random between pad 1 and pad 2
*  there will be
*  a number of times you appear on pad 1
*  where you switch over from thinking
*  it was random to thinking you know what
*  I think it just sends me on pad 1 every time
*  but it should never go to
*  0 or 1 because you always have more
*  data that you can collect in the future that might change your mind
*  Rob Gribber says
*  or Graeber says
*  what is our current understanding of the initial
*  formation of magnetic fields in the early
*  universe so I'm not going to
*  give a good answer to this because I don't know
*  what the answer is I don't know I don't think there
*  is a current understanding there are
*  current models but I do want
*  to sort of raise consciousness about this
*  question because it's an interesting one
*  it's one that I've worked on with my
*  PhD advisor George Field we're still thinking about
*  writing a different paper about this
*  updating some of our older stuff
*  but the idea is that we
*  have data that seems to indicate
*  there are large scale magnetic
*  fields in the universe not huge
*  like the actual size of the magnetic
*  field is quite small I don't know
*  exactly what the numbers are but you can
*  sort of measure the average amount of magnetic
*  field between the galaxies and things
*  like that or even large scale in
*  galaxies and so they're there
*  and you can ask where do they come from
*  and it's not impossible to
*  come up with scenarios to get
*  a magnetic field you know you have a bunch of
*  charges electric charges
*  moving around and we know from Maxwell's
*  equations that once you get charges
*  moving around you can make magnetic fields
*  so for a long time now there have
*  been theories of batteries
*  like galaxies acting like
*  batteries winding up
*  the magnetic fields and amplifying
*  them the problem is it's
*  just incredible non-linear horrible
*  mess in magnetohydrodynamics
*  to ask you know starting
*  with some tiny magnetic field
*  some seed field in the early
*  universe how it evolves in
*  a situation as complex
*  as a galaxy in a galaxy you have
*  not just stars but
*  you have gas and dust and some of it's
*  ionized some of it's not you have supernovae
*  going off and they have their own magnetic fields
*  and you have neutron stars and black holes and
*  it's a mess right so
*  there are people like me
*  who don't know anything about this messy late universe
*  stuff but do try to answer the question
*  can we generate some
*  primordial magnetic fields in the
*  early universe with a phase transition
*  you know or something like that that would
*  give you a starting point to make magnetic
*  fields in galaxies but I don't think there's
*  any accepted model for how that is
*  right now I think that knowing just the standard
*  model of particle physics there's no obvious
*  way to make that happen maybe
*  you need new physics maybe you need new
*  scalar fields or
*  pseudo scalar fields or something more exotic
*  to make those magnetic fields I think
*  that right now the problem is just too hard and there's no consensus
*  Adrian says are there any parts of
*  physics that you never understood as well as you think you
*  should what is your kryptonite
*  so I chose to answer this question
*  because it's a short one all
*  parts of physics are parts that I have never understood
*  as well as I think I should
*  even the what parts that I do there's always more
*  to understand right
*  you know I don't even have any degrees
*  in physics and that's a little bit of a cheat
*  both of my degrees undergraduate and graduate
*  are in astrophysics so it's pretty close
*  and I took all the courses
*  but sorry I didn't take all the courses
*  I took all the courses that I thought would be relevant
*  to my work
*  in theoretical physics so I took
*  quantum mechanics and quantum field
*  theory and general relativity
*  and particle physics and the early universe
*  all those things I took courses in those
*  but I could get away without
*  you know I had extra courses to take because
*  there were required courses in the astronomy side of things
*  and therefore I didn't take
*  some of the less relevant
*  physics courses
*  like condensed matter physics right
*  statistical mechanics I didn't even take
*  which is ironic now I do a lot of work
*  on statistical mechanics but so
*  there are absolutely aspects of those
*  fields especially condensed matter physics
*  that I don't
*  come anywhere close to understanding as well
*  as I would like to now
*  as well as I think I should
*  yeah you know who's to say should
*  I'm actually
*  this is another interesting aspect of the
*  question is
*  I get why
*  you know elders in
*  physics departments want
*  their students to get a broad
*  based physics education because
*  all things being equal
*  it makes you a better physicist
*  but it's hard to predict exactly ahead
*  of time what skills people will
*  use in their careers
*  and some people just like being narrow
*  and are very very
*  good at being narrow and getting
*  their narrow thing done
*  and other people don't like being narrow
*  but would like to be brought in a different
*  way than their elders would like them to be
*  like maybe they want to be taking courses in biology
*  or in information theory
*  or in computer science rather than
*  particle physics or condensed
*  matter physics or whatever so
*  I don't have a list of things
*  that everyone should know I think that
*  you should know the things you need to know
*  to get ahead and tickle your curiosity
*  that's my philosophy of these things
*  Nicholas Weiberg says
*  how could quantum field theory be compatible
*  with the idea that the universe has a finite number
*  of degrees of freedom given that a
*  field has a value at every point in space
*  short answer is it's not compatible
*  with that if
*  the universe has a finite number of degrees of freedom
*  then it is not described
*  by a quantum field theory
*  so it might be approximately described
*  by a quantum field theory so that's the hope
*  so for those of us who think that within our
*  observable universe there is a
*  finite dimensional Hilbert space of quantum states
*  which you could translate into saying
*  there are a finite number of degrees of freedom
*  that's exactly
*  well it's not exactly but it's very very
*  analogous to saying there are finite number of atoms
*  and molecules of air in the room that I'm in right now
*  but I can describe them approximately
*  as a continuous fluid
*  as a gas
*  that's a good emergent approximation
*  at low energies and large distances
*  likewise we would hope
*  that whatever this quantum description is
*  that is finite dimensional
*  has as a low energy approximation
*  quantum field theory
*  that's what it would have to be but it couldn't strictly
*  be a quantum field theory all the way down
*  Chris Rogers says
*  I live in London should I move to LA
*  well Chris it depends
*  you'll be surprised to learn
*  that it depends on many many things
*  so I love both places
*  London and Los Angeles are two of my favorite cities
*  they're quite different
*  the weather is different you may have heard about that
*  Los Angeles is expensive
*  London is crazily expensive
*  so in Los Angeles you get a much better house
*  for the same amount of money than you could in London
*  let's put it that way
*  politics is quirky in both places
*  I'm not going to draw a distinction there
*  you know there are
*  there are different
*  different types of
*  there are different
*  quality of life issues
*  or everyday life issues that are just different
*  the United States is
*  in many ways a culture of
*  convenience everyone has a car
*  supermarkets sell everything
*  Amazon sells you everything
*  but
*  it can be a little harsh
*  healthcare not easy
*  to pay for sometimes
*  there's a sort of
*  get it for yourself kind of attitude
*  in the United States that we have sometimes
*  rather than we're all in it together
*  I like
*  Los Angeles a lot
*  it is a
*  wonderful city lifestyle wise
*  the food is great
*  the weather like I said is great
*  but also there are cultural institutions that are quite good
*  but overall
*  food is also really good in London
*  and the culture in London is probably better
*  overall in terms of
*  universities
*  art
*  music and
*  theatre things like that London probably has it
*  over LA
*  the typical restaurant you will walk
*  into is way better in Los Angeles
*  than it is in London but the best restaurants
*  in London are probably better than the best restaurants
*  in Los Angeles
*  and Los Angeles you know
*  even though it's a wonderful big city
*  it's spread out
*  as a big city
*  you can't do in Los Angeles what is
*  very easy to do in London or Paris or New York or Tokyo
*  which is
*  go downtown and wander around
*  and something good will happen
*  you'll discover something good
*  in Los Angeles there's a million great things going on
*  but you have to know where they are
*  and you have to figure them out so you either have to
*  live here for a long time or you have to have
*  guidance on what to do
*  you're also in the middle of the entertainment
*  industry which has its benefits
*  it's a whole different
*  kind of creativity than you get
*  in other fields
*  it's a unique place
*  no place is the center of the entertainment industry
*  quite like Los Angeles is
*  so I think it's tied
*  things like weather and cost of living
*  seem very down to earth
*  concerns but they're important concerns
*  and LA wins on both of those
*  food depends on how much you want to spend on the food
*  tacos are much better in LA
*  but the beef wellington is much better in London
*  so I like both of them
*  you couldn't go wrong it depends on what you want to do for a living
*  which I don't know so good luck with that
*  Randy Roberts says
*  short version of my question
*  is the calculation of the entropy of a physical system
*  subjective or objective
*  and the answer is yes
*  that's the short version of the answer
*  because the word entropy has different definitions
*  there are different ideas
*  to which we attach the word entropy
*  there is a subjective definition
*  which is to say
*  that entropy is somehow
*  a measure of our ignorance
*  of the specific details of the system
*  so classically
*  you can know that
*  there is a system like the air in this room
*  that has a microscopic state
*  microscopic we don't mean small
*  we just mean all of the data
*  the position and location
*  the position and velocity of every single
*  atom and molecule in the gas
*  but we don't know it
*  so we have some probability distribution
*  over what those positions and velocities are
*  and you can use that probability distribution to calculate an entropy
*  that entropy is 100% subjective
*  it reflects your knowledge
*  of the system
*  but then there are other contexts
*  in which entropy is perfectly objective
*  if you have a quantum mechanical system
*  and you have two subsystems
*  and the system as a whole
*  is in what we call a pure quantum mechanical state
*  it has a wave function
*  but the two subsystems are
*  entangled with each other
*  then each one of those subsystems has an entropy
*  given to us by John von Neumann
*  he has a formula for it
*  and that's 100% objective
*  that entropy has nothing to do with your knowledge
*  of the system it's because of the quantum mechanical
*  state that the two entangled systems are in
*  and there are in between cases
*  like the Boltzmann entropy where you have
*  a coarse graining
*  of all the possible ways that a subsystem
*  that subsystems can arrange themselves
*  given the coarse graining
*  Boltzmann's definition of entropy
*  is completely objective
*  but your choice of coarse graining in the first place
*  is subjective
*  so it's a little bit of a mixture
*  so I think that a lot of confusion around the word entropy
*  just comes in because there's more than one definition of it
*  and they all overlap in appropriate regimes
*  but they are actually telling you
*  very different things
*  Anonymous says
*  this is a long question I edited down a little bit
*  but let me see if I can get to the essence of it
*  with overwhelming likelihood
*  new particle physics would not have
*  good practical effects for humanity
*  I can imagine many ways that new physics
*  could let humanity destroy itself
*  but it's hard for me to come up with
*  plausible fine tuning so that new physics
*  has a good effect on humanity
*  what do we do about this problem
*  so I think that the spirit of the question
*  is in the space of all new
*  possible ways that I could imagine
*  physics we haven't yet discovered it's easier
*  to imagine ways we could learn
*  to hurt ourselves or would hurt ourselves
*  inadvertently versus ways that we could
*  help ourselves like free energy
*  or something like that
*  so what can we do about that
*  well I think that
*  we should be honest I don't think you should hide
*  the truth in any case
*  but I actually think that it depends what you mean by new physics
*  so you said new particle physics in particular
*  I think that it is
*  very very unlikely that new particle
*  physics will have either
*  good or bad effects for humanity
*  other than learning more about the
*  universe
*  learning more about the universe is definitely
*  a factor that new particle physics will have
*  and it's good ok
*  whereas technological applications
*  could be good or bad but I don't think we're going to get
*  any technological applications out of new particle
*  physics in order to make new particle
*  physics you need a giant particle accelerator
*  these are not the things that you can shrink
*  down into the size of a phone or a
*  wrist watch or something like that or even a TV set
*  so I don't think you should look
*  to particle physics for
*  applications technologically
*  I think you should look to new particle
*  physics for knowledge and discovery
*  and that's an unalloyed good
*  in my mind
*  Vladimir Joff says
*  if Girdle's incompleteness theorem can be applied to
*  physics should scientists be able to figure out
*  which problems conceptually
*  do not have solutions
*  so I'm not sure
*  that what is meant
*  and it's not just you Vladimir
*  there's a common sort of
*  tendency of people to
*  say well physicists try to
*  understand everything but Girdle's incompleteness
*  theorem says you can't so does that mean
*  there's some physics problems that have no solutions
*  but I think this is a case
*  where you have to be a little bit more precise
*  about exactly what Girdle's
*  incompleteness theorem says
*  it says that if you have some formal
*  system right some axiomatic
*  mathematical system
*  I'm going to this is not rigorously
*  what it says but I can be this is casual enough to get
*  the right answer you cannot
*  the formal system cannot prove
*  its own consistency and the way that you demonstrate
*  that is by saying that there are statements
*  which are
*  which basically say
*  I cannot be proven
*  so you cannot prove that
*  sorry if you did prove it
*  then it would be inconsistent because you've proven something that says it's false
*  if you can't prove it then it's true
*  but you can't prove it so either
*  there are unprovable true statements or the system
*  is inconsistent
*  what in the world does that have to do with physics
*  I have no idea I'm not sure what it's supposed
*  to do with physics that's not how physics works
*  physics doesn't go around starting
*  with axioms and proving things
*  physics tries to construct
*  models that model
*  the world right and then the world works
*  according to that model we don't prove theorems
*  that's just not what we're about
*  so I'm not quite sure what the
*  exact limitation
*  on physics is supposed to be
*  coming from Girdle's theorem like
*  and you know maybe this is my limitation
*  maybe you have some more
*  precise thing in mind
*  but no one who is worried about Girdle's theorem
*  in physics has ever told me what that
*  precise worry is
*  I don't think that there's anything that Girdle's theorem
*  should do to slow down
*  physics in trying to understand the universe
*  as well as it can
*  J.M. Autobot
*  probably a pseudonym
*  says I'm most fascinated with
*  your ethics and morality discussions
*  although I eat plants and animals
*  I've been thinking more about not eating animals
*  you've mentioned in the past that one reason
*  you believe it is moral to eat animals is because
*  animals do not have the same experience
*  that humans do about missing the life
*  they would have experienced if they were not going to be eaten
*  that is true
*  but I struggle with the fact that I know that I shorten
*  the experience of an animal whether it knew about
*  its life being shortened or not
*  I sometimes feel bad about that do you have any thoughts
*  about rationally helping me think through this one
*  I mean
*  two things to say one is
*  if you I'm not going to tell
*  you you should eat animals
*  if you feel bad about it then don't do it
*  I'm a moral constructivist
*  I think that our ideas
*  of right or wrong are
*  ways that we systematize
*  our inner moral intuitions
*  and if your intuition is against
*  doing something then you can't
*  necessarily reason your way out of it
*  unless you have other intuitions that say
*  you should do it and you're just trying to make them
*  compatible with each other so there's nothing wrong
*  with saying I personally don't want to eat
*  animals that's a completely sensible
*  attitude to take
*  but to talk about the
*  specific reasoning that you advanced here
*  what you say is
*  you struggle with the fact that
*  I shortened the experience of an animal
*  whether it knew about its life being shortened
*  or not so the implication seems to be
*  that having more animals
*  having more experiences over
*  the course of their lives would be good
*  okay and there are absolutely
*  moral philosophies that say that is true
*  you can imagine a version of utilitarianism
*  under which that is true
*  where you literally take
*  somehow you imagine that you could take
*  the experience at each moment
*  in the course of an animal's existence
*  and it's either good or bad
*  hopefully it's good
*  and you add them up you do an integral over all the experiences
*  and you try to maximize that number right
*  and I think that's something
*  quite like what someone like Peter Singer
*  actually does
*  you imagine there's some number
*  called the total utility
*  of the world
*  which you get by adding up all the goodness
*  from every moment of time over every individual
*  and maximize that number
*  I personally don't think
*  that's a sensible moral system at all
*  right I mean
*  and there's various ways of arguing for that
*  you know there's this formal argument
*  called the repugnant conclusion
*  which argues that
*  if you believe that kind of utilitarianism
*  you should believe that it is always better to have more people
*  no matter how miserable those people are
*  you can always make the world better
*  just by increasing the number of miserable people
*  in the world
*  and that doesn't seem especially moral to me
*  I actually think that the whole project
*  is misguided
*  I don't think there's a number called utility
*  that you can get
*  by adding things up
*  of different experiences at different moments of time
*  in any particular moment
*  and I think that's a very good way
*  to compare experiences at different moments of time
*  in any way
*  I don't know a way to add up the experiences
*  that a cow has
*  and the experiences that I have
*  how do you compare them
*  that just seems impossible
*  not just difficult, not like a technical problem
*  but like literally not a sensible thing
*  to try to do
*  so I wouldn't worry about the fact that
*  there was a life
*  that you made shorter than otherwise
*  I mean human beings as a species
*  we can't really compare
*  the total diversity of life
*  on earth by a lot
*  in many bad ways
*  but how would it be different
*  if we really tried
*  to maximize the number of good experiences
*  that living beings had
*  whatever it would be
*  it would be very very very different
*  than what we are doing now
*  and I don't think that's a sensible thing to try to do
*  so I guess all I would say is
*  think through exactly
*  what it is that bothers you
*  about shortening
*  that experience of that animal
*  and you may, like I said at the beginning
*  you may come out saying yeah that was bad
*  I don't want to do that and that's completely ok
*  that's not the way that I personally feel about it
*  Brendan Hall said
*  when you arrived at Caltech you said
*  you were given Richard Feynman's old desk
*  do you still have this desk
*  do you feel bad when you spill coffee on it
*  and do you get to keep it after you're gone
*  I do have the desk
*  I feel bad when I spill coffee on it
*  I mean I feel bad because I don't like to spill coffee
*  but they sort of
*  every 10 years or so
*  they refurbish the desk
*  they polish it again
*  so it actually looks much younger than it is
*  and no I do not get to keep it after I'm gone
*  once I go from Caltech
*  it will be given to
*  usually the joke that I get a lot of mileage out of
*  it goes to the most senior theoretical physicist
*  who is not senior enough to get a brand new desk
*  so I don't know who that will be after me
*  but someone else will get it
*  ok I'm going to group together a bunch of questions
*  on Laplace's Demon
*  three questions on Laplace's Demon
*  Mike Meyer says
*  does Laplace's Demon know the exact trajectory of our lives from start to finish?
*  Steven Bernard says
*  it seems to me that if physics is deterministic
*  as it appears to be
*  then everything that exists must have been encoded in the initial state of the big bang
*  everything including all your books, contents, library, congresses, and so on
*  then everything that exists must have been encoded in the initial state of the big bang
*  everything including all your books, contents, library, congresses, and so on
*  this baffles me
*  where did all this content come from?
*  did it merely unfold deterministically in the fullness of time?
*  and Jesse Rimmler says
*  I recently listened to an episode of the BBC show
*  in our time
*  about Pierre-Simon Laplace
*  at one point one of the guests said
*  there have been numerous critiques of the idea of Laplace's Demon
*  and the deterministic model of the universe
*  one example is
*  if I roll a ball up on the hill
*  at just the right speed
*  so that it can be a little bit more accurate
*  and then I roll a ball at just the right speed
*  so that it comes to the top
*  and is still perfectly balanced
*  and then go into the future and try to see what happened in the past
*  I look back and this thing is still on top of the mountain
*  and then at some point it starts going down the mountain
*  there seems to be no way to predict that moment from the classical equations
*  there seems to be no way to predict that moment from the classical equations
*  do you know what he's getting at
*  and does it present a challenge to the concept of Laplace's Demon?
*  so Laplace's Demon
*  to remind those of you who haven't heard of it
*  is the idea that in classical Newtonian mechanics
*  is the idea that in classical Newtonian mechanics
*  it's deterministic or at least seemingly deterministic
*  modulo footnote we'll get to in a second
*  so in the sense that
*  you give me the position and velocity
*  of every particle in the universe
*  and Newton's laws of physics tell you what's going to happen next
*  so Laplace said
*  imagine a vast intelligence
*  that knows the position and velocity
*  of every particle in the universe
*  and knows all the laws of physics
*  and has infinite calculational capacity
*  so to that vast intelligence
*  the past, present and future
*  are equally clear
*  it can figure out what will happen
*  from the present state to the future
*  so for Mike Myers' question
*  does Laplace's Demon know the exact trajectory
*  of our lives from start to finish?
*  yes, except that Laplace's Demon doesn't exist
*  it's crucially important by the way
*  Laplace's Demon doesn't exist
*  it's a thought experiment
*  and people get in trouble
*  taking it a little bit too literally
*  it really doesn't exist
*  to actually model the universe
*  effectively you would need a Laplace's Demon
*  that was basically as big as the universe
*  or at least as complicated as the universe
*  it's not something you can
*  it's very very misleading to think of it as like
*  a dude over there who knows a lot of stuff
*  it's just not like that at all
*  to Jesse Rimmler's question
*  yeah
*  there are actual subtle
*  things about
*  Newton's laws of physics as Newton
*  wrote them down
*  that make it not as deterministic as you would think
*  so the specific example you're talking about
*  is called Norton's Dome
*  after John Norton who is still around
*  by the way John Norton is a very active philosopher of science
*  at the University of Pittsburgh
*  and his example is
*  not that long ago, Norton's Dome
*  and I talk about it in fact in the biggest
*  ideas in the universe videos that I mentioned before
*  if you want to read more about it
*  you can look it up there
*  and the idea is that yeah if you very very
*  carefully choose
*  your physical system
*  even Newton's laws are not deterministic
*  but
*  the footnote there is that
*  very very careful is an exaggeration
*  it is a set of measure zero
*  of situations you can find yourself in
*  where there's ambiguity
*  in what Newton's laws say
*  so in the space of all initial conditions
*  for the universe
*  the fraction of possible initial conditions
*  that would run into this kind of problem
*  that you mention is zero
*  for almost all initial conditions
*  in the mathematically precise sense of almost all
*  everything is perfectly deterministic
*  so as a practical matter
*  that's not a worry also Laplace's demon doesn't exist
*  so it's not a worry in that sense
*  either, okay
*  and then to Steven's question so
*  by the way you say it seems to me that if physics
*  is deterministic as it appears to be
*  I wouldn't be that quick about whether
*  physics is deterministic or not after all
*  there is quantum mechanics
*  some versions of quantum mechanics are
*  deterministic in the old fashioned way
*  like the pilot wave theories
*  the hidden variable theories
*  we talked about
*  some versions of quantum mechanics are just
*  not deterministic like the objective collapse models
*  that I mentioned some versions of quantum mechanics
*  like many worlds are
*  kind of deterministic but kind of not
*  the wave function of the universe evolves
*  deterministically but the individual
*  branches do not, okay
*  and I bring this up because it's relevant to your
*  question I mean you have a good question
*  that we live in an extremely complicated
*  universe right now extremely specific
*  all the information in all the
*  books ever written or on all the hard drives or
*  whatever was all that implicit
*  in the early universe well it depends
*  on your theory of
*  quantum mechanics
*  we don't know whether things are
*  deterministic so if it's not deterministic
*  if wave functions truly collapse
*  stochastically then no
*  then this information in
*  the hard drives
*  in the books was not there it sort of
*  came into existence via these
*  stochastic jumps
*  if there were hidden variables
*  then yes then all of the information
*  that determined what is in all the
*  books everywhere was there in
*  the early universe but you know
*  you shouldn't let that bother you
*  like where does this feeling come
*  from that there's not enough
*  room for all that information to be there
*  there could be plenty of room
*  right maybe an infinite matter room
*  so I wouldn't actually be bothered about
*  that and then in many worlds
*  it's the most interesting
*  case in some sense because
*  the early universe could actually
*  have had very low information
*  content and
*  evolved deterministically
*  but because the branches of the wave function
*  differentiate themselves over time
*  individual branches
*  could look like they have a high information
*  content and so that's kind of interesting
*  and cool but
*  in that sense the specific
*  information about what is in the
*  books on your branch of the wave function
*  was not there
*  because in the early universe there was no such thing
*  as your branch of the wave function in the early universe
*  there was just one big branch
*  I hope that makes sense everything I said is true
*  I'm not sure if it's actually very helpful
*  okay and then to move on
*  from Laplace's Demon there's a related
*  set of questions about free will
*  and man people love
*  talking about free will I don't love
*  talking about free will I've said this before I think it's the most boring
*  thing that we could be talking about but
*  so what I did was we got a whole bunch of questions about
*  free will I'm going to group them together
*  I'm going to give a spiel about free will
*  and then maybe I will get fewer
*  questions about free will in the future
*  we'll see but let me try let's try to read these through and give them sensible answers
*  so Mark Bloor says
*  in a block universe
*  if one can take a gods eye view one will see
*  that every conscious being is unable
*  to predict their future
*  and that many of them therefore conclude that
*  they have free will but none of them does
*  in the sense that their future was set in stone
*  when the universe was created so does a
*  compatibleist have any choice in taking their stance
*  Donald Trembley says
*  the podcast with Robert Sapolsky was
*  fascinating inside the framework of
*  physicalism where we all agree on
*  determinism at the atomic level
*  which we don't by the way
*  it seems to me that
*  Dennett and Sapolsky are at opposite ends of a continuum
*  of how much free will we have at the macro level
*  I rewatched a discussion you had with Sam Harris
*  three years ago on this topic at which time
*  I'd say you were near the Dennett end
*  has the needle moved for you over the past couple of years
*  Chris Mortlock says
*  I will answer all these questions I want to get them on the table first
*  Chris Mortlock says
*  I'm interested in your opinion on individuals who commit evil acts
*  and their free will or human accountability
*  in engaging in such abhorrent activities
*  my first thought is to have hatred for these people
*  being the worst of the worst
*  but I also find myself stuck with an inner moral dilemma
*  when I start to contemplate that these
*  individuals are the worst
*  I also find myself stuck with an inner moral dilemma
*  when I start to contemplate that these
*  individuals are only undertaking such acts
*  due to some kind of physical or chemical interactions
*  in their brain or basic particle interactions outside of their control
*  Michael Lacey says
*  at the end of your podcast on rationality with Julia Gallif
*  she talks about self-deception
*  as being a bad alternative for making oneself feel better
*  as someone who doesn't believe in libertarian free will
*  do you think it's ok to alleviate regret
*  with the thought that our actions are ultimately
*  the result of physical laws
*  or as a result of the fact that
*  the
*  physical laws or as a compatible list do you think it is as much of a cop out as self-deception
*  Daniela Cortese says
*  you said that you don't worry
*  whether libertarian free will could be described
*  mathematically because you don't believe in it
*  but isn't it important to understand regardless
*  if there are phenomena that can't be expressed
*  mathematically even in principle
*  isn't this a problem for a complete and sound
*  understanding of the foundations of the universe
*  and finally
*  flying waffle probably also a pseudonym
*  says isn't it paradoxical that atoms don't experience choice
*  ie they just blindly follow the fundamental laws of particle physics
*  yet at the macro level of living organisms
*  brains have evolved in order to capture and model their environment
*  in terms of probability distributions
*  as a way to guide apparent choices
*  ok that's a lot of questions
*  so let me just lay out how I think about this very quickly
*  so there are these three different stances
*  in free will thought roughly speaking
*  so let me just lay out how I think about this very quickly
*  so there are these three different stances
*  in free will thought roughly speaking
*  so there are these three different stances
*  in free will thought roughly speaking
*  one is libertarian free will
*  which is the idea that there is something special
*  about human beings we have a special spirit
*  and ability to sort of overcome
*  the laws of physics
*  we are a law unto ourselves
*  we are a law unto ourselves
*  I don't believe that
*  scientists generally don't believe that
*  let's put libertarian free will aside for the moment
*  the other two options are
*  either you're a compatibilist about free will
*  or you're an incompatibilist
*  sometimes incompatibilists
*  describe themselves as hard determinists
*  but that's just a mistake
*  that's just wrong
*  because whether you're a compatibilist
*  or incompatibilist has nothing at all
*  to do with whether the laws of physics
*  are deterministic
*  I cannot possibly emphasize this enough
*  what matters is that there are laws
*  whether those laws are deterministic
*  or not makes zero difference
*  to whether you're a compatibilist
*  or an incompatibilist you both believe
*  there are laws
*  whether you believe the fundamental laws are
*  a pilot wave theory of quantum mechanics
*  or a spontaneous collapse theory
*  of quantum mechanics one of which is
*  deterministic and one of which is not
*  who cares? that doesn't affect whether you're
*  a compatibilist or not so don't
*  label yourself a hard determinist that is not
*  the point you would still be anti-free will
*  if you're incompatibilist
*  even if the GRW theory
*  of quantum mechanics or Penrose's theory turns out
*  to be correct even if determinism is not there
*  it's the fact that there are laws that matter
*  okay the compatibilist
*  what are you compatible about?
*  you're saying that the
*  belief in free will that describing
*  human beings as agents that
*  make decisions that make choices
*  is compatible with human
*  beings being made of
*  either neurons or elementary particles or
*  whatever you want that obey the laws of
*  physics a compatibilist
*  says you can describe the world
*  in different ways that are compatible
*  with each other even though they use very different
*  vocabularies
*  one way of describing the world is sort of the
*  microscopic level where you're made of a bunch of
*  particles they're obeying the laws of physics
*  whatever those laws are deterministic
*  or indeterministic and there's no
*  free will there you know free will is not
*  enter the Lagrangian for the standard model
*  of particle physics okay no one thinks it does
*  and then there's another
*  level there's a biological level and then
*  there's finally a human level where you have
*  people okay and the compatibilist
*  says people make choices
*  this doesn't seem like a very controversial
*  things to say but apparently
*  it is so here's one way of thinking about it
*  Alice and Bob
*  are in a car Alice is
*  driving Bob is navigating with
*  his Google maps
*  and they're looking for a restaurant
*  and Bob says oh turn left up here
*  at this intersection the restaurant will
*  be right there once we turn left
*  Alice turns left
*  and there's no restaurant there
*  and Alice says what's going on
*  you told me to turn left I turned left
*  because you told me to turn left
*  and Bob says yeah
*  no I knew the restaurant wasn't there but the laws of physics
*  said that that would be what I would
*  say and that's what you would do so I'm not
*  really to blame for anything that happened
*  nobody in their right mind
*  talks that way right everyone
*  in the world who is not crazy
*  says Alice
*  made a choice to turn left
*  why because Bob told her
*  to turn left and she trusted that Bob was going to
*  give her the correct information right
*  Bob made a choice
*  to tell Alice something why
*  well I don't know there's something perverse in Bob's mind
*  that made him you know play a little game
*  or something like that literally
*  nobody
*  refuses to talk that way in the real
*  world now there are people who pretend
*  to not talk that way they will say
*  oh no Alice and Bob didn't make any choices
*  but when it comes right down to it
*  these people are constantly trying to convince you
*  to choose to not believe in free will
*  so you can't
*  act that way you can't
*  live in the world because it's not
*  a good description of the world at the
*  human level to act as if human
*  beings don't make choices
*  the reason why compatibilists think that
*  it's sensible to talk about human beings as agents
*  that make choices is because
*  that's the best theory
*  we have of
*  people and it literally
*  is everyone's theory there's no one who doesn't have
*  that theory because it works it's true
*  and you know I did the podcast with Sam
*  Harris a long time ago
*  so to be this is a little frustration
*  that comes out from me and I will
*  vent my frustration here and
*  it's not just Sam Harris it's many other people
*  I don't think I have ever met
*  an incompatibilist
*  who could correctly
*  describe to me what compatibilists think
*  there's
*  only straw compatibilists
*  live in the mind of incompatibilists
*  and the
*  incompatibilists seem to think
*  that if they you know really
*  if you really believe in the laws of physics they
*  can construct a logical cage to get
*  you to admit that we're made
*  of particles that obey the laws of physics but I
*  admit that and this
*  the discussion with Sam was incredibly frustrating
*  because that's what he was trying to do you know
*  he was trying to say like okay like if I knew
*  all of the laws and all of the particles
*  and I was Laplace's demon and you
*  know he's pushing against an open door I
*  admit all that if you describe
*  the universe as
*  microscopically in the
*  laws of physics then it obeys the laws
*  of physics and there's no free will there that's
*  just not the point
*  in the point of view of a compatibilist
*  and so and
*  this is why it's very important to realize that
*  Laplace's demon doesn't exist and none of us
*  is anywhere close to Laplace's demon
*  now there are interesting
*  questions to talk about
*  that are not that question the interesting
*  questions are and this gets into
*  some of the questions here
*  what about the edge cases
*  where it becomes less and less useful
*  to describe people as
*  agents making choices based on good
*  reasons right like what if you are
*  a drug addict or you have some brain damage
*  or something like that and you're
*  just you're under a compulsion that forces you
*  to do something and then
*  I would say indeed it becomes less
*  and less useful to describe that person
*  as an agent making rational choices
*  and we do we don't
*  we don't describe those people as
*  as robustly as agents making rational
*  choices so that discussion
*  the practical level discussion about
*  how to treat people
*  who suffer
*  in different ways from an inability
*  to be a completely rational agent
*  which we all do none of us are completely rational
*  like there are degrees of it so you know
*  how do you deal with that in the real world that's an
*  interesting discussion to have but
*  this whether or not to label it free will
*  discussion is to me the most boring thing
*  in the world because there aren't people
*  who don't talk about other people as
*  choice makers in my mind
*  and if you are someone who believes
*  in the laws of physics deep down
*  but you
*  say but I will of course in
*  my everyday life I will talk about people making
*  choices then there's a word for what you
*  are it's called compatibleism
*  that's what you are all right
*  so let me get with that in mind let me
*  address some of the specific questions
*  Mark Bloor says
*  does a compatible list have any choice
*  in being a compatible list given that it's baked in
*  the laws of physics well
*  if you're describing the
*  world at the microscopic
*  level with including the
*  position of velocity of every particle
*  or the entire wave function of the universe
*  then no
*  the choice the idea of a choice doesn't
*  enter into that picture of the universe
*  but as previously
*  mentioned nobody does
*  that nor will anybody ever
*  do that what we actually
*  do is describe people
*  incompletely with
*  incomplete information with incomplete knowledge
*  of the laws that make them do their thing
*  as agents making choices
*  and at that level of description
*  yes compatible lists do have choices
*  in taking their stances
*  to Donald Tremblay's questions
*  have I moved the needle
*  move for me over the past couple years
*  no I've you know I'm willing to move
*  my needle like free will again it's not
*  my favorite topic I don't care about
*  it people keep talking to me
*  about it and so I'm not that
*  wedded to my position but certainly
*  I've not heard anything to make me change
*  my position in the last couple years
*  Chris Mortlock wanted to know
*  how should you feel about
*  people who commit evil acts
*  and their free will and human accountability
*  in engaging in abhorrent activities
*  well here's where it becomes
*  delicate it depends on the person right
*  if you have good reason to
*  believe there's a sense in which
*  the person didn't have a
*  choice if they were you know addicted
*  or controlled or did were mentally
*  incapable of doing something else
*  then the feeling I would
*  feel for them is more feeling sorry for them
*  if you think that the best description
*  we have of this person is as someone who
*  could have done otherwise given what
*  we know about them not given
*  all the laws of physics in the microscopic state of the
*  universe because you don't have that given
*  what we know about them could they have done otherwise
*  rationally then you can be
*  angry at them I think that's perfectly legitimate
*  I'm angry at people all the time I'm angry at
*  myself all the time Michael Lacey
*  said
*  do I think it's okay to alleviate
*  regret with the thought that our actions
*  are ultimately the result of physical laws
*  no I think that is a cop out
*  that's just like self-deception
*  because the fact that
*  again it just doesn't matter that the
*  actions are ultimately the result of physical laws
*  I don't know my microstate
*  that's no help psychologically
*  Daniella Cortese said
*  if there are phenomena
*  about can libertarian
*  free will be described mathematically
*  so I'm not exactly sure what I said
*  so you began the question saying
*  you said that you don't worry whether libertarian
*  free will could be described mathematically because I don't believe in it
*  there's a sense in which anything
*  can be described mathematically
*  even if a sequence of numbers is completely random
*  the statement that it's completely random
*  is a mathematical statement
*  right
*  so I do think that
*  there would be a way to describe
*  even libertarian free will mathematically
*  I think what I would mean
*  I don't know what I was saying
*  when you were listening to me
*  so maybe I just said it badly or sloppily
*  but I think that the point is that
*  libertarians don't think that there are laws
*  that are completely random
*  there are laws
*  that give you in some useful way
*  for knowledge
*  of how people are going to behave
*  even at the level of microphysics
*  the incompatibilist says
*  there are laws, laws of physics
*  they tell you how people are going to behave
*  the compatibilist says the laws of physics
*  tell you how people are going to behave if you have
*  the microstate of the whole universe
*  at your disposal but you don't
*  at the human level
*  there are at best
*  vague tendencies
*  you can predict probabilistically what people are going to do
*  but it's not that sort of microscopic precision
*  that you have
*  whereas a libertarian would say nope, there's just nothing you can say
*  except maybe wait for it to happen
*  and then categorize everything mathematically
*  as a probability distribution
*  or as a frequency for different things happening
*  so yeah, I think
*  I don't know whether libertarian free will even make sense
*  that's the more honest thing
*  that I could say
*  but if it did make sense then after the fact
*  you could certainly summarize what people actually did
*  that's something that's always possible
*  finally for flyingwaffles
*  question
*  isn't it interesting that brains have evolved in order to capture
*  and model their environment in terms of probability
*  distributions even though atoms don't
*  you know, I don't think
*  it's paradoxical at all
*  atoms don't have a lot of internal
*  memory, right?
*  atoms cannot process information
*  in any interesting way
*  atoms just don't have a lot of registers
*  once you have a tremendous number
*  individual atoms, by which I mean
*  brains are collections of many many many
*  atoms and then you have different
*  arrangements you can put those atoms in
*  that correspond to different images
*  of the outside world
*  so because those images are
*  incomplete, because they have incomplete information
*  it makes perfect sense to me
*  that we model our environment as
*  probability distributions
*  that we don't know, when we will never know
*  everything there is to know about the microstate
*  of the universe
*  okay, that's enough for free will
*  for the moment anyway, we'll see what happens next time
*  moving on, Gregory Kuznick
*  says
*  Dean Bonamano argued that in the absence of
*  direct empirical evidence for closed time-like
*  curves, we should trust our presentist
*  intuitions. This seems to
*  parallel the argument against many worlds
*  even if we never observe any CTCs
*  shouldn't the fact that their existence
*  predicted by known solutions to Einstein's
*  well-tested equation, give us
*  high credence in eternalism
*  so I don't actually think, I mean
*  I am an eternalist myself, but I don't think that this
*  parallel actually works
*  that you're suggesting, Greg, because the point
*  is that in many worlds
*  the prediction of the
*  Schrödinger equation is that
*  our world will actually branch
*  that there will be branching in the
*  future just because tiny quantum
*  systems become entangled with their environments
*  whereas someone like Dean would say
*  look, when you have space-time
*  Einstein's equation
*  seems to govern
*  our space-time pretty well, seems to apply
*  to our space-time, it also has
*  other solutions, but classically at least
*  there is only one universe
*  the fact that there's an equation that has
*  other solutions that are not
*  like our universe doesn't matter
*  if it's not our universe
*  so these other solutions with
*  closed time-like curves
*  whether it's from Tipler's
*  cylinder or
*  Girdle's universe or the wormholes
*  or Gott's cosmic strings, as long as
*  they're not our universe
*  that doesn't actually give us any argument
*  against presentism
*  would be the argument
*  Pete Koutoulis says
*  this is a long question but I think
*  it's worth it, I don't know how to shorten it, it's a cute story
*  I recently read a story about a
*  man named Joseph Furtinbach
*  who in 1627
*  supposedly performed an experiment designed to show
*  that the earth rotates about its axis
*  Furtinbach fired a cannon
*  straight up into the air and stood
*  calmly by the muzzle as the cannonball
*  went up into the air
*  he expected the motion of the rotating earth
*  to cause the ball to hit the ground some
*  distance to the west of his position
*  as he told onlookers if he was
*  incorrect, the ball would instead come down
*  on his head killing him
*  the story goes that the cannonball did in fact hit the ground
*  and form a small crater to the west
*  of the cannon, not killing him presumably
*  an amusing story but did it prove
*  the motion of the earth
*  or was Furtinbach just lucky?
*  unless my understanding of physics is
*  way off, wouldn't a cannonball fired in a perfectly
*  perpendicular direction to the surface of the earth
*  be expected to land in the same
*  spot from which it is fired, barring
*  other forces such as wind
*  so Pete, I've never heard this story before
*  so I don't know the details of whether or not
*  Furtinbach was just lucky but I think you're right
*  in the physics analysis here
*  you know there's an old saying, there are many
*  wrong ways to get the right answer
*  and even though the earth is rotating
*  this particular analysis by
*  Furtinbach does not seem to be correct
*  like you say, if
*  the cannon and the cannonball and everything else
*  is moving along with the surface of
*  the earth, then what you would
*  expect is when you fire the cannonball up
*  it will come straight down, in fact
*  this is that the kind of reasoning
*  that led Galileo to
*  invent Galilean relativity
*  around the same time in the early
*  1600s, in fact
*  Galileo, what he talks about
*  I forget whether he actually did this or not
*  but he talks about an analogous experiment
*  on a ship, so you go
*  on a ship and then you climb all the way up to the mast
*  and you can drop a
*  cannonball, or something lighter
*  probably you don't want to drop a cannonball onto the ship
*  but anyway, you drop a ball straight down
*  and Galileo's point was, again
*  I don't know whether he did it or not, but
*  if the ship is stationary
*  then you should expect the
*  ball to fall straight down, if the
*  ship is moving at a constant
*  velocity, you will also
*  expect the ball to fall straight down
*  because the ship and the ball are moving with
*  each other, and there is no
*  absolute frame of reference with
*  respect to judge your velocity
*  it's only relative, that's the invention of
*  relativity in some very
*  real sense, and Galileo
*  is right, and in fact Galileo
*  used this as an argument that it's
*  okay to think that the earth is rotating
*  you wouldn't notice if the earth
*  is rotating, because all the physical experiments
*  you do here on earth would have the same
*  answers as if it weren't rotating
*  because of relativity, for exactly that reason
*  so I don't know what Furtinbach's story was
*  but again, you can reason
*  your way into the right answer for wrong reasons
*  in fact, Galileo did this, Galileo
*  had a whole explanation for the
*  tides that
*  was completely wrong, but he used that
*  as evidence that the earth was rotating
*  so, there you go, lots of people had wrong
*  reasons to get the
*  correct answer in that case
*  Johnny says, in your
*  conversation with Julia Gallif, you point out that
*  most people don't revisit or question
*  their beliefs often enough
*  if you turn a critical eye upon yourself
*  are you also guilty of this?
*  Sure, probably
*  I have a whole bunch of beliefs
*  and I like my beliefs, and
*  they fit in together into a system
*  that reinforces itself, and of course
*  one should always be critical of one's
*  beliefs, but it's hard to do so
*  it's, on the other hand, easy
*  to say that I or anyone
*  else should be critical of our
*  own beliefs, but very hard
*  to say which ones we should be critical
*  of, you know, this is a common but very
*  bad argument
*  when you say something that is true
*  and your opponent says, well
*  do you think you're always right?
*  Do you think you should be doubtful of your results sometimes?
*  and you say, yeah, no, I'm not always right
*  I should be doubtful of my results sometimes
*  and they say, well, okay, you should be doubtful of it this time
*  that doesn't follow, logically
*  like maybe this particular time you're pretty
*  darn confident, so it's easy
*  to say you should be critical of your
*  own beliefs, it's harder to know which of your
*  beliefs are the ones that might turn out to be
*  wrong, we should all try though, right?
*  this is an aspirational kind of thing, we should try to be
*  good Bayesians, give
*  credences to the things that we think are
*  unlikely but still possible
*  Jeff B. says
*  I once had a thought about the universe and I'm wondering
*  whether it holds any truth
*  the idea is that all possible states
*  of the universe coexist
*  and it is merely the records of other states
*  that give the illusion of time
*  so this is almost
*  the right point of view for an eternalist
*  to believe, in fact the reason why I like this
*  question is because
*  it is giving voice to the point of view that
*  St. Augustine had back in, I don't
*  know, the third century or whatever
*  the fourth century maybe
*  when Augustine in his confessions
*  has a famous discussion of the nature of
*  time and one of his quotes
*  he's a very quotable guy is
*  the past is present memory
*  the idea being that in his
*  ontology, the past
*  exists in the present moment
*  in the form of our records
*  of what the past actually held
*  now he didn't know about classical mechanics or Laplace's
*  demon, these days we can
*  be a little bit more quantitative and rigorous
*  about it, the entire
*  information is conserved from moment
*  to moment to the extent that the laws of physics
*  are deterministic, so in
*  some sense the past is contained
*  in the present moment
*  the one part of your proposal that I would
*  change is you say
*  all possible states of the universe
*  coexist
*  and this is a very typical issue
*  that comes up when you try to be a good eternalist
*  the eternalist is someone who believes that
*  every moment of time is equally
*  real, because at any one
*  moment, you and I and everyone
*  else are embedded in that moment
*  we have a way of talking about
*  the world that is loaded
*  temporally speaking, right?
*  with respect to time, so
*  what you should say as a good
*  eternalist is all
*  moments of time are equally real
*  what is very tempting to say
*  but is wrong is all
*  moments of time are equally real
*  now, or
*  coexisting or simultaneously
*  real, or real at the same
*  time, you're giving
*  different moments of time a little bit of
*  existence at the same time, which is
*  a contradiction, that's not what is going
*  on, so I sort of halfway agree
*  with your proposal there, Jeff
*  Farron Christu says, I just listened
*  to your solo mindscape episode on
*  entropic gravity from September 2019
*  and would like to know what your
*  thoughts are now about holography
*  in general and on implications
*  for locality if information is randomly
*  encoded on the holographic boundary as I've
*  heard Susskind postulate
*  well, you know, so by the way, if you're
*  not gone through the whole
*  back catalogue, there is an episode with
*  Susskind that you can listen to and hear his
*  own points of view of this
*  my perspective
*  hasn't changed a lot
*  I have the following vague
*  idea, and this is, so here's
*  something where I have an idea and it could be completely
*  wrong, so my belief would change rapidly if
*  we learned more
*  we had this idea of holography
*  Susskind and Atouf and others
*  John Preskill and others sort of
*  worked toward this idea
*  in the 1990s trying to understand
*  black holes and the idea that
*  black holes have an entropy can be used to
*  argue that the information
*  in a black hole can be thought
*  of as living on
*  the horizon of the black hole
*  or near the horizon of the black hole rather than
*  living inside the volume
*  of the black hole. That was later
*  sharpened to black hole complementarity
*  which says that it depends on
*  what observer you're talking about. To an observer
*  that falls inside, the information
*  is scattered through the volume, to an
*  observer outside, the information
*  looks like it's located on the boundary
*  and also it became much sharper
*  in the context of the ADS-CFT
*  correspondence from Juan Maldacena
*  Maldacena points out
*  that there is this specific example of an
*  anti-de Sitter cosmology where
*  there is a boundary and the boundary
*  looks like a space time of one
*  less dimension and in fact
*  in certain special cases there's
*  a theory of physics on the boundary that
*  is the same as
*  equivalent to a theory of quantum gravity
*  in the bulk. That's the ADS-CFT
*  correspondence. So that's
*  holography because the boundary theory which is
*  supposed to be equivalent to the bulk theory lives
*  in one lower dimension.
*  So my
*  feeling, I said I had a feeling here, an
*  idea that might or may not be right, my feeling
*  is that ADS-CFT
*  has misled us a little bit
*  because ADS-CFT is
*  a wonderful example
*  of duality, of holography,
*  of a working model of quantum
*  gravity, etc. It's also
*  not the real world. We don't live in anti-
*  de Sitter space. And so
*  it's also hard and it's
*  unclear whether or not it's hard because
*  it's intrinsically
*  hard or we human beings aren't very good at it, but
*  it's hard in ADS-CFT
*  to use
*  the purported duality between
*  the boundary and the bulk
*  to really talk about
*  physics that goes on on very small
*  scales inside the bulk.
*  It's easy to talk about big cosmological
*  questions. It's hard to talk about small
*  scale questions even though many
*  people think it's in principle possible.
*  So
*  I think that the misleadingness
*  is not that ADS-CFT is
*  wrong in any way,
*  but that the way that
*  holography might work
*  in the real world will
*  be sufficiently different,
*  I'm guessing, than ADS-CFT
*  that focusing on
*  ADS-CFT is not helping
*  us as much as we would like it to.
*  It's helping us some. It's worth doing. I think it's great
*  all in favor of it. But I
*  think other kinds of thought processes
*  are going to be needed to really
*  get holography to work in the real world
*  in local conditions,
*  in black holes or whatever.
*  So I don't think our universe
*  has something quite as simple and
*  direct and tangible as a holographic boundary
*  that we would have if we
*  lived in ADS. I think it's going to be more subtle
*  than that. I don't know what it's going to be, so it's
*  easy for me to say, but we'll have to wait and see.
*  Murray Dunn says,
*  Do we know with any certainty
*  that the net charge or angular momentum of
*  the universe is zero? Well, no.
*  We know very few things with
*  any certainty about the universe.
*  We should always be humble about those things.
*  The statement we can make is, given the
*  laws of physics as we understand them,
*  in a closed universe,
*  in a universe where space is a
*  closed manifold, either a sphere or a
*  torus or whatever, then the net
*  charge and angular momentum
*  and even the net energy will be zero.
*  That's just a topological
*  fact, okay?
*  The field lines can't go anywhere,
*  right? Like if you have an electric charge,
*  its electrical field lines stretch out to infinity.
*  But if you live on a torus or a
*  sphere, infinity
*  comes back on itself, and those field lines have to
*  come back and go somewhere, and they can't
*  unless the net charge is zero. If you think about
*  a positive charge at the north pole
*  of a sphere, if you don't want to have charges
*  anywhere else, you're going to need to have a negative
*  charge at the south pole of a sphere to make
*  everything work out consistently.
*  So, but what we don't
*  know is whether or not the universe is closed.
*  Maybe the universe is open. If the universe is open,
*  then we can certainly have a net charge or net angular momentum.
*  No problem.
*  Thomas Prunty says, in this week's
*  solo podcast, you did a lot of talking about
*  particles, environment diagrams, clouds
*  of virtual particles, etc. Essentially
*  nothing about fields. In the past,
*  you've emphasized fields as being more fundamental.
*  What gives?
*  You know, I actually, when I was planning out that solo
*  podcast, I thought about
*  talking in terms of fields, but then
*  I had the thought that
*  number one, it would be a lot more talk,
*  and number two, it would be distracting from what I was trying to
*  talk about. I would basically
*  be saying the same things,
*  but with an extra 20 minute digression
*  on why it's really fields, okay?
*  But that's not the point. The point was to talk about
*  the particular
*  experimental results
*  that we were trying to explain here.
*  So, what I try to say is
*  fields are more fundamental.
*  You're right, in quantum field theory.
*  But there's a good reason why
*  we call it particle physics. In the
*  regime where you have tiny
*  vibrations in those fields, when you observe
*  them, they look like particles.
*  And when you calculate processes
*  using Feynman diagrams, you're using
*  a very particle-based language.
*  And that's fine.
*  Fields are more fundamental,
*  but when the particle language
*  is appropriate, it's appropriate.
*  And there's no more time
*  when particle language is appropriate than when you're
*  doing particle physics and doing scattering
*  experiments and calculating Feynman diagrams.
*  So, you could translate everything
*  that I said there into talk
*  about fields, and what I
*  decided was that for the purposes of that
*  discussion, it wasn't adding
*  anything to the discussion to sort of
*  restate exactly the same thing
*  in the field language. There's a reason why
*  particle physicists use Feynman
*  diagrams all the time. They're really convenient
*  for that kind of analysis.
*  Anonymous says, do you have
*  any advice for dealing
*  with a spouse or other faculty, family member
*  I almost said faculty member.
*  Hopefully you have
*  people in your family who are not faculty members.
*  But do you have any advice for dealing with a
*  spouse or other family member that you love
*  dearly, but who believes wholeheartedly
*  in things like astrology, ESP,
*  New Age
*  spiritualism cloaked in science, things like that?
*  Short answer is no. It depends
*  on the family member. Different people are going to be
*  different. You know, there are a couple
*  of things I do think are true and are worth
*  keeping in mind in this kind of situation.
*  One is some people are not
*  going to be reasoned out of their beliefs.
*  And don't try.
*  If you think that there's going to be someone who
*  just isn't open
*  to thinking about whatever their set of beliefs
*  are, then you know,
*  you're not under any obligation
*  to bang your head against the wall
*  and try to convince them if you know it's not going to work
*  ahead of time. There are other people
*  who will have such beliefs, but are
*  open minded about them. You know,
*  they think that they have reasoned themselves
*  into those beliefs in a rational way
*  and are open to changing their minds
*  and want to engage
*  in discussion about it, then do that.
*  So my point is it depends on
*  that individual.
*  It also depends on you.
*  How important is this to you
*  that someone has the same set of
*  beliefs about these things as you do?
*  And I have no judgment one way or the other.
*  Like, I totally get it. If
*  you care about someone and love them
*  and they're a member of your family
*  and they have incompatible beliefs
*  with you and you say, you know what,
*  that's okay. They have different beliefs. I'm just going to roll with
*  that. We love them for other reasons. That's okay.
*  It's also okay to say
*  these particular beliefs are
*  so important to me
*  that I can't let it go, right? And you have
*  to pick and choose where your values
*  lie there.
*  The final thing is there are people
*  who might be
*  persuadable or at least interested in talking
*  about it, but don't want to be beaten over
*  the head. Don't want to be
*  felt to be irrational or stupid.
*  Right? Very often
*  if your actual interest
*  is not in winning some debate,
*  but in changing someone's mind
*  or opening them up to new possibilities,
*  the strategy is not
*  to bring out your biggest debating guns.
*  Right? The strategy
*  is not to be as rational and evidence-based
*  as you can. The strategy is
*  to, by example,
*  show them that they can
*  get rid of those beliefs and still
*  lead a happy, fulfilling life.
*  Right? Very often, and this goes back
*  to like week one of the Mindscape
*  podcast where I interviewed Anthony
*  Pym, who is an atheist
*  theologian who's also
*  black and he's interested in why
*  black people are not more atheist.
*  And he made the point that
*  atheism doesn't make a
*  good case empirically
*  in the real world. It's not a necessary
*  condition, but actual atheists
*  here and now often
*  just don't make a good case
*  for why black people would be
*  equally as fulfilled socially
*  and culturally outside
*  the church as they are inside of it.
*  Right? So a lot of times
*  these people reason themselves into these
*  beliefs or reasons that are other than perfectly
*  rational, and it's okay to reason them out
*  of them for reasons that are other than perfectly
*  rational. Or maybe they're rational
*  like from a different angle. Right?
*  Like what makes me happier? That's a perfectly rational
*  thing to have. So think about
*  it holistically. Think about why they believe
*  it. Think about whether they are
*  so devoted to it that they might change their mind
*  or even if they are open to talking about it at all.
*  There's no cut and dried answer ahead
*  of time.
*  George Atanasoff
*  says, in your book, Something Deeply
*  Hidden, you mentioned that the wave function of a
*  particle spreads out in space in a roughly
*  spherical fashion. What would be the reason
*  for roughly, why not perfectly spherical?
*  Well, it depends on the details
*  of the initial condition for the particle.
*  So typically what I'm talking about there
*  is, you know, the decay
*  of a nucleus that emits a particle.
*  You know, a beta decay you emit an electron,
*  alpha decay you emit a hydrogen atom,
*  sorry, a helium nucleus,
*  and these are things that have
*  wave functions and they will
*  spread out roughly spherically.
*  But maybe not perfectly spherically because
*  in fact there will be a
*  specific wave function that is whatever
*  is the Schrödinger equation's solution
*  given the initial conditions.
*  As the most obvious example,
*  if the nucleus itself
*  that you started with was spinning,
*  then it's not spherically symmetric,
*  right? A spinning nucleus has an axis
*  around which it's spinning
*  and so it might emit
*  with a wave function that is either bigger or smaller
*  perpendicular to that axis
*  versus parallel to that axis.
*  So it's just a matter of
*  where you start.
*  That tells you where you end up.
*  Chris Fotage says,
*  Regarding dark matter, dark energy, new particles,
*  the graviton, in your
*  view, where do they fit into the standard
*  model? Are they part of the current model
*  as new rows or columns?
*  Well, you've given examples here,
*  dark matter, dark energy, new particles,
*  the graviton. These are four very different examples.
*  They all have very different stories to tell about them.
*  Dark energy is most likely not a
*  particle. It's most likely just the
*  cosmological constant, so it's not in the
*  standard model at all. It's just a parameter
*  in the laws of physics,
*  easy to add. If it is not
*  a cosmological constant, if it's dynamical,
*  then it could be a new particle, but a very, very,
*  very, very light particle that interacts
*  very, very weakly with ordinary matter.
*  Dark matter, likewise,
*  it probably is a new particle.
*  It interacts very weakly with ordinary matter
*  or you would have found it before.
*  So I think that in some sense,
*  there's a good way of thinking about
*  the way that we think about
*  the muon anomalies that we talked about in the last solo podcast.
*  Even if we extend
*  the standard model,
*  even if we find new things,
*  dark matter particles, dark energy particles,
*  or whatever, fields,
*  it might turn out to be
*  the case that what we currently call
*  the standard model
*  still has a status
*  as a coherent sort of part
*  of the universe, right?
*  There's a lot of things that are
*  in the standard model, and
*  we'll extend it, but we'll still say that
*  this part was the standard model,
*  and then we have new things, right?
*  Maybe supersymmetric particles,
*  or excitations and extra dimensions,
*  or relics of grand unification,
*  but the standard model will still be the standard model.
*  Maybe.
*  So what I'm saying is, it's not clear until we actually do it
*  whether or not we will end up
*  relabeling the standard model
*  to include whatever new things we find,
*  or we'll end up
*  re-labeling the standard model
*  to include whatever new things we find,
*  or we'll keep the current standard model
*  and just say the standard model is not all
*  of what we know in particle physics.
*  The graviton is a special case
*  because we know that gravity exists,
*  we know that gravitons exist even though we've never
*  found them, as long as you think that there is
*  gravity and there's quantum mechanics,
*  something like the graviton will exist,
*  but technically speaking, it's not
*  in the standard model, so whatever.
*  It's in the core theory, that's why Frank Wilczak
*  labeled, came up with this label,
*  the core theory, because gravity exists,
*  you should include it, so that's
*  gravity plus the standard model
*  is the core theory.
*  Adriana Sosserman
*  says, in a scenario where there are no
*  restrictions for civilians to go to the
*  International Space Station, would you consider
*  going? I'd consider it,
*  you know, I wouldn't be
*  driven, I wouldn't be like, you know,
*  hyper passionate about it, to be honest.
*  It'd be fun, it'd be cool. Being out
*  in space sounds like an awesome thing.
*  At the same time, in the
*  current level of technology, it's, it is
*  to be fair, super dangerous.
*  Flying into space,
*  super dangerous. We
*  have accidents at quite a high
*  rate compared to what you would really
*  like, and
*  as cool as it would be going into space,
*  I have a lot of cool things I still want to do here
*  on Earth, so you have to balance
*  that, right? You have to say, well, what is the risk
*  that you would be willing to take?
*  And, you know, I think there are other people
*  in the world who would get more out
*  of going into space than I would, honestly.
*  Like, again, I have plenty
*  of things I want to do here on Earth, so even
*  though I do think it would be cool, I would not
*  do everything I can to force my way
*  to the front of the line. How about that?
*  Okay, I'm going to group two
*  questions together here, because they're both about the
*  past hypothesis of low entropy
*  in the early universe.
*  Lothian53 says,
*  if the early universe was high
*  entropy, could it have
*  had inflation or the expansion of the universe?
*  And if we had these,
*  wouldn't matter still clump due to gravity and then
*  collapse into suns providing the energy to power
*  life? Steve Pilling says,
*  you seemed a bit doubtful about Brian
*  Green's paper suggesting that gravity was
*  switched off in the early formation of the universe
*  to account for the low entropy.
*  This explanation seems to be quite plausible
*  to me, and if the Higgs field was
*  switched off, for example, this would presumably
*  have such an effect, because the particles would not
*  gain mass from the Higgs mechanism.
*  So, both of these have to do
*  with what we call the past hypothesis
*  in the foundations of statistical mechanics.
*  We know that entropy is increasing
*  in order to get that to have
*  to happen under rules of physics
*  that are individually,
*  fundamentally time reversible.
*  We need to assume an imbalance
*  in the initial versus the final conditions
*  of the universe. We need to assume the early universe
*  had low entropy. That's what the past hypothesis
*  is supposed to say.
*  So, the first question from Lothian53 is,
*  what if it were high entropy?
*  In the back of one's mind,
*  you think, well, couldn't you have high entropy
*  but still have the same story of inflation
*  and expansion and clumping, etc.?
*  And so, no. The answer is no.
*  It depends on what you mean
*  by high entropy.
*  Truly high entropy.
*  Remember, what we're talking
*  about here is a system that has gravity.
*  So, a system where
*  space-time is curved, and space-time
*  has dynamics. That's an important part of the story.
*  I think a lot of people get confused
*  when they talk about gravity and entropy
*  and cosmology
*  by imagining we can
*  keep the space-time fixed
*  and mess around with what the matter
*  is doing and call that, you know,
*  a new situation. But,
*  they're coupled to each other. The gravity,
*  the curvature of space-time, and what the matter
*  are doing both matter, as it were.
*  So, the...
*  There's a result,
*  a paper that I wrote
*  with Aidan Chatwin-Davis, where we showed
*  that what you mean
*  by high entropy in a universe
*  with a positive cosmological constant
*  is empty space.
*  Dissider space.
*  So, not anti-dissider space, which is an empty
*  universe with a negative cosmological constant,
*  but dissider space is an empty
*  universe with a positive cosmological
*  constant.
*  And so, we were not the first to suggest this,
*  but we actually were able to prove it under some
*  assumptions. I just said an hour
*  ago that you don't prove things, but here's an example,
*  a counter example, because we actually proved a little
*  result, where here are your
*  assumptions, and we showed that there's
*  an equivalence between what is called the cosmic
*  No-Hair Theorem,
*  which says that in the presence of a positive
*  vacuum energy, the universe will just empty out,
*  and you'll be left with nothing but
*  empty space, dissider space,
*  expanding forever, and the second
*  law of thermodynamics, which says that entropy continues
*  to increase. Eventually, you hit thermal equilibrium.
*  Increasing entropy
*  can be thought of as this approach
*  to empty space.
*  So, by hypothesis, if you say
*  if the early universe was high
*  entropy, it would be
*  empty space. It would not be hot and dense
*  and rapidly expanding. That's not what
*  it would be, okay?
*  So, if you start with high entropy,
*  then you're just in empty space, and you
*  stay there forever. So, you do not
*  collapse into stars or gravity
*  or anything like that. There's nothing around to
*  do any of that collapsing.
*  And to Steve's question, so Brian Green
*  and his collaborators had a paper
*  which said the following thing. Again,
*  if you imagine
*  that you could separate out
*  what gravity was doing from what matter
*  is doing, then there's a sense
*  in which the early universe,
*  if you could ignore gravity,
*  looks like it's high entropy.
*  That is to say, the
*  temperature profile of the early
*  universe, the photons,
*  the spectrum that we get from the cosmic microwave
*  background, if it weren't for gravity,
*  the spectrum looks like a black body.
*  That's a high entropy situation.
*  So, many people have pointed this out,
*  but the early
*  universe looks weird in the absence
*  of some theoretical understanding
*  because the gravitational
*  situation is very, very
*  orderly and low entropy,
*  given that
*  the matter situation is very disorderly
*  and high entropy, okay?
*  Now, gravity is much more important in this
*  situation, so overall, it's very, very low entropy,
*  but that's a fact that we can think about
*  trying to take advantage of. So,
*  Brian's paper tries to take advantage of that by saying,
*  well, maybe you turn off
*  gravity in the early universe,
*  the matter degrees of freedom
*  equilibrate, they go to their
*  maximum entropy state where it looks like a black body,
*  then there is separately
*  some process,
*  magic, that
*  turns on gravity, okay? It's not really magic,
*  it's a scalar field or something like that, okay?
*  Here's why that doesn't work.
*  So, one thing, sorry, footnote,
*  this has nothing to do with the Higgs mechanism, okay?
*  Gravity has nothing to do with the Higgs mechanism.
*  Gravity exists
*  whether particles have mass or don't.
*  Gravity exists for photons, photons have mass,
*  but they used to dominate the energy of the universe, okay?
*  Massiveness of particles
*  is affected by the Higgs mechanism
*  completely different than gravity.
*  Gravity is affected by Newton's constant.
*  So, when you turn off gravity in the early
*  universe, what you're saying is Newton's constant was zero.
*  Newton's constant of gravity in the early universe.
*  The reason why I don't think that solves the problem is
*  it's not robust.
*  I mean, it's just equivalent to saying
*  the early universe was in a very, very, very special
*  early state.
*  And the reason you know that is
*  if you took our universe today
*  and you let it collapse rather than expand,
*  even if gravity turned off
*  in the early universe, it wouldn't smooth out
*  while it's collapsing, right?
*  So, it's not a very, very special
*  initial condition.
*  And you can show that by just reversing
*  the problem.
*  And so, if you really want
*  to explain the
*  robustly and without cheating
*  the low entropy of the early universe,
*  you need to come up with
*  a story that works
*  both directions in time.
*  A story that you can say, well, you give me
*  a very, very special initial condition
*  and you can show that by just reversing the problem.
*  And so, if you really want
*  a story that you can say, well, you give me
*  conditions at one moment of time,
*  I will use the laws of physics to evolve
*  it forward and backward,
*  and eventually I will get the same answer.
*  That's what Jennifer Chen and I tried to do in our
*  2004 paper. It's becoming like it's creeping
*  up. People are beginning to catch on
*  that this is a good thing to try
*  to do. Julian Barber and his
*  collaborators are
*  the most famous example of people who are
*  trying to use that kind of technique.
*  James Cantrell says,
*  with so much noise out there in the
*  information sphere, how does someone who's
*  not terribly smart go about
*  making a smart choice in choosing what
*  expertise to latch onto?
*  So, James, I refuse to believe that any Patreon
*  supporters of the Mindscape podcast are not
*  terribly smart. You're obviously making good decisions
*  in your life, but taking
*  it that you must not be talking about yourself,
*  but someone else, this is a
*  good question. I mean, let's say, forget about being smart.
*  Being smart is not the point. But let's say, expertise.
*  If you don't have expertise in a certain area,
*  which all of us lack expertise in some
*  areas, how do you go about
*  choosing what experts to believe?
*  There's a lot of purported
*  experts out there, and they say incompatible
*  things. You know, this came up a little bit
*  in my podcast with Julia Gallif.
*  I really like that podcast
*  because it made me think, after the fact,
*  about what we talked about a lot.
*  And Julia, you know,
*  one of the questions I asked her was,
*  you want to be a good Bayesian? You want to start
*  with some credences on different possibilities,
*  update them on evidence,
*  but that starting point is tricky.
*  And especially when you're in a situation
*  where you're not an expert, and you are,
*  like you said in your question, like you have different
*  voices coming in and saying different things.
*  So if you hear
*  what might be a crackpot
*  or what might be a brilliant idea
*  and you don't know, you're not
*  an expert, how do you judge, right?
*  And so Julia actually, after the podcast,
*  you went on Twitter and you said,
*  she gave an answer in real time,
*  but then thought through it more
*  and went on Twitter and tried to explain more.
*  And she offered some tentative
*  suggestions for how you would judge
*  the credibility of a source
*  that was making outrageous claims.
*  Are they a genius or are they just a crackpot?
*  And she got some pushback
*  from people who said, well,
*  all of your criteria are about
*  the person making the claim,
*  not the claim itself.
*  And so she said,
*  she's not an expert in judging the claims themselves.
*  All I have to go on
*  is the person making the claim.
*  I think that's perfectly okay.
*  That will be true in some cases
*  where you just don't personally
*  have the expertise to judge
*  the claims for themselves.
*  You have to think to yourself, is the person
*  making this claim credible in my mind?
*  And there are a number of things
*  that you can do to judge the claims
*  for themselves.
*  So I think that's a great idea.
*  And there are a number of things that go into that.
*  Obviously, do they have a track record?
*  I mean, have they made other claims
*  in this area that have panned out?
*  Are they recognized
*  as an expert?
*  Whatever it takes, written papers,
*  written books, made predictions,
*  whatever it takes to say,
*  yes, they're not just selling you a line of goods.
*  They know something about this.
*  But there are people who do have a track record
*  who then go crazy.
*  That's something you also have to take in mind.
*  I think the more interesting
*  criterion or
*  piece of information you can use to evaluate
*  this question is,
*  when they're making their claims,
*  how do they relate
*  those claims to other
*  claims? In particular,
*  how does the person
*  making this claim
*  talk about the
*  arguments against their
*  claim? So if a person says,
*  you know, here's my
*  claim, people will tell you
*  I'm wrong, but they are pawns of
*  the establishment and they're out to
*  get me and they're dumb
*  and whatever it is,
*  then I'm actually much less likely to
*  take them seriously. If people
*  say, here are arguments why I might be
*  wrong, and they're good arguments,
*  I get it, I understand why you would believe it,
*  I'm now going to go through and tell you why
*  none of these arguments are persuasive in this case.
*  That's much more
*  convincing to me. A person who
*  demonstrates that they
*  appreciate why they might be wrong
*  is much more likely,
*  in my mind, to be right at the end of the day.
*  And there's other things you can think about
*  doing, but that kind of
*  thing, you know, you have to
*  develop your
*  bullshit detector. I mean, Carl Sagan
*  had a baloney detection kit
*  that he tried to go through, but there's no algorithm,
*  right? You have to sort of get
*  good at recognizing what kinds
*  of people are credible in this kind of
*  game. It's hard, and you will make mistakes.
*  We all do. I do.
*  Jim Murphy says, I've often
*  heard certain types of people say that humanity
*  as a whole is sick, or that
*  we have abandoned our natural way of being.
*  I think this is probably a bit strong, but
*  we do seem to have a very anthropocentric
*  way of thinking. Do you think that
*  we need to work as a species on
*  viewing ourselves less centrally?
*  So I think this is a good question to sort of
*  raise and contemplate, but I'm not sure I can give you
*  a very persuasive, simple answer,
*  because, I mean, how do we judge
*  the correct
*  level of anthropocentrism? Like,
*  I am a human being. I am going
*  to think about human beings more than I am going to
*  think about daffodils. That's just true,
*  right? You know, daffodils are going to think about
*  daffodils more than they think about human beings,
*  I presume, unless they're being stomped on
*  by a human being. But, you know,
*  it's just perfectly natural and okay
*  to think about people and
*  things that are in similar circumstances
*  to you. How much
*  to do that
*  is a good question.
*  So I don't know. That's a very
*  vague answer. Sorry, I should
*  have put more thought into this one, maybe.
*  So I
*  guess the short answer, if I'm trying
*  to be more direct, is I
*  don't think it's true that we need to
*  work as a species on viewing ourselves
*  less centrally. I think
*  we need to work as a species
*  on viewing everything else
*  more definitely,
*  more carefully,
*  more thoughtfully, right?
*  More consciously.
*  So there is the rest of the
*  world, the rest of the universe out there, the rest
*  of the biosphere, the rest of the species here
*  on Earth. Species maybe
*  on other planets or whatever, and
*  we should take them into consideration when we
*  are doing what we do to the Earth.
*  But I don't think that the problem
*  is we're putting our species first.
*  I think that individuals put themselves first,
*  right? Individuals
*  work for the betterment of themselves and their
*  families and whatever, their friends,
*  and we need cooperation, as we
*  discussed way at the beginning of this AMA,
*  across people around
*  the globe to do better. Like, that's the
*  more important thing than we should think
*  about other species in particular.
*  Miko
*  Hattainen says,
*  How visual is your thinking?
*  I remember you specifically
*  mentioning visualizing things in several podcast
*  episodes. When talking about higher dimensions
*  in physics and math, you mentioned that visualization
*  can only get you so far.
*  So yeah, so actually there's two things.
*  Number one,
*  I am actually kind of a visual
*  thinker myself. You know, within
*  mathematical approaches
*  either to math or to physics,
*  some people think visually,
*  geometrically, roughly speaking, you know,
*  drawing pictures and thinking about
*  physically tangible
*  constructions, and other people are more
*  equation based, thinking more abstractly
*  in that sense. And in that
*  continuum, I am more on the drawing pictures
*  side of things. I would love to someday
*  write a paper where I prove a result
*  or derive a result just based on
*  pictures, without any equations at all.
*  But at the same time,
*  I recognize that it does only take
*  you so far. If you want to talk about a
*  Hilbert space
*  that is 10 to the 120 dimensional,
*  or 10 to the 10 to the 120
*  dimensional, you can't
*  visualize that. Give up. You can visualize
*  three dimensions.
*  And that's not a very
*  representative sample of 10 to the 10
*  to the 120 dimensions.
*  So then you need to use the math. So
*  I can prefer to do things
*  visually, and I can try
*  to use simple examples
*  where I can draw it to get as much
*  intuition as I can muster.
*  But at the end of the day, you've got to trust the math.
*  If you have a mathematical description
*  that works where you understand
*  it, then you should trust it where you
*  can't visualize it until you have
*  a good reason not to. I think that's the rule
*  of thumb.
*  Okay, two questions I'm going to group together because they're both about the Fermi paradox.
*  Why haven't we seen
*  intelligent aliens? Ken Wolf
*  says, what do you think is the most likely
*  solution to the Fermi paradox, which is the one
*  you would most like to be true?
*  And David Wright says, I've always been very
*  skeptical of media stories about any
*  physical encounters with extraterrestrial intelligent
*  beings based on a simple fact.
*  Isn't it vastly more likely
*  that we would detect extraterrestrials
*  from their electromagnetic radiation
*  long before we would encounter their matter?
*  So to David's question first,
*  I am always
*  extremely skeptical
*  about anyone who says,
*  isn't it vastly more likely that aliens
*  would do this rather than that?
*  You know, I don't know what aliens would do.
*  I think we should be open minded, you know, other
*  than the fact that they have very,
*  very advanced technology, right? Presumably,
*  like by construction, it's extraordinarily
*  unlikely that advanced technological
*  aliens would be more or less at our
*  level of technology. That's just an
*  incredible fine tuning. It's easy for
*  them to be millions of years further
*  along in their development, right?
*  No problem at all.
*  So whatever we think about
*  extraterrestrial
*  technological civilizations, we should
*  assume that they're much more technologically
*  advanced. What that means
*  is very hard. So
*  no, I don't think it's necessarily
*  true we would encounter their electromagnetic
*  radiation long before we encounter their
*  matter. In fact, I could come up
*  with the perfectly plausible
*  reason why the opposite is true.
*  The thing about electromagnetic radiation is
*  it zips right by you,
*  right? If you're an alien civilization
*  who wants to
*  make contact with other
*  civilizations elsewhere in the universe,
*  electromagnetic radiation is the
*  dumbest thing to use because not
*  only does the civilization
*  you're trying to target need to be
*  listening into you, they
*  need to be listening into you at exactly
*  the right time. Otherwise, the photons just
*  go right by or radio waves or whatever.
*  If you really
*  want to sort of spread through the galaxy
*  and talk to everyone who is in other solar
*  systems, you should send space
*  probes. You should send matter. Why?
*  Because you can park them there.
*  You can send a probe to
*  another solar system and just have it
*  wait there for a few billion years to see
*  if any intelligent life comes into existence.
*  You can integrate over time in a way
*  that you can't with electromagnetic radiation.
*  Not to mention the fact that electromagnetic
*  radiation being beamed out into space
*  is just incredibly wasteful.
*  And why would an advanced technological civilization
*  waste all that energy?
*  Now, I don't think that either one of these
*  arguments is
*  actually convincing because I don't know what
*  extraterrestrials would do other than the fact that
*  they would be technologically very advanced.
*  For Ken's question, what do I think is the most likely
*  solution? I mean,
*  the most likely solution is
*  that the probability of life arising
*  on a planet, a planet
*  that can
*  in principle support life,
*  is small. One chance in
*  10 to the 100. There you go. There's a number
*  that would make it very, very
*  unlikely that there is even one other
*  life
*  supporting planet in our
*  observable universe.
*  Now, maybe life is everywhere,
*  but multicellular life
*  is very, very rare. Or
*  eukaryotic life, or the equivalent
*  thereof. Or
*  intelligent life, or technological life.
*  Like maybe there's lots of intelligent
*  life everywhere in the universe, but they're all
*  swimming in the oceans, and they have flippers,
*  and they never develop opposable thumbs, so they never
*  build spaceships, right?
*  Any of these are possible. So I think the most
*  likely solution is that the intelligent
*  space-faring civilizations just aren't
*  there for some reason or another. It's not the only
*  solution, and again, I think we should be humble
*  about these things, but that's the most obvious
*  likely one to me.
*  Russell Wolf says,
*  How does entropy work with Hawking
*  radiation? If a black hole is a maximum
*  entropy object, does that mean that as it evaporates
*  its entropy decreases?
*  No, it does not mean that, because
*  a black hole is not a maximum entropy
*  object. This is one of those cases where you have
*  to listen very carefully when the physicists
*  say their words. A black hole
*  is the maximum entropy that you can
*  fit into a region of prescribed
*  size.
*  So when a black hole evaporates,
*  it's important that not only it creates
*  photons that leave the black hole,
*  but those photons spread out
*  across a huge
*  distance.
*  So the overall entropy of the radiation
*  that a black hole turns into
*  is higher than the entropy of the
*  black hole itself. Not by a lot,
*  by a factor of order unity, but it is bigger
*  but that entropy is spread out over an enormous
*  distance. So there's no contradiction
*  with the fact that black holes are the maximum
*  entropy you can have in a region
*  because the entropy they turn into is not
*  confined to that region, it's spread out.
*  David Frank says,
*  A few months back you had Avi Loeb on
*  talking about Amuamua. Avi
*  shortly thereafter took a lot of criticism
*  for his views. What's your honest
*  view about his ideas on Amuamua?
*  Is he a charlatan selling snake oil
*  or is there some level of credibility to his ideas?
*  So again, there's two things I want to say about this.
*  Number one, I don't know
*  if this came through in the podcast, but I don't
*  care about Amuamua.
*  Like, that is not the point to me.
*  What I was interested in
*  is the general question of how
*  should we think about
*  taking seriously the idea
*  of intelligent life on other planets
*  in some sense
*  contacting us or being contactable
*  or having an influence or sending
*  something by our solar system.
*  This particular example of Amuamua,
*  I don't care. I don't think we'll have
*  any information that is going to let us decide
*  one way or the other. So what is the point
*  of worrying about this particular artifact?
*  I'm very interested in, you know, should
*  we be on the lookout
*  for artifacts like that? What is the
*  probability? What is the credence that we should put
*  into such ideas? So that's what I cared about.
*  The other thing, the other point to make
*  is I absolutely
*  think it's wrong to think
*  of Avi Loeb as a
*  charlatan selling snake oil.
*  Number one, he's not. I know that he's not.
*  I know Avi. I know his work.
*  It's very off-based.
*  I think he's a charlatan selling snake oil.
*  Number two,
*  I am not going to have charlatans who I think
*  are selling snake oil onto my podcast.
*  That's just not what I am about.
*  I do not, if I ever
*  invite someone on the podcast, I may or may not
*  agree with them, but I will
*  always think that they're worth listening to and
*  talking in good faith. Maybe I'm not
*  wrong, maybe they have fooled me, that's always possible.
*  But if I have someone on the podcast,
*  you can take as given that I think
*  they're worth listening to,
*  whether or not I think that they're right.
*  I want the audience to get something out of
*  what they're saying. I will never have someone
*  on the podcast just to debunk
*  them. There's plenty of that out there
*  in the world. That's not what I'm about.
*  I'm about listening to people
*  who have something interesting to teach us,
*  and I definitely think that Avi is on that
*  side of things, whether or not he's right about
*  this particular event.
*  Dan Pye says,
*  Regarding your claim building on Frank
*  Wilczek's core theory that we are overwhelmingly
*  unlikely to discover another
*  particle or force that is relevant to our everyday
*  lives at the human scale, can you
*  give an overview of how quantum field theory
*  tells us about what we know we
*  don't know, so to speak,
*  i.e. how are we certain that there aren't
*  forces affecting normal matter
*  that simply aren't produced by any of the common
*  interactions generated in particle accelerators?
*  So I'll give a short answer here because I did write a paper on this very recently.
*  The quantum field theory on which
*  everyday life supervenes, and I've tweeted
*  about it, so you can find it pretty easily,
*  but you know, it's on, it's, you know, you Google
*  that, you'll find it.
*  The point is quantum field theory
*  gives us rules. It's not anything
*  goes. So the
*  particular rule that is relevant
*  here is one called crossing symmetry.
*  If you have
*  a field or a particle
*  that can affect the fields and particles
*  of which we are made,
*  then it is inevitable
*  that you can make that
*  particle or make that field
*  just by colliding together
*  the particles and fields of which we are made.
*  And that's what particle physicists do for a living.
*  They collide together. Electrons and positrons
*  or protons and protons and
*  antiprotons, whatever.
*  We smash particles together and look at
*  what comes out. If there were
*  any other particles that could, that
*  interact strongly enough with the particles we're made of
*  that they could be relevant for human life,
*  we would have made them already.
*  Unless there is something
*  dramatically wrong about quantum field theory,
*  that's always possible, so it's not a proof
*  of anything. Science doesn't prove
*  things, but it means that
*  it's telling you exactly how dramatically
*  you have to violate the known laws of physics
*  in order to make something like that happen.
*  Adam Lowett says,
*  What are your thoughts on the position held by
*  former mindscape, mindscape scientists
*  and others that artificial intelligent
*  alignment, AI safety
*  could present a major challenge
*  or even an existential risk to humanity
*  in the future?
*  So I have mixed feelings about this.
*  You know, you use
*  the phrase AI alignment, AI safety,
*  and these are two different things.
*  AI safety, I think, is a big deal.
*  I think we should worry about it, you know.
*  But it's not even AI safety,
*  it's just complex systems
*  risk analysis, and it's not
*  complex systems risk analysis,
*  okay. We have computers,
*  we have technology, we have
*  networks
*  that no one human being
*  can grasp the whole thing in their head,
*  right. No one human being can grasp the whole
*  internet in all of its details, or
*  any sufficiently sophisticated
*  deep learning algorithm
*  or something like that. You know, it does things
*  and no human being knows exactly why
*  it's doing what it is doing, okay.
*  So there are obvious risks
*  associated with that kind of thing, long
*  before you get to the point where you would
*  call it artificially intelligent. I think
*  that's a general question. How do you quantify
*  risks and how do you
*  protect yourself against
*  risks for complex systems
*  which you don't fully understand? That's a very, very
*  important question that we should put a lot of effort into.
*  The AI alignment
*  problem, as I understand it, and I'm not
*  an expert, although I've had people on the
*  program talking about it,
*  what is being aligned here?
*  The alignment is between the values
*  of the AI and the values
*  that we human beings have. That is to say,
*  once you have
*  an artificially intelligent system
*  that can be said to have values
*  in some sense,
*  are its values our values?
*  Are its values once
*  we would hold? Does it want the same
*  things that we want?
*  To me, that whole discussion
*  seems wrongheaded a little bit.
*  I mean, there's aspects of it that make perfect
*  sense, but it is way
*  jumping the gun for exactly the
*  reasons that are implicit in what I just said
*  about AI safety.
*  Who's to say that the
*  word values is something that even
*  makes sense when we're talking about
*  artificial intelligence?
*  It seems highly anthropomorphic
*  to me to think that
*  we can talk about the values of
*  an AI in more or less
*  the same way that we can talk about the values
*  of human beings, and therefore we
*  can talk about aligning them together.
*  I mean, maybe something
*  that we would recognize as artificially intelligent
*  has something we would recognize as values.
*  Maybe it doesn't. Maybe
*  they're similar to human values. Maybe they're
*  not. Who knows?
*  I mean, I think that there's this whole
*  assumption that we get to
*  choose what the values are, and
*  I've always worried about that assumption. I mean, if it's
*  really artificially intelligent, can't it
*  modify its own values in ways that
*  we can't predict? So
*  I just think that that whole discussion
*  is based on taking
*  the analogy between AI
*  and human thinking too seriously.
*  That's not to say I don't think that
*  AIs can't in principle
*  do anything that humans
*  can do. I'm not giving humans any
*  special status here, but
*  just because in principle
*  an AI could do what a human can do
*  doesn't mean that in practice when you
*  get AI, it will be human-like
*  in any way. I
*  presume that there are thousands,
*  millions, who knows how
*  many other ways to be intelligent
*  that are different from what humans do,
*  and maybe the AI will be one of those,
*  and maybe it'll have values that we can recognize.
*  Maybe it won't, right?
*  So I think it's asking the wrong
*  question to ask about the values of AI.
*  What we should focus on is this
*  more general safety problem,
*  risk management problem. That's something I think
*  we should worry about.
*  Okay, Thomas Freeman says,
*  Do you feel like you are always on
*  when it comes to your life as a physicist?
*  Meaning, when you are watching basketball or out to dinner
*  with your wife, could you instantly chat
*  about the news developments, etc.?
*  I think it depends here.
*  When I read the question for the
*  first time, I was thinking I'm going to say no, I'm not
*  always on, because in the sense that
*  certainly there are plenty
*  of times in my life when I'm not thinking about physics
*  at all, okay? When I'm thinking about basketball
*  or poker or wine or whatever it is.
*  But I think maybe that's not exactly
*  what you're asking in retrospect.
*  Maybe what you're asking is
*  are there little subroutines running beneath
*  the surface that are
*  physics oriented that could be
*  summoned up at any time or
*  might secretly affect how
*  I think about basketball or poker or wine
*  or something like that. And there
*  maybe, yeah, maybe.
*  I do think that,
*  to go back to talking about the physics
*  of democracy, I do
*  think that there is something called thinking like a physicist.
*  And it's not a single
*  thing. There are ways that physicists
*  think. There are sort of
*  paradigms, questions
*  that we ask, you know,
*  toy systems, spherical
*  cows that we regularly refer to,
*  ways of analyzing
*  complex systems, and these pop
*  up in all sorts of different
*  examples. You know, you don't
*  want to be the person watching
*  movies who constantly complains about
*  them not obeying the laws of physics,
*  but you know, you do notice when
*  they don't obey the laws of physics, that is
*  always there. So I'm certainly not always
*  thinking about physics consciously,
*  but maybe it is true that there
*  are ways I am thinking about it unconsciously
*  all the time. I'm not quite sure, but
*  I'm willing to believe in that.
*  Okay, very last question
*  comes from Brad Miller who says,
*  Do you always feel as
*  confident in yourself as you sound?
*  So I guess I should thank
*  you, Brad, for the implicit compliment that I
*  always sound confident, or maybe it's not
*  you didn't actually assign a value
*  judgment to whether or not sounding confident
*  was good or bad. Maybe you think
*  it's objectionable, I don't know, but
*  I don't
*  think, here
*  I am sounding not very confident
*  about my level of confidence,
*  so I don't think I'm very confident
*  about all sorts of things, but
*  maybe
*  there is, and I'm just
*  this might not be true, but maybe there is
*  a way to sound confident
*  just by being comfortable
*  about
*  quantifying your uncertainty.
*  I mean, what I do try to do,
*  and I don't always succeed, but what I try to do
*  is to have a pretty good
*  handle on
*  not just what I think is true,
*  but the relative levels of confidence
*  I have in different things that
*  I believe.
*  When I think that things are true,
*  I try very hard to be clear
*  about why I think that those
*  are true. It could be clear to myself,
*  right, not going
*  badgering other people about why I think it's true,
*  but, you know, understanding how I came
*  to these different points of view.
*  And when you sort of take
*  that attitude about the world, that
*  you should judge
*  things with different credences, and you
*  should be clear as you can be
*  about what the reasons are
*  for having different credences in different things,
*  then I guess you start
*  sounding confident about it, but even
*  if what you're saying is, oh, I have no idea,
*  right, many things I have
*  no idea about, and I'm
*  happy to say that. I'm not bothered by it.
*  In other words, maybe,
*  again, I'm not at all
*  confident about this one, but maybe
*  the appearance of not
*  being confident
*  comes from feeling
*  bad when you say,
*  I don't know. You know what I mean?
*  So being able to say, I don't
*  know anything about that thing, or
*  I think this is true, but it might go away,
*  even though you're actually
*  expressing a great deal
*  of uncertainty, you're doing
*  it in a way that makes you sound confident.
*  And maybe that is good. Maybe that
*  is actually a virtue that you
*  can aim for, being
*  upfront about
*  what you know and what you don't know,
*  right? Again, recognizing
*  that you're always going to be wrong sometimes.
*  You can't tell ahead of time which times. That's the problem.
*  But you can be
*  confident that you're going to be wrong, even if you're
*  very confident that you have
*  judged your credences as well as you can.
*  So maybe that's an answer, Brad.
*  I don't know. Not very confident in that answer.
*  Thank you for the implicit compliment,
*  if it were indeed there.
*  I mean, also, I should also admit,
*  what are you listening to me talk about?
*  You're listening to me talk about
*  things on my podcast.
*  I get to choose the topics, right?
*  And so, and I get that the questions that are being asked
*  are questions about things that I usually have
*  talked about in the past, one way or the other.
*  So you're not seeing a representative sample
*  about things that I could talk about
*  in the whole world. You're seeing me talk about things I know
*  something about, generally, a little bit.
*  Maybe that also gives you a misimpression
*  of the confidence level. Anyway,
*  something to think about. These are good questions.
*  That was a good question.
*  Lots of good questions. I really had fun
*  with this AMA. See you next month.
*  Bye-bye.
