If you knew exactly when every person was going to die, or require medical care, you could make a killing buying and selling insurance. Nobody knows these things, of course -- the future is hard to predict -- but some people know something about the future that other people don't. This sets up adverse selection: the ability of one party to leverage information another party doesn't have, in order to gain an economic advantage. Economist Amy Finkelstein is an expert in this phenomenon, as well as the usefulness of empirical studies in economic research.

Amy Finkelstein received her Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She is currently John & Jennie S. MacDonald Professor of Economics at MIT. She is the co-director and research associate of the Public Economics Program at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and the co-Scientific Director of J-PAL North America. Among her awards are a MacArthur Fellowship and the John Bates Clark Medal. Her recent book, with co-authors Liran Einav and Ray Fisman, is Risky Business: Why Insurance Markets Fail and What to Do About It.

# Mindscape 232 | Amy Finkelstein on Adverse Selection and Hidden Information
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfRdKQX5nLA)
*  Hello, everyone.
*  Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll, and today's topic is insurance markets.
*  Now I know in the history of Mindscape, we've talked about the meaning of life, the fundamental
*  laws of physics, the way that giant philosophical scientific ideas fit together as well as some
*  more fun arts and cultural kind of topics.
*  Compared to our usual affair, insurance markets seem pretty down to earth, maybe not the sexiest
*  topic depending on what you get interested in.
*  I get that, but let me tell you, when you dig into what an insurance market is and why
*  it might not work, it's fascinating.
*  There's a lot of intellectually interesting things going on here, especially if you care
*  and are interested in the fundamental workings of capitalism and the market.
*  So not to sort of spoil too much of the conversation to come, but the basic idea is very simple.
*  Like, what is insurance?
*  Insurance is a trade.
*  You give somebody money now for peace of mind, basically, for knowing that if something goes
*  terribly wrong, you'll be able to protect yourself, to cover your debts or whatever
*  it is, depending on the kinds of insurance.
*  So it's already intellectually interesting because it's trading something right now for
*  a future thing, which is always kind of an interesting question.
*  But there's also the question of the market for insurance and how it works and how it's
*  a sort of counter example to many things that capitalism is supposed to do.
*  We know that capitalist markets can fail for various reasons.
*  There are monopolies or monopsies and things like that, incomplete information.
*  But here's an insurance market failure.
*  You offer insurance to a bunch of people and you say, OK, if you get sick, I will pay for
*  your health care and you set a certain rate.
*  And guess what?
*  So you advise your insurance, the people who are likely to get sick, the people who are
*  more healthy are less likely to buy the insurance.
*  So you have been very careful.
*  You had done some actuarial tables.
*  You figured out how often people get sick.
*  You knew that you would make money if you bought your insurance.
*  You failed to make money because only the sick people bought your insurance.
*  So you go, ah, OK, so it's only the sick people are going to buy it.
*  What I need to do is raise my prices so that I can still make money, even if only the sick
*  people buy my insurance.
*  But then guess what?
*  Only the really sick people buy your insurance.
*  So there is a race to failure built into the very nature of an insurance market.
*  And it's not because people are greedy.
*  It's not because the giant establishment is out to get you.
*  It's just that supply and demand isn't really working.
*  It's not about fairness.
*  It's just about the mechanism not quite working.
*  How do you fix that?
*  Right.
*  So there's a whole literature on this phenomenon about adverse selection where buyers and sellers
*  have different information and buyers in particular have private information about how sick they
*  are, for example, what bad thing is going to happen to them.
*  Still to this day, there's no such thing as divorce insurance because the buyer is
*  going to know much better than the seller whether they're likely to get divorced very
*  soon.
*  So today's guest is Amy Finkelstein, who's a very well-respected economist at MIT.
*  And she and her collaborators recently wrote a book, Risky Business, Why Insurance Markets
*  Fail and What to Do About It.
*  So I like the topic because it's at the intersection there of real-world stuff that
*  really matters, you know, legislation and things like that, how we organize our system.
*  But also, there's interesting intellectual questions about present versus future, how
*  to find an equilibrium in a bunch of people with different desires, all that sort of good
*  stuff.
*  So let's go.
*  Amy Finkelstein, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thanks a lot for having me, Sean.
*  I'm delighted to be here.
*  I wanted to mention right at the start that in your new book, Risky Business, a delightful
*  book, happy to recommend to everybody, one of the delightful things about it is right
*  up at the front, you are honest, you're candid, and you admit to your audience that insurance
*  markets might not seem like the sexiest topic to read or write a book about.
*  So I thought I would at least just open, just in case someone listens to the podcast for
*  just five minutes, give us your sales pitch for why insurance markets are sexier than
*  people might think.
*  That's a pretty low bar.
*  I'll actually go for they're sexy on an absolute scale.
*  Good.
*  Although, you know, we all have our different tastes.
*  So the reason I think insurance is so exciting and the reason I've spent most of my career
*  studying it is that insurance offers the possibility of doing something that I think is quite magical.
*  It offers the hope for a measure of security and certainty in a dangerous and uncertain
*  world.
*  Insurance touches nearly every aspect of our lives.
*  We ensure our cars, our houses, our pets, and literally our lives.
*  And when you think about all the risks we face in the world from disease to death to
*  natural disasters, you know, there's this tantalizing prospect that we can eliminate
*  some of not all, but some of the vicissitudes and vagaries that plague our lives.
*  So that's why I think it's exciting, you know, that it's, you know, the tantalizing what
*  economists call free lunch, right?
*  Everyone can benefit.
*  But what our book is about is the fact that despite I think this very real and potentially
*  valuable service, insurance often fails to deliver on its promise and few people understand
*  why and the results of that lack of understanding as we describe in the book can be, you know,
*  ruined businesses, ruined policies and ruined lives.
*  And so our hope in writing this book is to help people understand some of the ostensibly
*  frustrating features of many insurance markets, why dental insurance is so crummy, why pet
*  insurance is so expensive, why if you've tried, you'll have discovered you can't buy divorce
*  insurance for love or money.
*  And also why there's a real possibility for the government to step in and try and improve
*  the insurance markets, but why that's hard also and how it sometimes fails as well.
*  Well, that's you touched on the reason why as a physicist slash philosopher, I did I
*  was I was a soft target for your introduction because insurance does, you know, when you
*  get right down to it, the nitty gritty of personal finance, I'm terrible at and I have
*  no interest in getting better at it.
*  But there are these big picture questions about sort of trading present value for future
*  certainty, you know, a bargain between your present self and your and your future self
*  is sort of intellectually a fascinating notion to pursue.
*  Yeah, I mean, and I think, you know, economists tend to think and there's a lot of evidence
*  that most people are what we call risk averse, that they're willing to give up a small amount
*  of money for certainty, for certain, to avoid the perhaps small possibility of a much, much
*  larger loss.
*  So we'd rather pay, you know, a few hundred dollars a year in premiums than, you know,
*  and then in the unfortunate event that say our car is totaled, we then get the money
*  to, you know, repair the car or or buy a new car.
*  And not only would we prefer to do that, but it's not irrational to do that.
*  Right. I actually did recently a podcast with the philosopher, Laura Buchak, who studies
*  risk and rationality.
*  And she makes the case that even if you're it's she's sort of she frames it as taunting
*  economists a little bit because there's something we do in our rational decision making
*  other than maximizing our average expected utility.
*  Sometimes we are willing to forgo a little bit of utility if we can lower our volatility,
*  lower our risk a little bit.
*  Yeah. So I would say, though, there are many things to taunt economists about, but that
*  isn't one of them.
*  I think that that's actually central to economics.
*  It's the idea of going back to von Neumann and Morgenstern of maximizing expected
*  utility. So, you know, you would be happier having, you know, say you have a 10 percent
*  chance you might lose one hundred dollars.
*  Right. That means, you know, on average, you're only going to lose ten dollars.
*  You might be willing to pay ten dollars for sure.
*  And then, you know, ninety times out of a hundred, you're actually not going to lose
*  any money and you just paid you get your ninety dollars.
*  But the one time you do, you also get your ninety dollars.
*  So you never risk losing the whole hundred dollars.
*  In fact, maybe you'd even be willing to pay like eleven bucks for that.
*  I think that's the point.
*  That's not irrational. That's the bread and butter of a lot of economics.
*  No, that's right. But that paying eleven dollars in that case that you just raised is
*  lowering your expected utility.
*  But it's still rational, right?
*  No, it's raising your expected utility.
*  You're giving up eleven dollars.
*  You're going to have eighty nine dollars for sure both periods.
*  You know, say you have eighty nine dollars for sure rather than facing, you know, one,
*  you know, ninety percent probability of having one hundred dollars and a ten percent
*  probability of having zero dollars.
*  And you may be happier with that.
*  There's nothing irrational about it.
*  Of course, ex post, if you don't if you don't experience the loss, you'll wish you
*  haven't paid the premium. But, you know, that's not what insurance is about.
*  Well, actually, yeah, that's another good point you make in the beginning is that part
*  of the utility you get from paying insurance is the peace of mind, right?
*  That you're covered a little bit. And that has to be factored in.
*  For sure. For sure.
*  I was also surprised to learn, you know, how deep into the past it goes.
*  And I recently wrote a book that had an anecdote in it about Edmund Halley, the comet guy.
*  And so did you.
*  So tell I had no idea that Halley had anything to do with insurance.
*  No, neither. Neither did we until or neither did I.
*  At least I can't speak for my co-authors until we started writing this book.
*  And, you know, you mentioned that you're a physicist.
*  And, you know, my understanding is that, you know, physicists like to make fun of economists
*  and mathematicians like to make fun of physicists.
*  And that's kind of the, you know, intellectual pecking order.
*  So from that perspective that I've lived with my whole life, it was fun for us
*  to discover that, you know, Edmund Halley, the comet guy, as you said,
*  and also the distinguished 17th century mathematician, Abraham de Mavre,
*  were both involved in coming up with actuarial tables,
*  calculating mortality risk rates for, you know, or death rates calculations
*  and using those to price survival insurance, something known as annuities.
*  And while they may be, I think, were excellent scientists,
*  they were not very good social scientists.
*  So sometimes the pecking order doesn't hold in the sense that they calculated
*  the mortality tables correctly
*  for the population that they had data for.
*  But what they weren't thinking of is the fact that once you start selling
*  these survival contingent streams of payment, these things called annuities,
*  which actually the French and Dutch governments were doing in the 17th century
*  to finance wars, much the way modern governments issue bonds or treasury bills.
*  So they'd say, you know, to speculators, you know, you give me a bunch of money
*  and we'll pay you every year until someone that you've nominated dies.
*  So what they did, what Haley and de Mavre didn't realize is that,
*  you know, the set of people who's on whom those bets are placed
*  are not randomly drawn from the population. Right.
*  So, for example, in the French case, they looked for, you know,
*  young French girls who had already survived smallpox.
*  So those people had, you know, quite a much longer survival prospects
*  than say older men.
*  And then, you know, after a couple hundred years and arguably the French Revolution,
*  because this did bankrupt Louis the 14th, these mispriced annuities,
*  you know, eventually people caught on and thought, OK, well, we'll we'll we'll say
*  we'll price the annuities differently if you're taking them out a bet
*  on the survival of a 70 year old male as opposed to a five year old girl.
*  But even then, you know, it turned out that, you know,
*  speculators found the the really, really hell and hearty old men in Scotland
*  and placed bets on them.
*  And even in modern times, we continue to see these types of issues coming up.
*  You know, this isn't a side, but let me just get on the record that
*  I think that the pecking order that you refer to is essentially never true.
*  Whenever I see people in highly technical fields think that other fields are easier.
*  When you see them try to do it, they're not really very good at it.
*  There's a whole other set of skills that are required.
*  We should all recognize that.
*  But poor, poor Hallie, he did OK in other areas.
*  He got the common named after him.
*  So that's OK. Absolutely.
*  And to your point, I'm sure I would never have discovered that comment.
*  That comment. Sorry.
*  I would never have discovered that comment, even if I might have,
*  you know, with the benefit of a few hundred more years of economics,
*  figured out the selection problem.
*  But yeah, his mistake that you're pointing to is sort of the center
*  of what we have to talk about here, because, well, you're the world's expert.
*  I should let you describe what's going on here.
*  But there's a thing called adverse selection.
*  There's a thing in insurance, unlike selling cars or smartphones,
*  where you care about who is buying it.
*  You do not get the same value for any different kind of buyer.
*  Exactly. In fact, you made the you made the comparison,
*  which is perfectly accurate to, you know, a smartphone or a car.
*  You know, the comparison we love is one of the things that prompted us
*  to write this book, which was listening to the Supreme Court
*  oral arguments over whether or not the mandate to require everyone
*  to buy health insurance under Obamacare was constitutional.
*  Now, we have nothing to say on constitutional law.
*  But what what what intrigued us was hearing then Supreme Court
*  Justice Antonin Scalia asked during oral arguments, well,
*  if the government can force people to buy health insurance,
*  can it also force them to eat their broccoli?
*  Now, he was obviously being rhetorical and trying to conjure up,
*  you know, this image of a undesirable, intrusive state.
*  But I think to too many people, if not to Scalia, the distinction,
*  at least the distinction we're interested in between insurance
*  and broccoli is not clear.
*  And the reason it might make sense, you know, we jokingly thought
*  of calling our book, you know, why is insurance different than broccoli?
*  But we thought putting two unpopular things in the title
*  was probably not a good idea.
*  But but the reason we think there may be a role for the government
*  in mandating that people buy insurance, be it auto insurance,
*  flood insurance, health insurance, but not for eating their broccoli
*  is precisely what you said.
*  When when when the supermarket sells its broccoli, the profits
*  and the profitability of that broccoli depend only on the price
*  it charges and how many customers buy it.
*  It does not depend on which customers buy it.
*  That is not true for insurance.
*  How much it costs an insurer to insure automobiles or housing is or lives
*  depends on whether the customers who buy it are high risk,
*  accident prone customers or low risk ones.
*  And once you realize that you what what one will realize
*  or economic theorists in the 1970s, going back to George Akerlof
*  realized is that this can wreak havoc on the market,
*  that if you offer an insurance product, the people who are going to flock to it
*  are the people who know that they're riskier,
*  higher expected costs than the typical buyers happened to, you know, admit
*  Halley in the in the, you know, hundreds of years ago.
*  And it happens today.
*  We give examples in the book with divorce insurance and layoff insurance
*  that entrepreneurs tried to offer these products.
*  And they found very quickly that the customers that were buying them
*  were not the customers they wanted.
*  So they had to raise the price to, you know, to cover the higher
*  than expected rates of divorce among people who had divorce insurance
*  or rates of layoff among people buying layoff insurance.
*  Well, unfortunately, what raising the price does,
*  it sounds like a sensible solution to my costs are higher than my revenues.
*  That might be, you know, business school lesson 101.
*  The problem in a selection market, like an insurance market,
*  is when you raise your price, you just exacerbate the selection problem.
*  Now it's only the really, really high risk.
*  The ones who like, you know, already are bickering with their spouse
*  or, you know, have already seen the pink slip who are going to buy this,
*  you know, protection and the market.
*  And we give examples in the book can just literally spiral out of control
*  and have what's called a death spiral. It can completely disappear.
*  And so going back to why insurance is both exciting,
*  but also important to understand, I started by saying it's exciting
*  because it offers a measure of security.
*  But this type of selection problem can destroy that potential.
*  And that's a problem not just for the people who already know
*  they're about to get laid off or about to get divorced, but for all of us,
*  because we all, I think, value having some security, even though
*  I believe I'm happily married and at no risk of divorce or very low risk.
*  And likewise, you know, have secure employment.
*  It still would be great to know that in the unfortunate event
*  that I lose my job or my marriage, that I had some financial resources
*  to help cover the costs of those events.
*  So everyone can benefit from insurance, the low risk and the high risk.
*  The problem is that selection can make it impossible for either
*  everyone or most people to benefit from that insurance.
*  And it is intellectually interesting to someone like me
*  because it is an example of a market failure.
*  And I know that economists are well aware that markets do fail.
*  Like that is that is a bad stereotype to think that economists
*  think that markets never fail.
*  But there's sort of standard ways in which markets can fail,
*  either by exacerbating inequality or by monopolies or things like that.
*  And this is kind of a different way.
*  There's nothing nothing, you know, mistaken about it.
*  Everyone is doing the individually rational thing, but the market
*  is just driving you to an equilibrium that no one wants to be in.
*  Yes. And that's what is so to me, so fascinating about it is that
*  you could have a situation in which everyone values insurance.
*  They're actually willing to pay a price that's actuarially fair
*  based on their own risk, which means they're willing to go to go back
*  to our example of the 10 percent chance of losing one hundred dollars. Right.
*  The the actuarial costs, the expected cost to the insurance company is ten dollars.
*  And I might be willing to pay eleven dollars to avoid that risk.
*  And so even if everyone were willing to do that, so that everyone gets
*  gains from buying from buying insurance at a price that allows
*  the insurance company to break even or even make a tiny bit of money.
*  And yet that market may not exist.
*  That's what's so, you know, both frustrating and intriguing about insurance markets.
*  Yeah. And it's worth emphasizing.
*  You said it several times, but I just want to emphasize it
*  so that no one misses it, that the idea of insurance by itself is not a scam.
*  It is, you know, it is true that the insurance company is going to make money.
*  If everything goes well, you will be spending more money than you get back on average.
*  But it's worth it because of this lower risk, higher certainty,
*  the peace of mind you get along the way.
*  Yes, to most people, I mean, there are some people, you know,
*  the skydivers and bungee jumpers among us who may love risk and not.
*  But I think, you know, so I'm not saying that it's irrational for everyone
*  to not buy insurance at a fair price, but most people value it.
*  And yes, this is what you know, this is how markets work.
*  When when I, you know, value the car more than it costs Volkswagen to make it,
*  then that's what we call gains from trade.
*  And, you know, you can argue about how to split the surplus, you know,
*  should they make no profits, a tiny bit a lot, you know.
*  But but that's it. That's a good thing.
*  That's the economy functioning.
*  And what's what's amazing about insurance markets is there can be that
*  that surplus on the table.
*  And yet the market doesn't function or, you know, for people who, you know, insurers,
*  I think, have a bit of a bad rap and for sometimes with reason.
*  You know, one of the things is that, you know, listeners may think, oh, come on.
*  But insurance is priced exorbitantly.
*  It's not it's not just priced, you know, in my example, like, oh,
*  I have an expected loss of of $10, you know, this one in ten chance of losing
*  $100. And so fine.
*  Maybe I'd be willing to pay $11.
*  They're charging me they're charging a price of $50.
*  Right. And that is empirically correct.
*  So if we talk in the book, for example, if you look at the market for pet
*  health insurance, which has been growing over the last couple of decades,
*  the prices really are exorbitant relative to the risk.
*  So, for example, a 12 year old bulldog,
*  if you want to insure him, the annual premium is four thousand three hundred dollars.
*  And here's the kicker.
*  The maximum payout is five thousand dollars.
*  So that that is a very, very high price.
*  But one of the reasons the price is so high
*  is because the people who are insuring their 12 year old bulldogs
*  are the people who know not only that Rover, you know, is going to about
*  to need a lot of medical care, but that they're the type of owner who,
*  if Rover does need that medical care, are not going to, you know,
*  give him some pain relief and sadly say goodbye.
*  They're going to, you know, do the high tech invasive surgery on their 12 year old dog.
*  And so one of the reasons insurance
*  looks so bad and gets such a bad rap is because it often is high priced
*  and also limited in all kinds of annoying ways, you know, with waiting periods
*  and deductibles. But that's there precisely because of the selection problem.
*  It's the insurers trying to figure out how they can, you know,
*  ensure this risk that is so adversely selected.
*  Yeah. And the example of pet insurance
*  prefigures something I want to get to later, but it's not just pets.
*  We have this difference of strategy, but it's ourselves. Right.
*  You know, the topic of insurance brings up
*  injury and sickness and death and a lot of bad things that can happen to us.
*  And different among us are willing to fight and fight to stave off death
*  as long as possible.
*  And that might affect how much we're willing to pay for the medical care
*  and therefore the insurance. Totally.
*  And so the this this selection thing about the spiral
*  where you only get to the the the worst customers who want to pay for your
*  product, that it has a crucially interesting connection
*  to the information that different people have. Right.
*  It's an example where the people who want to buy your insurance
*  know they're in trouble.
*  They know they're going to get divorced and therefore they're buying it.
*  And presumably the insurance company doesn't know that.
*  Yes. And and you've hit on, I think, one of the one of the really
*  puzzling aspects of this whole problem that we spend some time
*  grappling with in the book, which is how can it be that,
*  you know, you have on the one hand, these massive insurers who face major,
*  you know, financial incentives to figure out just how risky their customers are
*  and price it accordingly. They have, you know, mounds of data.
*  They have, you know, sophisticated actuaries
*  and actuarial scientists and their data algorithms.
*  You know, in the world of big data today, how is it possible that,
*  you know, there are things that people know about themselves,
*  that the insurance company doesn't know?
*  So we talk about this in the book.
*  We give some anecdotes, which I'm happy to share to illustrate.
*  We also provide some of the empirical evidence.
*  In some case, clever researchers have been able to document
*  specific forms of this private information, such as, you know,
*  knowing, for example, whether, you know, if you have a parent
*  with the genetic disease for Huntington's Korea, there's evidence.
*  So you have a 50-50 chance of having it yourself.
*  It's a dominant gene.
*  There's evidence that people at risk for Huntington's Korea
*  have much higher rates of purchasing nursing home insurance
*  than people who don't have that gene, the risk of the gene.
*  And then even among the people at risk, once they do the genetic tests,
*  the people who test positive tend to buy the insurance at higher rates
*  than the people who don't test.
*  So in some cases, we've been able to pinpoint the source of it.
*  In other cases, it's genuinely surprising.
*  In the case of life insurance, for example, an economist named Dai Fing He
*  has documented that if you look at people
*  who look the same on every possible dimension of their health
*  and their family history that you can think of and look at who buys life
*  insurance and who doesn't and then follow them prospectively over time,
*  the people who buy life insurance are more likely to die in the next 10 years.
*  And so we don't you know, when we try to think, what is it that the life insurer
*  isn't, you know, figuring out, well, do they not know your, you know, your health?
*  No, they actually come into a medical exam.
*  Do they not know your family medical history?
*  Nope, they ask about that.
*  Maybe it's your lifestyle choices.
*  Don't they ask about your smoking and your skydiving
*  and whether you travel to dangerous places.
*  So there are cases where we don't know what it is, but the data are very clear
*  that there is something that people know above and beyond
*  what the insurance company is able to figure out about them.
*  So so the idea that, you know, oh, in the world of big data,
*  we'll somehow get rid of this selection problem because Big Brother
*  will know everything about us.
*  Turns out not not quite everything.
*  Is there any chance that the causal flow is that buying health insurance
*  or life insurance makes you die earlier?
*  So, yeah, so this is this is a one of the central
*  empirical challenges to researchers in this area.
*  The problem we've been talking about is one of selection
*  that people who
*  that people who are higher risk are more likely to buy the insurance
*  in the first place.
*  The the other possibility that you refer to is known as moral hazard.
*  It's the idea that even if identical people
*  and there are a bunch of people who all are the same risk
*  and then we just randomly give some of them automobile insurance
*  and other people not the people who have the insurance will now,
*  you know, put their foot on the gas pedal a little more
*  and drive a little less carefully.
*  In health insurance, there's a there's a huge body of evidence,
*  some of which I've contributed to documenting precisely this phenomenon
*  that once people get health insurance, including randomly assigned
*  health insurance, we did a randomized evaluation of this in the state of Oregon.
*  People take a group of people and you randomly give half of them
*  insurance and Medicaid and half of them remain uninsured.
*  So they're on average, those two groups are the same in terms of their health.
*  They're propensity to use the doctor, but the ones who get insurance
*  do, in fact, then go to the doctor more.
*  So moral hazard is alive and well.
*  But we also know that there's selection.
*  And one of the ways you can see this is imagine now
*  you randomize not whether you have insurance,
*  but you randomize this is other work we've done,
*  effectively randomize the price at which people are offered insurance.
*  So a higher price or a low price, lower price.
*  One of the things you see in the data is you can then look at the people
*  who choose to buy insurance at the higher price and the lower price.
*  So everyone has insurance.
*  So any effects of insurance making me more likely to go to the doctor.
*  That's the same.
*  What's different between the two groups is one consists of a group of people
*  who are willing to buy health insurance at a low price.
*  The other consists of a group of people who are willing to buy it
*  not only at a low price, but also at a higher price.
*  There's fewer of them, right, because we know people don't like high prices.
*  But you see the set of people who are willing to buy when the price is higher
*  have much higher health care utilization after the fact than the people
*  who bought when the price was lower.
*  So raising the price gets you a risky set of customers.
*  Again, you're comparing two groups of people, both of whom have insurance.
*  So that behavioral effect of the insurance, you know, on your health care
*  use is operating for both of them.
*  But one, the group that was willing to buy at an even higher price
*  has even more health care use coming from the fact that they're only willing to buy
*  it because they expected to have higher use.
*  This is I mean, you're bringing up the fact that this is a nice case where
*  interests align, arguably, right?
*  I mean, the insurance company wants you to be healthy
*  and not use the doctor a lot.
*  And so maybe their best interests are served by encouraging you to adopt healthy behaviors.
*  So this is this is a great segue to another example we talk about in the book
*  that also gets into this.
*  Is it about selecting the customers or changing their behavior?
*  So something something that we've observed many times in the world,
*  perhaps some of the listeners have actually experienced this, is that some health
*  insurance companies will offer discounts for a gym membership,
*  bundle that along with their health insurance.
*  And you might think going back to your, you know, oh, incentives are aligned point
*  that that's because it's great for the health insurer.
*  If you go to the gym and stay, get healthier, just like it's good for you, too.
*  But the data show that that's not what's going on.
*  So there's fascinating work by the researchers Cooper and Trivedi, who show that
*  if you if when insurers start offering these discounted
*  gym memberships bundled with the health insurance product, they attract
*  customers who are already healthier.
*  You can measure their health before they buy the insurance.
*  Moreover, there's other excellent work done by three economists,
*  Damon Jones, David Molitor and Julian Reif,
*  in which they actually ran a randomized control trial of offering
*  employees a workness wellness program at their university,
*  at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
*  And what they found by comparing, you know, people offered the workplace
*  wellness program than people who weren't is that didn't make you any healthier,
*  didn't make you any more productive.
*  All the things that, you know,
*  you know, employers or workplace wellness aficionados will tout.
*  But they also found that there's a reason that employers still offer it,
*  which is the types of employees who like to sign up for workplace
*  wellness programs are healthier at baseline.
*  Right. It's the same reason that Cooper and Trivedi find that health insurers
*  offer gym memberships.
*  It's because they want to attract the healthy customers, at least
*  the relatively more healthy and fit among us can at least dilute ourselves
*  into thinking we're really going to use that gym membership.
*  But it turns out it doesn't actually make you healthier.
*  It just gets you healthier customers. Right.
*  So even if I'm not the kind of person who literally goes to the gym
*  by the fact that I would want to be a member of the gym,
*  this I'm talking about friends of mine, not myself, but
*  that's a hint that correlates with other healthy behaviors.
*  And so I want those people in my insurance. Exactly. Exactly.
*  This is very complicated.
*  This is why physicists would not be very good at it.
*  Physicists are much better at simple things.
*  And there's a lot of a lot of confounding variables coming in here.
*  But let me back up again to, you know, once again, sort of
*  understand what's going on with the idea of insurance
*  and how it feeds into the aspects of it we just mentioned.
*  The idea is to spread risk. Right.
*  I mean, when you when you buy the insurance,
*  presumably you're not buying it from your friend.
*  You're buying it from a much larger company who can live through
*  the fluctuations up and down.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  Again, the idea is you take, you know, a hundred people or a million people,
*  each of whom has, you know, a one in ten chance of losing that hundred dollars.
*  And you spread that risk around only on the law of large numbers will work on average.
*  You know, yeah, one in ten of us will lose that hundred dollars.
*  But if we all pull together, then, you know, not all of us will lose it.
*  And if we all give a little bit of money that can cover the losses
*  for the few, the one in ten who do lose it.
*  So it's exactly this sort of collect, you know, sort of
*  making it a communal, smoothing the risk or spreading the risk,
*  as you nicely said, across the community.
*  Am I misremembering or was I misinformed that there were companies in,
*  you know, the stock market crashes or financial crisis that had insured themselves,
*  which is sort of almost a contradiction in terms.
*  Yeah. So there is something called reinsurance, which which is somewhat bizarre
*  at first glance and maybe even at second glance, which is insurers in turn reinsure their risk.
*  Sometimes the reasons are because, you know, there is some risk of a correlated shock.
*  So the example I gave with, you know, the 10 percent chance of losing a hundred dollars,
*  where it's just, you know, totally each person has a one in ten, you know,
*  ten sided coin flip chance, ten sided die roll, what have you.
*  In that case, it's going to be very unlikely with a large enough pool that, say,
*  everyone gets wiped out.
*  But on the other hand, if you're saying insurer who's insuring against natural disasters,
*  floods, et cetera, and you're sort of geographically concentrated in, say, Florida or California,
*  some years you may have no costs and some years you may have, you know,
*  80 percent of your customers have a claim.
*  And so then in some sense, you may want to lay off some of that risk to a larger pool that's more
*  diversified across either other types of insurance or geographically or has a larger
*  capital stock and can bear that risk.
*  And so it's clear why as the seller of insurance, as the insurance company,
*  we really do want to have a good statistical grasp on what the pool is that we're selling to,
*  what the risks are, et cetera.
*  I mean, how much like super fancy math goes into that?
*  Is there a lot of power laws and long tails and heavy duty statistical techniques here?
*  Or is it more or less just don't make the mistakes that I've been how you make and you'll be fine?
*  I think it's both.
*  I think, you know, for right, low probability, right tail events, this came up a lot, you know,
*  with terrorism insurance after 9-11.
*  And, you know, there's also the sort of weird, it was some of these things where there's
*  uncertainty about the risk.
*  You know, we know a lot about mortality risk.
*  We know a lot less about, say, terrorism risk.
*  And therefore, if an event occurs, you know, you as the insurer or the public would update
*  your probabilities of a future event occurring.
*  So some of that actuarial science can, some of it's quite straightforward.
*  And, you know, the pricing, you know, mortality tables at this point we've been doing for a while.
*  Some is much more complicated.
*  But all of it, then it's not enough to get the actuarial science, right?
*  You then have to think about who's going to be buying that product and how might they
*  differ from the typical population on which, you know, you've calculated those probabilities.
*  So clearly, as I said, the insurance company is going to want to know its customers as well
*  as it can.
*  And you already mentioned this or alluded to this, but are there any circumstances in
*  which the insurance companies know more than their customers about their customers' own risks?
*  That's a really great question.
*  I think, I think when it comes, I don't know for sure, but we've thought about this a lot.
*  And the way we think about it is it's not a less versus more thing.
*  That at some level, of course, you know, a life science actuary is going to have a much,
*  you know, more precise prediction of my mortality than I am.
*  I mean, just even if I, you know, looking up a life table for someone of my age and gender
*  and maybe a few other characteristics would probably do better than I could do off the
*  top of my head.
*  So in that sense, you could say, yeah, the insurance company or the actuary, quote,
*  unquote, knows more.
*  On the other hand, the way my informational advantage comes in is whatever the insurer
*  knows, they use to offer the insurance and they say, okay, here's the price at which
*  I'm going to offer insurance to, you know, middle-aged female economists, you know, with
*  a great sense of humor and two bratty kids or what have you, right?
*  And then, and then, but then I, and so I would not have known how to price that.
*  But then once they give me the price, I know that among that group of, you know, middle-aged
*  female economists with great senses of humor, I know something about whether I'm more or
*  less risky than the typical.
*  So that's where my informational advantage comes in.
*  It's not like if we had a competition of who could, you know, get the actuarial tables
*  right that I do better than they would.
*  It is like what they kind of move first and then I get to react.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, good.
*  And so, I mean, maybe we should think about the obligations of the person to reveal some
*  of these things, right?
*  Or maybe the obligations go both ways.
*  My understanding is that if the insurance company asks you about your medical status,
*  you have to be honest with them.
*  You can't lie, but you don't need to volunteer things that they don't ask you.
*  Is that roughly the idea?
*  That's correct.
*  And just to be clear, you could lie.
*  I wouldn't advise it because, right, it's very expensive to verify all this information.
*  And so my understanding is, for example, with life insurance, they don't, well, they do
*  do a medical exam, but for many things, they will take your self-reported word for it.
*  But then if you actually have a claim, then they'll investigate.
*  And so it's a very, very bad idea to try and shade the truth because you'll end up paying
*  all these premiums.
*  And then if in the event that you actually need the insurance, then you could be denied.
*  But yeah, I think, you know, I guess, you know, even if you, yeah, I don't know why
*  you would have, I mean, as an ethical matter, I don't know why it's my responsibility to
*  tell someone, you know, more about my risk than they ask.
*  I need to be truthful.
*  But again, and as you were talking about earlier, it's privately rational for us all
*  to do that.
*  It just messes things up in aggregate.
*  So one of the examples we give in the book, you know, is with auto insurance.
*  Now, you know, the saying is, you know, 90% of people think they're above average drivers.
*  Well, I'm one of the 10% who know I'm a below average driver.
*  But when I first got a car, which was in my late 20s in graduate school, and I needed
*  to get automobile insurance, I didn't think it was my job to tell them that.
*  I answered all their questions truthfully.
*  They asked a bunch of questions like, you know, the make and model of my car.
*  And then they asked how long I'd had my license and whether I had any accidents or speeding
*  tickets.
*  And the truthful answer was that I had had my license for 10 years and I had an absolutely
*  spotless driving record.
*  So what the insurance company didn't know that I knew and anyone who spent any time
*  in a car with me would quickly learn is that I'm a terrible driver.
*  And the reason I had a spotless driving record is because I never drove.
*  Right.
*  So I had gotten my license as a 17 year old growing up in Manhattan because my mom told
*  me I really should get it.
*  It would be useful to have the ID on the driver's license.
*  I got the license and I never drove.
*  So I answered every question truthfully.
*  They just, you know, that it was just something about me that was kind of idiosyncratic that
*  they didn't know.
*  Yes, but they do know that you live in Massachusetts.
*  So I bet that they assume that you're a below average driver just on the basis of that data.
*  Exactly.
*  But I knew I was a below average driver, even among Massachusetts drivers.
*  And that's exactly my point.
*  They probably knew much better than me what the empirical rate of accidents are in Massachusetts.
*  But I knew mine would be higher.
*  And speaking of the ethical obligations, so those are the ethical obligations of the
*  insured.
*  For the insurers, how much are they allowed to just discriminate?
*  To just say, well, look, I know that you're a very, very risky group.
*  So your premiums are much higher.
*  That's good business sense.
*  How legal is it?
*  So that's a really good question.
*  Again, with the caveat that I am not a legal expert, our understanding, and we talk about
*  this in the book, is that what insurers are allowed to price on varies a lot, both state
*  to state and also insurance to insurance.
*  Some insurance are more heavily regulated than others.
*  The thing that we talk about a lot in the book is not the legal matters, but not even
*  really the ethical matters, although we try and talk about that a bit, but more just from
*  an economic perspective, what are the consequences of saying, no, you can't price health insurance
*  on the basis of pre-existing conditions.
*  So let's take that as an example.
*  Now, on the one hand, we totally understand where this comes from, that it seems unjust
*  or unfair that people who are unfortunate enough to have some chronic health condition,
*  in addition, they have to pay more for their health insurance.
*  On the other hand, what we have seen happen, and we talk about this as well in the book,
*  is that when states come in, for example, New York and New Jersey did this in the 1990s,
*  and in the private health insurance markets, the ones that aren't through your employer,
*  they said, basically, yeah, we don't think it's fair, and you can't price health insurance
*  differently for people based on their pre-existing conditions.
*  You actually can't charge higher prices based on anything.
*  You have to offer the same price, it's called a community rate, to everyone in the community,
*  and you have to, it's so-called guaranteed issue.
*  You also have to sell to everyone who wants the insurance.
*  You can't say, well, here's the price, but only for you, Sean, and not for you, Amy.
*  We don't have insurance for you.
*  Well, this guaranteed issue is guaranteed to create issues, and what we saw happen there
*  is exactly what you'd expect.
*  If everyone has to be charged the same price and offered insurance, then on average, the
*  people who buy the insurance are the older, sicker individuals.
*  That drives up the price of that insurance, because insurance companies have to be getting
*  in enough to cover their claims.
*  That drives the healthiest of those older, sicker individuals out of the market and drives
*  risk up more and the price up more.
*  In the case of New York and New Jersey, it drove the market completely out of existence.
*  So yes, it was fairer.
*  No one was being treated differently, but everyone was in the same poor situation of
*  having no access to this health insurance product.
*  Because economists always love, on the one hand, on the other hand, let me also give
*  you the other hand, which is if it sounds if you're trying to deal with problems of
*  private information and selection, from a pure economics point of view, it can sound nutty
*  to say we're going to restrict what the insurance company can use in pricing.
*  That's like creating private information for the customer.
*  On the other hand, if what you want is not insurance for my claims this year, given that
*  I'm a relatively unhealthy individual, but I want insurance against being an unhealthy
*  individual, right, sort of behind the rolls and veil of ignorance, then it makes perfect
*  sense to have community rating, charge everyone the same, because that's to reflect the fact
*  that if we charge higher premiums to people who are higher cost, to people who are worse
*  drivers or less healthy, then we lose the insurance or the potential for insurance against
*  the possibility of being unlucky enough, such as myself, to have been born a terrible driver
*  or someone who's born with a genetic disease or a predisposition to certain chronic conditions.
*  And that's one of the reasons you can think that the government may get involved to say, look,
*  we don't know how to, or I'm not a philosopher, but I don't think we know how to literally buy
*  insurance behind the veil of ignorance, you know, in utero, as it were. But that's actually a role
*  that the government can play. Good. So that's the perfect place to get into that. So just to
*  summarize, we could imagine letting the insurers use all the information they have and discriminate
*  as much as they want, but that seems a little unfair to people who need the insurance products
*  the most are being charged, or the least able to afford it are being charged the most. So we could
*  try to make it fair by insisting that everyone be charged the same, but then we have the selection
*  effect where only the riskiest people are buying it. So the next obvious twist to put on it is to
*  say, now everyone has to buy insurance, right? Correct. So rather than just require that the
*  insurers offer it to everyone at the same price, right, which gets you your guaranteed issues,
*  you can instead also insist that everyone buy it at that price. So whether that's, you know,
*  the government providing it directly, or as in the case of automobile insurance, and most recently,
*  health insurance mandating that everyone provide it. And that's why going back to the Scalia
*  question about, can you force everyone to eat their broccoli if you can force them to buy health
*  insurance? Those are two very different situations. But one thing I learned or relearned, I should say,
*  from watching the experience of the health insurance mandates play out is both that the
*  economic theory really does apply in practice, but also, perhaps not surprisingly, it is true that
*  the real world is more complicated than what's dreamed of in our philosophy. And so what we saw,
*  so I think two main lessons came out of thinking about these mandates. So the first is, you know,
*  the textbook model is that mandates are a way to solve the selection problem, because if everyone
*  has to have insurance, then by definition, there's no selection, everyone's in, you've got your
*  random or representative pool. What I hadn't really thought about till that we I watched this play
*  out in practice is, again, to use the broccoli analogy, anyone who has, you know, young children
*  knows that saying you must eat your broccoli to your toddler doesn't make it so. And similarly,
*  saying that people must have health insurance mandating it also, it turns out doesn't make it
*  show. So and what turns out to matter a lot, and there's evidence of this from Massachusetts,
*  is what kinds of penalties are put in place for people who don't buy insurance. And when those
*  penalties are in place, you see that that's much more effective at getting the healthy customers
*  into the market than simply saying, you must buy insurance. So you know, there's the old Robin
*  Williams joke about the cops in England, who the Bobbies, as they're called, who don't they don't
*  carry guns. And so he deadpans, what do they do when they're arresting a criminal, they yell,
*  they shout, stop, or all say stop again, right? You know, like, it's not that effective. And
*  similarly, saying you must have health insurance without putting some teeth behind that is similarly
*  not as effective. So again, it's not just enough to to mandate it, you have to enforce the mandate,
*  which may sound obvious, but to get quickly back to the types of issues that, you know, we were
*  saying what's what is and isn't what is or isn't fair. One way to enforce a mandate is to find
*  people for not complying. The other way instead of the stick is the carrot, it's to subsidize
*  people for complying. And that's a lot of what we've done effectively under the Affordable Care Act
*  is, especially for lower income individuals offer subsidies for people to buy health insurance.
*  One of the things economists have pointed out, which is true, but also you can see why it would
*  be unpopular is if you're trying to design those selections, excuse me, if you're trying to design
*  those subsidies to deal with the selection problem, the people that you should be subsidizing are the
*  people who in some sense, you feel like might need the subsidies the least, right? It's not the old
*  sick people, you want to subsidize the young healthy people. That's actually how you'd solve
*  the selection problem. Not clear that's going to fly, you know, pass the sniff test with Joe Public.
*  Well, Joe Public does get in the way a lot. But Joe Public also, you know, there's a folk wisdom
*  there. I mean, one of the off putting aspects of the Affordable Care Act, even though I thought
*  it was a great step forward myself was, oh my goodness, there were a lot of complications
*  and bureaucracy and paperwork and that is both intrinsically off putting but it also
*  just opens up new venues for malfeasance, right? I mean, you mentioned in the book about what a huge
*  amount is spent on lobbying the government by insurance companies and people in that sector.
*  And this is part of the reason why, right? When there's a lot of rules, there are a lot of loopholes.
*  Absolutely. This is another thing we talk about in the book that because
*  sometimes the selection problem, when the government gets in and tries to fix things,
*  the selection problem can cease being a game between the customer and the insurer and can
*  become a game between the government and the insurer in which and then the government is
*  often on the losing side of this. So, right again, imagine, so one example that we discuss in the book
*  is the public Medicare program, which provides health insurance to individuals 65 and over
*  automatically through the tax system. There's an option instead that was created in the 80s
*  and has become much bigger in recent decades to try to allow people more choice in the type of
*  health insurance they have and to also allow the private market to maybe reap some of its
*  potential efficiencies, which is you can let private insurers offer Medicare and people may
*  prefer the product that they're offering. It has to meet some minimum requirements that the regular
*  Medicare program, but then they can also provide additional benefits. And some people really,
*  and then the idea is that the government, instead of paying for your Medicare, pays the private
*  insurer to insure you instead. So in other words, rather than the government bearing all of our
*  medical costs, it sells some of our risk to a private company who thinks they can manage your
*  risk better. So that sounds perfectly fine. Until then you have to think about, well, how much should
*  the government pay a private insurer to take a Medicare customer off its hands if the customer
*  wants to go to that insurer? And what the government would like to do is pay them
*  what they would have spent to cover this person with Medicare, or maybe even a little less if
*  the government wants to save money. Okay, so it sets a price. It says, look, older people are more
*  expensive. Maybe women are more expensive than men. And then guess what? That the private health
*  insurer is going to want to find the healthiest people by age and gender. And they may do it
*  by offering, in fact, they do it by offering things like gym memberships and other strategies
*  like that. And so then the government, you know, we talk about this in the game, we talk about it
*  as sort of a game of whack-a-mole. Well, the government got smart to that and started collecting
*  data on your past medical claims, because that's, you know, it's one thing that's going to predict
*  your future medical claims is your past one. If I've been to the doctor and hospital a lot over
*  the last year, I'm likely to be high cost this coming year. So they start pricing then on
*  additional things. And that can, you know, help solve the problem, help with the problem, but it
*  doesn't, it doesn't solve it entirely. And, you know, round and round you go with the insurer
*  always kind of staying one one step ahead of the government, right? Whenever the government does,
*  the insurer then spends some time trying to think about, you know, how it can, as we say, cream skim
*  the best customers. Do other countries have to put up with all this? We've been talking about the
*  United States, we both live there, but we have international listeners here on Mindscape. Is this
*  just a global phenomenon that is a result of the structure of insurance and markets, or is the
*  United States a special outlier? So selection is a global problem that's a function of markets, and
*  not only insurance markets, although it's one of the biggest examples, and we try and convince our
*  readers, one of the more interesting ones, you know, selection markets can occur whenever the
*  different customers are going to impose different costs on the seller and the customer knows
*  something that the seller doesn't. So we give examples in the book of saying all you can eat
*  restaurant or in or education loans that people have universities have tried to offer in which
*  their so-called income sharing agreements in which the amount you have to pay back depends on
*  how much you make after college. And what you see, and the economists Nathan Hendren and Daniel
*  Herbst have shown this very nicely, is that even when you look at what college people are going to
*  and what their major is, people still have private information about how much they're going to make
*  after college, and guess who wants to buy the income sharing agreement, the ones who aren't
*  going to make very much. So it's a pervasive problem that's not about the country or even
*  the particular market. That being said, although this is probably more a topic for a different
*  podcast, it's also the subject of our next book, in the particulars of health insurance, the way
*  the United States has tried to deal with this problem is unique, and we have come to conclude
*  uniquely problematic relative to how other high-income countries have tried to deal with
*  this. Yeah, that's a topic for other podcasts, but an extremely believable claim given our
*  empirical information. But with all that in mind that we've been exploring here,
*  is there, this is probably an unfair question, is there a simple set of things that we should
*  obviously be doing better here in the United States or the world than we are doing?
*  We being the government or the customer? Society.
*  I'm sorry? Society, the whole, the totality, the system.
*  So I would say for society, no. I think one of the messages of our book, which may make it
*  not a popular soundbite on late night TV, but is an important message is there aren't facile
*  solutions. There really are trade-offs. Take even the case of mandates that we've talked about
*  already and think about perfect enforcement of the mandate so we don't have to deal with that issue.
*  There's still the question of what, how much insurance should the government mandate? And
*  you see, for example, in automobile insurance, the minimum requirements are very drastically
*  across states. Now, if you mandate a very, very low amount of insurance coverage and most people
*  want more than that, you're just kind of recreating the selection problem. But now it's on the margin
*  of how much insurance you buy rather than whether you buy it at all. On the other hand, if you set
*  very high minimum requirements, as some states do, then you have the problem that maybe not everyone
*  actually wants that amount of insurance. So really, these are not issues that are
*  straightforward. Another example that I think is kind of an interesting and important one is
*  the problem with selection and with insurance markets is that people don't have choice of the
*  products that we think they should have available to them. And yet one of the ways we deal with that
*  problem is to try to restrict people's choices. So we give the example in the book, there was a
*  sort of scathing New York Times expose that got our blood boiling, where it talked about a very
*  unfortunate case of a man who, when he was 65 and getting onto Medicare at first, was quite healthy
*  and therefore was attracted to those gym memberships in the private plans and got one. And then,
*  unfortunately, about seven years later, got quite ill and wanted access to additional physicians and
*  other things that his plan didn't cover and tried to go back to the regular public Medicare program
*  and buy a supplemental private policy to cover some of the gaps. And he couldn't, like no one
*  would sell him one. And the reason was because when you're 65, the regulation says that, again,
*  you have to offer these plans to everyone, but the insurer, but then afterwards you don't. And
*  that's a way of trying to not make the market collapse, have the always guaranteed issue like
*  New York and New Jersey had, but also prevent rampant selection. And so, yes, it was very
*  unfortunate that when he was sick, he could not get a more comprehensive policy, but that's also
*  how you prevent selection from wreaking havoc on a market. If you let people wait till the risk
*  occurs to buy the insurance, then you can destroy the market for everyone.
*  HOFFMAN Is there some argument that the government should just give a basic insurance plan to every
*  person?
*  LESLIE There is. That's the subject of my next book that's coming out this summer with my co-author
*  Laurent Aydin from this one. But spoiler alert, the argument, it turns out, really isn't about
*  selection. As much as we went into it thinking it would be, because that's what we think about,
*  it's a topic for a different day. It's a very different... I'm sorry?
*  HOFFMAN Well, we'll look for that book. That's a very interesting question to think about.
*  So there's two more things to get to before we end. One is, we were just hinting at it with the
*  example you gave of the older gentleman trying to get insurance. We're not very good as a society,
*  or maybe even as a species, in planning for our last days, right? We don't want to die,
*  most of us. We're willing to spend the money we have to do it. I mean, there seems to me,
*  as someone who's not there yet, but eventually will be, that we have a system in the United States
*  where there are ways that all of your wealth disappears when you get old and sick, because
*  you're willing to spend as much as you can to stay alive, and hospitals and doctors and insurers are
*  willing to take it. And we haven't quite figured out how to deal with that.
*  LESLIE Yes. And without denying that that is a real problem, let me give you, though,
*  a counterpoint, which is some work I've done also with Laurent Aynon, who's my co-author on this
*  book, as well as some other economists, which is to try to look into this concern that comes up
*  a lot about all the healthcare spending that occurs at the end of life. So the fact that
*  you might have heard that's often quoted is that a quarter of all medical spending on the elderly
*  occurs in the last 12 months of life. And it turns out that is actually true. So the first thing,
*  whenever I hear something a lot that sounds inflammatory, I wonder if it's true. We've
*  checked, and that is a true fact. But the next thing is, if we ask, well, there's two reasons
*  for that. One is because you spend more when you get sick, and people who are sick have higher
*  death rates. They're more likely to die. The other is, and that just seems plausible. Of course,
*  we spend more healthcare money on sick people than healthy people. But what's behind the concern
*  about that fact is the assumption, or sometimes assertion, that we're spending money on people
*  who we know are about to die. So they're in intensive care, bedridden, hooked up to many
*  machines, and clearly going to die. It's only a question of is it today or next week or next month,
*  and we're spending all this money to keep people alive for a few more days. It turns out if you
*  look in the data and you use fairly sophisticated machine learning techniques and all their past
*  health records to predict their mortality, it's very, very hard to know at the time that most of
*  this medical care is occurring that people have a very, very high mortality. So in other words,
*  even if you look, and we did this among people who have been diagnosed with cancer and are at
*  a fairly late stage of cancer, even look at 80-year-olds with cancer, there's not many of
*  them who at the time they're getting their medical treatment have a 70% plus annual mortality rate.
*  So it's just very, very hard to identify a group of people that we're spending a lot of money on
*  who are actually going to die with 90-95% probability. So yes, death probabilities are
*  elevated among the sick, and yes, we spend a lot of money on the sick, but we're not spending money
*  on people that we, on a large group of people who we quote unquote know with high probability
*  are going to die. The example I always think of in trying to explain this, which obviously is a
*  little silly, but I think kind of drives home the point, is when my kids were learning to ski and
*  they went to ski school, one of the things the ski instructor always would say is you really need to
*  be careful towards, because most ski accidents occur on the last run of the day, to which I
*  thought, well, of course they do, because once you have an accident, you stop skiing. So again,
*  that doesn't mean that your probability of a ski accident is necessarily higher at four o'clock.
*  Well, that's actually very, very helpful data or information. It's visually or viscerally,
*  I suppose I should say, a very different idea to think that someone has a 95% mortality rate,
*  and we're spending millions of dollars versus someone even with a 50% mortality rate.
*  Exactly. I mean, that's a high rate, but that's not dying for sure.
*  I'm going to keep fighting if I have 50-50 odds, right? Yeah, that's especially if I could
*  maybe live for another 10 years. That's an enormous amount of time. Okay.
*  Exactly.
*  These problems are hard. Again, I really should go into physics instead. Physics is so much easier
*  and less emotionally taxing. But speaking of physics, in the very broadest sense,
*  the other question I want to bring up before we go is you've alluded a couple of times
*  to asking these questions, which are not only intellectually interesting, but morally and
*  politically charged, and collecting data to see what the answers are, because the answers aren't
*  always what we might guess or what our theories would predict. And apparently, this is not always
*  the way that people reach their conclusions. You've given talks, you've written about the
*  need for more empirical testing and the difficulty of empirical studies within economics.
*  Yes, I think one way to think about it is we all have our hypotheses, our prior beliefs,
*  sometimes even our hope as to what would be the effect of a policy. But it's incredibly important
*  when we're doing academic research or when the public is trying to find out what the effect of
*  a policy is from that research, that we take great care to make sure that we are getting cause and
*  effect and not spurious correlation. And so there's been a real revolution, I would say,
*  in empirical work. My colleague, Josh Angeris, who won the Nobel Prize a couple of years ago
*  for some of this work, refers to it as the credibility revolution in trying to make sure
*  that we're isolating causal effects. And one of the most valuable tools in the work I do,
*  which is mostly in health economics, for doing that, something that, to my other colleagues who
*  also won the Nobel Prize, it can be hard on the ego hanging out here, but who won the Nobel Prize
*  in development economics for popularizing this approach for policies designed to try and reduce
*  global poverty, but it applies more broadly to any policy, is the randomized experiment.
*  To literally do what we do in medicine all the time, if you want to know if a drug worked,
*  we run a randomized trial and we look at what the effect is of giving the drug to one group and not
*  to another. One can do the same thing with any policy question I mentioned earlier. We did this
*  with the case of what is the effect of covering low-income, uninsured people with Medicaid.
*  You can do a randomized trial. This was done in the state of Oregon in 2008. Kate Baker and I
*  studied it in which the state randomly allocated Medicaid to some low-income, uninsured adults and
*  not to others. And then you can see what happens. And I think it's incredibly important, whatever
*  you, your theories or your biases or your hypotheses or your hopes are to look at the data
*  and learn from it. One of the things many people had claimed was if we expand Medicaid health
*  insurance to previously uninsured individuals, we'll get these individuals out of the emergency
*  room where they have to be by law be treated and into cheaper and more effective primary and
*  preventive care. And what we saw from this randomized control trial is that yes, covering
*  the low-income, uninsured with Medicaid does get them into more primary and preventive care.
*  And they have more doctor visits, their rates of mammograms go up, their rates of diabetes checks
*  for blood sugar checks for their diabetes go up. And yet they also go to the emergency room more.
*  So as we talked about earlier, health insurance makes medical care cheaper. And one thing that
*  does is get people to use more of it. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, we can have
*  a different discussion about, but you shouldn't be arguing for health insurance expansions on the
*  grounds that it's going to get people out of the emergency room. Is there in economics some kind of
*  active resistance to emphasizing these kinds of empirical results or just a recognition that
*  it's hard to tease out all the causal relationships? It's a good question. I don't know of anyone who's
*  against, I can't think of why anyone would be against causal evidence and causal inference.
*  I think the problem is that often it's really hard. And the challenges come in as, you know,
*  how do you form your most educated guests when you don't have rigorous causal evidence? And there,
*  I think, you know, reasonable people can take different approaches. I think the other thing
*  that's hard is, you know, there are many well-intentioned people in the world outside
*  of economics who want, who hope for the best, who hope that, you know, expanding health insurance
*  can be an easy decision because it'll not only improve people's lives, but save us money.
*  And, you know, having to tell people that actually, no, there's no free lunch, we face
*  real trade-offs, and it may well be worth it to spend that money, but it's not going to be free.
*  I think there's a lot of resistance in that sense as well from well-intentioned people, but who wish,
*  you know, that we didn't face as hard choices as we sometimes do face.
*  Okay. For the very, very final question then, to give the audience a tangible take-home message,
*  given that you're the world's expert in all this stuff, what kind of insurance do you have
*  that would be different than anybody else's? Like, does this actually make you change your mind about,
*  you know, the annual enrollment at MIT when you're given your options for life insurance
*  and health insurance and dental insurance? Well, I will say that one thing it really
*  prompted me to do is to try, when we bought our first home, to get a homeowner's insurance policy
*  with as high a deductible as possible. The reason being, you know, home insurance,
*  as with most risks, is most valuable for the catastrophic risk. You know, your home burns down
*  or a large section of it is destroyed. That's a real financial shock. And yet, you know,
*  despite the rather high price of homes in the Boston area, a lot of the homeowners' policies,
*  have a $500 deductible, a $1,000 deductible. I mean, that's real money, but it's kind of trivial
*  compared to the cost of a home. And so I searched high and low for a homeowner's policy with the
*  largest homeowners' deductible that I could find, a $10,000 deductible, because the premium was a
*  lot lower. And I would argue, based on the type of research I do, that the reason the premium was a
*  lot lower is because people who know that there's a lot of problems with their home and they're
*  going to have a lot of claims want a low deductible. Now, going back to supposedly being an
*  insurance expert, I will say that shortly after we bought this enormous deductible relative to what
*  you could find policy, there was the winter of 2015 where, if you spent any time in Massachusetts,
*  there was massive amounts of snow. It was declared a federal disaster area. Everyone had leaks,
*  etc. As did everyone, we had to get contractors in to repair the damages, and we blew well past
*  our $10,000 deductible. The next year, we had a flood in our basement, blew past the deductible
*  again. And it did cause my long-suffering husband to observe that it could be quite costly to be
*  married to an insurance expert. But actually, he will admit that if you look over all the years
*  we've had the policy, even with those two big losses, the lower premiums we were paying every
*  year on the high deductible policy have in the end paid off. You got to do that. I once knew a guy who
*  won a lottery ticket, came in with a $200,000 prize. I asked him how often he bought lottery
*  tickets, and it was easy calculation that he was losing money, even if there had been no taxes at
*  all. So, yeah, I know. All right. Good. Both intellectually challenging, socially important,
*  and practically useful information here. So, Amy Finkelstein, thanks so much for being on
*  the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you so much for having me.
