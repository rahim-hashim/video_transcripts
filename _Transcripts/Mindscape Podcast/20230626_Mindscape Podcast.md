Last year's Nobel Prize for experimental tests of Bell's Theorem was the first Nobel in the foundations of quantum mechanics since Max Born in 1954. Quantum foundations is enjoying a bit of a resurgence, inspired in part by improving quantum technology but also by a realization that understanding quantum mechanics might help with other problems in physics (and be important in its own right). Tim Maudlin is a leading philosopher of physics and also a skeptic of the Everett interpretation. We discuss the logic behind hidden-variable approaches such as Bohmian mechanics, and also the broader question of the importance of the foundations of physics.

Tim Maudlin received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh. He is currently a professor of philosophy at New York University. He is a member of the Academie Internationale de Philosophie des Sciences and the Foundational Questions Institute (FQXi). He has been a Guggenheim Fellow. He is the founder and director of the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics in Croatia: https://www.johnbellinstitute.org/

# Mindscape 241 | Tim Maudlin on Locality, Hidden Variables, and Quantum Foundations
**Mindscape Podcast:** [June 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ7h9VALHMU)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Today's podcast is
*  one of those long-awaited episodes. People have been asking for this one for a long time. You know,
*  it's funny. Sometimes there are some possible guests who are just so obviously Mindscape guests,
*  and I haven't had them on yet and people are like, well, what's wrong? Why doesn't he have them on
*  yet? They must be feuding. There must be beef or something like that. That's not usually the
*  correct answer. It's usually just that I like to space them out. As I've said many times,
*  like to have a variety and that includes both people who I know very well and am familiar with
*  their work and the people I've never heard of before I got to looking for podcast guests.
*  So Tim Maldon is someone I've known for a long time, is a leader in the philosophy of physics or
*  what we sometimes call the foundations of physics. So studying not physics as a philosopher,
*  but studying nature as a philosopher, but doing so in such a way that you're looking at the
*  foundational questions of nature. You're asking the why questions, the deep questions. You're
*  trying to be very careful. Tim has done very important work in thinking about space-time and
*  the geometry of space-time, the nature of time and the arrow of time. I will point to, I'll try to
*  link in the show notes to a wonderful mock debate that was done at the Foundational Questions
*  Institute between Tim and Julian Barber. Julian Barber famously has advocated that time does not
*  exist. Tim has famously advocated that not only does time exist, but the arrow of time is
*  fundamental, not just an emergent approximation because of statistical mechanics. What FUXI does
*  is it has the debaters flip sides. So Julian was arguing in favor of the existence of time, Tim
*  was arguing against it and they were both really, really good. I got to say, they were both quite
*  persuasive for the points of view they didn't actually agree with as well as being quite amusing
*  along the way. But today, we're actually going to be talking about quantum mechanics. In some sense,
*  this can be thought of as a sequel to the podcast they did a while back with David Albert talking
*  about quantum mechanics. David and Tim are very good friends and have worked together for a long
*  time. They don't agree on everything because no two philosophers agree on everything, but they
*  are united in their skepticism about the Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics. So with David
*  on the podcast, even though I'm pro Everett, I want to give the voice to sensible voices on the
*  other side, sensible points of view. So David explained why he doesn't like the Everett
*  interpretation. What we didn't get to at a time was what he does like. So today with Tim,
*  we're going to be talking mostly about Bohmian or de Broglie-Bohm versions of quantum mechanics,
*  sometimes called hidden variable versions of quantum mechanics. I keep calling them hidden
*  variable theories as most people do, even though as advocates like to point out, the variables are
*  not hidden. The extra variables that you add to quantum mechanics to make a hidden variable theory
*  are the ones that you observe when you actually make a measurement. Physicists have not really
*  caught on to hidden variable theories. They're not very popular, but certain sets of people,
*  some physicists, some mathematicians, some philosophers have kept the flame alive.
*  And interestingly, as we talk about in the podcast, the Nobel Prize last year was given
*  to tests of John Bell's famous theorems, his famous inequalities, which were very much prompted,
*  Bell's exploration of these theorems and his proof of them was prompted by David Bohm's hidden
*  variable theory, which Bell thought was the best formulated known version of quantum mechanics. Bell
*  thought we should be teaching it in textbooks. So it's a little weird that the people who really
*  take these theories seriously get good results that later lead to Nobel prizes, yet the theories
*  themselves are not very popular within physics. Again, I could give my reasons for not being a
*  fan of hidden variable theories, but they are, as Tim says about Everett, they are absolutely a
*  serious attempt. It's something that you should think about if you care about these things.
*  And so we'll give the sales pitch for why you should take these seriously. We'll talk a little
*  bit about foundations of physics more generally and even a little bit about the arrow of time.
*  And the other thing that I want to mention, because Tim reminded me of it at the very end
*  of the podcast is Tim is the director and I think his title is director, but anyway,
*  he's the founder of something called the John Bell Institute for the Foundations of Physics.
*  Tim has been very active not only in doing foundations of physics, but in advocating for
*  the status of this sub-discipline within philosophy and physics. And the Bell Institute,
*  which is located in Croatia and serves as a place to meet and talk about foundations of physics,
*  is trying to raise funds to get a permanent home. So they literally have a GoFundMe and you can
*  visit the John Bell Institute homepage at johnbellinstitute.org that will link you to
*  a donate button. You can donate to the permanent home for the John Bell Institute. We're not there
*  yet. We need a bunch more donations, but I think they just started, so it's early days. Maybe
*  Mindscape listeners will kick in a little bit. And with that, let's go.
*  Tim Wadden, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thank you. Good to be here.
*  So you've been a champion for a little while of something called the Foundations of Physics. So
*  I want to ask you two questions. One is, what is that for the listeners out there? But also,
*  what's your sales pitch? Like hypothetically, if you're talking to your colleagues in a physics
*  department or philosophy department, how do you explain to them why foundations of physics is so
*  important? Okay. Oddly enough, I don't have to sell it to the philosophers. It's a weird situation.
*  You have to sell it to the physicists. But it's very simple, really. Foundations of Physics,
*  as the name suggests, is a branch of physics, namely the one that asks, what are the most
*  fundamental items? How do we understand the most fundamental physical structures and things that
*  there are? And that's only part of physics because you could do condensed matter physics,
*  where you say, I'm just worried about other states or the physics of stars, and you take for granted
*  a lot of the micro stuff, or at least how to handle it, and then you're building up from there.
*  But if you just dig and dig and dig and say, at the very bottom, what's the stuff that doesn't get
*  explained in terms of other stuff? That's the foundations. And so if you do that in physics,
*  that's the foundations of physics. In philosophy, it's easy. I actually just gave a talk about this
*  to the undergraduates at Rutgers because that is part of what philosophers call metaphysics or
*  ontology, which is, again, just the question of what exists asked at the most generic level?
*  And if you're a physicalist, you think everything that exists is somehow physical. If you're not,
*  you might think there are other things that aren't physical. But everybody pretty much agrees there's
*  some physical stuff. Not everybody says that, yes. Not everybody, of course. Every time you say
*  something, you can think of a counterexample, unfortunately. Now, the curious thing, if I
*  describe it that way, is you say, but why should you have to sell this to the physicists? Why isn't
*  this just part of the physics curriculum? And that has a very strange and disturbing sociological
*  answer that really goes back to quantum mechanics because they didn't really understand when the
*  quantum mechanical formalism was first developed in a way that was very predictively successful.
*  They really didn't understand what they were talking about.
*  They, the physicists?
*  They, the physicists, the physicists who came up with the math. And you can come up with math and
*  understand how to manipulate it to get predictions, but still not look at that math and be quite sure
*  what the physics underlying it is. And those were very good questions, and they were asked very
*  rigorously and vociferously early on by people like Einstein, people like Schrodinger, people who are
*  very deeply involved even in the development of the theory. But at a certain point, another crew
*  led by Bohr and to some extent Heisenberg kind of said, well, don't ask those questions, either
*  because for some deep philosophical reason, they're not good questions, although they sound pretty
*  good, or eventually this morphed into what people call shut up and calculate, where you don't even
*  explain, you just say, don't ask those questions.
*  I mean, my impression would have been that Bohr and Heisenberg were more like, we've told you the
*  answer to those questions. And then when the Americans got hold of it, it was like, just don't
*  even ask those questions.
*  That's my take on it was that it was, I mean, Bohr's background was in neo-Kantian philosophy.
*  He actually said very, very, very mysterious things. And I would say early on, the idea of
*  the Copenhagen School was say some incomprehensible stuff and then calculate. And then when it came
*  to America, they cut out the first step.
*  Good. But you said sociological reasons. I mean, I can imagine why, well, don't let me imagine.
*  What is, in your opinion, the sociological reason why physicists would stop asking what is going on
*  at the fundamental nature of reality?
*  And I'm speculating here, when they first started, everybody's familiar with this
*  picture of the atom as a kind of planetary system with a nucleus and then these electrons whizzing
*  about it. We still kind of picture it that way. And that was sort of what was called the old quantum
*  theory. Said that, and it said, by the way, these electron orbits are restricted. They can't just
*  orbit anywhere where a planet can. They're restricted to these particular little orbits.
*  And then all they can do is jump between them. And when they jump between them, they'll
*  either give off or absorb some light. And there was a bunch of explanation that you could get out
*  of that basic picture. But if you pursue that picture, the natural question is, but how do they
*  jump? I mean, how does it get from here to there? And how does it orbit when it's in one of these
*  orbits? And questions like that. And they kind of work beavered away at that and couldn't make much
*  progress on it. And I think they eventually got to the point where they didn't want to say, yes,
*  those are good questions, which we can't answer. And they were satisfied that they were calculating
*  correctly. And in order not to say, there's really deep questions we don't know the answer to. They
*  said, no, no, no, we've got it. We just have the mathematical formalism. The only reason you're
*  puzzled is that you're trying to push some classical picture on the microscopic realm,
*  and it doesn't belong there. And your confusion is arising from you having unjustified design
*  buyers for comprehension. I have I don't know if I've ever mentioned this to you, I have
*  talked to fellow physicists, and I've opined that despite everything, I personally care about more
*  than just correctly predicting the outcomes of experiments, I actually care about talking
*  about reality. And many of them are very open and explicit that all they want to do is predict the
*  outcomes of experiments. Yeah, and I think it would if somebody had a lot of funding and a lot
*  of time, it would be interesting to figure out at what point these people started saying that,
*  because my experience is that young people going into physics care a lot about trying to understand.
*  And they get very upset. And I know this because I teach foundations of physics in the philosophy
*  department. And I get physics students who say, this is why I went into the field, you're talking
*  about the stuff I was interested in. And I think in most cases, like I can't imagine, you know,
*  an 18 year old saying, I just want to calculate, right. So I think that basic curiosity
*  about the world gets beaten out of them. Yeah. And I really think it's part of a physics education,
*  unfortunately, to beat it out of you. So we talked about Einstein and Bohr, etc. But it's still more
*  or less true, he said. That's my impression. I certainly can testify that lots of physics students
*  will come to me and say, I get very frustrated. I raise questions to my physics professors
*  of the form, what's really going on here? And I'm not told these are good questions, right? I really
*  am told, don't ask them. Don't spend your time thinking about this. And slight generalization,
*  but the philosophers, to their credit, have kept the flame alive. They've been thinking about these
*  things. Yeah, it's, you know, it's the same way that Aristotle kind of had to be squirreled away
*  in the Islamic world for a while, and then eventually found his way back. Yes, I do think
*  that that really philosophy has been a refuge. And in some cases, as you know, like David Albert
*  got his degree in theoretical physics at Rockefeller, his background was not in philosophy,
*  but he's in a philosophy department because these questions were welcomed in philosophy
*  departments and not welcomed in physics departments. Now, my feeling, a lot of people around us,
*  and I have some concrete reason to believe things are getting better. I actually got an email kind
*  of out of the blue from a chair of a physics department who said, we're thinking of trying to
*  introduce foundations of physics into our program. Can you give me advice about, you know, what we
*  might teach and how it might be done? This was great. And this was somebody I'd never met.
*  Just, you know, I was literally just yesterday talking to an undergrad with thinking about grad
*  school and she wasn't sure she likes the foundations of physics. So, but she's a physics
*  undergrad. So she thought it'd be better to go to a physics department for grad school,
*  was asking for advice on where to go. And it was hard for me to even come up with departments who
*  would let you do that. Right. But maybe it's changed. Yeah. And, you know, and at a certain
*  time, I guess that you could say, well, you could go here because yes, it's a normal physics
*  department, but at least one or two people on the weekends and a little bit hiding from their
*  colleagues are interested in these subjects and we'll talk to you about them if you catch them,
*  you know, off their clock. All right. So there's our sociology, but you already opened up the
*  doors to what we want to talk about, which is these mysteries of quantum mechanics. And
*  David Albert was on the show. David Wallace was on the show. We were mostly talking about
*  entropy in the era of time. Adam Becker gave us this wonderful historical introduction. But
*  when we were talking to David Albert, mostly we criticized the Everett interpretation of quantum
*  mechanics. I say we being the royal we, I was defending it, but I always let the guest talk.
*  So David gave his spiel. So what we didn't get time to get into is, okay, then what instead?
*  So if, if putting, let's not talk about Everett today, unless it, unless it comes up, I want to
*  be like, uh, substantive and proactive and, and constructive. What do we do if we're thinking
*  about what are the, what are the mysteries we're trying to solve about quantum mechanics that got
*  us into this trouble and what are the avenues open to solving? Good. So, um, that's a really
*  good question. And there, there are several different dimensions to it, but let me start
*  with a dimension and I am going to briefly bring in Everett, but then let it go. Everybody knows
*  there's this experiment. They say a thought experiment, although you could do it, it would
*  be cool to do it. That Schrodinger talked about, um, with this cat penned up in a cage with a,
*  with a bit of radioactive material in a Geiger counter and this diabolical device. Um,
*  actually that turns out that Schrodinger was really just reconfiguring the same thought
*  experiment that Einstein had written to him just before, which had to do with a keg of, of, uh,
*  gunpowder that either would or would not explode in the next half hour. And you could calculate
*  a quantum mechanical probability for it to explode and not explode. And what Schrodinger was pointing
*  out and what, what Einstein was pointing out is that if you hold two views, which are very
*  natural views you would like to hold, you got into what seemed to them to be hopeless difficulties.
*  And the two views were, first of all, when we do quantum mechanics, we describe a system with a
*  thing called a wave function mathematically. One of the questions is, okay, that wave function,
*  does it provide us a complete description of the system? Meaning every physical fact about that
*  system one way or another could be extracted if you gave me the wave function. And this was when,
*  when Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote in 1935, and this is the same year as the cat paper. And
*  the cat paper was really a response or a reaction is better to say to the EPR paper. The title of
*  that paper is quantum mechanical description of reality complete. This is what they were looking
*  at. And they were arguing in that paper. No, there's more, there's more to the world than
*  wave functions. If that were true, of course, then as a physicist, again, not as a philosopher,
*  but as a physicist, the question is, okay, what else is there? Tell me about the other stuff.
*  So, so there's one question, is the wave function complete? And then there's the question about how
*  the wave function evolves through time, what its dynamics is. And there's it Schrodinger wrote down
*  this wonderful equation that has his name, that has some nice mathematical properties,
*  particularly linearity. And people certainly wanted to say at least part of the dynamics
*  is this Schrodinger evolution. And you might say, well, why not, why not just go whole hog and say
*  all of it is Schrodinger evolution. That's all it ever does. Okay.
*  Yep. I like that idea. That sounds promising.
*  So if you put those two together, and you say, A, the wave function is complete, and B, it always
*  evolves by Schrodinger evolution, then you get into this problem that Schrodinger was pointing
*  out and that Einstein was pointing out, which is that for the cat or for the gunpowder after an hour,
*  the wave function doesn't tell you either yes, it has exploded or no, it is not exploded or yes,
*  the cat is dead or no, the cat isn't dead. The wave function goes into this,
*  we call superposition of different states, which normally you'd associate one state with the
*  exploded gunpowder and another with the unexploded. But what the wave function gives you is not one or
*  the other, but a kind of combination of both. And if you say, well, that's a complete description,
*  there isn't no further fact that's left out. Then you say, but then the cat's neither alive
*  nor dead or the gunpowder is somehow in a weird suspended state between exploded and not exploded.
*  And Schrodinger's view of that was that that was ridiculous. And John Bell, when he writes about
*  this, I mean, the way he sums this up is he says, either the wave function as given by the Schrodinger
*  equation is not everything or it's not correct. And Everett, now I'm just going to say the one
*  thing about Everett is an attempt to say no, it is both everything and correct.
*  Liking up with a way to make it both everything correct.
*  Right. So I would say that's the route that leads you to the many worlds theory. And you
*  understand the motivation, it's to keep both of those nice things. But it has this price to pay
*  in terms of saying, you know, the idea that that one cat you put into the cage, it either ended up
*  alive or dead. No, that's not right. They're now, you know, and not just two cats, actually,
*  infinitely many cats, people don't point this out that there might be only one live cat,
*  but there are going to be a whole lot of dead cats because the thing could have decayed at all
*  these different times. Now, if you don't want to go that way, and so we won't spend our time talking
*  about the price you have to pay and what you have to do. I suppose let's just get our cards on the
*  table. For the audience purposes, you're not a fan. I'm not, but it's a serious attempt. I mean,
*  you have to be very clear here. There are things I'm not a fan of, but I appreciate the honesty
*  of people who are fans. If they see the what they have to confront, and they, you know,
*  straightforwardly say, yes, I, I, by making these commitments, I inherit these problems,
*  and I'm going to work on those, right? And nobody should just turn their back, in my view,
*  on a serious proposal. I take it to be a serious proposal. I think there are other proposals out
*  there, which I will not name right now, which I do not think are serious. I don't think that they
*  have any chance. I would not put many worlds in that basket. But if we, if we take off the table,
*  having the wave function be both complete and always Schrodinger, then your options are,
*  all right, if it's not complete, then there's something else in the world beside the wave
*  function. And then immediately you ask, okay, what is it? And what does it do? And why am I
*  talking about wave functions anyway? And things like that. Those are the natural questions. You
*  ought to have answers at your fingertips. Or if you say, well, I think something went wrong with
*  the Schrodinger evolution, then you can say, well, I think the wave function doesn't always evolve
*  in this way. It does this other thing that people call collapsing, right? Or reducing that looks
*  very, very, very un Schrodinger like. This was the way that when John von Neumann wrote down his
*  understanding of the mathematical foundations of the theory had two processes for the wave function,
*  the Schrodinger process and a collapse process. And that's also kind of okay at a very high level.
*  But if you, as soon as you say that, you also now inherit an obligation to tell me, all right,
*  well, when and how does it deviate from Schrodinger evolution? And you there are lots of
*  details that can be put in in different ways and different suggestions. Some people think early on
*  that the collapses had to be triggered by something. So things would go nice Schrodinger wise until
*  X. What's the X? Oh, until a measurement is made or till an observation is made. And then that,
*  of course, astonished. This is something Einstein was very upset about. Other people are upset
*  about because they say, Look, it's what do you mean an observation? I mean, who can do the observing?
*  You know, can a mouse observe? Can a can a amoeba observe? Can they, you know, trigger a collapse of
*  the wave function? If you go that direction, and certainly you end up with the vigner who says,
*  Oh, we have to talk about consciousness. And now you're in the mind body problem. And, you know,
*  you're in a mess. Other people have said, Well, no, there's a kind of trigger or something that
*  affects collapse, but it's not measurement or observation. It's like, say gravity. I mean,
*  this is something that Roger Penrose has been advocating for a long time, not with as much
*  precision as a theory as some other things, but that somehow gravity, which is the one thing that
*  is not well understood quantum mechanically may come in here as triggering this non Schrodinger
*  evolution. And then there's another idea, which is that no, it collapses and nothing triggers it.
*  It just it just happens. It happens randomly from time to time at a certain rate. In a certain way.
*  This is called the spontaneous collapse theories. And there's a famous theory by Gerardi,
*  Romanian, Weber, the GRW theory, and they just put numbers to it. I mean, this was the great
*  thing they did. They didn't just wave their hands. They said, Okay, yeah, it collapses every now and
*  then. How often? Well, once every, you know, 10 to 15 seconds per particle, you know, and, and how
*  does it collapse? Well, there you multiply by a Gaussian of this width and, you know, put some
*  math to it. This was what this is what john bell was so impressed by. I know when I talked to him
*  about that theory was that, okay, for many years, people have had this kind of general thought.
*  But they took the step of turning it into clean mathematics. Yeah. And also the mathematics,
*  but a real theory, physically, right? Yeah, not just an idea. Not just a general suggestion.
*  That's right. And it can be in fact, experimentally tested. Yes, it does. It makes because the wave
*  function evolution is different. And because the predictions really depend on what the wave
*  function does, it will make it's easy to see in principle, it makes different predictions.
*  It's harder to come up with the experimental situations where you can see those differences.
*  Although people have been working at it for some decades and making progress. The progress is
*  mostly ruling out the theory. I mean, so far, we have not seen a signature that the theory is
*  correct. Okay, we haven't ruled it out. But but you could have ruled it in if you'd seen certain
*  things you could have really ruled it in it has not been ruled in and ruling it in these these
*  spontaneous collapse theories would count as falsifying this other. That's right. If that
*  were to happen, then the other things on the table that we might talk about, including Everett would
*  would, you know, a lot of the motivation for Everett would go away because one of the motivations is
*  but gee, this Schrodinger revolution is so nice. So that is a motivation, I guess the to a physicist,
*  the there's a sort of, I don't want to say intuitive, but emotional objection to these
*  spontaneous collapse theories, like it just looks so ad hoc that the wave function just does this.
*  And I guess you could say, yeah, but we're fitting the data. Yeah. And ad hoc. It's not that I don't
*  have some sympathy. But when you realize how difficult these questions are, and the weird
*  extremes that people have gone to say, oh, but I don't like this one, because it's ad hoc,
*  that is such weak teeth. Right? I mean, get over it. You know, I mean, the, you know, the physical
*  world might look a little more ad hoc than you prefer. You really shouldn't rule things out in a
*  strong way for that reason. I guess maybe following what you said about Einstein and EPR, the one
*  thing that you can say about quantum mechanics is that someone's going to have to give up on
*  something that they really want to be true. Yes, I think that's correct. I mean,
*  somewhat, yes, some ways that I'm not sure I would say, and now I'm going to, you know,
*  tip the hand, which you'd understand already, if you already know, I'm not that sympathetic
*  to the many worlds because of the problems I see there. And I also have this feeling
*  that I can only say by saying the collapses don't smell right to me, right? I don't want to put too
*  much weight on that, but that's just the way I feel. And when you're in this, you kind of
*  make a judgment about what looks more plausible to you. Then we have the last possibility where,
*  okay, yeah, there are no collapses. I agree. I like the Schrodinger revolution. It looks,
*  it's clean. It's pretty. It's linear. I want to keep that, but I want my cats to just,
*  one cat goes in and one cat comes out. That means I have to have something in addition to the wave
*  function. And now the question is what? And the amazing thing, and I think anybody, whatever you
*  think about the theory is at least just for the non relativistic theory, there's some complications
*  further on. For the non relativistic theory, this thought occurred immediately in 1926 already by
*  Louis de Broglie. And you say, what is this magical thing you're going to add to your physics
*  answer particles, point particles, just the sort of thing you were already familiar with the sort
*  of thing, even democratists, well, his were a little thick, right? They had to have shapes.
*  These can be point particles. So they're even slimmed down and more minimalistic than
*  democracy and particles. But the idea, okay, there are some particles and they move around
*  and they constitute cats and tables and chairs. And if you want to know whether your cat's alive
*  or dead, tell me where it's, what its particles are doing and I'll give you a good idea, right?
*  You might say that's such a simple idea. It couldn't possibly be the case
*  that you just add some particles and write down a pretty simple looking equation for how they move
*  and everything comes out right. But amazingly, in the non relativistic theory, it does.
*  I don't really see that as giving up on anything. I mean, because what you have to give up on is the
*  completeness of the wave function, but it's not clear what the motivation for believing that ever
*  was except Bohr and so on saying, look, we know what to do with the wave function. If it's complete,
*  then we're done and we want to be done. So don't tell us there's something else.
*  So in other words, the basic idea is when we invented quantum mechanics, we started saying,
*  electrons are like waves, right? They have interference patterns under the right circumstances.
*  They spread out in the atom. They are also like particles in certain ways. We measure little dots
*  on screens. And the brilliant breakthrough from de Broglie is that's because they're both at the
*  same time. Yeah. Or to put it as Bell, again, I'm always quoting John Bell. He says people were
*  breaking their heads all the time, wave or particle, wave or particle. You'd hear wave-ical,
*  right? It's a new concept you don't have. And he said, why didn't it occur to them the simple
*  answer, wave and particle? There is a wave that is a thing that obeys a wave equation,
*  which is why you get interference. That's the wave function or the quantum state,
*  the thing described by the wave function. And in addition, there is a particle which always has a
*  location. So if you ask, but why do these little individual spots form on my screen, it's because
*  that's where the particle hit. No reason why you can't explain the wave-like behavior because
*  there is a wave and the particle-like behavior because there is a particle and that and their
*  dynamics is coupled in a way that the particles are guided by a wave-like thing. And so the
*  interference in the wave will affect where the particles go. So this table in front of us is in
*  some legitimate sense made of particles. And the positions of those particles are among other things
*  being guided by the wave function. Yes. Are they separately interacting with each other, the
*  particles? Well, of course, the word interaction here is one of those words that different
*  physical theories will give you different accounts of what even counts as an interaction.
*  Certainly, the particles can be in a situation where what happens to one will make a difference
*  to what happens to others. So the theory will just tell you, gee, if you turn on a magnetic
*  field over here and now this particle gets deflected down, and by the way, that particle
*  will get deflected up. The example I just gave you is a little bit misleading. But now, is that
*  an interaction between the particles? Well, it's certainly mediated by the wave function. The
*  particles can't do anything to each other. But in a way, already you have that in Newton. You say,
*  well, how does one particle affect another gravitationally? Well, not sort of directly,
*  but you need a gravitational field or something like that. There's a mediator. There's a physical
*  mediator that accounts for these relations between what they do. Is that interaction? It is,
*  but it's not quite like classical Newtonian interaction. One way to talk about this,
*  people get a little bit, maybe this will help or maybe not, but let me say it briefly. If you've
*  studied any physics, if you did any Newtonian physics, you'll remember that the fundamental
*  equation is F equals ma, where a is the acceleration. And the acceleration is the change in the
*  velocity, and the velocity is already the change in the position. So it's a second time derivative.
*  And what that means for Newton is that to give you the initial conditions of a system, I both have to
*  tell you where everything is and what its momentum is. So I need both position and momentum,
*  and then the fundamental kind of physical interaction through F equals ma is changing
*  the momentum. But in this theory, it's not like that. It's a first order theory. Everything is
*  just done with one time derivative. So the initial condition only has to be the positions.
*  And then what the wave function does is guide the particles. It doesn't push them around
*  in by producing Newtonian forces on them. It guides them. It as it were determines where they go.
*  More in the way, this is a kind of analogy that David Bohm used to use, as if you were piloting
*  by radio control a little boat out on the lake. And you say, yeah, as you turn the dial, you're
*  as it were sending information or telling the boat where to go, but you're not pushing the boat
*  around. Right. And in fact, if the boat goes twice as far away, so your radio signal is half as
*  strong, still, as long as it's getting the signal, it's going to guide it the same way. Right.
*  Whereas a Newtonian force, you'd sort of think, well, the further away you get,
*  the weaker the force has to become. So it's a different fundamental picture of physical interaction.
*  And I think many physicists object to it or have this intuitive emotional response to it because
*  the wave function is guiding the particles, but the particles don't influence the wave function
*  at all. Right. Maybe part of that negative feeling is that they're still thinking of the
*  wave function as a Newtonian force field. They might be thinking that this is an
*  objection people have raised quite explicitly that this theory violates, they call it generalized
*  Newton's third law of action and reaction. Right. So they say, oh, well, in general, I think if A
*  has an influence on B, B should have a back influence or a reciprocal influence back on A.
*  And that, I have to say, strikes me as just silly. I mean, in a certain way, if you say to Newton,
*  look, doesn't the law of gravity somehow affect what particles do? He'd say, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And you say, but what about the particles? Do they affect the law of gravity? He says, no, of course
*  not. Right. The law of gravity doesn't change because of what the particles do. What the way
*  the particles behave is accounted for, as it were, by the law. So we don't usually think that if A
*  affects B, B has to have a reciprocal back effect on A. Lots of cases where even in physics, we
*  wouldn't say that at all. So this seems to me to be a bit special pleading of trying to find something
*  to complain about. I mean, certainly it sounds like a very made up metaphysical principle.
*  Yes. Made up. Okay. You mentioned David Bohm. Tell us his role in this story.
*  So it's an interesting, I mean, the history of this is very interesting because again,
*  people were very concerned. There was the early quantum theory by Bohr, which had this very
*  classical looking idea of this planetary atom and then these jumping kind of jumps, which were
*  unusual and they didn't quite understand. And then the new quantum theory was developed in the 20s,
*  mid 20s. And the mathematics of it came out first, matrix mechanics by Heisenberg and then
*  wave mechanics by Schrodinger. I'm just throwing some names out, but people have heard these names.
*  But they had the math in a way, they kind of knew how to manipulate the math to make some
*  predictions, but it wasn't at all clear what the physical picture was, right? What's the physical
*  theory here? And de Broglie early on looks at this and says, well, I can just put these particles in,
*  these point particles and have them guided around by this quite simple equation. You need a second
*  equation because we needed an equation to tell us what the wave function does and we're just going
*  to keep Schrodinger's equation for that. So we got that. No real dispute about that. Then we need
*  a second one, which tells me what the particles do. And that's going to be a thing called the
*  guidance equation. And just from mathematical simplicity and other very basic physical
*  considerations, I think I've seen claimed 10 different ways that would lead you in
*  the non relativistic theory to a very simple, obvious equation, guidance equation for this.
*  Lots of ways to motivate it intuitively. And so de Broglie discovers this and he presents it. He
*  was very young at the time and some rather bad objections were made to the theory, but de Broglie
*  on his feet couldn't answer them. And the story seems to be that he was just a bit traumatized by
*  the whole thing because these were the big shots of physics. I mean, he's a young guy. He's at the
*  Solvay conference with the biggest names, Einstein is there, Bohr is there and so on. And they're
*  pally, whoever they're beating up on him. And he just kind of seems to have abandoned the theory a
*  bit. As far as I can tell, and I've heard people tell me this more recently who looked into it,
*  it kind of lays fallow. Now, Einstein, who we know didn't like the Copenhagen understanding
*  of quantum theory, we know played around with this theory or very similar theories
*  in the intervening years. He didn't like it, but he didn't like it because it had what he called
*  in a very manifest, easy to see way, spooky action at a distance, this non locality. So we know why
*  he didn't like the theory and he could never come up with a satisfactory version to him.
*  But it's very possible that he came up with the version that other people think is satisfactory.
*  Exactly. He could have very well had it and it sort of stayed that way. And then the really
*  interesting situation, if we get into this, is David Bohm is now a young physicist, very well
*  regarded at Princeton. He writes a book explaining quantum theory from the kind of Copenhagen-Bohrian
*  point of view. And he's in Princeton, Einstein's over at the Institute for Advanced Study.
*  And he's kind of saying, gosh, I would like to get my nerve to go ask Einstein what he thinks of my
*  book, right? And he's actually trying to get other people to approach Einstein. And as this is going
*  on, he gets a message from Einstein and Einstein says, I read your book, would you like to come
*  talk about it? And the story is he goes to talk to Einstein.
*  So it's like 1950, 51, something like that.
*  51, I think. Einstein has read the book and he says, I think this is the best, the clearest
*  exposition of the Copenhagen approach that I've ever seen. I mean, he was really trying hard,
*  but Einstein raised some objections. And the story is, and I think it was Gell-Mann who tells the
*  story, it was Bohm's roommate at the time, that Bohm goes, meets Einstein, comes back,
*  and he reports when he comes back, I'm back to square one. He was convinced by Einstein's
*  objections. He just, he couldn't answer Einstein's objections. He realized that he really didn't
*  understand what he himself had written. And within a year, he discovers this other thing,
*  which was the same thing de Broglie had done, and apparently independently, as far as I can tell.
*  I mean, I was told recently, I haven't done the research myself, but again, it's not hard to find
*  that theory if you're looking in a certain direction. And then he publishes these papers,
*  this two part paper in 1952, a theory that introduces so called hidden variables into
*  quantum mechanics and gives you all the right predictions. And this was something that people
*  had believed had been proven mathematically impossible by John von Neumann, when von Neumann
*  wrote his book. So this is of course a shock. It's like, you're not supposed to be able to do that.
*  And then you look at the paper and you say, wait, it does look like you can do that. And we now
*  understand that von Neumann had made not a mathematical mistake, but a kind of conceptual
*  mistake, which was caught at the time by Greta Hermann. And people pointed it out, but who's
*  listening to Greta Hermann? When Bohr and Heisenberg are saying the opposite.
*  So in 1952, the theory sort of gets reborn. It's under Bohm's name, and Bohm worked on expanding it
*  to cover spin and some other, I mean, it's a kind of very basic theory at the beginning. And then
*  you start adding Bell's and Whistle's to cover more and more phenomena. And it might still have
*  disappeared, but John Bell became a fan of it, right? Well, Bell, it's not that Bell started out
*  as a fan of it. Bell was a fan of this. He was a fan of saying, I understand what this theory is
*  claiming. There's no mystery about it. There are these particles, there's this wave function.
*  Here's what the wave function does. Here's what the particles do. Okay? This is a picture of the
*  world. Like it or lump it. When I first learned about this theory, and I was very skeptical about
*  it from Shelley Goldstein, Shelley helped me a lot at one point in our discussions, because I was
*  being very obstreperous. And he said, look, surely you'll admit this is a theory of something.
*  Okay? It says there are these particles, there's this other thing, here's what they do.
*  Now, just in your mind, imagine a world as this theory describes. Wouldn't it be interesting if
*  that world looked very much like the world we live in? Which turns out to be true.
*  This is always good advice when people have trouble thinking about new theories, because they always
*  want to fit it into their own boxes, right? And if you just ask what it would be like if it were true,
*  you make progress. And it addressed the problem that Einstein had raised about locality,
*  by saying, yeah. Yes, so this is what I was going to say. So, so Bell, and Bell tells a
*  wonderful story, right? Bell says when he first learned quantum mechanics, he was very puzzled
*  by it. He didn't understand what was going on. And he thought, you need to add something to it. You
*  need these additional variables. The wave function is not the whole story. And he said he was told
*  by his physics professors, no, no, no, no, von Neumann has proven it can't be done. Mathematically
*  proven, you can't add any additional variables and keep the same predictions. And Bell says at
*  the time, he didn't know any German and the book had not been translated. And so that's where it
*  sat. He just didn't know why he didn't understand he couldn't read von Neumann's proof, but he was
*  told there was a proof. And then Bell says he just gets up in 1952 and reads this paper that's been
*  published and says, wait, Bohm has just done what everybody's telling me von Neumann proved couldn't
*  be done. Something's gone wrong here. He quickly convinces himself that the mistake in that case
*  was on von Neumann side. But he sees that the theory has this manifest non locality. And he
*  asked himself, surely what Einstein must have been asking himself, can you get rid of it? Can I have
*  a kind of theory like this, but without the non locality in it, that still makes the right predictions?
*  The quantum mechanical predictions. That's the very precise thought that Bell had. And when he
*  finally got some time off on sabbatical to sit down. Because he couldn't do it during his regular
*  work. But the amazing thing is, of course, when you see Bell's proof, it's a few lines of algebra.
*  It's not like, you know, proving Fermat's Last Theorem. Okay, it's not hard mathematically.
*  When I first read about this stuff, which was in the Scientific American, in an article by
*  Bernard Despignard back in 79, I guess. It's not looking back on it. It's not the greatest
*  article in the world. But it was enough was there that just with a little math, you can see, wait,
*  wait, I see the problem. I really this just stands out at you. So the what happens with Bell is
*  Bell, what Bell realizes, wait a minute. No, you can't get rid of the non locality out of this
*  theory. You can't get rid of the non locality out of any theory. I mean, throw away quantum mechanics
*  and start from scratch from entirely different principles. Bell's proof is not about quantum
*  mechanics. It's just about certain experiments and the correlations that you see in the outcomes.
*  You can't have a theory that is local in a well defined sense that will predict that.
*  Quantum mechanics does predict it. And more importantly than quantum mechanics predicting it,
*  the world does it. Right. That's why the Nobel Prize went to went to Klaus and Aspion's Islander
*  recently for doing the experiments that showed that violent that the violation of Bell's
*  inequality actually occurs. And as you and I both complained about in separate occasions,
*  the Nobel committee blew it in their press release. Yes, they did. They said that what they had done
*  was what proved that von Neumann was right. And you can't have hidden variables, which is just the
*  irony there is so delicious. Because Bell became, you know, Bell then became the probably the
*  strongest advocate of this bone bones theory or de Broglie's theory, which is a theory with
*  additional variables. Why? Because he said, well, what's the objection? You can't object as Einstein
*  did. I don't like it because it's non local because now I understand. Okay, the non locality is just
*  in the world, right? Suck it up. And it's a clear theory and so on. I mean, at one point,
*  Bell says he's going through all these different ways of approaching quantum mechanics. And he
*  says, well, the pilot wave approach shows the best craftsmanship. But then he says, but is that he
*  says then wonderfully, I mean, he always made these cutting little remarks. Is that is that a virtue
*  in our time? Right? Do people appreciate good craftsmanship anymore? Do they like just things
*  that sound whoo, you know, amazing and blow your mind? Because it at some level, it's a much more
*  pedestrian kind of theory. You say, yeah, there's some particles, they move around. Yeah, there's
*  this wave function. That's kind of funny thing. But I'll explain how it, you know, how it plays
*  into the architecture here. It was a rough time for the philosophy of quantum mechanics.
*  But okay, so the I think that there are any physicists out there who are not into the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics, and they're listening, they're very confused because one
*  uses the word locality in different senses sometimes. I mean, if you asked a quantum
*  field theorist, is their field theory local, they would say, yes, it's very, very local. So
*  what exactly do you mean by this word? Good. So and there's even a technical mathematical
*  condition that's imposed in quantum field theory that they will call locality has to do with
*  commuting operators. Okay, so what's going on? Well, one thing to say is that there is there's
*  bell proved there has to be some kind of influence or effect. If Alice and Bob, if I set up a pair of
*  particles in a special state called an entangled state, and anybody who's heard about this, at
*  least have heard the word entangled, but send the particles off way in different directions. So
*  they're, you know, hundreds of light years apart, one into Alice's lab and one into Bob's lab.
*  The intuition of causal locality basically says nothing that Alice does can have any actual
*  influence or effect on what Bob sees. Right? Yeah. That doesn't mean there can't be correlations
*  between what they see. I mean, everybody knows people give this example, you tear tear a dollar
*  bill in half and send the two sides off in different directions. Of course, Alice seeing
*  one half immediately informs you that Bob will see the other half. But that's not Alice doing
*  anything that affects Bob at all. That's just it was always true. Everybody understood that
*  everybody understands there could be correlations like that. But those correlations are already
*  explained by what happened at the source. And so nothing non local is going on in that case.
*  Bell showed no, you can't get the kinds of correlations you see in quantum mechanics by
*  that kind of local story. There has to be a sense in which what Alice does actually makes a difference
*  to what Bob sees or the other way around. That's causal non locality. Now the next question that
*  arises is, Oh, could you implement that in some way to allow Alice to send a message to Bob,
*  signal Bob, right, tell Bob whether they're going to meet for, you know, lunch today or not.
*  And the really interesting, I mean, a very interesting thing is that at least under certain
*  pretty clear idealizations, you can kind of look at the way quantum mechanics work and say,
*  well, no, actually, even though you can't get rid of this connection, you also can't use it to signal.
*  And the person who proved that first was also Bell, people like to call it the Nobel telephone
*  theorem. So he was perfectly aware of it, right? You can't use the non locality to signal.
*  Sorry, that's a that's a feature in Copenhagen, Everett, bone, whatever you want. Yeah, well,
*  okay. Now this is now I'm gonna now I'm gonna tread off into into treacherous territory.
*  If you say, and I think it's just a bad thing to say that the the fundamental postulate of say,
*  relativity has to do with signaling, that you can't signal faster than light. And you say, oh,
*  well, then this is still a local theory. But that just I think, first of all, signaling isn't even
*  the right kind of concept that should be in the foundations of any theory, just as measurement
*  shouldn't and just as observation shouldn't. And, and, you know, Bell proved there is this kind of
*  non local causation. And maybe I can't use it to signal, but so what. But then the next thought is,
*  gosh, if there really is this real physical non local connection, somehow, why can't I use it to
*  signal you sort of offhand think there must be some clever way to do it. Now I'm going to report
*  something. To ask that question, of course, you really need a well defined theory on the table in
*  front of you. Right? Because you have to ask, well, what can I do with this physics? quantum
*  mechanics tends to use these things called Hermitian operators, or, or, as they call them
*  observables, and they sort of you, the mathematics of that is, is what they look into to ask certain
*  questions. But if you have an actual theory in front of you, you're not restricted in that way,
*  you know, you can just say, well, can I do something? Can I twiddle this and, you know,
*  see something that it looks like, in the Bohmian theory with spin, there's reasons to believe you
*  could signal faster than light. Oh, this could be the most popular podcast ever. You weren't
*  expecting that, were you? I was not. It is, it is, I am personally, I suspected there should be a way
*  Siddhant Das, who's a young researcher, has been looking at something which amazingly people had
*  not looked carefully at, which is in this pilot wave theory, when you add spin, okay, that's an
*  additional physical degree of freedom, people usually just don't fiddle with it, they kind of
*  deal with spinless particles, you know, at this level, to understand things when you add spin.
*  And when you look at there's a very specific thing you can look at, that standard quantum mechanics
*  doesn't have an obvious way to even treat, right? This is the key to understanding this. That is
*  arrival times. So if I, if I, this is a well known issue. Yes, it is a well known issue, although
*  people just kind of put it out of their mind. So if I have an electron as it were confined in a little
*  box, which we kind of know how to do, and at some moment, I open the box, and then I've got a screen,
*  and at some time a flash appears on the screen. One thing you can ask is, well, what was the,
*  what was the transit time? How long, what was the time gap between when I open the box and when the
*  flash occurred? And it turns out, if you ask quantum mechanically, and in quantum mechanics,
*  you of course have to do experiments many, many times, and you get kind of statistical results,
*  you get a distribution of results. It's, nobody agrees how even to make that prediction using
*  standard quantum mechanics, because there is no Hermitian operator that corresponds to arrival
*  times. Okay? In the, in this pilot wave picture, because you have these particles and they just
*  move, it's kind of easy at least to ask the question according to the theory, how long did it,
*  would it take a particle here to get there? So you can actually do these calculations.
*  And when you do them with spin, you start to see that there's a spin dependence of the arrival times,
*  which you really weren't expecting, but it shows up. And if that's right, it's already a question of
*  whether you'll see that this is something you could check in the lab. We're trying to find people
*  who'll do it, but you need specialized equipment and you need the motivation to do it. If, if there
*  is that spin dependence of the arrival times, then there's a very quick argument, oh, you could
*  signal. Now the signaling would be very subtle. I mean, it's not like you could flip a switch and
*  a light would go on there, but it would essentially say if Alice orients a magnet in her
*  lab in a certain way, Bob will suddenly start seeing a slightly different distribution of arrival
*  times than if it's oriented another way. And that would be any kind of information, right? It doesn't
*  have to be a clean, a hundred percent strong signal, any signal, right? Any Shannon information.
*  Sure. And this suggests that, yeah, you actually should be able to do that. Now there are lots of
*  still, there's lots of arguments within the community about whether this is right, how far
*  do you have to carry the analysis into the observing equipment? I mean, lots of stuff,
*  maybe in a couple of years, people will say, no, this argument breaks down for some reasons
*  we don't quite understand yet. So I don't want to say this is nailed down, but it's there.
*  And it's a really hot, interesting, interesting topic and one that could be tested in a lab.
*  Some of it you could do today. I'm not completely surprised because both you and I have written
*  papers about energy conservation and its failure in quantum mechanics, which anyone could have
*  done in the 1950s. I just didn't ask the question. But is this a fact that you're talking about now?
*  Would it be a difference between well-meaning mechanics and other formulations of quantum?
*  Or is it just that you can't ask the question? Yeah, it's a little hard to say because,
*  and again, I'm now just reporting what Sid Hunt tells me and he's done all the research. He says,
*  if you go into the standard physics literature about arrival times, you'll find 20 different
*  suggestions about how to do it. They tend to agree with each other in the far field. That is,
*  if there's a long time between when you release it and when you detect it, all of these different
*  approaches converge on the same answers. But in the midfield, there are places where they will
*  not converge. So what can you say? I mean, it's not clear what predictions the quote standard
*  approach even makes. So you could say if the pilot wave approach makes a clean prediction,
*  it's clearly a different theory because look, it's doing something precise where the rival
*  doesn't even have anything precise to say. The other obvious question is you've been
*  simultaneously talking about whether you can send a signal faster than the speed of light,
*  but also working in the context of non relativistic quantum mechanics where there is no speed of
*  light. So do we have to talk about relativistic quantum field theory to have this conversation?
*  Well, we certainly don't have to talk about it to have the conversation we've had up until now
*  because even before relativity, if you said, look, Alice is in a lab, 100 billion miles away from Bob.
*  Can Alice do anything in her lab that would make a difference to what shows up in Bob's lab?
*  That's a little bit of a question.
*  The natural thought would be no. I mean, even if there were some effect, even if there were
*  a fast effect, it would drop off with the square of the distance. It would tail off.
*  So you can have the discussion about non-locality even in a non relativistic. Now it becomes sharper
*  in a relativistic context because then you mean faster than light where there is a light cone
*  structure. There's kind of an objective thing you mean there that's very sharp.
*  So you can sharpen it up in the relativistic context, but I think you can still reasonably
*  have it. It's not like all of your discussion of the non relativistic case just falls to the floor
*  when you notice there's relativity. My halfway informed feeling is that
*  Bome mechanics looks quite natural in the non relativistic regime. And it's a little bit more
*  of a challenge to see how we should just do quantum field theory in that picture.
*  Yeah, there is no doubt there are both conceptual and technical challenges when you go from standard
*  quantum mechanics where, and one of the signals here for people who don't know is that in quantum
*  mechanics, you talk about a system having N particles and that's it, right? Unless you add
*  some or take some away, it's going to be N particles forever. But that's not the world.
*  That's not the world. We now know that there is some phenomenon that we call particle creation
*  annihilation that particle numbers can change. And so you need to account for that.
*  Whether, I mean, there are lots of subtleties here. One subtlety is the thing we call particle
*  creation annihilation, is it really? And what I mean by that is when Dirac, and he's just a standard
*  guy, was talking about this, he didn't have particles really come into existence. He said,
*  well, there are always infinitely many particles filling up negative energy states. And what we
*  call the creation of a new electron and a new anti electron, a new positron, is really just lifting
*  an electron that was there all along in a negative energy state up into a positive energy state and
*  leaving a hole behind. And so it looks like there's a new electron and the hole is the thing we call
*  the positron. Now that's a story that would account for the phenomenon without really creating any new
*  particles. It's just moving them around in energy space, as it were. So there's certainly, you have
*  to account for the phenomenon, right? You have to account for the phenomenon. Yeah, I can take a
*  really high energy photon and gee, there just appears now an electron and a positron or
*  some things that satisfy certain conservation laws. We need to account for that phenomenon,
*  whether it really deeply requires new particles or do you want to give up the particle? The other
*  thing to say is the pilot wave picture is not tied to particles. It just says there's something that
*  the wave function is guiding. It could be particles. It could be a more field-like thing, right? There's
*  a kind of way of doing Bohmian field theory where you replace the particles with fields, but
*  the same kind of architecture. And the other point to make, which at least needs to be made,
*  is that people can say, gosh, but there's no good Bohmian quantum field theory. Standard quantum
*  field theory has been plagued by mathematical problems and runaway singularities, numbers you
*  try to calculate and they all come out infinity. It's not as if it's all conceptual lightness and
*  clarity in the so-called standard picture. So you don't want to hold this picture to a higher
*  standard of mathematical precision and so on. Then you're allowing for the theory that you
*  happen to use. Okay. That's perfectly fair, but I'm just trying to get straight for the listeners
*  out there. If I'm a particle physicist and I just calculated the rate of Higgs bosons decaying into
*  two photons and something like that, is that stuff I can do just as well in the current
*  Bohmian framework or is that work in progress? Okay. So one of the things that people have
*  looked at is suppose I remain, again, there are different moves you could make. You could say,
*  I'm going to give up the particles altogether and put something else more field-like in,
*  or you can say, no, I'm going to stick with the particles, but I am going to allow
*  literally the number to change. I'm going to allow particle creation and annihilation.
*  You can do that. How you would work that out in a kind of pilot wave picture was done,
*  has been done for 30 years ago, I guess. What you do is you say, in the original picture,
*  you have a fixed number of particles and all they do is move around and change their configuration.
*  But now I say, no, no, the real space of possible states is there's a zero particle state and a one
*  particle state and then two particle states and then three. So this whole thing called Fox space,
*  which is familiar to any of the physicists you're talking about. And you say, no, that's what I'm
*  now going to say. The thing is always in a particular location with a particular number
*  of particles, sometimes it just moves around in one of these sectors and the number doesn't change.
*  And sometimes it can jump up or jump down, which corresponds to particle creation and annihilation.
*  I now need dynamics for that. It turns out that dynamics tends, instead of being deterministic,
*  to be indeterministic. The easiest way to do it is say at any given time, there's a certain chance
*  you'll jump up and create a new particle or jump down and lose particles. You can do that.
*  And what falls out of doing that is the mathematics of standard quantum field theory.
*  Okay. But so just so I didn't lose it, among people who are fans of BOMI mechanics right now,
*  it's there's a camp that thinks maybe the hidden variables are field-like and there's another camp
*  that thinks maybe there's just a collection of particles that can change their number.
*  So we're not sure. That's right. It's not a leading. And there's a lot of things that are
*  debated within it. So here's another question. People, when you start out, you're always treating
*  electrons and gluons as particles. And they're all fermions, right? They're all half integers.
*  Well, the gluons are not.
*  Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I meant quarks. Then people ask, well, what about the photon?
*  Is that a particle? Are there photon trajectories? And it turns out you can try and develop a theory
*  in which there are and a theory in which there aren't. Okay. And people work on both sides and
*  there's no agreement in the community. And you ask, well, what would be the advantages,
*  you know, of doing it this way? What would be the advantage of doing it this way? So it's a
*  general architecture of how to develop a theory that can be implemented, of course,
*  in many different ways. And so even within the big house, right, there's rooms in the big mansion
*  of people who are working in different directions. With regard to the idea of sort of stepping back
*  from the fields and going particles as your ontology, two things come to mind, one of which
*  is against that idea, one of which is for it. So which one you want me to tell you first,
*  and then you can respond. The worry I have is something like the Higgs mechanism, where it
*  seems that the Higgs boson lurking as a field with an expectation value throughout all of space is
*  playing a crucially important role in explaining phenomenologically observable properties. Is that
*  something you could use? I mean, I think I just answered that, which is it sounds like you're the
*  kind of person who would say, I'd rather, yeah, I'll treat my fermions as particles, and I'll
*  treat my bosons as fields, essentially, which is, yeah, I won't introduce particles associated with
*  the integer spin objects. That I think would make you happy, right? I don't have to say there's a
*  Higgs particle to work it into the theory. And there is a reason to think that you're going to work
*  bosons and fermions can enter into the theory in different roles.
*  Okay, this is going to undo the good news that I had. So I don't know if you know this,
*  because I only recently learned it, but Richard Feynman, when he was inventing Feynman diagrams,
*  part of his motivation was to get rid of quantum field theory and replace it with another theory
*  particles again. And we now think of Feynman diagrams as a tool for understanding quantum
*  field theory. So he changed his mind. But his motivation, I'm told, was the cosmological
*  constant problem. Really? Yeah. No, I did not know that. Yeah, I mean, I was told that I need
*  to find the reference for it. But the idea is if you have fields, they all have these zero point
*  energies, and they add up to infinity, or you cut it off, and it gives you a big vacuum energy. But
*  if you have particles, you don't have that problem. So if I were a Bohmian particle ontology guy,
*  I'd be claiming a solution to the cosmological constant. That's that'd be my advice.
*  That that I look that's a connection I was unaware of my understanding. And again, this is not
*  based in in anything other than what I somehow picked up on the street. Was that that one way
*  anyway, let me put it this way, how Feynman thought about it, I'm not sure one way to think
*  about Feynman diagrams, which is runs contrary to way people often talk about them, is that they
*  were just a mnemonic device, right? I have a mathematical equation that has an infinite number
*  of terms that I need to sum up. And of course, the issue gets bad when that sum goes to infinity.
*  But anyway, I have this, all these terms I need to add up. And that the and that the diagrams were
*  just easy ways to kind of remember what the different terms look like, right? To figure out
*  what integral you had to do. Exactly. And now if you the way the way I say people don't do that is
*  they often pointed those things as if they are literal pictures of stuff going on. Oh, this is
*  doing this and this is doing this and all the stuff is going on. It's a blooming buzzing confusion
*  of virtual particles that are running around that talk. I don't think makes any sense on any view.
*  I'm on your side. Yeah. So if if it's just a mnemonic technique, then you're really it's
*  as if I like to say, suppose you wanted to calculate the volume of a sphere. And you just
*  love cubes. And you say, Okay, look, I'm going to first of all figure out the biggest cube I can
*  sit inside a sphere and calculate its volume. And now I've got these other little, you know,
*  six round pieces sticking out. Now I'm going to find the biggest cube I can get out of each of
*  those and then add those and then more cubes and more cubes and more cubes. And you can see,
*  okay, there's going to be an infinite sequence of these volumes that you now need to add up to get
*  the total volume of the sphere. But you'd say, but you shouldn't think that the sphere is this really
*  complicated thing, right? It's actually quite simple. And in fact, here's another way to do
*  this calculation that is, you know, is straightforward. And you don't do an
*  infinite sum and G, it's just, you know, four thirds pi r cubed.
*  No, I think that's actually an important point, because lots of modern physics is motivated,
*  you know, beyond the standard model particle physics searches for our next best theory is
*  motivated by questions of naturalness, right, and fine tuning and so forth. And I think I
*  don't know what the right way to think about those problems is. But I think that not only do
*  people talk as if there really are virtual particles popping out of existence, which there
*  aren't. But they also think that somehow nature starts with a classical theory and then adds
*  quantum corrections on top of it. And nature doesn't do that. And that might change our
*  perspective here. Right. And I think there's a I think you're exactly right. And I think there's
*  a methodological point here, which is that because we start out learning classical physics,
*  and it feels familiar to us, and we familiar with the math of it, there's this great temptation if
*  someone says, Oh, the way to come up with a good quantum theory is to start with a classical theory
*  and then do this thing we call quantizing it, right, we put the hats on, we turn certain
*  variables into operators. And, well, most of the time, it's clear how to do that. Sometimes it's
*  not quite clear how to do that. But you think but this doesn't make any sense, right? The world Yes,
*  the world behaves pretty well the way classical theory predicts at a certain scale. But that's
*  because something emerging out of a very non classical physics. And there's no reason to think
*  that the right way into that physics is to start with the approximation, and then twiddle with it,
*  right? It's got to go the other way around, right? You need the fundamental physics, and then
*  hopefully, you can understand why the quant, why the classical approximations work as well as they
*  do. But I think people are tempted, you know, because you have this kind of, kind of algorithmic
*  thing of, oh, just take a variable and put a hat on it and turn it into an operator. But conceptually,
*  that's just not the right way to think about it. Yeah, reality. That's right. So good. I'm glad
*  we can find like all of our points of agreement against the consensus, despite the fact that we
*  have some disagreements. But this question of the speed of light, I'm going to go back to the
*  experiment that the possible signaling because I do not know about that work. I don't know whether
*  it's right. So that's okay. We're putting it on. Yeah, right there. But the idea of looking hard
*  for possible experiments to do, I think is a crucially important one. I mean, my impression
*  is that your typical bohmean on the street thinks there's no experiment to do to test
*  bohm versus conventional quantum mechanics, whatever that is. Do you have a feeling about
*  that? I do. And this is a discussion I am in right now arising out of this work. That is,
*  a lot of people in the bohmian camp will kind of say, oh, but we know that it won't make different
*  predictions than quote standard quantum mechanics. Now, I think that's just wrong. I think there are,
*  you know, kind of toy cases that make it obviously wrong, but leave those aside. I just tried to
*  understand what the argument was. And I can't get it. Right. And so I think, and I think some of this
*  is defensive, right, because there's this and you stop back a second, you see, this is so unfair.
*  You standard quantum mechanics, whatever it is, anyway, you can make lots of good predictions
*  with it. Then somebody comes up with a new theory. And then they say, Oh, does your theory make any
*  new predictions? If not, why should I pay any attention to it? Now, the first thing you notice
*  is, but wait, if these two theories had been discovered in the opposite order, right, you know,
*  you would be going the other way around. So this can't be from a logical point of view, a good
*  objection that, you know, why should I take your theory seriously? Because it makes all the same
*  predictions as my theory, because that's, you know, that doesn't make any sense. But I think
*  that is an objection that physicists often made. And so, you know, there were certain kind of
*  defensive procedures that were put up to say, Oh, no, we're not saying there are new predictions,
*  right. But and then you'd have to go on. I Yeah, I, my view is a sharp theory, again,
*  standard quantum mechanics has certain vaguenesses in it. If you if you have to talk about
*  measurement, if you have to talk about observation, because those are vague terms, these are the
*  objections that we had. And so you'd expect a sharp theory will certainly ought to differ
*  in some ways. And and you should be looking hard at where those differences might be.
*  Is so unfair question, what fraction of the bohemians out there agree with you about that?
*  Is it? It's not an unfair question. But it's a sociological question, which I just
*  can't answer. I don't know. I don't know. And and there. And even the as it were,
*  the bohemian camp is divided into sub camps. And probably the statistics in the different
*  ones are different. And probably, my guess is, weirdly enough, it probably correlates with age.
*  I think you're weird at all. I think younger people are more open to certain things than people who've
*  been through a lot of battles. But I but I really don't know. Where are these bohemians of which
*  you speak? Are they in philosophy departments or physics departments or? Well, a lot of them? Yeah,
*  so there were a lot of students in Europe. And I'm sorry, this is going to be just a little hard
*  for me. That laughter who was at the LMU in in Munich had always a dozen graduate students,
*  unbelievable what he did that nobody else I know has ever done to promote young people
*  and bring them into this. And he was in the physics. He was in he was in physics. He was in the math.
*  Oh, math, math department. And he was just the most wonderful, caring
*  doctor father and looked after these students. He could not get many of them jobs in academia.
*  A lot of them have gone into other, you know, industry, whatever they they did their work.
*  But there are a lot of young people who came through that program who know it, who know the
*  theory and work on it. Sid Hantas, who I mentioned was one of of of Detlef's last students. And some
*  of his students, a couple of them are in to begin in, you know, so there are more of them in Europe
*  who've come through LMU and through his influence. Then the other thing that's happened is a lot of
*  physicists who realize they're interested in foundations notice that if you have credentials
*  as a philosopher, you can more literally more easily have an academic career in a philosophy
*  department as a philosopher of physics than you can in the physics department. Still true. Yes.
*  So some of them have switched over. Also, that was to Dustin Lazarevich, who's now in the
*  Technion in Israel. There are people who are around and it's more than there used to be.
*  I mean, the total number is up. What the effect of losing that because that left died during COVID?
*  I don't know. I mean, nobody right now is is doing what he was able to do. And we have to hope that
*  some, you know, there was a dedicated person with the right the right psychology and so on can kind
*  of take his place and help people along. Do you think we started by talking about
*  why you don't need to make the sales pitch to philosophers? They get it. Yeah.
*  How deeply do they get it? How much has quantum mechanics changed what philosophers think about
*  metaphysics? So this is an interesting question. In philosophy, I would say there are three camps
*  of people who do what goes under the name metaphysics. I just gave this talk at Rutgers,
*  the undergraduates about metaphysics and science are metaphysics and science enemies or friends or
*  what? Or the same thing. Yeah, exactly. That was my conclusion at the end. So you jumped right to
*  the end. But no, there's an interesting history because really there's a certain point where
*  they're clearly, you know, considered to be enemies. I mean, Carnap and anyway. I would say
*  that in metaphysics, metaphysicians, people would self identify as metaphysicians in philosophy now
*  fall into kind of three camps. There's a camp that's sometimes called analytic metaphysics,
*  which tends to be doing things which don't seem to care much about science. They're asking questions
*  that don't. It's not obvious that any scientific theory would bear one way or the other on the
*  question. Oh, are there I mean, these are not just gonna be words. Are there universals or tropes?
*  Okay, so this is the kind of thing that that a philosopher of a certain kind will understand and
*  they'll be fighting with each other forever about universal and tropes. And it's very hard if you
*  say, well, you know, did Newton believe in universal tropes? You'd say, well, then Newton didn't care.
*  I mean, you know, this is not it's just not an issue that that is built into the guts of that
*  theory in any obvious way. Then there are then there's another camp that goes by the name
*  scientific metaphysics for the reason of saying that what I think is obviously correct metaphysics
*  is about describing what exists at the most general scales. And if you're interested in what
*  exists in the physical world, you better pay attention to science, not to say that the
*  scientists can just answer those questions, but they do have relevant things to say to offer.
*  But then that group kind of subdivides into two, the ones who then specialize say to do philosophy
*  of physics. Now that really requires learning some math and some physics and at a, you know,
*  reasonably good scale, some people are you have full PhDs in physics, you know, but you certainly
*  have to devote some time to just studying math and physics to do this in a kind of specialized way.
*  And then there's another group of people who clearly acknowledge the relevance of the physics,
*  but they're not experts. And so they like to listen to the experts and try and figure what
*  they can draw out of it right without themselves delving so deeply into it. I would say that's
*  that's how the landscape goes. And but do they talk to each other these people? Are they to go
*  to the same conferences? Um, I yeah, I mean, they're certainly they do talk well, they're
*  they're in each other's presence. I mean, there are a lot of specialized conferences,
*  but there are conferences. I mean, I was just invited to be on a panel at the Metaphysics
*  Society of America. And I'll tell you, the people in that society are not people you'll ever run into
*  in, you know, they were doing a very different kind of metaphysics, but they were happy. I talked
*  about what I do and the way I think about it. And they didn't throw bricks at me. It wasn't
*  the way they thought about it. They were interested. They were interested. Yeah,
*  they were interested in they appreciated having the conversation. And I mean, philosophers tend
*  to be pretty open to talking about weird stuff, because that's more or less comes with the
*  territory. Whatever strikes them as weird, you still don't just reject it. Right? I guess what
*  I'm what I'm getting at, and I'm not trying to presume the right answer, because I honestly
*  don't know. But to what extent can we imagine smoothing over the conceptual differences between
*  thinking about physics and thinking about metaphysics? Like it really should be thinking
*  about reality is what we're doing, right? Yeah, I mean, I mean, we do, you know, I do need to
*  mention here that, again, you can be interested in metaphysics and not be a physicalist. So you'd say,
*  part of what I do really is not going to be informed by physics. If I'm a mathematical
*  Platonist, and I'm worried about mathematical reality, and I say, that's just not part of
*  physical reality. So I don't care how your physics comes out. That's a fair, you know,
*  that's a fair thing. So not all of metaphysics has to be hostile, you know, or all that interest,
*  it depends on, you know, where you're where you're focusing your attention. Okay. We actually, you
*  know, Barry Lauer was another person we had on recently. And Barry, he said something,
*  not on the podcast, sadly, but in informal conversation that was even stronger than
*  something I would say, I think he was being humorous about it. But he said, he remembers
*  very vividly being struck the day he realized that most problems of philosophy could be
*  cured or solved by statistical mechanics. And I think that he has a different view about you than
*  that. So we're running out of time a little bit. But I wanted you to give to have a chance to give
*  a little bit of your view of the arrow of time and things like that, which is the other giant
*  thing that people who care about foundations of physics spend their time worrying about.
*  Right. So let me actually start with the last thing first and just get it get it out in the
*  open. So people are auto, at least be aware of it. I would say it is it is kind of everybody has
*  this idea there's space and it's kind of three dimensional at least at large scales. And if I
*  talked about, say the north south direction at a certain point, if I went on to say, by the way,
*  space goes north to south, it doesn't go south to north. You'd look at me funny and say, what in
*  the world are you talking about? Right. The spatial thing, it just it there are two directions and
*  they're oppositely directed. But space itself doesn't go more one way than the other. I don't
*  even know what you mean. On the other hand, the person in the street, you say, you know, time goes
*  from from from past to future. Doesn't go from future to past. They again nod at you and say,
*  yeah, you know, tell me something new. Now, I happen to agree with that, that as I think time
*  is fundamentally different from space, temporal structure is fundamentally different from spatial
*  structure in the temporal structure does have a fundamental directionality to it and spatial
*  structure doesn't. This turns out to be a very contentious view among philosophers and physicists
*  for funny reasons, I would say I don't know that we have the time to go into but it surely is the
*  minority view. And it's a little bit of you just just to just to clarify, it's a little bit
*  different than there are physicists out there and philosophers who will question whether or not time
*  exists or whether it's fundamental. But here we're talking about the direction the direction of time.
*  Yes, that's right. That's right. There it would be even harder to deny the existence of time
*  altogether. But certainly the directionality is is hotly contested. I think time itself has a
*  direction. Now, it is clearly the case that there are temporal manifest temporal asymmetries
*  on any view. If you give me two pictures of somebody 10 years apart, usually I can look at
*  them and figure oh, this was the younger and this is the older, right? Because people tend to wrinkle
*  up. And now that's not maybe they had, you know, cosmetic surgery, I could get that wrong. But
*  there are certainly lots of very reliable temporal asymmetries. And those need an explanation,
*  simply saying time has a direction would not explain all by itself. Any of those observable
*  temporal asymmetries are what people sometimes call arrows of time. So I think all of that
*  is a perfectly good object of study. Even if you believe as I do that one of the things you can
*  invoke is that time is itself directed, right? That doesn't give me these observable asymmetries
*  like that. But it might be part of the explanation. How does it help?
*  Since people like David Albert and Barry and myself think that you don't need an intrinsic
*  arrow if you just have an initial condition that is doing all the work. Well, because a lot of the
*  explanation, I mean, we can do this in different levels, but let me do the first level. What do I
*  explain when I explaining something? Well, often, I think it's a kind of causal explanation. I talk
*  about cause and effect. And now you say, okay, but what distinguishes cause and effect? Offhand,
*  in many cases, causes precede the effects. I mean, if people often talk about running a movie
*  backward or imagining that, which of course, you can literally run a movie backward, but then
*  the end sequence comes before the title sequence, right? You still have a direction of time.
*  If you took that seriously as a movie of something in the normal direction, also,
*  all the causal structure would be reversed, right? What were causes would become effects.
*  And therefore, the structure of causal explanation would be different, right?
*  And so, you have to get a bit deep and statistical mechanics does come into this here in a way that
*  we couldn't get on the table clearly in a short period of time, where you not only have
*  causal explanations where you say this particular precise physical state gives rise to this later
*  one, but other kinds of statistical explanations where you say this kind of physical state,
*  I haven't precisely, but I'm going to constrain it in certain ways.
*  There's a class of various.
*  Gives rise to this kind of state. I mean, this is the sort of thing that you take a box of gas
*  and you say, if you wait a while, it'll eventually relax to an equilibrium. And that, of course,
*  shows a directionality to it because from this initial state, you can say in five minutes,
*  it'll be equilibrium. If you look at the equilibrium state at a generic level, a kind
*  of fuzzed out level, you couldn't say, oh, five minutes ago, it was in this non-equilibrium state.
*  So there's kind of asymmetry there, and that's connected to certain asymmetries in statistical
*  explanation, probabilistic explanation. Very interesting and deep, hard topic. A bit different
*  than worrying about, say, relativity, which you might say is about space-time structure,
*  quantum mechanics is about material structure. Statistical explanation is about a kind of
*  explanatory project and what goes into it and what succeeds as giving statistical explanations
*  of things. But I do think that reversing the direction of time, you might have a very good,
*  what you consider to be a very good statistical explanation of something as seen as it were in
*  one direction of time. And if you look at the other direction and say, wait, there's no explanation
*  at all. The explanatory part went away. All I can say is a massive coincidence.
*  Or else to be teleological and say the future is somehow, but the future is somehow affecting
*  the present. But I take it to be one of the great discoveries of the scientific revolution to get
*  rid of that kind of teleology. Does your view that time has an intrinsic direction affect what we
*  would call microphysics, the standard model of particle physics, for example, or could it?
*  Sure, it could. I mean, I think that it plays into your fundamental picture of space-time
*  structure. And of course, one needs an account of space-time structure to even begin to write
*  down what you think of as laws of physics. And I think there are very specific ways in which
*  having a direction, well, certainly having a direction, well, let me just give you a very
*  concrete thing one could say. Suppose I have a kind of grid, like a street grid, and I have
*  two points on it. And you ask me, OK, how many continuous paths are there that will take me from
*  A to B? And typically the answer, if the grid goes on forever, it's infinitely many because it can
*  kind of go short way or around or far around, go way out and come back. Now, suppose I put some
*  arrows on that grid. Right? So they're one way streets. Now it's not at all clear that this
*  number will always be infinite. Now it might be quite tightly constrained. The directionality
*  gives me a resource there that a lack of directionality doesn't have. And I think that's
*  actually quite important and plays out in trying to understand the laws of physics, but it's much
*  more complicated. It's much more complicated. But that's what you're thinking about these days.
*  That's one of the things I'm thinking about very hard. I mean, I've been working on thinking about
*  what space time could be like if they were actually not continuous but discrete at fundamental
*  scale. I worked a long time and did six chapters just on space, and now I have to bring in time.
*  And the time part really has to have a direction. Just for it to work, it has to have a direction.
*  You have to understand how the directionality comes into it.
*  What do you say for it to work?
*  For this scheme I have to be a kind of thing where you could do a plausible looking sort of physics
*  with.
*  Do you have a catchy name for your scheme?
*  Yeah, Full Discrete Geometry.
*  Full Discrete Geometry. Okay, good. And the time directedness has to be part of the story.
*  It's fundamental in it.
*  Okay. All right. Good. Well, we're looking forward to that.
*  So am I.
*  We'll be a little bit at some point. Yeah, I know. You said chapters.
*  Yeah. Well, I'm up on chapter eight now. I mean, the spatial part went real well. And then it was
*  like, okay, part two, let's bring in time. And then you realize it's a tricky business.
*  Is it quantum we're talking or classical?
*  This is all classical geometry. But quantum field theory, there is a connection to quantum
*  field theory, which I'll just state briefly. We talked about problems just in doing quantum
*  field theory, just mathematical problems. One way that this kind of bohemian or pilot wave approach
*  for quantum field theory was done was done by Bell. It's called Bell type quantum field theory.
*  And one thing he does is he puts it on a lattice. That is, he doesn't do it in continuous space.
*  He does it on a kind of discrete lattice. And you have these jumps from lattice points to
*  lattice points. That turns out to be very important to have a structure where you can
*  do the math in a clean way. Okay. Looking forward to the book coming out. We'll pre-advertise it here.
*  So here's the last, I'm not going to call it a question, thing to respond to.
*  When we talk about quantum mechanics, and as we say, you have to give up something maybe that was
*  hopeful or intuitive or whatever. And even in relativity, it seems like maybe the world is a
*  little bit different. Is there hope for fundamentally understanding why the world is this way? Like in
*  retrospect, can you say, oh yes, it had to be quantum mechanics, or are we just stuck with it?
*  Yeah, I think people like to say that why the quantum, you know, you'll get this thing. I think,
*  oh come on, just grow up. No, I mean, there's going to be foundations. There's going to be
*  one of the really hard questions in this whole topic is the question, where do I stop digging?
*  Right? Where is my spade turned? Where do I say, okay, I've hit a foundation here.
*  It looks like this is a plausible place to stop. And all you can say is, yeah, this is the way it
*  is. Could it have been some other way? Yeah, it could have been some other way. It isn't.
*  This looks like a plausible place to stop. If you think, if you're never going to be satisfied,
*  okay, then you're never going to be satisfied. And the problem is there are dangers in both
*  directions, right? If you're too easily satisfied, you'll stop digging when in fact, you could
*  discover a lot of interesting structure lying underneath where you've stopped. But if you're
*  too pigheaded, you're going to get to the bottom and still be banging your head against it forever
*  because there is nothing underneath it, right? So there's a kind of, you know, connoisseurs feel
*  for where's a reasonable place to stop. But I don't think you're going to be stopped by some
*  master principle that says it could only have been this way.
*  How could you expect that? The world is kind of contingent.
*  Well, that seems like a reasonable place to stop. So Tim Well, then thanks very much for being on
*  the Mindscape podcast. Can I actually, before you do that, because I'm here and I have many
*  voices, many years than I ever kind of normally will have, and I'm going to just take advantage
*  of you and say, one of the things I'm doing is trying to promote foundations of physics.
*  And later I'm doing it is I founded this thing called the John Bell Institute for the Foundations
*  of Physics. And we are at the very moment, a kind of critical moment where we're trying to buy a
*  physical place for us to live. And if anybody out there likes people who talk about this stuff and
*  thinks they should have a place to go where they can meet and talk to each other, we have a GoFundMe
*  or you could go to www.johnbellinstitute.org. If anybody would like to help us out in any way,
*  it's our moment of need and we would appreciate it greatly.
*  Good to be reminded of that. I will also mention that in the intro and put links
*  on the webpage. I can mention it because it's an audio podcast. Tim is wearing a very fetching
*  John Bell Institute polo shirt right now. So that could be swag. I don't know. Is that a GoFundMe?
*  This, to get the shirt, you got to come to the place. The shirt, the only exception to that are
*  my parents who are 95. And I said, you can have shirts without actually going. But this is, this,
*  you can only wear the shirt if you've been there and you've seen this beautiful island in Croatia
*  and enjoyed it and then you get a shirt. But it is actually an important thing. I'm glad you
*  mentioned it because it's a reminder that ideas are great and conversations about them are great,
*  but institutions also matter for getting these ideas. And this is the problem is this field is
*  an academic orphan. Yeah. Right. Foundations of physics doesn't fit. I mean, it's kind of doesn't
*  fit in physics departments and it doesn't really fit in philosophy departments. And so, you know,
*  if it's going to live, a place has to be made for it. All right. Let's look it up on the internet.
*  So in that case, Tim Walden, thanks very much for being on the Winescape Podcast. Thank you.
