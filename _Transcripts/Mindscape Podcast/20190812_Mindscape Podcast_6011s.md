There are many mysteries surrounding quantum mechanics. To me, the biggest mysteries are why physicists haven't yet agreed on a complete understanding of the theory, and even more why they mostly seem content not to try. This puzzling attitude has historical roots that go back to the Bohr-Einstein debates. Adam Becker, in his book What Is Real?, looks at this history, and discusses how physicists have shied away from the foundations of quantum mechanics in the subsequent years. We discuss why this has been the case, and talk about some of the stubborn iconoclasts who insisted on thinking about it anyway.

Adam Becker received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Michigan. He is currently a science writer and a Visiting Scholar at the Center for Science, Technology, Medicine & Society at UC Berkeley. His book What Is Real? The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics comes out in paperback on Sept. 3, 2019.

# Mindscape 59 | Adam Becker on the Curious History of Quantum Mechanics
**Mindscape Podcast:** [August 12, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em7dkYZTetE)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and today we have another episode of quantum mechanics.
*  I know this makes everyone very excited. Today I'm talking to Adam Becker who is a PhD in physics
*  but has gone the route of becoming a freelance science writer and
*  most interestingly for our current purposes, he's the author of a book called What Is Real?
*  This is a really wonderful book. I've been recommending it right and left.
*  It's about the history of quantum mechanics in the 20th century
*  but it's not the typical history. Most histories of quantum mechanics focus on from 1900 to 1935
*  and what Adam really does is look at what happens after
*  1935. He does a little bit of the early stuff, but the point is that as I talk about in my own book, Something Deeply Hidden,
*  there's this weird thing where quantum mechanics is invented.
*  It comes with this giant problem called the measurement problem. What really happens when you measure a quantum system?
*  Why do the rules seem to be different etc?
*  And then after a very brief flurry of interest in talking about the measurement problem with people like Bohr and
*  Einstein and Schrodinger going back and forth, it's forgotten. It's just dropped. It is in fact becomes it becomes
*  disreputable to even think about the measurement problem.
*  So Adam really digs into the history of the people who refused to be quieted
*  when talking about this huge problem in physics. The plucky band of rebels who really said no, actually
*  this is kind of an important thing. We need to think about it.
*  So he talks about Hugh Everett, of course, but also David Bohm, John Bell, a lot of the
*  experimentalists like Clauser and Aspey and others who really tackled this problem and tried to remind the physics community
*  that despite what their advisors told them, the measurement problem in quantum mechanics is really really important.
*  So it's not about here solving the measurement problem.
*  It's sort of about the history of how physicists talked about that problem and it's a fascinating history with colorful characters.
*  So you'll both learn a little bit about quantum mechanics, but also learn a little bit about the history and sociology of
*  physics, which is really much more fascinating than it has any right to be. So let's go.
*  Adam Becker, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Well, thanks for having me. It's great to be here.
*  Of course, this is a slightly unusual show just because they're all slightly unusual. I don't know why I keep saying that.
*  Sure. Quantum mechanics, I should say this is a slightly usual show.
*  It's the single topic I've been talking about.
*  I'm not sure if you've ever heard of quantum mechanics.
*  I've heard of quantum mechanics.
*  I've heard of quantum mechanics.
*  I've heard of quantum mechanics.
*  Quantum mechanics, I should say this is a slightly usual show.
*  It's the single topic I do the most because I'm coming out with a book on quantum mechanics.
*  Sure.
*  Now, I do quantum mechanics for a living, but you've written a book that's already out about quantum mechanics.
*  So for the purposes of this interview, I'm going to pretend that I don't know much about quantum mechanics.
*  If that's okay. I'm going to try to get it out from you.
*  Sure.
*  And specifically, is it okay to characterize your book as a history of quantum mechanics?
*  Yeah, I think that's what it is.
*  Yeah, it's definitely a history of quantum mechanics.
*  It is, I would say, a somewhat unusual history of quantum mechanics.
*  And I think it's a good history of quantum mechanics, but I'm biased.
*  Well, it's unusual.
*  I guess you're going to say that in a sense that, you know, history, there's a set of things that happen, but you have an angle, right?
*  You have a theme.
*  I have an angle.
*  That's one of the things that makes it unusual in that I think that the sort of dominant take on what quantum mechanics says, this thing that's called the Copenhagen interpretation, but also goes by other names like the orthodox interpretation or whatever.
*  I am not a fan, to put it mildly.
*  The other thing, though, that I think makes my book somewhat unusual as a history of quantum mechanics is, you know, there are a lot of other popular histories of quantum mechanics out there, and most of them sort of start in, say, 1900 with Max Planck.
*  And then they say, you know, Max Planck found the black body radiation law, and that was the beginning of the quantum revolution.
*  And then they sort of move forward from that with Einstein and the photoelectric effect in Bohr and his model of the atom.
*  And then, you know, they end with and then Heisenberg and Schrödinger developed, you know, fully fledged modern quantum mechanics, and everybody lived happily ever after.
*  And then maybe, you know, Einstein and Bohr got into a fight, but Bohr won.
*  And then, you know, 30 years later, John Bell did a thing, and that's the end of the book, right?
*  My book kind of inverts that structure.
*  I only have a chapter or two at the beginning about the very early days of quantum mechanics, and most of the book focuses on stuff that happened from, say, 1945 onward.
*  Which is fascinating.
*  So just so there's if there's any people out there in the audience who think quantum mechanics is fun, but history is not, it's really, really illuminating to go through this particular kind of history because you see where people got certain attitudes.
*  And, you know, quantum mechanics is hard, and it shows us a lot about physics and the physics community, right?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, I think I think that there is general attitude or idea among some physicists and some scientists of various stripes that history and personalities and culture don't really matter that much in science and aren't really reflected in science.
*  And that's just kind of wrong.
*  It's just the objective truth, Adam.
*  What are you talking about?
*  We just find the truth and we lay it out there for people.
*  Yeah, that's clearly true.
*  Science is a body of facts.
*  It's not a human process.
*  Yeah.
*  But science is a human process, right?
*  It's affected by all other human processes, right?
*  Which is not to say that science is just, you know, bullshit that people make up.
*  Well, we certainly make choices along the way about how to do science, right?
*  What's important?
*  What questions we're going to tackle and so forth.
*  And quantum mechanics is a great example.
*  Why don't we give you your version of what is quantum mechanics?
*  Oh, boy.
*  Quantum mechanics is a phenomenally successful physical theory.
*  It is the best theory we have to account for the behavior and predict the behavior of very small objects, but also things that are constituted of very small objects, which are very small objects.
*  Which is basically everything.
*  And so quantum mechanics.
*  So one definition of quantum mechanics is it is well, hold on quantum physics, right?
*  I don't care.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever you want to do the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Quantum mechanics.
*  We usually use that for the non relativistic theory.
*  But anyway, yeah.
*  Quantum physics, because it's this theory for tiny things and things made of tiny things,
*  which is everything.
*  It's basically our best physical theory of everything with a little asterisk on it.
*  And the asterisk is general relativity, which is a whole other thing.
*  But basically anything that where gravity doesn't matter that much, where that much means matters less than it does.
*  I don't know.
*  Inside of the heart of a dense star or near a black hole.
*  Quantum mechanics is fantastic.
*  OK.
*  But what does it actually say?
*  What does it?
*  Let's imagine someone is listening who just doesn't know about uncertainty or wave functions
*  or anything like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's the question, right?
*  Quantum mechanics is so.
*  So one way of answering the question is quantum mechanics is this really good mathematical
*  tool for predicting the outcomes of experiments and predicting how various physical phenomena
*  will play out.
*  As for what it tells us is going on in the world, that's a question of interpreting the mathematical structure
*  and the results of the experiments that we do.
*  And that's exactly what's at stake in the story that I'm telling in my book.
*  The question of how to interpret this incredibly successful theory to figure out what it's telling us about the world
*  is very controversial and has been since the early days of quantum mechanics back in the 1920s
*  I mean, that's why I don't think we've actually said the name of my book yet, but that's why the title of my book is
*  What is real?
*  Right.
*  It's not a finished story.
*  And that question is the question at hand.
*  So yeah, you do notice this whenever you're trying to talk about whenever I'm trying to talk about quantum mechanics
*  is that you can't say anything about what the theory says without choosing a formulation of it, right?
*  Without taking sides in these interpretation wars.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, you know, I could I could say something that would make you as a many worlds person very happy and say,
*  well, quantum mechanics tells us that things can be in more than one place at once in different universes
*  and very small systems composed of a very small number of things can interfere with their counterparts in other universes.
*  But then when you get large aggregate number of things, that doesn't happen as much unless you perform special tricks.
*  That would make a lot of people very angry if I said that that was what quantum mechanics said without qualification.
*  Right.
*  You got to be able to make people angry.
*  Oh, don't worry.
*  I have no trouble making people angry.
*  There are a lot of people angry with me.
*  Well, how about I mean, why don't we just be a little bit historical and imagine that we are there at the Solvay Conference, right?
*  International.
*  For those of you who don't know, this was this 1927.
*  I think.
*  Yes.
*  It was the moment when quantum mechanics sort of matured.
*  Yeah.
*  And all the great bright people in the physics world were there and they had it out and tempers flared.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  No, this was I don't know.
*  We're in L.A. It was the Oscars of quantum mechanics.
*  Right.
*  So, yeah, there were this was this was a major, major conference in 1927 in Belgium and all of the key players in the formulation of quantum mechanics are almost all of them.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, for example, Albert Einstein was there.
*  Niels Bohr, the great Danish physicist, was there.
*  Louis Du Bois was there.
*  Werner Heisenberg was there.
*  Erwin Schrödinger was there.
*  Max Born.
*  Plonk was.
*  Yeah, Plonk was there.
*  How Lee, how Lee, Marie Curie, Dirac.
*  Yeah, like everybody was there.
*  I think Rutherford was there.
*  Like everyone was there.
*  And.
*  And this was sort of a great coming out party for the the version of quantum mechanics or the way of thinking about quantum mechanics that Heisenberg and Born and Bohr and Pauli had sort of cobbled together, which is not to say that those four were the only ones involved, nor is it to say that those four all agreed with each other, but they agreed enough that that they were able to do it.
*  And so they were able to put together a presentation that they gave and and specifically presentation that Born and Heisenberg, I believe, gave in which they said, OK, here's the theory.
*  Here's how it works.
*  It's done.
*  It's a complete theory and you can't add anything to it.
*  And it doesn't let you say anything about what's going on before you take a measurement.
*  And this is what we call the Copenhagen Interpretation.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  And that's the question of the Copenhagen Interpretation.
*  No one agrees on the no one.
*  That's the other thing.
*  But it's still what we teach our students today.
*  We teach our students something that plausibly goes by that name.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, because because there's you know, here's another way of answering your earlier question of what quantum mechanics is.
*  And then I'll get back to the Solvay Conference.
*  This is a pair of rules for predicting what's going to happen in the world.
*  One of the rules is this thing called the Schrödinger equation, which is exactly the kind of thing that we love to have as a law of nature.
*  It is deterministic.
*  It's a beautiful partial differential equation.
*  It's very, very pretty.
*  It says that there are these things in the world or that there are things whether they're in the world is controversial.
*  Right.
*  So there are these things so hard.
*  But there are things.
*  There are things called wave functions.
*  And as the name sort of implies, they kind of wave and, you know, they they undulate in a way that is perfectly predictable through the beautiful mathematics of the Schrödinger equation.
*  And then there's this other thing called the Born rule.
*  And the Born rule doesn't look like a normal law of nature.
*  It doesn't look like the laws of nature that physicists were accustomed to in the 1920s, which is not in and of itself a strike against it.
*  That's fine.
*  We could be dramatic and new.
*  Exactly. That's good.
*  You know, or can be good.
*  But the Born rule also Max Born, not the concept of being born.
*  That's true.
*  Yes. Named after Max Born.
*  The same with the Schrödinger equation is named after Erwin Schrödinger.
*  And to give credit where credit is due, Heisenberg came up with something sort of like the Schrödinger equation.
*  It was something that was mathematically equivalent.
*  But Max Born, he said, OK, these wave functions, there is another way that they behave.
*  They when you when you look at something that has a wave function associated with it, when you take a measurement of something that has a wave function associated with it, which is supposed to be everything in quantum mechanics.
*  That wave function collapses.
*  It goes to zero everywhere except in one spot or in one spot, like in one spot or in one way.
*  Yeah, one value.
*  Everything, everything but one value goes to zero.
*  And which one it's going to be is probabilistic.
*  Which one is going to not be zero is probabilistic.
*  And you can determine that by looking at the values of the wave function the moment before you make the measurement.
*  And the problem is that these two rules for how wave functions work contradict each other.
*  And so there's the question, when do you use one and when do you use the other one?
*  So one rule for when you're not looking at it.
*  Yes.
*  Another rule for when you are.
*  Yes, something like that.
*  And so the question the question is, which one do you use when?
*  And the traditional answer, the Copenhagen answer is to say, oh, you use the Born rule, this collapse rule when you're looking at things, when you're making a measurement and use the Schrodinger equation for when you're not looking.
*  What do we mean by looking?
*  What's a measurement?
*  What counts as a measurement?
*  Who has to do it?
*  Right.
*  Do you need a PhD to do a measurement?
*  What if you just glance at it?
*  What if you just glance at it?
*  What if a monkey does it?
*  What if a bacterium does it?
*  All these questions.
*  So this this sort of assorted host of questions that go along with this one core question of which rule do we use when that's the measurement problem.
*  Right.
*  The measurement problem of quantum mechanics.
*  Yeah.
*  And the Copenhagen interpretation has claims to have a solution to this.
*  Well, claims to have many solutions to this because the Copenhagen interpretation isn't any one thing.
*  But at the Solvay conference, the solution that was proposed was it's not right.
*  It's not good scientific practice to talk about what's going on when you're not looking.
*  So the philosophical maneuver that they made.
*  Yes.
*  Something along those lines.
*  And not everyone was happy with this.
*  In particular, Albert Einstein was very unhappy with this.
*  And so he starts getting into it with Niels Bohr in particular, but really the rest of them as well.
*  He proposes a couple of thought experiments to try to get around this to show why this can't quite be right.
*  Or at least can't be the whole story.
*  He is misunderstood basically right off the bat.
*  And this goes on for years.
*  So there's this popular idea that Einstein just couldn't handle or couldn't keep up with quantum mechanics.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's such a strange myth.
*  Because the opposite of true.
*  Yes, the opposite of true, which usually we call that false.
*  But I mean, Einstein, first of all, was one of the founders of quantum mechanics.
*  His 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect postulated the existence of quantized packets of light, photons.
*  And that's hardly the only work he did on quantum mechanics throughout his career.
*  He did a lot of very, very important work on quantum mechanics both before and after, though probably less after.
*  The full modern formulation of quantum mechanics shows up in the mid 1920s.
*  There is no evidence whatsoever that he couldn't keep up with it.
*  He definitely understood it.
*  He spent a lot of time thinking about it.
*  He once said that he spent more time thinking about quantum mechanics or I think the phrase was that he used up more brain grease on quantum mechanics than he did on relativity, which is what he's more known for.
*  I mean, he got the Nobel Prize for his work on quantum mechanics, not for his work on relativity, which is a weird historical quirk.
*  And Nobel prizes aren't that important anyway.
*  He was upset.
*  And I think it makes perfect sense if you don't know a lot about quantum mechanics.
*  I think you should sympathize with why he was upset at the Solvay conference, both because there are these two different rules that you use under different circumstances and just because it all seemed so ill posed.
*  The whole point of physics is to be precise and beautiful and exact and this hand wavy thing about making measurements somehow sneaked in.
*  Yeah, I mean, he Einstein Einstein had a what was at the time a fairly common sense view of what physics was about.
*  He said physics is about describing what's in the world.
*  And now you're telling me no, physics is about predicting the outcomes of experiments.
*  What's an experiment?
*  If it's really only about predicting the outcomes of experiments, then how are we supposed to use it to explain things that happen in the natural world when we're not around?
*  Which people were doing already at the time.
*  You know, quantum mechanics has always been used to do more than just predict the outcomes of experiments.
*  It has also been used to explain all kinds of very interesting natural phenomena ranging from stuff as basic as why does the sun shine to why is it that silicon behaves in this funny way where it's not really an insulator and it's not really a conductor.
*  It's a semiconductor.
*  Right.
*  And that lets us build computers.
*  So everything from basic fundamental facts about the world around us, like why I can't pass my hand through the table to all sorts of strange and wonderful modern technology like LEDs or most of this recording equipment.
*  And I thought you mentioned this very quickly, but I want to dwell on this philosophical leap made by the Copenhagen interpretation.
*  So if you really say that the job of your physical theory in this case is to simply predict the outcomes of experiments.
*  And they said this, the advocates of Copenhagen, as far as I can tell, were sometimes more explicit about this than others.
*  They were never completely on the same page.
*  But OK, there's a version of it which really says that.
*  And it's almost solipsistic, idealistic.
*  And if you really push it, you're saying it's all in the mind.
*  You're saying like the world as something that exists external to me is irrelevant to physics.
*  What is important to physics is the predictions that I can make and the observations that I can make.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think that that is definitely one way to take what they were saying.
*  You know, I don't think that there is any single Copenhagen interpretation.
*  And while Niels Bohr and Max Born and Pauli and Heisenberg and the others may have each had their own individual positions,
*  I don't think that you can combine all of those to make something coherent.
*  And in some cases, like with Niels Bohr, it's not even clear what each individual's position was.
*  There's no consensus.
*  Within one paper.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Speaking of people being mad at me, this is something that some people are mad at me for.
*  They say, but you said that Niels Bohr had this position.
*  No, I didn't.
*  I didn't say that Niels Bohr had any position.
*  I don't know what position he had.
*  Neither does anybody else.
*  I just quoted him a few times in my book because like if you try to translate what he says or paraphrase, people are going to be mad at you.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  No, he was a brilliant physicist and a very interesting man who did lots of wonderful things.
*  And he just was not a particularly clear writer or speaker.
*  Well, David Albert, when I interviewed him for the podcast, he had a wonderful take on Niels Bohr.
*  He said that Niels Bohr was the person in history who he would most like to have met personally.
*  His reason why is because people would meet him and they would come back after talking to Niels Bohr.
*  And number one, they would say this was the most brilliant, wonderful, transcendentally wise human being.
*  And they would start spouting complete nonsense about the foundation of quantum mechanics.
*  How can one person have this effect?
*  Yeah, no, it's a real question.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I don't know if he's the person in history I'd most like to invite to dinner, but I'm certainly very curious about him.
*  When I consider potential sponsors for Mindscape, I'm naturally drawn to educational services.
*  But Policy Genius can be thought of as an educational service when it comes time to search for insurance policies,
*  whether it's life insurance, home insurance, auto insurance.
*  You go to the website and you can find multiple quotes from the leading insurers around the country.
*  So you can pick which is the policy that best fits you.
*  They're at the right price.
*  They do not add cost to the insurance policies that you'd be signing up for.
*  They simply get a commission from the different companies that are selling them.
*  And so you can look at all the different policies, what they involve, and pick the one that is best for you.
*  What I really like is that you don't need to tell them your contact info first.
*  You don't need to give them your name or email before they give you the quote.
*  They also have experts on staff who can help you search through all of these different policies.
*  So when you make insurance choices, just like when you do anything else, it's best to be educated.
*  And at PolicyGenius.com, that's what you'll be.
*  But they did win the PR battle.
*  Yes, they did.
*  After Solvay, it's more or less became standard conventional wisdom that the Copenhagen interpretation was how we think about quantum mechanics.
*  And there were a few people who didn't like that, like Einstein, also Schrodinger.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  But they became increasingly marginalized, at least in terms of how we think about quantum mechanics.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  Yeah, they, you know, people thought Einstein and Schrodinger were kind of out of touch and kooky.
*  They were kooky, but they were not wrong, I think, to have doubts about this.
*  But, you know, their work was increasingly outside of the mainstream of the work that the rest of the physics community was engaging in.
*  Not in the sense that, oh, it was wrong or fringe, but in that the rest of the physics community was just not thinking about these things.
*  They were working on other things.
*  And part of that was for really obvious historical reasons.
*  This debate was going on in the early to mid 1930s, mostly in Europe.
*  There were some things also going on in the 1930s in Europe into the 40s that were somewhat distracting to a lot of people.
*  And physicists in particular had other things to worry about.
*  Yes, they did.
*  Yeah.
*  So, you know, by the 1940s, people were working on other things such as the Manhattan Project.
*  And so and then and then after the Manhattan Project, after the war, suddenly there was this realization due to, you know, the the I hesitate to use the word success for the Manhattan Project.
*  But due to the achievements of the Manhattan Project, there was recognition by governments and industry and the military that there was a lot of value to be had in funding massive amounts of applied physics.
*  And so rather than worrying about the foundations of quantum mechanics, this this influx of money and the people who came along with that were concerned with working out implications of quantum physics, which is a good thing to do.
*  You know, there was a lot of really, really great science done in that period.
*  And I do think that if the attitude had been, OK, you know what?
*  There's a problem here.
*  The foundations will come back to it later.
*  There's something that we need to figure out.
*  But in the meantime, we have a lot of really interesting work to do.
*  And maybe that'll help us understand the theory better and that will shed more light on things.
*  If that had been the attitude, I wouldn't have had a book to write.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that and I think that's a very sensible attitude.
*  And so there are theories in the history of science that have worked that way.
*  You know, Newton himself, right, talked about his own theories in this way sometimes.
*  But that's not what happened.
*  Sorry, that's not what happened.
*  Instead, it was, oh, those problems are solved.
*  We don't have to worry about the foundations.
*  Now we can work on these applications of the theory.
*  And the foundations, we mean, is the correct attitude towards this measurement problem
*  really just to only ask about measurement outcomes or is there some other version of
*  quantum mechanics, some other way of thinking about things that is more traditionally physically
*  scientific?
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the with this influx of money and people that came after World War Two questions
*  like, but what does the theory mean, were kind of swept under the rug.
*  And there's been a lot of really good work on how the changes in physics after World
*  War Two led to changes in the way that quantum mechanics was taught.
*  That's been done by the historian of science, David Kaiser at MIT, who has gone back through
*  physics curricula and textbooks from the time and found that the larger the classroom, the
*  less time spent on the meaning and foundations of the theory and the more time spent on applications.
*  And I think that makes sense.
*  It's easier to teach people how to solve a partial differential equation than it is to
*  talk about these thorny philosophical issues at the heart of the theory.
*  I do think that we'll get to the plucky band of rebels who did want to keep thinking about
*  the foundations.
*  And blew up the Death Star.
*  But let's, I mean, let me try, since my usual spiel is what a huge mistake it was to ignore
*  the foundations, let's try to be charitable to the people who did ignore the foundations.
*  So as you said, there's a lot of applied physics to do.
*  There was even non-applied physics.
*  When Murray Gell-Mann is working out the SU-3 symmetry group the eightfold way, there's
*  no applications of this to the military or anything like that.
*  But so what would someone back then have said if you said, why aren't you thinking about
*  quantum mechanics as a foundational theory?
*  Well, I think.
*  I think that answers would have varied, right?
*  One answer that someone could have given was, but we are, you know, take a look at, I think
*  since the late 1940s, early 1950s, speaking of non-applied foundational work of a different
*  kind, take a look at what happened with, how do I describe this without using jargon?
*  There was this little shift in the way that atoms emitted light called the Lamb shift.
*  The Lamb shift, right.
*  A slight miscalibration between what you predicted and what you saw.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And at first, people just thought it would go away.
*  And then as experimental techniques and theory got better and better, the mismatch got more
*  and more obvious until it became clear there was a real problem.
*  And this led to the development of a new foundational theory of quantum physics called quantum electrodynamics.
*  And this is, you know, what the single piece of work that Richard Feynman is most well
*  known for, as well as Julian Schwinger, Tobanaga, and Freeman Dyson.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But okay, I mean, to be fair, that could be classified as a particular theory within the
*  quantum mechanical umbrella rather than the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  Sure, that's true.
*  But if you were to ask these people...
*  It had nothing to do with the measurement.
*  That's right.
*  It had nothing to do with the measurement problem, but it certainly wasn't really applied.
*  Sure.
*  Right.
*  So if you ask those people, you know, why aren't you paying attention to the measurement
*  problem?
*  They might have said something like, the theory works very well.
*  This has all been worked out, and we're focusing on real problems, not chasing phantoms.
*  So that's one possible answer.
*  Another possible answer would be to say, well, what do you mean?
*  You know, rather than to say the problem's been solved, they would say, no, there was
*  never a problem there.
*  Right?
*  It's not a problem.
*  Right.
*  You know, they might take some version of the Copenhagen interpretation and really swallow
*  it entirely and say, no, it really is all about these observations that we make.
*  That's really all that matters.
*  You know, we're very good at doing physics.
*  Physicists are very good at doing physics.
*  We're not always good at describing how we're doing physics.
*  Oh, we're terrible.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's okay.
*  Those who cannot do teach.
*  Sometimes those who can do don't know how to teach.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  But yeah, I mean, you know, just the same way that we deny, oh, you know, things outside
*  of the realm of science have no influence on science itself.
*  You can sort of see somebody saying, oh, no, no, no, no, physics is definitely all about
*  the outcomes of measurements.
*  And then, you know, they go off and do something that's clearly not about the no one ever said
*  that before quantum mechanics.
*  Right.
*  I mean, I guess I guess mock might have said that.
*  Yeah.
*  Mock said things kind of like that.
*  There were philosophers.
*  Yeah.
*  Mock was both a philosopher and a physicist sort of.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah, people people definitely did say things kind of like that beforehand.
*  In fact, some people thought that that's what Einstein had been saying in 1905 when he came
*  up with special relativity.
*  And that was a big inspiration for them.
*  Though if you then go back and take a look at Einstein's other work from 1905, it's very
*  clear that actually that's not really the kind of thing that he thought.
*  Okay.
*  Which Einstein and also Schrodinger, who was sort of on his side, they didn't give up,
*  you know, post Solvay conference.
*  And so and they're not giving up was a huge boon to humankind in the sense that they basically
*  invented entanglement.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, yeah, it forced the rest of the physics community to understand that entanglement
*  was maybe the defining trait of quantum mechanics.
*  You should tell us what entanglement is.
*  Yes.
*  So that's another thing where no matter how I describe it, it's going to be picking some
*  interpretation.
*  So let me see what I can do.
*  Pick the right.
*  Yeah, pick the right one.
*  Clearly.
*  Yeah.
*  The joke here, of course, is that you have a preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  and I just have an anti preferred interpretation of quantum mechanics.
*  But yeah, so entanglement quantum mechanics makes it very clear that under really a wide
*  variety of circumstances, you can have two things that are widely separated particles
*  or whatever particles or whatever really that, you know, despite the fact that they are very
*  far apart, you know, they could be on other sides of the solar system.
*  And despite the fact that there's no obvious connection between them, there are instantaneous
*  correlations in experiments that you conduct on each of the two of them.
*  And you can account for that in several different ways.
*  And that's another one of the things that's at stake in this interpretation debate.
*  Right.
*  So the reason why Einstein.
*  Yeah, see, two particles far away quantum mechanics says that when we measure them,
*  all we do is predict a probability for getting certain outcomes.
*  But what Einstein and Podolsky and Rosen say that the probability of getting one thing
*  is deeply affected by doing a measurement on the other one, even if they're really far
*  away.
*  Exactly.
*  And sort of this seems to violate at least the spirit of Einstein's theory of special
*  relativity.
*  Yes.
*  I think that's what he said about it, but it doesn't actually let you send signals
*  faster than the speed of light or anything like that.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You can prove that you can't use it to send signals like that.
*  You know, it's it looks like an instantaneous influence.
*  It doesn't look like something that you could use for instantaneous communication.
*  And so why did Einstein think this was a big deal?
*  Einstein thought this was a big deal because he saw no reason to believe in any kind of
*  instantaneous influence.
*  He said, well, if we really want to say that we can't talk about what's going on before
*  we make measurements, then we have to say it's an instantaneous influence because you
*  make a measurement way over here and you make a measurement way over there and they have
*  correlated outcomes all the time.
*  So if it really, you know, if there was really no fact of the matter before you made the
*  measurement, then they must have been conspiring immediately across great distances.
*  He said you could do the reasonable thing and say that, no, when you first sent them
*  off in different directions, they already had a sort of agreed upon set of properties.
*  And so that lets you get around this without saying that, you know, the two objects have
*  this sort of long distance conspiracy going on.
*  So even though we couldn't predict what our measurement outcomes were, the particles knew
*  what their measurement outcomes were going to be.
*  Exactly.
*  And so he says, given that the two options are something totally normal like that, or
*  this long distance, you know, what he called spooky action at a distance, he chose to our
*  number one.
*  And given that those were apparently the two options on the table at the time, that seemed
*  like a reasonable thing for him to do.
*  And the response that he received was not great.
*  Niels Bohr wrote a sort of famously impenetrable response, which he later apologized for how
*  poorly written it was, but then didn't really proceed to elaborate on what he had meant.
*  I was told that part of it was even printed in the wrong order.
*  Is that okay?
*  Okay, so right.
*  So the printing in the wrong order.
*  This is this is really inside baseball.
*  So it was not originally printed in the wrong order.
*  However, in in, you know, the dark days before the internet, if you wanted to find Bohr's
*  reply to the EPR paper, you know, the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paper, you had to go find it
*  in a book.
*  And the book where it was sort of most famously and widely available was a book from the early
*  1980s called I think quantum theory and measurement.
*  It's a big red book.
*  And in the first, I think in all of the first edition printings of that book, two pages
*  of Bohr's reply were swapped, and it's only like a four or five page reply.
*  So that's a pretty big difference.
*  And and the story, which is, I think, impossible to verify, is that nobody noticed for years
*  because they couldn't understand anyway.
*  Yeah, differences make what order the pages are in.
*  And also, you know, there's the Bohr's replies sort of serve this very important social function
*  just by existing because people could say, oh, you're not, you know, you don't have to
*  worry about that EPR thing.
*  Bohr worked it out.
*  It's on that page.
*  And so people didn't actually read it.
*  It was just there.
*  But yeah, you can now, of course, download it online and and whatnot.
*  But a story that I know is true, because, you know, I don't know if nobody noticed it.
*  It definitely was printed in the wrong order.
*  When I first read it, I first read Bohr's reply, I guess it was 2005.
*  So I did not have to get it from that book.
*  I did get it from the Internet.
*  I had the pages in the right order.
*  I printed them out.
*  I read it.
*  And then I went to the professor that I was working with at the time.
*  I said, you know, this is a really bad translation.
*  Is there a better translation available into English?
*  Because, you know, I thought, oh, well, you know, Bohr wasn't a native English speaker.
*  Maybe this was written in Danish.
*  I see where this is going.
*  Yeah.
*  So the professor told me, no, no, Adam, he wrote this in English.
*  This is the original.
*  Yeah.
*  So, yeah, it's just a fabulously impenetrable reply.
*  But like you say, it let the rest of the community say, oh, yeah, Einstein's objection.
*  And by the way, Einstein's objection was not quantum mechanics is wrong.
*  Right.
*  It was just that it was just a stepping stone toward a bigger theory that we would someday
*  have.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  He he said that it was simply incomplete.
*  In fact, I think that was the title of the paper.
*  You know, can quantum mechanical description of reality be considered complete?
*  Not correct.
*  So, yeah, no, people thought that Einstein was wrong.
*  Einstein actually wrote a letter to Schrodinger shortly after the EPR paper came out saying
*  that he had gotten letters from a couple dozen different physicists from around the world
*  explaining why he was wrong.
*  And none of them agreed with each other.
*  So, yeah, Einstein and Schrodinger sort of laughing at everybody else behind their backs.
*  Schrodinger, meanwhile, writes a paper in support of the EPR position saying, look,
*  you know, this is this this long distance connection.
*  This is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics.
*  It's everywhere.
*  And you can't really get around it.
*  And to show you another kind of example of the same thing, let's talk about a cat in
*  a box with radiation and a vial of cyanide.
*  And so this is where this is where the famous Schrodinger's cat thought experiment comes
*  from.
*  That's right.
*  And so Schrodinger points this out as, you know, he comes up with this thought experiment
*  to explain why there must be some, you know, deeper fact about the world.
*  Or so he thought that quantum mechanics doesn't capture because otherwise, you know, maybe
*  you can have a particle that's not in any particular state before you look.
*  But the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment says, well, if you have a particle in that
*  state, you can set up an experiment where a cat is neither dead nor alive before you
*  look and saying that a particles in a subatomic particle that we have no direct experience
*  with is in neither one state nor the other.
*  That's one thing.
*  But cats are either dead or alive.
*  There are cats in this apartment right now.
*  I haven't seen them.
*  I am sure that they are either dead or alive.
*  Yes. In fact, they're alive.
*  Yes. OK. Yes.
*  Yeah. But OK.
*  But just get the philosophy on the table here.
*  Yeah. Einstein and Podolsky and Rosen make this point about spooky action at a distance.
*  But they didn't just say.
*  And that's obviously crazy.
*  Like Schrodinger with his cat.
*  His argument was really at the level of that's obviously crazy.
*  Surely you don't believe that.
*  That's true. That's true.
*  No. The EPR thought experiment in that respect is more rigorous.
*  EPR was a little more rigorous.
*  They wanted to make the case that if you believe that there really is something actually
*  happening at every location in space in ways that they tried to make carefully defined
*  and so forth, then quantum mechanics couldn't be complete.
*  And this is going to skip ahead a little bit.
*  But then John Bell comes along and says that, OK, Einstein is basically sketching out an
*  aspiration. Someday we'll have a better theory that explains all this without spooky action
*  at a distance. And Bell basically proved that no such theory can ever reproduce the predictions
*  of quantum mechanics.
*  Yeah, Bell.
*  People have called Bell the person who proved Einstein wrong.
*  People have also called Bell the person who proved Einstein right.
*  I think that neither of those are really correct, though I'm more sympathetic to the second
*  one, because what Bell proved was that Einstein was right to be worried, right.
*  But that his proposed solution couldn't work because you can modify the EPR thought experiment
*  in this very subtle and brilliant way that that that will basically give you a real
*  experiment that you could build.
*  And the results of that experiment, if they conform with the predictions of quantum
*  mechanics, can't be accounted for with this sort of pre-existing answers that Einstein
*  had in mind for how these particles were, you know, arranging to have these long distance
*  correlations.
*  Right. And Bell is an example of how it was to try to do foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  So we're talking about like 60s and 70s now.
*  And he was a perfectly respectable particle theorist at CERN at the laboratory where he
*  discovered the Higgs boson a few years ago.
*  And correct me if I'm wrong, but he basically hid the fact that he was working on the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics from his colleagues at CERN.
*  He didn't. I don't know.
*  Hyde is a little bit.
*  He didn't advertise it.
*  He certainly didn't advertise it.
*  Yeah. You know, there is there is this nasty.
*  Well, nasty is probably a little strong.
*  There was certainly whispers about John Bell at CERN that, you know, oh, he did something
*  important in quantum foundations, but don't worry about it because quantum mechanics works
*  anyway. Yeah, don't hold it against.
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  One of Bell's good friends who he worked with on the other work he did, not quantum
*  foundations, Bell's sort of everyday physics work was in quantum field theory.
*  And one of Bell's good friends was Martinus Veltman.
*  And the story is that Veltman one day said to Bell, you know, you did this thing in
*  the in quantum foundations.
*  Do I need to worry about this?
*  Will it affect my work in quantum field theory at all?
*  And Veltman is a very good quantum field theorist.
*  He won the Nobel Prize.
*  Yes, he did win the Nobel Prize.
*  Yes. And and so, you know, Veltman asks Bell this question and Bell says, no, don't
*  worry about it. It's not going to affect your work at all, which is true.
*  Yeah. And and so Bell, yeah, he certainly didn't advertise that he was working on
*  this stuff. He also didn't work on it in a serious way, you know, great length until
*  well after his career was established and safe.
*  You know, he thought about this stuff in college and then he thought about it a little
*  bit in early in his early graduate work.
*  And then he was dissuaded from working on it.
*  And so he put it off to the side and came back to it later.
*  And a lot of people, even to this day, there are physicists who will claim that what
*  Bell proved was that you can't have what are called hidden variables, that you can't
*  have secret new values, secret new parameters of physics that, as Einstein had
*  hoped, would, you know, fix the outcomes of future experiments, even if we human
*  beings don't know about it.
*  Yeah. But that's not what Bell proved.
*  No. In fact, we have to talk about David Bohm, who is certainly one of the more
*  interesting characters in the story.
*  Yes, he is. Yeah.
*  So so no, Bell certainly didn't prove that you can't have these hidden variables
*  like Einstein wanted.
*  Bell proved that you can't have a particular kind of hidden variables, ones
*  without spooky actions, without spooky action at a distance.
*  And really what he proved was not really about hidden variables at all.
*  It was really saying that you can't have a theory without spooky action at a
*  distance of some kind unless you break something even more fundamental, which
*  we'll get to, which we'll get to later.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  My man, you ever broke all the.
*  Yeah, no, I think the way I describe it in my book is, you know, he showed that
*  you either have to have spooky action at a distance or something even weirder.
*  Yeah. But yeah.
*  So David Bohm, right.
*  So David Bohm was in a lot of ways the inspiration for Bell's work and someone
*  whose work Bell admired very clearly.
*  David Bohm was a student of Robert Oppenheimer, the guy who was in charge of
*  the Manhattan Project, though he himself only he didn't follow Oppenheimer to
*  Los Alamos.
*  Why is that?
*  Well, he didn't follow Oppenheimer to Los Alamos because David Bohm had been
*  briefly a member of the Communist Party in Berkeley, where he was doing his PhD
*  work. And so when he applied for security clearance to go to Los Alamos, he was
*  denied that clearance.
*  They did not tell him that this is why they denied him the clearance.
*  They lied to him and told him it was because he had relatives in Europe who
*  could be held as hostage against him, which while true in theory was definitely
*  not the real reason as as you know, documents uncovered well after Bohm died
*  proved.
*  But but yeah, Bohm did do some important work that was relevant to the Manhattan
*  Project for his PhD, which was promptly classified and thus removed from his
*  apartment forcibly by military police because he didn't have clearance to have
*  his own work.
*  And so it was a crazy time.
*  We're talking about the early 40s.
*  Yeah, this is like 41 or 42, something like that.
*  Maybe more like 43.
*  It doesn't matter. The point is, it's during World War Two.
*  It was a crazy time, like you said.
*  And and yeah, no, he didn't have any of his research notes.
*  Oppenheimer had to go to the UC Berkeley administration and say you have to give him
*  a PhD anyway.
*  Just trust me, which they did, which was good.
*  Bohm had no problem with the Copenhagen interpretation at this time.
*  You know, Oppenheimer was a great admirer of Bohr.
*  Bohm was a great admirer of Oppenheimer.
*  And so he didn't really think too critically about it.
*  And it seemed to work for him.
*  Then he started teaching quantum mechanics classes.
*  So teaching is what's going to get you in trouble, clearly.
*  Clearly not usually, since most physicists seem to have no trouble ignoring the
*  foundations even when they teach one.
*  That's fair. That's fair.
*  Bohm was a thoughtful guy.
*  Yes, Bohm was a thoughtful guy.
*  He was teaching quantum mechanics classes at Berkeley out of Oppenheimer's research
*  notes or sorry, lecture notes.
*  And then he got a position at Princeton and continued to teach out of a mix of his
*  own notes and Oppenheimer's notes and started turning that into a textbook.
*  And that textbook he wrote was trying to give the best version of the Copenhagen
*  interpretation that he could and make it as clear as he could make it.
*  And in the process of trying to do that, Bohm's faith in the Copenhagen
*  interpretation just plummeted until by the end of the process, he was just
*  completely plagued with doubt.
*  The more you think about it, the less sense it makes.
*  Yes, which I certainly agree.
*  So then Bohm went and met with Einstein, who had looked at Bohm's textbook once it
*  came out and sort of called Bohm into his office and said, look, you wrote this book
*  and, you know, how do you feel about it?
*  And Bohm said, I'm plagued with doubt.
*  And Einstein said, look, that's because you're trying to defend an indefensible
*  position. You did the best job that you could do, but no one can do it because it
*  doesn't work.
*  And so Bohm walked out of that meeting thinking, can I find another way to look
*  at this? Can I find another way to think about quantum mechanics?
*  And he did.
*  He independently rediscovered a set of ideas that Louis de Broglie, one of the
*  other founders of quantum mechanics, had come up with back in the late 1920s and
*  then sort of finished the work that de Broglie started and put together this
*  theory, which goes by a bunch of different names, Bohmian mechanics, de
*  Broglie, Bohm theory, pilot wave theory.
*  I like calling it pilot wave theory because that's descriptive of the content
*  of the theory.
*  But also, by the way, when de Broglie actually tried to present his theory at
*  the Solvay conference and he was just hectored out of his own theory.
*  Exactly.
*  No good reason.
*  Yeah, basically.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it is true that the job wasn't done, but he could have finished it and
*  he didn't.
*  Yeah.
*  So Bohm, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Finished that took up that mantle.
*  Exactly.
*  Bohm took up that mantle, puts this thing together relatively quickly and sends it
*  off for publication.
*  The problem is that at the same time that all of this was happening, Bohm's past was
*  catching up with him.
*  He got called up in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee and
*  testified in front of it to committee, including Richard Nixon, who was a
*  congressman at the time.
*  And he was asked to name names and tell people, you know, who the other people in
*  the Communist Party in Berkeley during World War II were.
*  He wouldn't do it.
*  He was held in contempt of Congress.
*  He was arrested in his office in Princeton.
*  And by the time he got back to campus after his friends posted bail, he had been
*  suspended and banned from the Princeton campus.
*  And he was working on all of these ideas during that suspension.
*  And this is 1951.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  This is 1951.
*  So, so while he suspended, he works on these ideas about quantum mechanics and
*  then has his day in court.
*  He's cleared on all charges because it turns out that, you know, you don't have
*  to name names.
*  There's, there's, he had pled the first and the fifth amendments.
*  There are, there is a first and a fifth amendment.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's cleared on all counts, but Princeton effectively fired him after that.
*  And he couldn't get a job anywhere else, even though he had recommendation letters
*  from Einstein and Oppenheimer.
*  He couldn't get work, you know, doing academic physics anywhere in the U.S.
*  or Europe, much to his disappointment.
*  Finally, he gets a position in Brazil.
*  And so toward the end of 1951, he goes down to Brazil.
*  And shortly after arriving, he's summoned to the U.S.
*  consulate where they illegally confiscate his passport and tell him that he can
*  only have it back if he goes back to the United States, which he doesn't want to
*  do because he's worried that he's going to be arrested again and, you know, maybe,
*  you know, brought up on false charges or something.
*  So he's trapped.
*  But now it's the height of the Red Scare.
*  Exactly.
*  It's the height of the Red Scare and the McCarthy era.
*  So Boehm is is trapped in Brazil.
*  He can't get out.
*  He was planning to go give a bunch of talks in support of his ideas because his
*  papers were due to be published imminently just a couple months later.
*  So when they are finally published in very early 1952, Boehm can't defend his
*  ideas through anything other than writing letters to people.
*  And so mostly he's just ridiculed.
*  You know, someone I one of one of the quotes that I found in my research for my
*  book, which I like the best, was someone said that Boehm had, you know, something
*  the effect of had a very illustrious set of people sticking knives in his back
*  all year long in 1952, which, yeah, it's absolutely true.
*  You know, Wolfgang Pauli, Werner Heisenberg.
*  Yeah.
*  These are not the political knives of being a communist.
*  Yes.
*  Physics knives of like, you're a crazy person who doesn't understand quantum
*  mechanics.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  But the fact that he was a communist also didn't help not only because he
*  couldn't leave Brazil, but because at that time, most physics funding was coming
*  from the military and it was the height of the Red Scare.
*  And so if, you know, someone in your physics department was suspected of being
*  a communist, that could turn off the faucet of funding.
*  And that's a scary thing.
*  So, yeah.
*  And basically to make it very, very brief, his theory, the pilot wave theory was the
*  kind of hidden variable theory that Einstein wanted, except rather than avoiding
*  spooky action at a distance, it reifies.
*  It's all like the spooky action is doing all the work here.
*  Yeah.
*  It's riddled with spooky action at a distance.
*  There's a great quote from Bell saying that, you know, he resolved the EPR paradox in
*  the way that Einstein would have liked the least.
*  Yeah.
*  Something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, it's, it's really, um, another quote from Bell actually about, uh, about
*  Bohm's, uh, theory was that, um, if you shook a magnet right here, it would
*  instantaneously affect the position of every single electron anywhere in the universe,
*  which is not a pleasant thing to consider as a physicist.
*  Doesn't mean it's wrong.
*  Well, I think it would have been perfectly happy.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Newton would have been fine with it.
*  I mean, obviously the influence is very, very small.
*  And, and by the way, um, this, this hasn't gone away.
*  Like, this is this Bohmian mechanics, pilot wave theory is still one of the leading
*  contenders for a sensible interpretation of quantum mechanics, not so much among
*  physicists, but among philosophers and people who work on foundations.
*  Um, and what, how would you characterize the state of play with reconciling these
*  kinds of ideas with quantum field theory and relativity?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the, the, the fundamental problem with pilot wave theory, Bohmian mechanics,
*  whatever you want to call it, is that it doesn't seem to play nice with relativity
*  for exactly these reasons.
*  You know, relativity doesn't have a preferred frame of reference.
*  It doesn't let you have things go faster than light.
*  Uh, Bohmian mechanics seems to violate that.
*  Um, I would have a much better answer to your question about the state of play,
*  uh, in about three hours, I'm getting dinner with chip.
*  Okay.
*  My collaborator.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, but, um, we, we rule out retro causality here in this podcast, but that's
*  not, that's not a version of quantum mechanics we like.
*  So the information you will get in the future cannot probably be used here.
*  So the way that I like to put it, I'm just trying to check reality, check myself.
*  I'm not an expert on Bohmian mechanics.
*  Yeah.
*  People have tried to make it compatible with relativity and quantum field theory.
*  There have been yeoman like efforts.
*  Yes.
*  I don't think there's been anything completely convincing.
*  I think that's correct.
*  Um, if you ask them why the problem is there, they will say something like, or at
*  least some of them will say something like, um, well, quantum field theory
*  actually has its own foundational issues independently of the measurement
*  problem in quantum mechanics, which is true.
*  And that makes it very, very difficult to come up with a, you know, Bohmian
*  formulation of quantum field theory, because it's not clear what kind of
*  quantum field theory you want that can account for all the different phenomena
*  that quantum field theory, you know, accounts for.
*  I don't quite know what to make of that.
*  Well, you know, I think it's a great example of how non algorithmic physics
*  really is not the results you get from physics with the process of doing it.
*  Right.
*  You have, you have all of these sorts of puzzles, things we don't yet know the
*  answer to, and some of them you have to say, Oh, don't worry, that'll be figured
*  out.
*  Whereas others, you have to say, this is really important.
*  We should really focus on solving this and different people are going to make
*  different choices.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  No physics is definitely subject to contingency and personality and, you
*  know, random fate.
*  And for 50 years, the physics as a field made the choice that the foundations
*  were not worth worrying about.
*  Exactly.
*  And, and even now I'd say the, the standard position is, yeah, don't worry
*  about it.
*  You know, it's not as rabid as it was before.
*  It's not, you shouldn't worry about it.
*  It's, eh, don't worry about it.
*  As I'm recording this, I literally this week just recorded the audio book for my
*  upcoming book, Something Deeply Hidden on Quantum Mechanics.

*  So happy listening.
*  We don't need to talk too much about Everett because it's my podcast.
*  Sure.
*  The audience will get plenty of Everett over the years.
*  But interestingly, he was there at Princeton in the early fifties.
*  Did they overlap?
*  He was a, Everett was a student and Bohm was an assistant professor.
*  Yes, that's correct.
*  They didn't overlap.
*  They just missed each other by something like two years.
*  Okay.
*  Um, so I think Everett shows up at Princeton as a grad student and I want
*  to say 53 or 54 and Bohm is gone by the end of 51.
*  Okay.
*  Um, so I wonder if, you know, all of this.
*  Influ all of this work on quantum foundations at Princeton in the early
*  fifties wasn't ultimately Einstein's fault.
*  I mean, Einstein certainly influenced, uh, Bohm.
*  Yes.
*  He, uh, apparently taught a class.
*  Like he gave a lecture that Everett was at though.
*  Everett Everett doesn't remember.
*  Yeah.
*  He didn't remember later in life.
*  On the other hand, other people say that Everett was there.
*  It makes sense that Everett was there.
*  And also, I don't know.
*  Everett was a funny guy and people forget things.
*  Um, but yeah, and certainly a lot of Sherry.
*  Yes.
*  There was a lot of alcohol of various kinds.
*  It's absolutely true.
*  Um, but yeah, Everett certainly read a great deal of Einstein.
*  Um, Everett also talked with Eugene Vigner, who was someone who was at
*  Princeton at the time, um, who harbored his own kinds of doubts about the
*  Copenhagen interpretation.
*  Um, and so I think he was definitely an influence on Everett and probably vice
*  versa.
*  Um, and yeah, Einstein was there.
*  And.
*  You know, the other thing is Princeton at the time was one of the best places
*  to be doing physics in the world.
*  You know, one of the smart people would end up there.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And, and I think that smart people are more likely to, um, more likely to
*  question these truths that they've just sort of been handed on a platter, which
*  is not to say that if you question those truths, that makes you a smart person.
*  Okay.
*  I mean, we're, uh, there's a lot of physics to get through here.
*  So I don't want to dwell too much on Everett because we'll get there otherwise.
*  But, you know, Bohm, uh, suggested an answer to the measurement problem.
*  Maybe there were hidden variables.
*  We just don't know their values.
*  And so measuring is revealing some truth about nature that we hadn't known before.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And Everett suggests a completely different one.
*  He gives up on, and so what Bohm gives up on is locality.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  He allows for spooky action at a distance.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's certainly a little bit more complicated than measurements simply
*  reveal things that were already there because measurements can still influence
*  things, but it's, it's, uh, it's like, uh, um, it's a much less mysterious process.
*  And Bohm mechanics is, you know, hearkens back to the classical paradigm, right?
*  Where there are definite values of things and we measure them.
*  Yeah.
*  In some ways.
*  Some hearkening.
*  Yes.
*  There's definitely some marketing.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  Um, as Everett takes completely the opposite point of view, he says, there's
*  no hidden variables.
*  There's just this way function.
*  We should take it seriously.
*  There's not two different ways of evolving.
*  There's only one way of evolving.
*  Yeah.
*  And the price he pays is that when you measure something, the universe
*  branches into multiple copies.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, which is this radical and deeply strange, uh, solution to the problem.
*  But again, deeply strange is not a strike against things.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And Bohm was, uh, uh, chased out of the country and then stabbed in the back.
*  Yes.
*  Uh, Everett sort of took his golden parachute, right?
*  He didn't even try to get a job as a physics professor.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he was certainly not happy with the way that his work was received.
*  I mean, uh, Everett's mentor and advisor at Princeton was, uh, the
*  great physicist, John Wheeler.
*  And Wheeler was, you know, one of Boer's most devoted students.
*  And so when he saw Everett's work, he really liked Everett's work at first,
*  but he wanted it to get the blessing from the master, right?
*  To get the blessing from Boer and Boer and that was never going to happen.
*  Born his inner circle, never gave it that blessing because of course they didn't.
*  And, uh, the whole experience was definitely, you know, a traumatizing one
*  for Everett, but on the other hand, Everett was never going to stay in academia.
*  He, it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't where his passions were.
*  He wasn't chased out.
*  Yeah.
*  He wasn't chased out.
*  Uh, if he had wanted to stay, he might've had problems.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, Wheeler was still willing to go to bat for him, but Wheeler made Everett
*  make a lot of revisions to his ideas in his PhD thesis to try to make Boer happy.
*  It didn't work, of course.
*  And then Everett did what he was always going to do, which is he finished his PhD
*  and went and got a job working for the military industrial complex, you know,
*  doing, uh, essentially war gaming.
*  Simulation.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Or bomb falling.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And okay.
*  So, so there was this sort of brief moment in the 1950s when a couple of people at
*  Princeton thought deeply about the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  Yeah.
*  And I it's fairly safe to say that their efforts had zero impact for the next few
*  decades.
*  Didn't have big impacts for, for a decade or two.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  I mean, and, and I'm also, you know, these are not the only people who thought
*  deeply about the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  They're just the ones whose work ended up being the most influential in the
*  coming years.
*  Um, but yeah, no people didn't, there wasn't a lot of widespread, you know, open
*  talking about the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  There wasn't a lot of research done on it.
*  Um, you know, the work that Boehm did and that Everett did, it was probably the
*  most notable work done in quantum foundations at the time.
*  And then.
*  Bell shows up.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, Bell is one of these people who had never been happy with the story that he'd
*  been presented with about quantum mechanics.
*  And then, you know, he, he got into fights with his college professors about it.
*  And then shortly before finishing his university studies in, uh, in 1949,
*  shortly before finishing college.
*  Um, and he's in Northern Ireland.
*  He's at, uh, uh, Queens college in Belfast.
*  I think the point is he's at college.
*  He's almost done.
*  And then he comes across a book by Max Born, uh, in which born describes a,
*  among other things, a proof from the great and mighty physicist, John von
*  Neumann and John von Neumann is, is one of the giants of 20th century math and
*  physics.
*  Um, and so if there's a proof of something by John von Neumann, it's
*  almost certainly correct.
*  And born says that von Neumann proved that this way of understanding quantum
*  physics, uh, as, as, you know, fundamentally, uh, driven by, you know,
*  chance that happens, you know, like these weird, um, random chance events that
*  happen when you make measurements, uh, is the only way to think about quantum.
*  Yeah.
*  So it can't really be deterministic hidden variables.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  There's, there's no other way to think about it.
*  And so bell is very impressed by this and he wants to go look at the proof, but
*  he can't, because at the time it's only available in German bell doesn't speak
*  German, but he thinks, okay, I'd better put this down because von Neumann is,
*  is right.
*  And if I keep thinking about this, I'm just going to fall down a well and I'm
*  never going to come out.
*  So he goes off and does some work in accelerator physics.
*  And then, um, while he's working that job in 1952, he sees the papers from David
*  bone and he reads these papers and he immediately realizes there's nothing
*  wrong with what bomb said bone may not be right, but it's certainly a perfectly
*  legitimate way of looking at quantum mechanics.
*  And so then bell realizes, well, von Neumann must have been wrong.
*  How can you prove something can't exist when here's an example of it?
*  Exist.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  So here's a counter example.
*  So, um, so he, he again wants to go look at the proof.
*  It's still only available in German.
*  Um, so he goes off and works in other things for a few years.
*  He goes to graduate school.
*  Um, he, he suggests to his PhD advisor that he could either, you know, one day
*  give a talk about either, you know, bohms work and the quantum measurement problem
*  or about accelerator physics and his, his PhD advisor, um, uh, I'm never
*  gonna, I never pronounced this name correctly, Rudolph, uh, pyro pyroles.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  The point is well-known physicist, another student of bore, um, or, or
*  colleague of bore, a student of Heisenberg, uh, said, you know, it
*  basically gave him a look and said, why don't you give a talk about accelerator
*  physics?
*  And so he just, he sort of left quantum foundations aside for a while.
*  And then finally in the mid 1960s, he gets a chance to think about these things.
*  And he sits down and looks at von Neumann's proof, which is finally
*  available in English, along with a couple of other proofs that are sort of related.
*  And, uh, and he said, you know, I looked at von Neumann's proof and it fell
*  apart in my hands.
*  It's not just wrong.
*  It's silly.
*  I clearly doesn't work.
*  And so he,
*  but was it that he didn't, he, he made a mistake in the proof or just didn't
*  prove the thing that people were saying.
*  He didn't prove the thing that people said he proved.
*  Yeah.
*  And he also didn't prove the thing that he thought he'd proven, right?
*  You know, this, this proof shows up in von Neumann's textbook, uh, quantum
*  mechanics textbook, which is a really, you know, incredible intellectual work.
*  Um, with this one flaw in it.
*  Um, but in that book, von Neumann makes it clear that this is how he's thinking
*  about it.
*  And that's not correct.
*  He hasn't proven my impression was, uh, again, I forget where maybe from your
*  book that Einstein who did speak German had seen von Neumann's, uh, book and was
*  at least skeptical of this claimed proof.
*  You know, I didn't talk about it to bone.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, there are stories about that and I'm not sure.
*  Like the, the, the stories about Einstein's awareness of von Neumann's proof
*  are not particularly well-sourced.
*  Okay.
*  So I didn't put them in my book because I didn't want to get good.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, and then of course people attacked me for not putting them in my book because
*  no one's ever happy, but, um, but the point is, yes, Einstein may have been
*  aware of it.
*  He may not have been aware of it.
*  Um, but even if he was aware of it, he was skeptical of it.
*  Um, but the point is von Neumann's proof didn't prove what von Neumann and
*  especially a lot of other people thought it proved.
*  Um, and so bell works on it and looks at that proof and these other proofs
*  that are sort of like it and shows, you know, no, they don't rule out hidden
*  variables.
*  That's not what they do.
*  They do this other thing.
*  And Greta Herman knew it.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  Uh, Greta Herman, uh, a, a mathematician and philosopher and student of
*  Emmy nooter, um, pointed out the problem with von Neumann's proof just a few years
*  after he published it, um, in 1935 and nobody listened to her.
*  Yeah.
*  Nobody cared.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, uh, a variety of reasons, probably including the fact that she was a woman.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, but, um, bell independently rediscovers these problems, also discovers the problems
*  in similar proofs that have been published since, um, publishes a paper basically
*  saying, look, you know, these proofs don't do what you think they do.
*  Hidden variables are still on the table.
*  They just need to meet these requirements.
*  And then at the end of the paper, he says, but there's still the question about,
*  you know, theories, hidden variable theories, whether they need to be like
*  Bohm's in that they need to have this non-locality, that's an open question
*  which somebody should answer.
*  And so then he starts working on that immediately afterward.
*  Right.
*  And then he answers it and he says, no, this non-locality, um, it's a fundamental
*  feature, not just of hidden variables, but of any theory that's going to reproduce
*  the results of quantum mechanics with the exception of theories that break
*  something even more fundamental.
*  Like many, like many worlds.
*  Like, yeah.
*  So basically if experiments have definite outcome, yes, if experiments have
*  definite outcomes and there's not some vast conspiracy going back to the
*  beginning of time, super determinism.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Just in case the audience does know the buzzwords.
*  Yes.
*  Let them in on that.
*  Exactly.
*  So those are pretty much the only two ways out.
*  Now people are definitely not going to be happy with me for saying that, but, um,
*  but yeah, you know, you'll sometimes hear people say, no, you can save locality.
*  If you get rid of the hidden variables, that's not true because then you're still
*  left with Einstein's EPR argument.
*  Right.
*  Then you'll hear people like you already said, Bell's theorem and his argument
*  wasn't really about hidden variables.
*  That's right.
*  It was about, there's no way to reproduce quantum mechanics without
*  spooky action at a distance.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And, um, you know, you'll hear people say, well, you can save locality.
*  If you give up realism, I have yet to hear a definition of realism that
*  satisfies that, um, unless, unless you're giving up the idea of things.
*  Yeah.
*  In which case, sure.
*  You can have local people.
*  People do, but then, you know, what does locality even mean?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  So, so, so let's, uh, you know, put ourselves where we are now.
*  So it's like the sixties or seventies.
*  Um, most of the physics community has been ignoring the measurement
*  problem of quantum mechanics.
*  There was Bowman effort in the fifties, but even Bohm sort of didn't
*  keep talking about it a lot.
*  He did other things.
*  I remember there was this quote from Yakir Aronov was one of his students.
*  And together they invented the Aronov-Bohm effect.
*  Yes.
*  Really, really important.
*  Yes, it is.
*  And someone asked him, you know, uh, Aronov, did you ever talk to
*  Bohm about his theory and Aronov says, no, we only ever talked about physics.
*  I hadn't heard that quote, but that, that seems pretty plausible to me.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he definitely, he told me that when he started working with Bohm, they
*  had an agreement to not work on that stuff.
*  Um, I think in part because Bohm was worried about what impact that would
*  have on Aronov's career and quite understandably.
*  And there was even this infamous memo from, uh, the editor of the physical
*  review saying, yes, we won't even look at papers in the foundations of quantum
*  mechanics.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Which someone later pointed out.
*  Um, yeah, he said, we're not going to look at papers in the foundations of
*  quantum mechanics unless they propose a new experimental result and, or a new
*  experiment that you can do.
*  And someone pointed out, well, you know, if we had that policy 30 years ago, that
*  would have forced you to reject a boar's reply to EPR.
*  Um, yeah, yeah.
*  But yeah, sign of the times though.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  No, it was really bad.
*  Um, so yeah, in the fifties we had Bowman Everett in the sixties.
*  We had bell.
*  Bell's paper is published.
*  He doesn't hear anything about it for years.
*  Um, part of this is because there's this weird story about where that paper and
*  the other paper he did before that were published, which is a whole thing that
*  we're not going to get into.
*  Um, but yeah, people just weren't paying attention.
*  Uh, and then at the very end of the 1960s, bell gets correspondence about this paper
*  for the very first time from a graduate student named John Clouser, uh, at Columbia
*  university who wants to conduct an experiment to test this particular set of
*  outcomes of quantum mechanics, to see if Bell's, uh, uh, proof, uh, holds about the
*  world.
*  Um, because, you know, basically what bell showed was you can do an experiment.
*  And if the experiment agrees, if the outcome of the experiment agrees with
*  quantum mechanics, then, you know, you don't have locality and if it does, and
*  if it doesn't agree with quantum mechanics, then you can have locality, but
*  also you've broken quantum mechanics.
*  Which is important.
*  Yeah.
*  The experiment couldn't show that bell was wrong.
*  Bell gave us horns up a dilemma.
*  Exactly.
*  Yes.
*  Either there's spooky action at a distance or quantum mechanics is wrong or
*  yeah, even worse things like many worlds.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You can experimentally figure out which one we're on.
*  Yeah.
*  Either, either quantum mechanics is correct in this outcome or we can have
*  locality.
*  Um, so you have to actually do that experiment and Clouser wanted to do it.
*  Um, and so did a couple of other people.
*  Um, and so Clouser got together with a guy named Abner Shimony at Boston
*  university and a couple of other guys named Horn and Holt, and they wrote a
*  paper, you know, sort of massaging bells result into a form that could actually
*  be tested, um, called the CHSH paper after their initials.
*  This is always an underappreciated part of the process of this.
*  Yes.
*  Turning the crazy things that the earth's do into something that can be
*  experimentally probe or at least something that can be computed.
*  Right.
*  Um, but yeah, yeah, exactly.
*  So they do this.
*  Um, and then in the very early seventies, I think 71 or 72, Clouser, who at this
*  point is a postdoc at Berkeley, um, along with another guy named Stuart Friedman
*  actually do an experiment to, to, you know, test, um, to test the predictions
*  of quantum mechanics in this, uh, in this situation and they find that quantum
*  mechanics works.
*  Surprise.
*  Yeah, surprise.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, pretty much everybody thought that it would, Clouser was not sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Clouser really thought that it might turn out the other way.
*  Um, and if it had, he, you know, he would be even more well known than he already
*  is, but yeah, uh, but, uh, but don't quantum mechanics survived, uh, which
*  meant that, uh, we couldn't have locality, um, with, you know, again,
*  not in one world.
*  Yes.
*  Not in one world.
*  Yes.
*  Um, so that's been, uh, that idea of testing these things has been upgraded
*  and carried forward to the present day.
*  Yeah.
*  Of course, the more elaborate tests of Bell's inequality.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, so Clouser was first and then in the late seventies, uh, this guy
*  named Alain Aspe did a, a more, did a more, uh, detailed experiment, uh, testing
*  again, the predictions of quantum mechanics in these conditions and found
*  again that quantum mechanics worked.
*  And Clouser and Aspe really had very different, uh, career trajectories
*  from, from that point on Clouser.
*  When he did this, he was a postdoc.
*  He didn't have a permanent position and he had a lot of trouble getting a
*  permanent position and, and ultimately never really did, uh, even though he'd
*  done, you know, this really impressive experimental work, um, so his, his
*  career sort of, um, suffered as a result of doing this work, Aspe had a permanent
*  position before he did the work.
*  Yes.
*  Um, and in fact, when he'd gone to John Bell to talk with him about doing this
*  work, you know, Aspe met with Bell before, um, before setting out on this
*  experimental journey, uh, Bell wouldn't even talk to him about it until Aspe
*  assured him that he had a permanent position because Bell was so worried
*  about damaging, you know, the careers of young physicists, but, uh, Aspe did
*  this experiment and then went out and gave a lot of talks about it.
*  And Aspe is very good at giving talks and it makes a very big difference.
*  So he's very good at giving talks.
*  Niels Bohr was very good at convincing people of his point of view.
*  And Einstein, uh, you know, for all his genius, kind of just expected
*  people to go along with him.
*  He was not that good at the sales pitches.
*  No, he really wasn't.
*  He was not a people person.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, yeah.
*  And, and whereas Bohr almost had to work with people to do his work,
*  Einstein almost never worked with people or he worked with a very small group of
*  people.
*  Um, he worked with people on the EPR paper, but then afterward he never
*  talked to Podolsky again.
*  Yeah, he did not like, he did not like how that paper turned out.
*  And, and I, I really think that, that the clearest versions of the EPR, you
*  know, paradoxes Einstein thought about are in Einstein's later writing where
*  he really explained it much more clearly.
*  But, um, but yeah.
*  Um, so Espe was a big force in changing how the field thought about the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  Exactly.
*  Because he showed, Hey, you know, he made people aware that there was, you
*  know, at least one really nice experiment to be done in quantum foundations.
*  And that in turn caused people to take a look at Bell's work.
*  And then when they did that, all sorts of interesting things happened.
*  Uh, not only was there renewed interest in quantum foundations, but this also
*  drove, uh, you know, the, the, the new field of quantum information and quantum
*  computing.
*  And to be fair, you know, I do give people a hard time, the physics community,
*  I give them a hard time for ignoring quantum foundations, but there was not
*  only a feeling that there's more interesting things to be done, but there
*  was a feeling that it's impossible to make progress on that kind of question
*  because it's more a philosophy question.
*  There's no experimental input, et cetera, et cetera.
*  And that is one way of changing that is to do an experiment that has a big
*  impact on this field.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah, that that's exactly right.
*  I mean, I think, you know, as I was saying before, if the attitude of the
*  physics community was, it's very hard to make progress.
*  And so I'm not going to work on it because it's really hard.
*  That'd be one thing that'd be fine.
*  The problem is when you change that to this normative statement, when you say,
*  oh, it's very hard and you shouldn't work on it.
*  It's a bad idea to work on it, not just because you'll suffer professionally,
*  but because that's not the kind of thing that we do as physicists.
*  And that was certainly endemic.
*  Yes.
*  So in fact, let's I guess there's two big things I still have to, I still
*  want to ask you about.
*  One is despite all the bad now that we've done at the Copenhagen
*  Interpretation, it's sort of come back or at least versions of it have come back
*  in the form of these epistemic approaches to quantum mechanics.
*  There's a whole subset of people who, who really, you know, get behind the idea
*  that all we're supposed to be doing all quantum mechanics purports to do is to
*  make predictions for experimental outcomes.
*  Well, there are definitely people who believe that, and there are definitely
*  people who support these epistemic interpretations.
*  Epistemic meaning that the wave function is, is about our knowledge about the
*  world rather than a thing in the world.
*  Um, but I wouldn't say that the people who support these epistemic interpretations
*  are all people who say, no, we really quantum mechanics is really only about
*  the outcomes of experiments and we shouldn't be doing more than that as physicists.
*  I mean, they're someone we both know.
*  Um, Matt Leifer, uh, at Chapman University, he is certainly a supporter of these
*  epistemic interpretations, but he, he is a scientific realist.
*  He thinks that there is a world and there's stuff in the world and the job of
*  physics is to go after that stuff.
*  He just thinks that the, that the quantum wave function isn't one of the things in
*  the world.
*  It's a statement about our knowledge.
*  That's right.
*  That's a very good clarification.
*  Yeah.
*  So we have this quantum wave function.
*  It's the thing that you can't get away without having in any version of quantum
*  mechanics.
*  And I think every, that's one of the few things everyone would agree on.
*  Yes.
*  Fertiger's equation talks about the evolution of something.
*  Yeah.
*  Uh, but at least there was a quantum state, right?
*  There's a quantum state.
*  Well, right.
*  But then, but amazingly we can't say in our best understanding of the world,
*  whether that thing is real or just a tool.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And so the epistemic folks want to say, it's just a tool.
*  It's, it's just like a probability distribution.
*  When, when you say that I flipped a coin, I haven't looked at it yet.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's a 50 50 chance it's heads or tails.
*  I can give a probability distribution to that.
*  But there is a reality beneath it.
*  Right.
*  And they want to make the wave function like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's right.
*  There are people who think that, I don't know, there are positions that I, I
*  don't know, um, now we're getting back to the subject of people being angry with
*  me.
*  Um, there, there are people who hold positions that are extremely Copenhagen
*  like, um, who will say, no, the wave function is a statement of our knowledge.
*  And there isn't a thing underneath it.
*  Well, and proudly so, right?
*  There are people who identify themselves as Copenhagen supporters, not just, not
*  just because there's nothing better, but because that's the right answer.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  And, um, and, and when you push them on, what do you mean by Copenhagen?
*  You get a variety of interesting answers.
*  And, um, and one of the things that happens is you get them sort of jumping
*  between mutually contradictory positions, which if you can pull that off, is
*  a really effective rhetorical move.
*  Cause it turns out that anything follows from a contradiction.
*  So you can always answer any question that you've been given.
*  You just have to contradict yourself.
*  So Cubism is an example of an epistemic theory.
*  Do you know, do you understand Cubism well enough to talk about it for the
*  audience?
*  This is capital Q capital B ism.
*  So quantum ism quantum Bayesianism.
*  Yeah.
*  Although they now say that that's not what it stands for and it's not clear what
*  it does by its name.
*  Yeah.
*  So I think that this is where I'm going to get people mad at me for my book
*  because I tried to be, you know, I'm very pro ever pro many worlds.
*  I tried, as I said in the book to be fair, but not balanced.
*  Yes.
*  So I certainly gave all of the good lines to Everett and quantum mechanics, but I
*  tried to say correct things about the other interpretations and Cubism or
*  epistemic approaches more generally are where the chances are greatest that the
*  proponents of those theories will not think I'm being fair.
*  I tried to be fair, but I just can't figure out what they're saying.
*  So speaking of people being mad, um,
*  I, I was originally planning to have a chapter in my book about epistemic
*  theories.
*  And then my editor started yelling at me for being way over word count,
*  which I was.
*  Um, and I ultimately decided,
*  you know,
*  this is a book about the history of quantum foundations and how we got from
*  where we were to where we are.
*  And these epistemic interpretations, um,
*  or as I call them in my book, information based interpretations, because I,
*  I try to use less jargon.
*  No, that's good.
*  But probably smart choice.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, I don't know that they like it, but, um, whatever.
*  Um, they're new ish, right?
*  They, they certainly have Copenhagen ish DNA,
*  but they are mostly things from the 1990s and later.
*  They're young and being developed.
*  Exactly.
*  And so, yeah, exactly.
*  And, and so, so I decided, oh,
*  that means that I can get away with not discussing them a great deal because we
*  haven't seen how they're going to play out yet.
*  Uh, and, and you know, if you're writing a history book that,
*  that tries to go up to the present day,
*  the hardest part is always going to be the last 15 to 20 years.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I just kind of,
*  where we haven't yet decided what history says.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, so I do mention them in my book, but I don't go into it in a great deal of
*  detail.
*  And, and, um, you know, I talked with Matt about this and he said, yeah, that
*  seems like a perfectly reasonable move.
*  However, some other Psi epistemic people and some QBists or Cubists, whatever,
*  I bad at pronouncing things, um, are not happy about that.
*  Um, and they're also not happy with how I present bore in my book and, you know,
*  whatever.
*  Um, but I have to say,
*  I don't think that I really understand their position terribly well either.
*  And that could be me.
*  And, but I'm not sure that it is.
*  Um, I have tried quite a bit to understand it.
*  Although once I realized that I wasn't going to be going over it in great detail
*  on my book, I stopped trying quite as hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it was working on the book.
*  Um, but I've since tried some more.
*  Um, and, um, and I'm actually, I'm going to have a chance, I hope later this year
*  to sit down and talk with David Merman, one of the QBists again.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, but I, I did talk with him.
*  I had two long conversations with him, uh, while working on my book.
*  Um, he's, he's someone I know from, uh, when I was in college, uh, cause I, I,
*  he's at Cornell and that's where I went for college.
*  Um, he, and he's the aforementioned professor who told me, you know, gave me
*  the bad news that no, there's not a different translation of Boar's paper.
*  Um, so yeah, David Merman is a lovely guy.
*  He and I disagree about quantum mechanics and I'm not sure that I understand his
*  position.
*  Um, I, I am not sure what to make of Cubism.
*  Okay.
*  Uh, that's fine.
*  Yeah.
*  That's, that's perfectly fair.
*  Probably the most prudent thing you can say.
*  I think that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, but is it a, um, the other big point I wanted to give it us a chance to talk
*  about is, is the very fact of the existence, uh, the resurgence, the
*  Renaissance of people trying to make something like Copenhagen respectable.
*  Is it a reflection of the fact that quantum foundations more broadly are
*  becoming slightly more respectable in physics?
*  I mean, you still don't see, look, Caltech and Harvard and Princeton
*  are not going to hire physicists who study the foundations of quantum
*  mechanics as, you know, senior faculty members, but, um, but maybe with not
*  only the experiments in quantum optics and so forth, but also interest in
*  quantum computing, quantum information, it's become a little bit less
*  objectionable to worry about the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I, it definitely has become less objectionable.
*  I mean, you know, you've talked with David Albert about this.
*  Uh, things are certainly not the way that they were when he was in
*  graduate school, right?
*  You know, um, I, you know, when I was in undergrad, I was curious about these
*  things and I had some professors saying, why are you asking these questions?
*  But there was also David Merman who said, yes, ask these questions.
*  Um, and, um, you know, my, my PhD advisor, um, is certainly not someone who
*  spends time thinking about these things, even though he's a very, very, very
*  good physicist and a very smart man, but he doesn't mind that I think about these
*  things.
*  Um, uh, he just would have minded if I had spent time doing that rather than
*  doing my research when I was in graduate school and I didn't do that.
*  Um, uh, so yeah, um, I think, I think that part of it is just, you know, people
*  look for new options, right?
*  People, people come into a new field or come into a newly resurgent field.
*  And want to do something new, um, which is completely understandable.
*  Uh, I also think some of it comes from, um, an understanding on the part of
*  people who are sympathetic to the Copenhagen interpretation, that if they
*  want it to survive, they can no longer ignore the competition.
*  Um, so there, you know, for, for many, many years, the strategy was what
*  alternatives, right?
*  There are no alternatives.
*  I did at one point, I'm on the colloquium committee at Caltech and I suggested
*  getting a talk on Bohmian mechanics and I was swiftly slept down with a withering
*  gaze.
*  If that's a mixed metaphor that I can get away with.
*  Yeah.
*  So we're not quite there yet.
*  Yeah.
*  Situation might be improving a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think, I think that's right.
*  I mean, on, on the one hand, sure.
*  That's true.
*  On the other hand, people have been inviting me to give physics colloquia at,
*  you know, some pretty good places.
*  Like I gave talks.
*  Um, it wasn't a colloquium, but it was a public talk sponsored by the
*  Harvard physics department.
*  Um, uh, Cornell has invited me back.
*  Michigan's invited me back.
*  Granted, that's cause I went to both of those places, Michigan for my PhD, but,
*  but still those are good schools.
*  They're, they're good, good physics departments.
*  Um, and, and other departments that I have no affiliation with have also
*  invited me and you did not get tomatoes thrown at me.
*  I did not get tomatoes thrown at me.
*  I thought I was going to get tomatoes thrown at me and I didn't, you know, I
*  gave a talk at Berkeley lab, which is, you know, almost in my backyard and.
*  Nothing bad happened.
*  Um, uh, and, and they knew what I was coming to give a talk about.
*  You know, I made it very, very clear in the title and abstract, you know, I was
*  not saying, you know, I'm not a partisan for any particular interpretation.
*  I was just saying, Hey, the measurement problem is a thing.
*  And it's, it's an important open problem in physics.
*  That doesn't mean that everybody has to work on it any more than anybody.
*  Then, you know, everybody has to work on any other open problem, right?
*  We wouldn't want that, but you should be aware of that.
*  It's an open problem, you know, the same way that everyone's aware that we don't
*  have a theory, you know, we don't have a definite well accepted theory of quantum
*  gravity, right?
*  That's, that's a well-known open problem, even if you don't work on that.
*  And relatedly, maybe in fact, part of the reason why people have not been too much
*  in favor of thinking about quantum foundations is that it has the aura of
*  philosophy about it.
*  And, you know, for those of us who think it's an important problem, that's a good
*  thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's been probably that in statistical mechanics, arrow of time type
*  stuff, the foundations of quantum mechanics are the area in which the
*  philosophers have in some sense, carried the torch for a while as physicists
*  have been ignoring things.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's right.
*  I mean, the whole disciplinary split between physics and philosophy is a pretty
*  modern invention.
*  You know, we used to call scientists natural philosophers, right?
*  Einstein and Bohr would not have understood it.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, it used to be that, that physicists generally had a pretty good
*  schooling in philosophy and certainly didn't have outright contempt for it.
*  And in less than a century, we've gotten to a point where many well-known
*  scientists and physicists do have open public contempt for philosophy.
*  And, and, you know, I, I, I do talk about that a little bit toward the end of my
*  book.
*  I'm really not quite sure why that happens.
*  I mean, I've heard it suggested that it coincided with the shift in the center of
*  physics from Europe to the United States.
*  I think that that's correct.
*  And I think that there's certainly Americans have always been more down to
*  earth, practical folk.
*  Yes.
*  None of this abstract nonsense for us.
*  We're going to build things.
*  That is absolutely true.
*  But, but it's also not true that, you know, there are no American physicists who
*  have, you know, philosophical inclinations.
*  There always have been some, right?
*  It's, I think there's a lot of different sociological things that went into it.
*  World War II not only shift at the center of physics to the U S it also, you know,
*  credit created the era of big science.
*  And that certainly had something to do with it.
*  Um, but, but I'm still sort of puzzled.
*  Um, you know, you get, you get physicists saying these things about philosophy.
*  And I don't think, you know, sure.
*  We physicists have, have a deserved reputation for being arrogant when it comes
*  to looking at other fields.
*  But I don't think that you would get a physicist, you know, just saying, I don't
*  understand why anybody does, I don't know, sheet metal production, right?
*  That just seems like a silly thing.
*  And, you know, anybody who studies best practices in that is just wasting,
*  that wasting their time, right?
*  It's, I don't know anything about sheet metal production, but I do know that,
*  you know, it's probably good to do it in a way that people don't get hurt.
*  Right.
*  Because when you're manufacturing anything, people can get hurt.
*  That's why I'm not an experimental physicist, but, um,
*  well, I think you said, I forget whether it was in your voice in your book or
*  whether it was, you were quoting someone, but there was this wonderful idea that
*  part of the reason might, might even bell who said part of the reason for the
*  rejection of philosophy and foundational questions more generally was that most
*  physicists think that if they would just spend 20 minutes thinking about it, they
*  could figure it all out.
*  They just haven't found the time yet.
*  That is indeed bell.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Yeah.
*  No, he was, he was a really, really good writer and speaker.
*  Well, I hope that, uh, things are getting better.
*  Well, you know, we're on the same side in terms of what would qualify as better,
*  but I do think that slowly, gradually it's getting there.
*  Your book, uh, I think definitely had a salutary effect.
*  Hopefully mine does.
*  Uh, and we're looking forward to whatever book you end up writing next.
*  Thank you.
*  Yeah.
*  So am I.
*  Adam Becker.
*  Thanks so much for being on the podcast.
*  Thanks for having me.
