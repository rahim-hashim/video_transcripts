Economics is seeing an upsurge in the importance of controlled, reproducible empirical studies. One area where this has had a great impact is on development economics, which studies the economies of low- and middle-income societies. Edward Miguel has been at the forefront of both the revolution in empirical methods, and in applying those techniques to alleviating poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.
Edward Miguel received his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard university. He is currently Distinguished Professor of Economics and Oxfam Professor in Environmental and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also Faculty co-Director of the Center for Effective Global Action and a Faculty Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Among his awards are the Frisch Medal of the Econometric Society, the Kenneth Arrow Prize of the International Health Economics Association, and multiple teaching awards.

# Mindscape 318 | Edward Miguel on the Developing Practice of Development Economics
**Mindscape Podcast:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know if any of you out there are fans of the web comic girl genius. I'm a huge fan of girl genius [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3.56s)]
*  it's a comic by Phil and Katya folio the artists and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=11.46s)]
*  It tells a story it's been going on for years now [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=15.8s)]
*  So if you want to like take a weekend off and catch up if you haven't read it [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  There's plenty of material there and it's very complicated story with a lot of moving parts, but it's a kind of a steampunk [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=22.26s)]
*  Almost medieval setting so there are dragons and there are swords, but there's also [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=29.38s)]
*  science of a sort but it's kind of fantasy science [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=34.78s)]
*  So rather than just ordinary scientists, they have mad scientists called sparks in the comic and there's a lot of jokes [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=39.04s)]
*  It's a mostly humor filled web comic [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=47.08s)]
*  One of the characters a minor character in girl genius is presented as a mad social [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=50.04s)]
*  Scientist rather than most of the mad scientists who are you know building death rays and flying machines [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=55.660000000000004s)]
*  He's experimenting on people and even within the comic they say like you don't meet a lot of mad social scientists [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=61.540000000000006s)]
*  But at one point there's a place where the mad social scientist is explaining what a soft-hearted guy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=67.94s)]
*  He is and as evidence he says, you know on Christmas time [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=74.38s)]
*  I sometimes like to take the children that I'm experimenting on out of their container tanks and give them presents for Christmas [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=79.62s)]
*  And the other you know, the mad scientists are portrayed as pretty devilish people most of the time [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=87.34s)]
*  Anyway, the other characters look at him in horror at the idea of children in container tanks and he says oh don't worry [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=93.66s)]
*  Not the control group. So the joke of course is that if you're a mad social scientist [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=100.46s)]
*  You have to do experiments on human beings, but then there's other people who you don't [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=106.68s)]
*  Experiment on that's the control group and you just leave them in their container tanks even for Christmas [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=111.6s)]
*  and the reason I'm telling this extended not especially humorous anecdote is because [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=116.44s)]
*  It's not completely divorced from the reality of being a social scientist [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=121.64s)]
*  the methodologies that are accessible to you are just different than those that are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=126.92s)]
*  Accessible to physicists or biologists or chemists right where you can literally run trials over and over again [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  Changing conditions in whatever ways you want because social scientists have to deal with human beings and human beings actually have some rights [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=138.48s)]
*  That's certainly not an insuperable barrier. You can do things that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  People volunteer for psychologists do it all the time [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  But also you can just study what happens in the world, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=152.72s)]
*  And again many kinds of science need to do that if you're an archaeologist or you're a cosmologist for that matter [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=156.32s)]
*  You're not running experiments over and over again [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=162.92s)]
*  You don't redo the universe you just look at the universe and try to figure out what is happening in a social science like economics [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=164.96s)]
*  That's the traditional way of doing things not running an experiment [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=171.56s)]
*  Rather just seeing what happens in the world and trying to tease out the patterns [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=176.44s)]
*  But that methodology is changing a little bit [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  Economists are increasingly trying to do controlled [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=184.16s)]
*  randomized experiments where they sort of do their best not to induce [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=188.2s)]
*  unwanted correlations between [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=194.64s)]
*  People in one condition and people in the other condition of course in ways that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  Treat the dignity of the individual people as well as they can [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  So today's guest Ted Miguel is an economist at the University of California [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=204.76s)]
*  Berkeley and his specialty is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=209.72s)]
*  Development economics so he thinks about the economies of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=211.64s)]
*  relatively poor countries right to developing countries specializing in fact in sub-saharan Africa [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  which is some of the poorest countries on the globe and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=221.32s)]
*  He does his best as well as we'll talk about in the podcast to do sort of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=225.2s)]
*  methodologically careful analyses running randomized controlled trials [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=231.92s)]
*  Making methods and data collection strategies as transparent as open as possible [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=236.88s)]
*  Ideally making things reproducible there is not as as Ted he goes by Ted as he says in the discussion [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=243.44s)]
*  economics does not have as bad of a reproducibility crisis as [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=251.44s)]
*  Feels like psychology have been struggling with but there is still some there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=255.64000000000001s)]
*  so you want to make it possible for other people to run your experiments as well and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=259.32s)]
*  What's fascinating about this conversation is he makes a very convincing case that we've actually learned an enormous amount [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=264.64s)]
*  About how to help the most poor countries. It's it's not something where you just have to bash your head against the wall [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  There are clear strategies where you can intervene [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes as simple as just cash transfers giving people money, but other times [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=283.24s)]
*  Slightly more complicated strategies like curing diseases or building roads or whatever and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=289.12s)]
*  Ironically, of course, we live in a world now [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=295.88s)]
*  Which is somewhat pulling back from the idea of foreign aid and helping other countries [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=297.76s)]
*  Just as we are getting better at actually knowing what kinds of interventions can help [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=302.72s)]
*  As we say in the podcast, hopefully the pendulum will swing back once again and we'll put our knowledge to better use [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=308.76s)]
*  You know, we live in a world where there are wild disparities of wealth and health and education and conditions of all different sorts [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=317.44s)]
*  I think that we in the wealthier parts of the country [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=325.92s)]
*  But parts of the world rather should do some part to help those in lesser off [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  Parts of the world and we know how to do it. There's no excuse for us [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=336.56s)]
*  Really, hopefully we can convince some people to get on that bandwagon. So let's go [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=341.0s)]
*  Edward Miguel welcome to the mindscape podcast [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=346.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. I wanted to start just by sort of getting a [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  Mindset check about being I guess a developmental economist. Is that a good thing to call you? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=355.0s)]
*  Yeah, we call you a developmental economist. We're a big company. We're a big company [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=362.12s)]
*  We're a big company. We're a big company. We're a big company [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=365.92s)]
*  And we're a big company. We're a big company. We're a big company [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=369.36s)]
*  Economist is that a good thing to call you? Yeah, we call it development economist but development economist. Yeah [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=373.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah developmental would be sounds like childhood development or something like that. I guess [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  so, you know economics obviously is central to many many things, but I think a lot of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=386.16s)]
*  economists I associate with studying like, you know [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  rich people stuff finance [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  You know shipping and things like that and and here you are choosing of your own free will to think about [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=399.32s)]
*  Places in the world that are less well off [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=405.78s)]
*  Economically, so sort of what what drives you to that and what's it like to be that kind of economist? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  There's no doubt about what you say and you know, certainly a family gatherings [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=414.56s)]
*  You know relatives always want stock tips because they know I'm an economist and it's like well [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=419.56s)]
*  You don't want my stuff [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=424.94s)]
*  But yeah early on for me [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=427.66s)]
*  You know, I came to economics through international development rather than the other way around [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=429.98s)]
*  So I was always interested in global inequality. Even when I was a teenager it fascinated me [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=434.82s)]
*  You know, why do we live in a world with such just intense disparities between rich and poor countries? I think it was [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=440.44s)]
*  Kind of heightened for me. Both of my parents are immigrants. And so when I got to travel to see my cousins [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=447.7s)]
*  In different parts of the world they were you know, a lot poorer than we were growing up [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  I was growing up in the suburbs of New York City. So [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=457.58s)]
*  that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=460.5s)]
*  Just lit something in me and I was trying to figure out how I could help make progress on those issues [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=461.82s)]
*  How could I study that? Okay. I was a kid who really liked math and science. I was actually an undergrad at MIT [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=466.62s)]
*  I studied math at MIT [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=472.14s)]
*  But then really discovered economics at MIT so MIT of course is a science and engineering school math school [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=476.34s)]
*  but has an amazing economics department and has for like almost a hundred years and [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=481.74s)]
*  I decided to you know apply my [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=487.02s)]
*  Analytical abilities to try to understand global poverty and inequality. So [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=491.66s)]
*  That's how I came to it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=496.58s)]
*  I do love economics and I think for folks who come at things with you know, strong interest in math and stats and modeling [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=498.18s)]
*  It's a great field because we are trying to bring structure to the world [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=505.82s)]
*  We're trying to come up with general insights and we're doing that formally and quantitatively [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=510.68s)]
*  In a way that I think you know is appealing you're a physicist so you get it and a lot of economists [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=515.96s)]
*  Come from a math or physics, you know background [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=521.8s)]
*  But the challenges are complex and human beings are complicated so, you know, it's not an easy task [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=526.12s)]
*  The spherical cows are hard to come by in economics. It's hilarious the extent to which, you know here on the podcast [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=531.28s)]
*  I try to have people from a wide variety of fields and I do but some huge fraction of them always say but as an [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=537.34s)]
*  Undergraduate I studied math or physics [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=543.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it was interesting, you know being at MIT because I felt like there were so many different fields [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=547.62s)]
*  We were studying but like we were all fluent in math, you know, I mean like that was kind of the common [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=553.58s)]
*  that's what we do for us and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=557.5s)]
*  It gives you a you know way of thinking about the world and some analytical approaches that are very useful and you know [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=560.5s)]
*  I think for us in economics we've [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=566.9s)]
*  Looked around other fields whether it's physics for our kind of formal models or whether it's clinical trials for when we do [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=569.8199999999999s)]
*  Statistical work and we've tried to bring in those best tools from other fields into economics [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=577.66s)]
*  So economics ends up being a pretty eclectic [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=583.26s)]
*  Pretty broad field and a very like practical field and and that's one of the things that actually appeals to me about it [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=585.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, that's great because the next question I wanted to ask about being a development economist was [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=592.86s)]
*  Unlike being theoretical physicists if there's some balancing you have to do between purely [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=597.54s)]
*  Understanding the world and trying to make it a better place [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=602.58s)]
*  And you know you mentioned that the trying to make it a better place was part of your motivation [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=605.02s)]
*  Is this an ongoing thing you have to keep balancing? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=609.62s)]
*  It definitely isn't and within say my department or any department [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=612.9s)]
*  There are folks that really are kind of lined up along that continuum from more of the basic science to more of the applied work [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=616.78s)]
*  And you know even in my own work [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=623.5799999999999s)]
*  I kind of move back and forth, you know along that line because some of the work I've done is more conceptual or methodological [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=625.56s)]
*  But the bulk of what I'm doing [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=631.9399999999999s)]
*  Really is applied because I'm driven by these these practical questions of how we can learn about how to improve [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=634.22s)]
*  lives for poor people [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=640.06s)]
*  Around the world and the idea is to bring the best tools and the best methods and then apply them to really important problems [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I've been working since early in my career on [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa the world's poorest region the region of the world with [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=653.6999999999999s)]
*  The lowest life expectancy the most armed conflict the highest rates of HIV we can kind of go down the list of [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=657.9s)]
*  challenges [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=664.42s)]
*  So there's no shortage of big topics for me to to study and you know early in my career [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=665.66s)]
*  I focused a lot on health impacts of [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=670.62s)]
*  Dealing with tropical disease more recently. I've been focusing on impacts of cash transfers [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=673.3s)]
*  Yeah, and how you know targeting cash transfers to poor people may or may not improve their lives [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=679.22s)]
*  And that's a really big question. There's been a big increase in those kinds of programs by government [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=685.88s)]
*  So part of the reason we focus on it is it's just such a big public policy question right now. I [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=691.02s)]
*  Think that it might be a little unfair but there's at least a stereotype that in math and physics there is a [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=696.26s)]
*  Sort of prestige hierarchy where the more abstract thing you work on the more prestigious it is [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  Is there anything like that in economics? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=710.74s)]
*  There is and traditionally it lined up exactly the way you said that the folks who were doing the really hard [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=713.9799999999999s)]
*  abstract theory and you know [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=721.18s)]
*  Complicated modeling of how markets work in general equilibrium [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=724.08s)]
*  Were really the high folks on the totem pole and the folks doing applied work in say development economics [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=728.12s)]
*  Like myself were farther down and in fact when I was an undergrad at MIT and I was applying I went straight through to grad [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=735.62s)]
*  School, I applied my senior year to grad school and you know, I'd gotten good grades and I was you know [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=741.1800000000001s)]
*  They my professors thought I could go to a good [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=745.76s)]
*  Grad program and when I told them my main field was gonna be development economics [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=748.88s)]
*  It said no, you can't write that on your application [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=753.46s)]
*  That doesn't that's not gonna track with your math and stats skills, but no I wrote it down [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=755.5600000000001s)]
*  I was like, that's what I'm gonna do and I ended up going to get my PhD at Harvard and [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=761.5200000000001s)]
*  That at that time at Harvard there wasn't even a development economic sequence at Harvard it was just a small field I had to go [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=768.24s)]
*  Back to MIT where I'd done my undergrad to take development economics graduate classes because it was such a small field and [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=775.1s)]
*  The amazing thing is during my career and I've been in the field, you know, I've been here at Berkeley 25 years [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=781.4200000000001s)]
*  Things have changed actually so that that traditional prestige structure has changed and it's even reflected in things like Nobel prizes [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=786.98s)]
*  Where over the last decade now several groups of applied researchers [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=793.9000000000001s)]
*  Have gotten the Nobel Prize for contributions that really are, you know a combination of you know [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=798.98s)]
*  Some new methods so there's always some methodological development in there for a Nobel Prize [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=804.2s)]
*  But you know uses of new types of data tackling new problems that's being recognized in the field [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=808.0s)]
*  So I think it's a little more even now in terms the prestige between the theorists and the applied people [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=813.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, okay [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=819.44s)]
*  I did want to get that that was very very helpful as sort of a background or the other big background question [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=820.44s)]
*  Which is almost hilariously overbroad is so how's the developing world doing these days? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=826.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, is there some sense in which [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=832.04s)]
*  Development is really going on or there are places where we just seem to be stuck [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=835.04s)]
*  Yeah, so I think the popular perception if one were to be on social media or just kind of get the you know [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=840.56s)]
*  The kind of vibes in the world today [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=846.56s)]
*  It would be pretty negative people would think well [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=848.7199999999999s)]
*  You know, we're stagnating the world isn't doing well and sure there's a million challenges in the world [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=851.88s)]
*  But if we look at data systematically over the last 30 years 35 years 40 years [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=856.5999999999999s)]
*  And look at low-income regions of the world. They've really been transformed now. Everybody knows the China case [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=862.04s)]
*  Yeah, China 40 years ago was really poor and now they're a middle-income country, you know [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=867.52s)]
*  Still way poorer than the US, you know per capita income in China is like 1 fifth of the US, right? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=872.1999999999999s)]
*  So huge gap still but you know, it used to be 120th or something [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=876.8s)]
*  But even other parts of the world in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have experienced a lot of economic growth [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=881.0799999999999s)]
*  Improve living standards big reductions in infant mortality big improvements in health indicators [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=888.14s)]
*  reductions in malnutrition, etc [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=894.5s)]
*  So, you know objectively the last 30 something years have been really great for international development [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=896.22s)]
*  In a way that I don't think the popular, you know [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=902.66s)]
*  The man on the street or the person on the street really appreciates and you know [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=906.26s)]
*  Part of what we do in our field is measure these things [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=909.8199999999999s)]
*  so like the most basic thing we do as development economists is measure hard things if you're [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=911.9s)]
*  Trying to measure living standards for a subsistence farmer in rural, Mali [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=917.18s)]
*  It's kind of hard but we've developed tools to do that to measure living standards and those things [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=920.74s)]
*  You know tell the same story as the official government statistics things have gotten better [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=926.3s)]
*  I mean maybe talking about those tools would be useful. I know that there's a [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=930.62s)]
*  To me as a scientist a weird discussion in economics about the role of the empirical [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=936.26s)]
*  Side of things, you know in physics like of course [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=942.54s)]
*  empirical side of things is the point whereas like in economics [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=946.78s)]
*  There's at least a little debate about it or maybe maybe the debate is just more about how to do it correctly [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=950.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's I think it's both I think again traditionally the the folks doing theory [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=956.62s)]
*  Yeah, kind of where the the [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=963.22s)]
*  Have the most prestige and the most influence and did look down on folks that got their hands dirty with data [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=965.74s)]
*  But but that's less of a majority view now [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=972.62s)]
*  There really is a debate about how to do empirical work how to you know how to do the science how to test things how to [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=974.82s)]
*  test theory the big debate in our field is how close should those tests be to theory and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  Should the the tests be like really motivated by economic theory or should they be a little more theory agnostic? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=987.5s)]
*  That's really the debate and I've been into you know in my branch of development economics and in my own career [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=994.22s)]
*  I've been part of the group that's been a little more skeptical of a lot of the accepted theory because in development [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1000.66s)]
*  economics a lot of the assumptions of those theories about you know how markets work and how you know how well markets work and [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1007.14s)]
*  How good information is in the world about how markets work all those things just don't hold as well [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1012.54s)]
*  So we've been a little skeptical about just like applying those theories off the shelf [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1017.38s)]
*  There's also been the whole what's called behavioral economics revolution, which is like the injection of psychology into economic theory [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1022.06s)]
*  Which has proven really valuable in sort of knocking down some traditional theory [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1028.92s)]
*  So I've been on this more theory agnostic side and what we've done is [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1033.1200000000001s)]
*  Brought the tools of medical trials and randomized control trials into development economics. I was very lucky as an undergrad at MIT [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1037.76s)]
*  My advisor the the faculty member I work closely with Michael Kramer [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  Was one of the first economist who started doing field experiments and RCTs in Africa [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1050.76s)]
*  And I was his undergrad array coding up, you know the data entry software and working on the statistics [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1056.1s)]
*  And then I went to grad school. I continued working with Kramer [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1061.4599999999998s)]
*  There as well and you know, Michael won the Nobel Prize with colleagues [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1064.82s)]
*  I guess six years ago for that for that work. So kind of right at the start [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1069.06s)]
*  I was part of that that view that said hey theory is really useful [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1074.1799999999998s)]
*  But let's not get so caught up in the theory that we don't see the world as it is. Let's let's let's run experiments [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1077.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's establish some empirical facts that then can drive the next generation of theory. That was really the the mentality [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1083.98s)]
*  And it's been an exciting thing to be part of neither physicists nor philosophers really do randomized control [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1092.18s)]
*  Trials, so why don't you tell us about what exactly that means in the economics context? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1099.42s)]
*  I'm actually more familiar with it probably in the medical context [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1104.02s)]
*  Yeah, the way we do trials in economics, you know builds on what's been done in medicine [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1106.78s)]
*  In fact a lot of the early trials like the first study that I worked on with Michael Kramer [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1111.9s)]
*  And this was one of the studies that was cited heavily in the Nobel, you know citation in [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1116.38s)]
*  2019 was a project to [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1122.18s)]
*  Improve child health in rural Kenyan schools. So there's a lot of health problems faced by East African kids [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1125.38s)]
*  But one of them that's really widespread is intestinal worm infections intestinal parasites like hookworm [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1131.94s)]
*  And in our data, you know 90 something percent of kids had these infections but they were super cheap to treat [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1137.34s)]
*  I think this is what attracted us to this intervention as [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1144.18s)]
*  Economists that like basically for less than a dollar a year. You can really clear these, you know worm infections out of kids [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1146.86s)]
*  And worm infections can lead to anemia and growth stunting and weakness fatigue, etc [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1153.86s)]
*  so this seemed like potentially very cost-effective and we worked with a [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1159.54s)]
*  Nonprofit and the government of Kenya to roll out a randomized control trial now the way it worked was [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1165.5s)]
*  The nonprofit we worked with had a limited budget [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1171.4s)]
*  They were gonna start in a small number of schools and gradually roll out this school health program [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1174.42s)]
*  And what we did is we convinced them in one of these early, you know earliest experiments in development economics [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1179.04s)]
*  We said hey, why don't you randomize the order of that rollout? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1184.66s)]
*  So it's very much like a medical trial where some schools were getting these drugs earlier some later [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1187.68s)]
*  That was what the rollout was gonna look like but now because it was randomized [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1193.36s)]
*  There's no reason to think that the early phase in schools should be any different statistically on average [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1196.9399999999998s)]
*  Compared to those that got it, you know a few years later as the rollout happened [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1203.4799999999998s)]
*  So that was the way it, you know, it worked for us very much like a medical trial [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1207.8s)]
*  You have something like a treatment group and a control group and you can compare outcomes across those groups and get unbiased [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1211.3999999999999s)]
*  Estimates of the effect of the program and you know, we found in that case and again [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1217.1999999999998s)]
*  That was a program that was launched my the summer after my first year of grad school [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1221.58s)]
*  I went to Kenya to set it up in the field and [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1225.54s)]
*  There was very little research infrastructure in place [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1228.6599999999999s)]
*  It was it was a it was a lesson for me in persistence because things didn't really work and you know [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1231.22s)]
*  It was hard to get you know an internet there were no internet cafes even in 1997 [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1237.54s)]
*  You know in Kenya at that time was very hard to connect. So we got it done. We set it up [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1242.46s)]
*  We work with great partners and found really interesting stuff. So, you know, first of all the drugs were very effective [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1247.28s)]
*  We had, you know collaborations with health authorities to measure the worm infections [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1253.28s)]
*  They went down a lot and kids started going to school a lot more [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1257.2399999999998s)]
*  So it really looked like tropical disease was holding kids back from going to school [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1260.76s)]
*  So there was a big increase in school attendance [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1266.08s)]
*  and [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1268.7199999999998s)]
*  That was you know, sort of a finding of that that first paper the other thing we found and this really links to you know [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1269.9199999999998s)]
*  The medical literature and the broader epidemiological literatures we were collecting these [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1276.8s)]
*  peristological surveys on worm infections in the local area and [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1281.3999999999999s)]
*  Even people that hadn't gotten the drugs who lived within a few miles of these schools [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1284.84s)]
*  Showed big reductions in worm infections because we had broken the cycle of transmission [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1290.08s)]
*  Okay, you know mass treat a school then they're not infecting other people [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1294.8799999999999s)]
*  so we documented the kind of like first-order direct effects and then the spillover effects and [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1298.1399999999999s)]
*  that [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1304.44s)]
*  Approach we had to develop some new econometric approaches to do to estimate those spillover effects. It went beyond the simple [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1305.68s)]
*  Medical trial treatment versus control group comparisons. We had to put a little more statistical structure on the problem [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1313.52s)]
*  and [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1320.8s)]
*  It was super exciting. I mean for me as a young scholar you can imagine [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1322.1200000000001s)]
*  I was working on a project that ended up, you know kind of being a Nobel Prize winning [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1325.28s)]
*  Project, you know with with my advisor Michael Kramer. So very exciting stuff. We built on medical trials [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1329.28s)]
*  And tackle this issue and we're able to really document a highly cost-effective [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1336.0800000000002s)]
*  intervention so the economists and the policymakers and the finance ministers cared about it, too, but [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1341.48s)]
*  It's a great story and I love it, but you know, I did read about a little bit before we are doing an interview here and [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1347.64s)]
*  Apparently not everyone agrees with all the conclusions and there is literally something called the worm wars [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1354.2s)]
*  Which I was unfamiliar with so I don't know how that escaped my attention [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1360.24s)]
*  Yeah, the worm war so that was about ten years ago [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1363.72s)]
*  That that kind of you know broke out. It's a very interesting [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1367.2s)]
*  Thing to be part of when academic debates on statistical models and what the right statistical approach kind of you know when that goes [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1372.1599999999999s)]
*  You know into the mainstream media. It's it's not our you know, comfort zone as scientists [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1379.96s)]
*  Like we're used to be debating, you know certain models and so in some ways it was very it was very strange [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1384.76s)]
*  You know there I think that you know, the broader debate about worms is for folks in the global health community [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1389.56s)]
*  You know worms aren't the most important thing very understandably right folks are dying of HIV folks are dying of malaria and TB [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1398.28s)]
*  and there's just like, you know in sub-saharan Africa huge health challenges and [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1404.96s)]
*  If you were looking at just mortality risk, you know [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1409.76s)]
*  These worm infections aren't aren't a first-order issue and I you know, I get that and I think as a result [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1411.92s)]
*  Some of the work on worms just automatically gets a lot of pushback or people like wait [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1417.92s)]
*  You're focusing all this attention here and advocating for treating, you know worms [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1421.88s)]
*  We should be putting whatever scarce resources we have into something else [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1425.68s)]
*  And I think our perspective as economists a little bit different in saying hey [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1428.5600000000002s)]
*  If you can really treat a kid for 30 cents a year then for like very little money [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1433.2s)]
*  You could be mass treating a whole county [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1438.4s)]
*  and [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1441.92s)]
*  You know one of the things that we were able to document not just in that first study [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1442.88s)]
*  But we've continued following up this population of thousands of kids in rural Kenya from the early experiment over time [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1446.08s)]
*  We're still following them up [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1452.3999999999999s)]
*  So now it's 27 years later to look at long-run life outcomes as these kids that got additional years of health treatments when they were like [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1454.3999999999999s)]
*  10 years old if you look at them in their 30s, they're earning more in the labor market [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1461.76s)]
*  Like there's not just like a short-run education return. There's like a real economic labor market return on average [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1466.96s)]
*  They're earning like 10% more [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1472.32s)]
*  So for 30 cents a year [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1474.48s)]
*  You know with that investment people could be earning, you know, $50 more a year as adults just like a huge rate of return [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1476.48s)]
*  So we're not just looking at sort of absolute effects [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1483.76s)]
*  But just also rate of return like the rate of return on this is super [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1486.72s)]
*  Super high. So there were debates about the statistical models used [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1490.6399999999999s)]
*  In that early study in the first paper [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1494.8s)]
*  I because I was the one doing the the statistical coding made one coding error [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1497.36s)]
*  As we estimated those spillover effects [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1503.0400000000002s)]
*  So the coding was fine for the direct effects for the effects within three kilometers [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1505.5200000000002s)]
*  But then when I was coding up the spillover effects between three to six kilometers, I made a coding error [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1510.4s)]
*  I basically capped the number of schools. I would consider just [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1514.8000000000002s)]
*  You know in the code and so actually when you go out to six kilometers [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1518.4s)]
*  the kind of corrected code has [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1523.2800000000002s)]
*  Standard errors on the estimate sort of like the degree of uncertainty on the estimate that gets really large [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1526.72s)]
*  So the worm wars fundamentally was about folks and I shared that code with them [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1530.8799999999999s)]
*  I found the error corrected it shared it with other scholars [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1534.96s)]
*  And they said well if you go out to six kilometers now, you have like really imprecise estimates [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1538.3999999999999s)]
*  So we don't know if we believe anything and of course our response was wait [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1542.72s)]
*  We have direct effects. We have effects to three kilometers like those are really precisely estimated. Those are meaningful [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1545.28s)]
*  But yes, we can't really say anything with confidence from three to six kilometers. Those estimates are noisy [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1550.8s)]
*  So again, there was kind of a methodological point that I thought was [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1556.3999999999999s)]
*  You know pretty straightforward and and folks who evaluated the statistical side of the worm wars [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1559.2s)]
*  I think more or less, you know [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1565.92s)]
*  Sided with our views, although, you know, you can read about it [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1568.0s)]
*  But I think because worms were controversial it just got all this attention that like wait a minute [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1570.88s)]
*  These economists are saying we should be focusing on worms and they're you know, distracting attention from malaria or something else [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1576.08s)]
*  So anyway, it was an interesting experience as a researcher who's not a [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1582.08s)]
*  You know media person, yeah [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1585.44s)]
*  But but I think at the end of the day that there was a scientific debate and I think [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1588.24s)]
*  You know, we kept it, you know, both sides kept it largely professionals. Just some folks in the media. I think [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1593.28s)]
*  Gave it a lot more attention than it maybe should have gotten. Look there were string wars back in the 90s about super string [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1599.04s)]
*  You can have wars about anything like you're actually spending money and saving lives. It's a higher stakes game [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1605.44s)]
*  But is part of the media attention because the this kind of thing is at least adjacent to effective altruism and other [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1610.56s)]
*  Things that get labeled as movements in the popular imagination [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1618.32s)]
*  For sure [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1621.84s)]
*  And I think the whole our early study on deworming and the follow-up study showing the rate of return like we were doing [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1622.48s)]
*  These kinds of effective altruism style calculations and creating those estimates before the term had even been coined and I think [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1629.12s)]
*  Our work was picked up on by that movement tons of [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1636.4s)]
*  Funding from effective altruist organizations has gone literally into deworming programs around the world in [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1640.72s)]
*  So first first of all in Kenya and again, it's been a great part of my career [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1646.8000000000002s)]
*  Just to see how ideas from research can get translated into action [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1650.96s)]
*  But because we did this work in Kenya and we did the follow-up work [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1654.96s)]
*  We were very active in disseminating those findings to policymakers and researchers [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1657.92s)]
*  And what not in Kenya to the world bank to the who as well and the government of Kenya in 2009 [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1662.24s)]
*  Put in place a national deworming program with the design of the school-based deworming [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1669.76s)]
*  That was like based on what we had done in our earlier [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1673.6000000000001s)]
*  Study, so that scaled it up to millions, but then [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1676.72s)]
*  Really powered I think by effective altruist organizations [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1680.48s)]
*  It was scaled up to other countries, you know [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1684.64s)]
*  India has had mass campaigns with the world bank and the world bank has had a lot of people who have been in the world bank [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1686.24s)]
*  Mass campaigns with a hundred million kids a year getting treated [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1691.6s)]
*  You know vietnam has had campaigns nigeria, you know, ethiopia, etc. So [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1694.48s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of kids per year have been getting these these treatments at very low cost [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1699.28s)]
*  Uh in part because of our work and the work of other scholars [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1704.9599999999998s)]
*  So I do think that it it it became like the flagship for the movement and that did increase media attention for sure [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1707.6s)]
*  And again this study the kind of original study and the follow-ups [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1714.24s)]
*  Were, you know very heavily cited even in the nobel announcement, you know in 2019 for kramer and co-authors [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1717.6000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, we've been in the middle of that that that media attention [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1724.5600000000002s)]
*  And you know one of the things I tell my students and the folks in my group here [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1728.48s)]
*  Because there has been so much attention on it is like let's let's make sure we don't get caught up in all that like it [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1732.0800000000002s)]
*  Whatever we find in the data is what we find. Yes, some effects are going to be significant [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1738.0s)]
*  Some are going to be large some are going to be small [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1741.7600000000002s)]
*  And [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1744.4s)]
*  Yes, our results are going to be used by policymakers, but we just have to stand by them [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1745.36s)]
*  we have to believe in them and just keep the scientific ethos front and center and not just become policy advocates like if if I just [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1748.8s)]
*  If I do new research [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1756.56s)]
*  And the new research shows deworming has harms or deworming doesn't do anything good [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1758.24s)]
*  I'm going to try to put it out there just as strongly as my first results [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1762.16s)]
*  And if that changes the policy calculation great actually, that's that's a good thing. So [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1766.0s)]
*  You know, we're trying to keep the science front and center [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1770.56s)]
*  uh here I did have joshua green from harvard on the podcast a while back and [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1773.12s)]
*  He's involved with give directly and i'm pretty sure that i've given money to deworming projects because of that [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1778.24s)]
*  Involvement, so i've done my little bit of part there, but there's another thing you mentioned, which is the long-term follow-up [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1784.06s)]
*  You know speaking about this theme of how to be a good empiricist [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1790.8799999999999s)]
*  as an economist [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1794.6399999999999s)]
*  I get the feeling that [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1796.96s)]
*  There is some difficulty associated with doing long-term studies like there's a feeling that if you do [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1799.8400000000001s)]
*  If you try an intervention and it doesn't pan out [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1806.56s)]
*  Then you give up [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1809.52s)]
*  And you need to like really think very hard about spending resources on doing something longer term [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1810.96s)]
*  Yeah, it is very resource intensive, uh to follow people up, especially in settings [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1816.96s)]
*  You know low resource settings like kenya [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1822.8s)]
*  Um [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1825.52s)]
*  We have been following up the original deworming sample now [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1826.72s)]
*  A representative subset of them. So there's around 6 000 folks. We've been following up [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1831.12s)]
*  for 27 years, um [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1835.76s)]
*  We've gotten funding for many different sources to do it because we we need to like have we need to maintain a standing team [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1838.08s)]
*  Of enumerators of surveyors who are going and finding respondents wherever they move [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1844.1599999999999s)]
*  We don't only want to look at the people that just stay in the original study area. It turns out [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1848.8799999999999s)]
*  Once you get 10 or 15 years after the original intervention about half of them have moved to cities [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  So we need to like go and find them in nirobi and find them in mombasa. Some of them moved to uganda [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1858.16s)]
*  Some of them have moved even to you know, the gulf states and we do phone surveys with them. So [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1862.88s)]
*  You know, there's there's a whole enterprise there to um, keep in touch with them, but we've managed over 27 years [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1867.1200000000001s)]
*  to have an effective [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1874.0800000000002s)]
*  survey response rate [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1875.8400000000001s)]
*  Of 83 84 percent so we're very happy with that. It's balanced between the treatment and control group [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1877.76s)]
*  So we're actually able to to speak about the central tendency in the data, you know in a in a pretty representative way [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1882.8799999999999s)]
*  following the vast majority of [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1889.12s)]
*  Respondents and as I mentioned, you know when you invest in child health we find short-run effects on health and education [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1891.36s)]
*  And we find these longer run effects on for instance likelihood to move to nirobi likelihood of moving to a city [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1896.24s)]
*  It goes up by about 10 percent [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1901.68s)]
*  Earnings go up around 10 percent in that sample and people move into different types of occupations [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1904.5600000000002s)]
*  They move out of agriculture into various non-agricultural occupations like manufacturing jobs that are better paid [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1909.92s)]
*  Etc. So by tracing the data over a long period of time [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1916.3200000000002s)]
*  We can see how a health investment can transform people's lives in multiple different ways [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1920.0s)]
*  And it's something that that i'm really proud of it's taken, you know, again decades of work to build [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1926.48s)]
*  Um, yeah, and it's hard to do so not that many randomized control trials or any other studies sort of have had that [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1931.6000000000001s)]
*  You know ability to follow people over time [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1938.48s)]
*  They either haven't been able to raise the resources to do it or like you said, maybe they were discouraged by initial results [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1940.3200000000002s)]
*  Which is a bit unfortunate but but understandable too because they have limited time and they're going to kind of focus on on [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1947.8400000000001s)]
*  On big questions where they can maybe find, you know answers that are that are interesting [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1952.72s)]
*  The idea of the control group obviously is crucial to everything going on here, but [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1956.88s)]
*  Much like in medicine is there some you know feeling I don't know how to describe the feeling that [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1961.1200000000001s)]
*  If you really think the intervention is going to help [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1966.8s)]
*  Do you feel bad about not giving it to some random fraction of the people you're studying? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1969.84s)]
*  Yeah, definitely and I think you know for us, you know the the ethics of it [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1976.16s)]
*  I think that [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1980.24s)]
*  It's not exactly the same with our interventions in economics as it is in health [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1981.44s)]
*  But a lot of the same considerations apply certainly with a deworming intervention, which is a health intervention [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1985.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, we had to go through all the same kind of ethical approvals and whatnot as any medical trial, you know would have [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1990.4s)]
*  In our case, I think the ethics were interesting in the following sense again [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=1996.64s)]
*  We were working with a non-profit that was sort of like expanding a health program. The government wasn't doing mass deworming [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2000.4s)]
*  It wasn't kind of a standard program at that time in the late [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  In the late 90s and this non-profit was just scaling up gradually. So like we no one was being denied treatment [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2009.04s)]
*  It was really just a question like hey, they had identified a region with really high infection rates [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2016.08s)]
*  And actually you could make the case that randomizing was a pretty fair way to do it rather than just going to politically connected areas [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2020.8s)]
*  or something first so [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2026.32s)]
*  Um, you know in that case with resource scarcity [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2028.08s)]
*  You know not everybody was going to get treated and that's true for a lot of the development [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2031.2s)]
*  Economics interventions that we study that like when you're dealing with, you know governments or programs that have limited resources [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2034.64s)]
*  They're not going to be able to treat everybody and you know, i've worked as I mentioned briefly before i've been working on cash transfer [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2041.6s)]
*  interventions with you know, give directly and others [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2047.1s)]
*  and um [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2050.2400000000002s)]
*  they don't have enough cash to like [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2051.76s)]
*  Give cash transfers to all the poor people in kenya or tanzania or other countries like it's just limited [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2054.0s)]
*  they just they get donations from people like you and others they have a budget and [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2058.4s)]
*  Um, and so again you you might think that a lottery is a fair way to allocate resources once you've identified poor folks [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2062.6400000000003s)]
*  It's not clear which of them is more or less deserving [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2069.52s)]
*  But yeah, the ethical issues are very important. We debate them and talk about them a lot [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2072.32s)]
*  and um [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2077.28s)]
*  You know, uh the resource scarcity in some ways [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2080.0s)]
*  Um, you know makes it inevitable that not everybody's gonna that someone's going to be in a control group of some kind [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2083.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, is there something in economics that is analogous to the replication crisis that we've seen in psychology and other social sciences [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2088.48s)]
*  There is and that's something that that we're um [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2097.04s)]
*  We're working on here. In fact, I we're having a conference here today at berkeley [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2099.84s)]
*  From the berkeley initiative for transparency in the social sciences bits [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2104.32s)]
*  Which is an effort to kind of bring open science tools into the social sciences. We have had a replicability [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2107.84s)]
*  Crisis it hasn't been as severe in economics as in psychology. I think in social psychology in particular [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2115.22s)]
*  It's been so high profile. There's been [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2120.18s)]
*  You know real kind of bruising battles in that field so many instances of fraud and other things [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2122.42s)]
*  um, there haven't been as many in economics [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2128.66s)]
*  There's been more consensus since early on in the field around [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2132.26s)]
*  issues of data sharing and and the importance of [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2136.5s)]
*  You know, um computational reproduction of our work [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2140.02s)]
*  But we've had our own crisis [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2143.86s)]
*  So I don't know how much you follow the news [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2145.38s)]
*  But last week there was a kind of scandal coming out of the mit economics department where a grad student [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2146.58s)]
*  I did has been accused of [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2151.54s)]
*  Of fabricating a whole data set like a massive data set, uh, which I think purportedly was from a biotech company [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2154.18s)]
*  um, and you know claiming that the use of ai tools was accelerating discovery in this company and then you know pretty quickly [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2161.54s)]
*  You know based on the description of the company [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2168.7400000000002s)]
*  I think people in that field were like wait that could only be three or four companies [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2170.42s)]
*  Which one is it and and then it became clear that that it was it was apparently it's it's allegedly fabricated [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2173.3s)]
*  um, so we have our own crises and [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2179.78s)]
*  um, you know, there are tools to deal with these things things like data sharing [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2183.14s)]
*  Uh, just allowing other people to scrutinize your work is important [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2188.1800000000003s)]
*  This is an area where actually economics is is a bit ahead of medical research in that data sharing and sharing of data [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2191.46s)]
*  You know of underlying data sets and survey instruments and whatnot has been a lot slower in the health fields [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2197.22s)]
*  I think there's been a lot of [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2202.2599999999998s)]
*  Concern about sharing personally identifiable information pii in the health field understandably [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2204.02s)]
*  um, but you know [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2209.46s)]
*  Sometimes it may be a little bit of a pretext in that field for people who have collected data not to share their data with [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2210.82s)]
*  Others so they can write papers. I think that's [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2215.62s)]
*  At least you know a little bit of a concern and econ journals have been much more aggressive in forcing authors to post their data [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2218.02s)]
*  to make replication data public [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2224.9s)]
*  and [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2227.22s)]
*  Um, i'm really proud of that in our field because I think we were ahead of the curve on that and that's just central to [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2228.02s)]
*  Science we can't do science if no one else can scrutinize your work and verify your work [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2232.5s)]
*  It's just like a basic principle [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2236.2599999999998s)]
*  the irony of the mit paper was it was supposed to show that ai improve productivity, but it actually showed that ai improved the ability to [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2238.18s)]
*  Be fraudulent to make up data and things like that because I remember the old days in physics [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2245.94s)]
*  You know people would miss would reuse a graph of one thing for an entirely different [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2251.7s)]
*  Claimed result and you would be able to eventually figure out that must be faked but with ai you can you can [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2257.06s)]
*  Fabricate data really well [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2263.22s)]
*  Yeah, apparently not well enough, I guess [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2266.02s)]
*  Thankfully, I guess the ai's don't get so good in a few years. We can't even [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2269.38s)]
*  Can't even detect it. Um [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2273.86s)]
*  yeah, no, I mean I think this it's just touching on this other open question of the role that ai will play in our work going [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2276.1s)]
*  forward and [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2281.7s)]
*  Uh, you know for the kind of work that we do where we're collecting original data in the field [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2283.62s)]
*  Like there's just going to be a lot of machinery [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2287.46s)]
*  And data generation or feel that will not be automated that ai can't do we have to actually talk to people [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2290.2599999999998s)]
*  It's complicated to measure living standards. There's like ways that we do that kind of measurement [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2296.2599999999998s)]
*  but other parts of the research process will change and [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2301.7799999999997s)]
*  We're already seeing it. I mean even in this the conference this bits, you know transparency conference that i'm i'm at today [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2306.66s)]
*  You know, there's a lot more use of ai in extracting estimates from existing studies for use in meta analysis [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2314.2599999999998s)]
*  And actually that's a pretty good use of ai tools. Like if we get the right training data [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2320.8199999999997s)]
*  you know because our papers have a certain format and results are being presented in a certain way, but if we can [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2325.7799999999997s)]
*  You know get the right kind of you know [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2331.14s)]
*  High quality training data then then it could be that the llms can go pretty far in [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2333.06s)]
*  In certain forms of data extraction and speed up meta research. So [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2337.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm optimistic about certain applications [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2341.46s)]
*  But it's not going to take over all of our research [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2344.34s)]
*  There's still realms of research where we need to generate original data that at least for us in development economics the ai's can't do [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2346.26s)]
*  Let's go back to the issue of the the cash transfers in kenya because I know that that's been a big project and and I guess [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2353.3s)]
*  Is there a distinction between cash transfers and basic income or is one just a subset of the other? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2360.9s)]
*  They're very closely related. I think the conception of basic income is it's a kind of ongoing [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2366.5s)]
*  Income support over, you know, say multiple years [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2373.46s)]
*  and [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2377.14s)]
*  You know basic income is a form of cash transfer [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2378.02s)]
*  But there are also one-time cash transfers where cash transfers given at different frequency or you know with different sizes [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2380.9s)]
*  So that's right. I think cash transfers are kind of the catch-all [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2386.74s)]
*  Um frame for us the work we started working on about 11 years ago in kenya with give directly was a very large rct [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2389.62s)]
*  Of a one-time cash transfer, but a really big cash transfer [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2397.3s)]
*  So in us nominal terms, uh in 2014 it was a thousand dollars [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2401.46s)]
*  per household [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2406.82s)]
*  And you know given the difference in prices between the us and kenya where prices tend to be lower there [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2408.26s)]
*  Um, that would be the equivalent in real us dollar terms at the time of closer to two thousand dollars [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2414.3399999999997s)]
*  Which for kenyan living standards at that time would be something like 75 percent of average household income [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2420.8999999999996s)]
*  So a really I mean a huge transfer right like that'd be the equivalent of giving tens of thousands of dollars to a poor household [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2426.5s)]
*  In the u.s. So we studied that with give directly. It was kind of relatively early days in the cash transfer movement [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2432.02s)]
*  and [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2439.2999999999997s)]
*  The way we designed it and this is actually, you know going back to your earlier point about theory [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2440.42s)]
*  This was actually a an intervention that we very much designed with economic theory in mind [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2444.34s)]
*  So it was an rct. It was randomized control trial [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2449.2200000000003s)]
*  But we were very interested in not just understanding the effect on the recipients [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2451.54s)]
*  But a little bit like the deworming study understanding those second order effects the spillover effects on the local economy [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2456.82s)]
*  And there are models in macroeconomics of what are called multipliers [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2462.58s)]
*  So, you know if you put if you inject money into the economy and people spend it [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2466.74s)]
*  In certain ways if like they have a very high what we call marginal propensity to consume like for every dollar [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2471.46s)]
*  They get they spend most of it. It's just going to generate lots of multipliers in the economy [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2477.06s)]
*  Because hey local businesses will get more revenue and then they'll be able to hire more workers [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2482.18s)]
*  And then those workers will spend more etc. Etc. So you get this this kind of multiplier effect [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2485.7s)]
*  Which is well modeled in macroeconomic theory [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2490.42s)]
*  So we were very interested in those models and we work with give directly to design a large enough experiment so we could understand [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2492.66s)]
*  multipliers and estimate multipliers and that was [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2501.22s)]
*  Novel at the time because most of the macroeconomic estimates and multipliers are not experimental and they're not based on rcts [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2504.8199999999997s)]
*  They're just like well the government had a stimulus program and let's kind of do a time series analysis or a pre post analysis [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2511.7799999999997s)]
*  effectively um [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2519.12s)]
*  Or in some cases more sophisticated designs, but this was you know an experimental design so it has some more validity [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2520.82s)]
*  And uh, we put in place this, you know the data collection to [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2527.78s)]
*  To estimate effects on the local economy and found really big multipliers much bigger multipliers than you would see [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2532.1000000000004s)]
*  In the us and you know [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2538.5800000000004s)]
*  There's good reasons why the marginal propensity to consume in rural kenya is really high if you target poor households [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2540.34s)]
*  We find that in the first year after they get the cash they spend like 90 percent of it like almost none of it's being saved [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2545.78s)]
*  It's just being spent so local business revenue goes up [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2550.5s)]
*  They hire more people like all those hypothesized things in the models come through in our data [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2554.18s)]
*  Um, and that means the dollars you give to poor folks in say a rural african setting [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2559.7s)]
*  Um, you know generate more than that dollar in local [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2565.62s)]
*  GDP so it makes cash transfers targeted to the poor look like a very attractive [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2569.44s)]
*  Policy it is a more expensive experiment to run than the deworming. It sounds like [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2575.14s)]
*  Much more because you know, like like I said if it's 30 cents per kid, you know for deworming [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2580.9s)]
*  This was a thousand dollars per household a very expensive [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2584.98s)]
*  Uh experiment for sure [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2588.98s)]
*  But really big economic impacts too, so, you know, I think that was the the flip side [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2592.34s)]
*  Because you know in many ways the the cash transfer program i've worked on [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2598.34s)]
*  In kenya follows the model of deworming study because from the start we were really interested in doing longer-term tracking of this population [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2603.06s)]
*  We really wanted to understand [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2609.54s)]
*  Not just spillovers in the short run, but these kind of like broader long-run effects [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2611.62s)]
*  So we've we've continued data collection now. It's been 11 years. We're still in the field collecting lots of data [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2615.06s)]
*  And we've been able to track economic effects over time as well as health effects [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2620.98s)]
*  So kind of things go full circle here in terms of understanding [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2625.46s)]
*  You know causal relationships between income and health and health and income in my own work [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2629.06s)]
*  What we found with cash transfers in kenya were really big health effects in particular [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2633.94s)]
*  For children so we were [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2639.54s)]
*  Able to collect data and get a full birth census of this population in kenya [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2641.7s)]
*  We were working in and again the scale of the cash transfer program in kenya was very large. We're working in an area [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2646.4199999999996s)]
*  with 300 000 people [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2652.4199999999996s)]
*  We collected full birth histories for women around the time the cash was going out and there's just tens of thousands of births in the data set [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2654.4199999999996s)]
*  And we find that in the year the cash transfer this big thousand dollar cash transfer was received [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2661.9399999999996s)]
*  By households in that year infant mortality [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2667.7799999999997s)]
*  In recipient areas fell by 40 percent. Wow, it's just a huge infant mortality reduction. It's just like a massive number [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2671.7s)]
*  and [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2679.7s)]
*  We're writing that up now. We're about to finish that that analysis. So [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2680.98s)]
*  Again, it's a gratifying thing about this work and it goes back, you know early in my career [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2685.8599999999997s)]
*  I could only have dreamed that i'd be able to work on big programs where we were like studying how [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2689.62s)]
*  Economic interventions like save lives and affected lives in this profound way [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2694.98s)]
*  And this seems to be an example cash transfers don't just benefit the local economy. They're like literally saving lives [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2700.7400000000002s)]
*  I can see how it would be extraordinarily gratifying. I wonder if it's also [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2707.3s)]
*  And there's an element of frustration that we live in a world with so much inequality [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2711.46s)]
*  That a relatively tiny amount of money is [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2717.14s)]
*  life-saving to so many people [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2721.44s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt about it. And again, it goes back to sort of you know, like if if you talk to the person on the street [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2724.58s)]
*  here in the u.s [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2729.46s)]
*  It's not clear they understand just exactly how much could be done with a few dollars [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2731.94s)]
*  And it's also not clear that they understand how little we've been spending on foreign aid and these forms of redistribution to poor people [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2737.38s)]
*  So, you know, there are some surveys out there where they ask americans, you know, how much [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2744.1800000000003s)]
*  How much do you think america is spending on foreign aid as a share of the government budget? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2748.7400000000002s)]
*  You know and people say oh, I think it's you know, 20 percent. I think it's 15 percent. Of course in truth [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2753.7799999999997s)]
*  And this this is even before what just happened with usaid the dismantling of usaid. It was like [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2759.8599999999997s)]
*  You know 0.3 of 1 percent of the budget or 0.2 of 1 percent of the budget was going to foreign aid [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2765.2999999999997s)]
*  So like minuscule amounts but for those really small amounts we were having big impacts. We were saving lives with hiv [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2771.38s)]
*  treatments and malaria treatments and cash transfers and [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2778.96s)]
*  And now even that like minuscule amount is being slashed by the current administration. It's really unclear what the future [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2782.74s)]
*  holds so [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2790.74s)]
*  There's this kind of misunderstanding about what we're doing [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2792.2599999999998s)]
*  And there's a misunderstanding about what we can do and I think it's frustrating and maybe it's a [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2796.66s)]
*  I guess ultimately it's a failure of ours as researchers and communicating what we're doing. I mean, we're trying [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2801.62s)]
*  Yeah, but somehow we're not getting the traction we need to tell people [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2806.82s)]
*  Hey, if you like don't drink that cup of coffee, that's six dollars now or five dollars [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2810.26s)]
*  You could give deworming drugs to 20 kids. Yeah, like that's pretty powerful, but people don't know it [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2816.0200000000004s)]
*  well [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2822.26s)]
*  You're on the podcast. You're doing your part. I mean, that's hopefully we'll we'll reach some people. I hope [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2823.3s)]
*  Hopefully we're not only reaching the converted already, but in terms of understanding why the effect is so big [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2828.6600000000003s)]
*  Um, I had this vague feeling that I read people talking about the the cost of [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2836.4199999999996s)]
*  Being poor right? Like if you're poor not only do you not have a lot of money [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2843.06s)]
*  But you're just hit with all of these fines and fees and things that make it impossible to pull yourself out and and i'm [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2846.8199999999997s)]
*  guessing [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2854.96s)]
*  Hypothesizing that uh, you know a big one-time [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2856.16s)]
*  Pile of money will just help release you into the world to do your work [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2859.54s)]
*  Exactly and and that's really what we're finding even when we look at these folks who receive cash transfers five or seven years later [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2863.22s)]
*  They're still doing better partially because of this. They're more likely to have [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2870.18s)]
*  Invested in certain types of durable assets like livestock that could pay off over time [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2874.98s)]
*  You know even very basic things and you alluded to it like in shops in rural, Kenya [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2880.3399999999997s)]
*  If you're if you're only able to buy small amounts of sugar or small amounts of flour or small amounts of other things [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2886.18s)]
*  Small amounts of other stuff the per unit cost is higher like they're really just our fixed cost to doing things. And so [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2892.58s)]
*  having more liquidity [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2898.58s)]
*  Uh pays off and you know, it just it goes on from there [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2900.42s)]
*  There's also really you know, great work in the field of development economics [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2904.42s)]
*  That's bringing in insights from psychology and this is this really exciting intersection of of you know, behavioral economics and psychology [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2907.54s)]
*  Which shows that even beyond that there's just psychological implications of poverty that make it harder to break out of poverty [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2915.14s)]
*  So, you know people who are [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2920.98s)]
*  Poor [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2923.3s)]
*  Are really worried about their money and they're really worried about their kids going hungry and it can affect decision making [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2924.5s)]
*  And so people who are just super stressed out about money [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2930.98s)]
*  Uh systematically make certain types of errors. They're less productive [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2935.2000000000003s)]
*  So, you know poverty breeds more poverty and again these you know large one-time cash transfers or basic income anything that can just [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2939.46s)]
*  Temporarily lift you out of that state can allow you to make investments that improve your [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2946.02s)]
*  Uh your life and I think that's one of the powerful things about you know, the cash transfer model. It's so simple, right? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2951.3s)]
*  It's like this very pure form of redistribution from folks like you or me who have an extra [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2956.34s)]
*  $100 or thousand dollars here or there [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2961.78s)]
*  That we may not even think about or notice missing and that's just transformative for somebody in a rural african setting [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2964.34s)]
*  There is maybe like a moral aspect on some side of the things [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2971.38s)]
*  That the simplicity of it [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2975.78s)]
*  Gets in the way because people are like well, how do I know? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2977.78s)]
*  We're giving money to deserving people like shouldn't we test that we're giving it to the right people and you know my feeling is [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2981.1400000000003s)]
*  Maybe in the in the ideal world you could target it precisely. But [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2989.54s)]
*  In fact, it's just simpler more effective just give everyone money [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2993.86s)]
*  Yeah, and that's that's really been the model of give directly and several other programs [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=2998.1s)]
*  They do have targeting criteria that are that are pretty rough, you know, so they're they're looking at [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3001.86s)]
*  You know in the early days like in our project looking at the the the building materials in someone's home [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3007.1400000000003s)]
*  And it turns out in our data the people with like rough building materials who have not as nice homes really are poorer than the people [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3012.1800000000003s)]
*  With fancy homes, right? That's true everywhere [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3018.02s)]
*  So they can use something that's really cheap and very visible very easy to observe [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3020.6600000000003s)]
*  uh for targeting and [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3025.54s)]
*  That cuts out a lot of overhead costs because if you really want to go and carefully measure people's living standards [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3028.5s)]
*  It's pretty expensive. We have tools to do it [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3033.38s)]
*  But you may need to go through a two-hour survey to carefully measure their agricultural production and how many assets they own exactly [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3035.14s)]
*  And you still end up with something very highly correlated with like, you know, how rough is the roofing on your house? So [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3043.3s)]
*  um, I i'm a fan of that approach because it just means more of every dollar actually gets to people and [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3048.98s)]
*  Um, you know, there's another aspect of the deserving poor is this question which we often get asked of like well [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3055.78s)]
*  Are people wasting the money? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3060.6600000000003s)]
*  Are they like drinking away the money they get or spending it on gambling or and it's it's impossible to know for sure exactly [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3061.86s)]
*  How everybody spends every dollar but there have been follow-up surveys like in our study and in just dozens of other cash transfer studies at this point [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3067.94s)]
*  That do in careful ways try to get at how much is being spent on what you might call sin goods or temptation goods like alcohol cigarettes [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3075.94s)]
*  and you know [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3083.54s)]
*  Across these studies, you know, very small shares are being spent on those things a little bit like people do buy some alcohol [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3084.74s)]
*  With the money but in our data it's less than one percent. So, you know, it's something that we can live with [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3090.9799999999996s)]
*  And you know the caricature of of poor folks, you know wasting this windfall on [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3096.8199999999997s)]
*  You know booze and cigarettes and drugs or something. I'm sure there's cases where that's true [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3102.4199999999996s)]
*  But it's really not the vast majority of households. You said a provocative thing about uh, not only is poverty [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3107.14s)]
*  Expensive with all these extra costs per unit cost etc, but it also [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3113.7000000000003s)]
*  Drives people towards making worse decisions about things [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3118.26s)]
*  That's very interesting and I i'm glad I learned it [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3123.54s)]
*  But then you've also worked on other things that hurt decision making like the temperature outside like climate change [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3125.78s)]
*  Is making us dumber as well as all sorts of other things to slightly oversimplify [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3133.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's another branch of my research that's that's really not as as grounded in a lot of these field experiments [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3139.24s)]
*  But I have another line of research that's been really exciting to work on on [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3144.7599999999998s)]
*  Climate change and what it's going to do to developing countries, especially in africa [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3149.24s)]
*  And again, it's part of my overall research focus on african development and poverty [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3154.36s)]
*  We cannot ignore climate change if we're going to understand the evolution of of living standards in poor countries over the next 20 30 40 years [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3157.88s)]
*  One of the things we were able to do is some lab experiments and we did lab experiments both in berkeley and in nairobi [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3165.88s)]
*  Kenya seeing how people react to higher temperatures again trying to simulate like okay, you know if they're in a warmer environment [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3172.92s)]
*  We manipulated actually the lab to make some rooms hot and some rooms cold and we randomized that [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3180.44s)]
*  and then we measured how do people's economic decisions change and [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3186.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, it's it's a kind it was a fun thing to work on and actually it took like months to figure out how we could [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3190.7599999999998s)]
*  Regulate the temperature we actually brought some engineers in to like we had to hide the heaters [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3196.04s)]
*  Because we didn't necessarily want everybody to know we were doing this experiment in that way that like had temperature [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3200.68s)]
*  You know sensors all over the room. It was it's an interesting applied engineering problem [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3205.96s)]
*  Sorry, this was at berkeley at the university at berkeley in the experimental lab here and in nairobi [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3209.7999999999997s)]
*  kenya in a lab called the busara lab, which um [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3215.56s)]
*  You know does [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3220.2799999999997s)]
*  experimental and and sort of behavioral economics research [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3222.04s)]
*  There and you know some of the work, you know on both ends is supported [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3225.96s)]
*  You know by my center here center for effective global action, which is kind of a an overall development economic center [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3228.9199999999996s)]
*  So there were a bunch of different partners in this but yeah, we set up these labs somewhere like normal temperature [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3235.3999999999996s)]
*  You know 20 degrees celsius at like 68 fahrenheit and some were hot 30 degrees celsius like 86 87 degrees [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3242.04s)]
*  Fahrenheit's like kind of uncomfortable and then we saw what happened to people's decision making it was pretty interesting like in berkeley [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3249.08s)]
*  Whether you were in the hot room or the cool room like nothing really changed people's [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3255.7999999999997s)]
*  Answers how they solved puzzles math problems [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3260.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh how impatient they were in the lab like folks in berkeley were just kind of chill regardless of the settings [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3265.08s)]
*  It kind of fit the [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3271.64s)]
*  The stereotype but in the nairobi lab we found something pretty interesting [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3273.16s)]
*  There's a bunch of different games that [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3276.44s)]
*  experimental economists have [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3278.7400000000002s)]
*  Developed to try to measure how altruistic people are to others to measure what we call social preferences [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3280.6000000000004s)]
*  Like how nice are you to other people and one of the games they've developed? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3285.96s)]
*  Is a game called the joy of destruction game [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3291.4s)]
*  Which is really it's the game is exactly what you would think when you're in a lab with a bunch of other people you can [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3294.6800000000003s)]
*  Costlessly to yourself [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3300.2s)]
*  Just destroy some of their payoff [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3302.28s)]
*  You don't even get anything out of it. It isn't like oh i'm stealing it from them. There's other games like that [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3304.76s)]
*  This is just called the joy of destruction purely measuring whether I will choose to like destroy other people's [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3310.12s)]
*  payoffs [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3316.2s)]
*  And in general, you know both in berkeley and in the the nairobi lab [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3317.4s)]
*  Most people don't do this. I think actually the berkeley rate back to the the stereotypes of our you know west coast folks like [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3321.48s)]
*  I think of the dozens of studies out there [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3327.64s)]
*  But the rate in berkeley of people destroying other people's payoffs was like the lowest ever observed [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3330.2799999999997s)]
*  It was like only two percent of people did it everybody was just chilling. Hey, you keep your money [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3334.8399999999997s)]
*  I'll keep mine. They would like to destroy their own if they had the chance [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3338.44s)]
*  That would be the caricature [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3342.04s)]
*  But uh in the nairobi lab it was like 15 percent, which is pretty similar to what you see in some european studies some us studies [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3343.64s)]
*  But what was very interesting in the kenyon setting was in the hot room. It went up a lot [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3351.16s)]
*  So in the hot room was like another 50 higher, you know on top of that [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3356.12s)]
*  So there was something about being in this uncomfortable environment where people were kind of agitated [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3359.64s)]
*  Like when we asked them how they felt they didn't feel that good in the hot room, etc [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3365.56s)]
*  that made them kind of anti-social and [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3369.8799999999997s)]
*  It's something this is paper that was recently published [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3373.56s)]
*  I think it's important to do this kind of work try to understand the underlying psychology of heat how it can affect our behavior [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3376.8399999999997s)]
*  how it affects how we [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3382.92s)]
*  treat others [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3384.52s)]
*  Because you know one of the things that's been seen in the overall climate [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3385.96s)]
*  Economics literature and climate literature is a lot of social processes break down at very high temperatures [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3389.4s)]
*  The economy doesn't work as well [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3395.32s)]
*  If you look at an african country in a anomalously hot year versus a normal year in that hot year [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3397.24s)]
*  There's more political instability. It's more likely to have an outbreak of civil conflict [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3403.4s)]
*  So there's a link between extreme temperature and social breakdown and what we were able to do in the lab is start [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3408.68s)]
*  Pinpointing that like, you know, even if i'm just in a hot room for a couple hours that process kind of gets started [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3413.8599999999997s)]
*  in a in a troubling way [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3419.3199999999997s)]
*  is there a [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3421.4s)]
*  Psychological or even neuroscientific theoretical understanding of what's going on here? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3423.14s)]
*  There are claims about it and you know, we we we read through that literature [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3428.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a little bit above our pay grade to fully understand it, but I don't think it's it's fully understood [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3432.04s)]
*  There are you know some changes in neurotransmitters at high temperatures, uh, you know [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3437.64s)]
*  We know there are physiological changes, right? We all experience them at high at high temperatures [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3442.76s)]
*  Um, but I don't think it's very well understood at least that was our take on the literature [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3447.48s)]
*  So I think there's more work to be done. I'd be fascinated about a version of the study done in like [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3450.76s)]
*  Phoenix or el paso where you're in the united states but in a really hot environment or atlanta like the south where it's humid also [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3456.44s)]
*  Is it is it like people are more willing to put up with it in berkeley? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3462.5200000000004s)]
*  Because they almost never experience it. So they're you know, it's not as frustrating for them [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3466.92s)]
*  Yeah, that that question of adaptation I think is really important [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3472.84s)]
*  Um, and yeah, I think it would be it would be a great [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3476.6800000000003s)]
*  Uh, you know extension of the study maybe over time people just get used to it and they deal with it and they have [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3479.96s)]
*  Different ways of dealing with it. Of course, you know, one of the ways people adapt to high temperatures is they avoid it [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3484.6000000000004s)]
*  They like put crank up the ac and yeah, you know, uh and deal with it that way [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3489.7200000000003s)]
*  But uh, I think that you know, that's one of the big open questions in the climate literature in general like, you know [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3494.5200000000004s)]
*  Adaptation writ large is something we need to understand [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3500.58s)]
*  To to understand how an increase of two or three degrees celsius is going to affect us [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3504.92s)]
*  Um, you know, how quickly can we adapt either physiologically or in terms of our institutions? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3509.6400000000003s)]
*  That's a big open question. I think for social scientists studying climate [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3515.7200000000003s)]
*  I guess there there might this might be the result of some stereotype buried in my mind [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3518.92s)]
*  but I if i'm honest, I would have guessed that in in nairobi they would have [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3524.04s)]
*  For the heat better [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3530.6s)]
*  Like aren't they used to it? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3533.4s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's interesting like nairobi was chosen as the capital of kenya because it's in the highlands and it's actually pretty cool. Okay, so [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3535.2400000000002s)]
*  um the the kind of mean temperature [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3542.04s)]
*  In nairobi and berkeley isn't that different and people aren't really used to very high temperature [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3544.92s)]
*  so I think it kind of still fits the story that [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3550.04s)]
*  um [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3553.0s)]
*  You know, they're they're not used to you know, say 90 degree fahrenheit days or you know, 20 degrees celsius days that often [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3553.96s)]
*  Um, it's a little more of a puzzle, you know why it differs so much between berkeley and nairobi and that's something we can only [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3560.76s)]
*  You know hypothesize [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3565.8s)]
*  uh about [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3567.7200000000003s)]
*  um, yeah people were just very chill in berkeley, but there's a kind of wrinkle of that finding in [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3569.32s)]
*  Nairobi that i'll just briefly mention which is we also have data on the ethnicity of our participants and actually we were carrying out [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3575.0s)]
*  This experiment in kenya during a general election season [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3581.7200000000003s)]
*  um, that was very heated politically, um, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3585.6400000000003s)]
*  and um [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3589.08s)]
*  Some ethnic groups were very much aligned with the government which won that election others were aligned with the opposition [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3590.6s)]
*  Which felt very hard done by and kind of felt like the election wasn't being conducted fairly [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3595.6400000000003s)]
*  This response to the high temperature was concentrated among people who belonged to ethnic groups aligned with the opposition actually [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3600.6800000000003s)]
*  So it's actually like kind of a marginalized group [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3608.2000000000003s)]
*  In this stressful high temperature condition that started destroying other people's payouts [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3611.0s)]
*  So it's folks aligned with the kind of pro-government groups the kind of dominant group in kenya didn't respond that much to temperature [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3615.96s)]
*  So there could even be a sub wrinkle to this that like if I have some like underlying latent [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3623.96s)]
*  You know anger or feeling of marginalization then I get triggered [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3630.04s)]
*  By the environmental stressor, uh, so I think that's an even more kind of [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3634.36s)]
*  Complex story, but one that I think resonates with with our intuition about how people respond in society [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3638.04s)]
*  I mean it makes perfect sense to me and is and is yet another example of the [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3643.48s)]
*  Not assuming that people are perfectly rational actors as economists sometimes like to do [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3648.2s)]
*  uh in in the [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3653.16s)]
*  Pandemic when people were locked down there was certainly [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3655.24s)]
*  Anecdotally a fraying of the social fabric and I can imagine that [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3658.8199999999997s)]
*  Being on the losing side of election being in a country that has a lot of poverty and disease [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3663.4s)]
*  Um all these feed in and the causality can be hard to tease out sometimes [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3668.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know for sure and you know, it's been a very big challenge [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3673.08s)]
*  For those of us studying the impacts of climate on [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3678.04s)]
*  On economic outcomes or political outcomes that you know, we can't just compare hot countries to poor countries, right? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3681.24s)]
*  Like they just differ in so many different ways [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3686.84s)]
*  Um people that may adapt in certain ways [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3689.64s)]
*  And the way we've actually dealt with it and just getting into the statistics a little bit because I know the audience is is more sophisticated [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3694.04s)]
*  A lot of the even though we're interested in long-run effects of climate change a lot of the statistical analysis among social scientists [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3702.06s)]
*  Trying to understand the effect of climate has focused on shorter term climatic shocks [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3708.2999999999997s)]
*  Like an anomalously hot year or month or maybe two years [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3713.2599999999998s)]
*  Rather than like a multi-decadal scale analysis because we just haven't had [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3717.42s)]
*  you know the data and the variation over say 40 years like we care about the next 40 years, but [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3721.66s)]
*  Um, you know, we're we're forced statistically to look at shorter term variation [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3726.7s)]
*  And that's where there's kind of a gap between what we estimate from short-term variation and the possibility that maybe over the long run [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3732.62s)]
*  We can adapt adapt to you know, longer term variation [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3738.3799999999997s)]
*  So that's again one of these big open questions in terms of the empirical analysis of climate [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3742.06s)]
*  Among social scientists like me like economists or political scientists [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3746.8599999999997s)]
*  I forget were you part of the research on the parking tickets and corruptions in the united nations? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3750.2999999999997s)]
*  I was that was one of the funnest projects i've i've worked on that was with ray fissman [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3756.54s)]
*  my colleague who's now at um at bu [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3761.42s)]
*  and um [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3764.7799999999997s)]
*  You know that was something that you know, it's just one of those things you get an idea and it's it's a little bit wacky [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3766.94s)]
*  but [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3771.5s)]
*  It turned out it had you know, a lot of uh legs and just to summarize it briefly for for the audience. Sorry [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3772.3799999999997s)]
*  uh, you know we [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3779.1s)]
*  Thought of ways to understand how country [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3782.3799999999997s)]
*  Institutions and country characteristics how persistent they are, you know, this was the case of of corruption [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3786.2s)]
*  um, you know in particular and our insight was [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3792.62s)]
*  You know, maybe we can get insight into the behavior of government officials by looking at them all in the same place [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3796.22s)]
*  How do they behave in the same environment and this was un diplomats in new york. So [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3801.8199999999997s)]
*  um, you know, how often do they abuse their diplomatic immunity to rack up parking tickets and [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3806.3799999999997s)]
*  That's a pretty good [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3812.3799999999997s)]
*  Uh, you know, you could definitely think of that as corruption you're abusing your official position [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3814.22s)]
*  So you don't have to pay something you kind of gain monetarily [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3818.2999999999997s)]
*  You don't have to pay for parking and you can kind of get away with it [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3820.7s)]
*  um, basically, you know do diplomats from some countries abuse their position and others don't and does that correlate with how much [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3823.9s)]
*  Corruption there is in the home country. That was the question we wanted to ask [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3831.5s)]
*  and um [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3835.58s)]
*  it turns out [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3837.58s)]
*  Home country corruption very strongly predicts which diplomats abuse their position in new york city by racking up unpaid parking tickets. So [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3839.2599999999998s)]
*  You know folks from countries with very high corruption indices like nigeria [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3847.4199999999996s)]
*  their diplomats in new york were getting parking tickets all the time and [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3852.46s)]
*  You know diplomats from japan or norway, which have very low corruption indicators [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3856.54s)]
*  basically [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3861.1s)]
*  Almost never rack up an unpaid parking ticket. So [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3862.22s)]
*  Um, that was that was a study that got a lot of attention in the popular media [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3865.5s)]
*  It's because it's a fun thing to to kind of like, you know, imagine diplomats [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3869.1s)]
*  choosing to double park on some narrow street in new york city and [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3873.42s)]
*  Yeah, but it does seem to feed into this, you know [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3877.1s)]
*  Wider thing that culture matters like everything feeds back on everything else [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3879.82s)]
*  I mean it is a it's a fun thing but corruption in a society if that's what you expect to come across [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3884.38s)]
*  Might be kind of friction in the economic gear wheels on a much larger scale [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3891.66s)]
*  Yeah for sure and um [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3897.9s)]
*  Political scientists and economists have written about how persistent corruption is partially because it's a it's a culture. It's self [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3901.18s)]
*  Reinforcing if I expect you to behave a certain way and you expect me to behave a certain way and we all feel that way [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3908.12s)]
*  In society, it's very hard to break out of that [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3913.18s)]
*  Uh that equilibrium [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3915.98s)]
*  Unless something really radical [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3917.98s)]
*  Changes and again, even if you fly diplomats all the way around the world to new york city [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3920.06s)]
*  they kind of keep acting the same way as they did in the [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3923.58s)]
*  You know in the home country, you know, we're often asked in that study, you know, how did the u.s [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3926.86s)]
*  Perform, you know was the you know, how did u.s diplomats diplomats do? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3932.46s)]
*  In terms of racking up unpaid parking tickets in new york city and unfortunately we can't [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3936.78s)]
*  Measure it because u.s diplomats in new york city don't have diplomatic immunity. They're in their home country [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3942.14s)]
*  So we can't observe it and people always wanted to how did the u.s diplomats do how corrupt are we? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3948.3s)]
*  Um, but yeah with that research we can't shed light on that issue [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3953.98s)]
*  Probably. Yeah. Okay. I I don't want to guess this is going to get me in trouble about how corrupt the united states is but um [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3959.02s)]
*  and the other thing that it actually is fed into by this stuff on climate change etc that that you've worked on that is fascinating is [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3965.6600000000003s)]
*  Uh conflicts, you know big large-scale conflicts civil wars and things like that in a country or external wars and how they affect [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3973.5s)]
*  What's going on economically or for that matter? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3981.1s)]
*  How what's going on economically leads to a conflict and especially if the whole world is getting warmer? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3983.9s)]
*  And that slows down our economic engines. Is that going to start? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3990.6200000000003s)]
*  increases in violence in a lot of places [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3994.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, some of my early really my earliest work on on climate was related to exactly that question focusing on african societies [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=3997.18s)]
*  Is it the case that when you have a bad rainfall year or you have an especially warm year? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4004.06s)]
*  We do get uh, you know more risk of civil conflict and we find very strong [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4010.14s)]
*  Relationships there, you know, these anomalously warm years a lot anomalously dry years tend to be associated with [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4016.3599999999997s)]
*  More conflict risk and in a lot of that work we do interpret it through an economic lens [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4021.74s)]
*  So we do know in say a poor african [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4025.58s)]
*  Society that the agricultural sector is a huge part of the economy and when there is a drought [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4028.54s)]
*  incomes fall for a lot of citizens, it's just uh, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4034.7799999999997s)]
*  you know a major economic shock and so [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4037.8199999999997s)]
*  Those climate shocks turn into economic shocks that are destabilizing because when people are poor they have much less to lose [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4041.1s)]
*  They may be more willing to fight, you know fight the government join an insurgency [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4046.94s)]
*  And that comes through very clearly in data over, you know many decades and it's been replicated [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4051.18s)]
*  in a lot of other countries and a lot of other settings it turns out that in years with [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4055.8199999999997s)]
*  Climate shocks of various sorts high temperatures bad rainfall. There's more crime. There's more hindu muslim riots in india [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4060.7799999999997s)]
*  There's more land invasions in brazil. There's just a whole literature that's developed around around those ideas [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4068.62s)]
*  Which is very troubling because you know at this point the world is warming. It's going to continue warming [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4075.58s)]
*  I think even the most optimistic assessments are we're going to warm by a couple degrees celsius in the coming decades [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4081.42s)]
*  And so if we take the existing estimates seriously there could be far more civil conflict risk and crime [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4087.66s)]
*  In the coming decades our best guess from some meta analysis work that we've done [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4094.46s)]
*  Is with the warming we'd expect around the world in the next 30 or 40 years [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4098.78s)]
*  The risk of armed conflict could go up by something like 40 percent [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4103.5s)]
*  Around the world unless we can adapt in some effective way [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4107.58s)]
*  And we already have a lot of violence in this world. So a 40 increase on top of what we have [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4111.42s)]
*  is [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4116.54s)]
*  Is scary [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4117.900000000001s)]
*  Is there I mean since you've been there and and been thinking about it like what are the [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4119.660000000001s)]
*  how much of the challenge of [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4124.700000000001s)]
*  Helping the poor nations of sub-tahoe in africa is a cultural shift kind of thing, you know, I guess [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4127.820000000001s)]
*  let's put it in terms of a [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4135.34s)]
*  Coordination problem like if everyone worked together it could obviously be much better [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4137.08s)]
*  But if when the system isn't either working or established people are going to try to take advantage and that does get in the way [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4141.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know I would say speaking [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4149.72s)]
*  Scientifically, I don't think we have very high quality evidence about [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4153.78s)]
*  The best ways to carry out that kind of cultural shift or shift in in social norms [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4157.8s)]
*  It's a very hard thing to study. We do have some case studies that are interesting. There are [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4162.44s)]
*  You know particular african societies where governments have carried out large-scale reforms that have had social impact [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4167.5599999999995s)]
*  So one that i've worked on and that's gotten quite a bit of attention is [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4173.72s)]
*  The case of tanzania so, you know not a country. Maybe a lot of readers are super familiar with but you know kenya's neighbor in [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4177.88s)]
*  In east africa and right after independence in the 60s and really for the next, you know 15 20 years [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4184.68s)]
*  It was really a concerted effort [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4189.64s)]
*  To build up a tanzanian identity that was very different than most of its neighbors. There was a big emphasis on building up [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4191.88s)]
*  Uh the national language of swahili rather than regional languages or english to to kind of bind people together with an african language [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4198.52s)]
*  There was a big reform of the school curriculum with a very kind of nationalistic focus and pan african focus [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4206.4400000000005s)]
*  Um that was unusual among african countries [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4213.88s)]
*  And there were also attempts to to diminish ethnic divides for instance by abolishing traditional chiefs in the country [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4217.66s)]
*  So a bunch of these reforms were meant to build up a new identity that could kind of bring people together kind of along [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4223.179999999999s)]
*  The lines that you're saying shauna like are there ways we can bridge these gaps and get everybody kind of pulling in the same [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4228.78s)]
*  direction as a country [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4233.66s)]
*  Uh, and really all the the kind of historical evidence and survey evidence [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4235.5s)]
*  Since then points to the fact that it was pretty successful like tanzanians feel very proud of being tanzanian [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4239.58s)]
*  Um ethnic identities have kind of fallen in importance relative to this national identity [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4245.26s)]
*  Um swahili is very widely spoken people are very proud of it as their national language [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4250.94s)]
*  So there are ways that large-scale reforms can transform social identities and social norms in african settings [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4255.26s)]
*  Um, but I think we need to do a lot more work to understand how and how these ideas can be applied, you know in other countries [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4262.62s)]
*  Thank goodness like halfway through I wasn't sure which way that was going to go. I really I was not familiar enough [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4269.0199999999995s)]
*  With the current state and I was I was really worried you were going to say and it all failed dramatically, but uh, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4274.299999999999s)]
*  Apparently there's well we could talk about all the nuances of it [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4280.139999999999s)]
*  But but in many ways there have been positive outcomes another country i'll mention and this is really a country that's seen as a model [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4283.42s)]
*  Economic and political country in africa is botswana, which again some readers may be familiar with but a country with a very visionary leader [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4289.66s)]
*  That promoted a kind of coherent national identity and also this was suretse, comma the [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4297.34s)]
*  Independence leader of botswana, but also really promoted democratic institutions. Yeah, and even today botswana has had just continuous democracy [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4303.1s)]
*  since independence [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4311.42s)]
*  alternation of power in the last election [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4312.780000000001s)]
*  free press [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4315.9800000000005s)]
*  Not that it's you know, not without its its problems and they've also had very good economic performance [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4317.42s)]
*  So we can we can point to particular country cases in sub-saharan africa where the right types of political and social reforms [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4322.14s)]
*  Have really brought people together in a common identity [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4329.34s)]
*  And governments, you know have promoted economic development [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4333.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's not hopeless and that's something that I definitely want readers to take away and it goes back to your first question [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4335.34s)]
*  What does development look like? There are success stories and a lot of the aggregate trends are good [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4339.82s)]
*  And that's something that I really hope you know, the listeners here can can take away from the podcast [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4345.179999999999s)]
*  I do think that maybe i'm being overly optimistic or simplistic but one message i'm getting is that [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4350.94s)]
*  Sometimes the best thing to do is just to throw money at a problem [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4357.639999999999s)]
*  Like if you just flooded certain places with money [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4362.139999999999s)]
*  I guess that people would worry be worried that you know [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4365.66s)]
*  The oligarchs or the monarchs would just take it all and it wouldn't help anything [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4368.86s)]
*  But I don't know i'm kind of getting the message that at least in some cases it would help a lot [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4372.62s)]
*  Just throwing money at the problem [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4378.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think so and I think I would add the caveat that throwing money [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4380.86s)]
*  Um in ways where there's an evidence base to support how to do it [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4385.42s)]
*  So, you know, I would say like just you know indiscriminately transferring foreign aid [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4389.26s)]
*  To governments that are very corrupt that may not yield huge development development impacts [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4394.7s)]
*  But say the give directly approach of literally person to person transfers like literally putting money in the pockets of real people [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4399.179999999999s)]
*  The research literature on that is just overwhelmingly positive at this point. It improves living standards [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4406.62s)]
*  I mentioned how it you know, it saves children's lives. It improves health [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4411.5s)]
*  It has these spillover effects on local businesses and the private sector like that's something that [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4414.3s)]
*  A large body of randomized control trials with good scientific evidence has shown is very effective [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4420.46s)]
*  And that would be something that I would strongly advocate for yes throwing money at the problem in that way could be very [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4425.9s)]
*  Uh, you know very effective [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4431.74s)]
*  And that's why like again some of the cuts in foreign aid in the u.s [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4433.9s)]
*  But not even just the u.s cuts there's big cuts in foreign aid in europe are discouraging because [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4437.34s)]
*  Finally after the last 20 or 30 years, we have a scientific evidence base in development economics. We really know [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4442.3s)]
*  Certain things based on multiple [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4449.18s)]
*  Experimental studies with good measurement have been shown to improve living standards have been shown to improve health [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4451.96s)]
*  We have that evidence base now like now is not the time to be cutting funding [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4457.34s)]
*  Now is the time where we know what to do [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4461.5s)]
*  And it's been very frustrating to see governments in the u.s and the uk and france and and china too china has pulled back a lot [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4464.3s)]
*  From foreign aid in the lat you know since the pandemic and even a little bit before so [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4470.7s)]
*  We're at a moment where we know what to do [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4475.5s)]
*  And the money isn't there and that's something that's been discouraging. I'm hopeful the pendulum will swing swing back [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4477.98s)]
*  I'm hopeful that communicating the scientific evidence will at least mean that private citizens in the u.s and other rich countries [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4483.5s)]
*  will privately give [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4490.78s)]
*  To organizations that are doing [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4492.54s)]
*  Good work. So that's my hope. It's a particular kind of [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4495.42s)]
*  Discouragement when you know what it would what the right thing to do would be [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4500.44s)]
*  And you and you see people choosing not to do it [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4505.58s)]
*  Like there's a different kind of discouragement when you're at a loss, right? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4508.06s)]
*  But but this must be frustrating but okay, we're reaching the end that it is frustrating [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4511.42s)]
*  I wanted to give you a chance just to chime in on a couple of other things that I that I saw [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4516.38s)]
*  Somewhere on the internet that you were interested in but weren't the one the things you've been doing a lot of already [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4521.660000000001s)]
*  One is tax policy [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4527.34s)]
*  And the other is the economics of aging [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4529.34s)]
*  Uh, what is it that is pulling you in these particular directions? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4532.38s)]
*  Yeah, let me let me focus more on the economics of aging because it's something that i'm, you know working on very actively now. So [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4536.06s)]
*  traditionally in development economics [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4543.320000000001s)]
*  We didn't focus much on aging because countries age structures are just very young and so, you know [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4546.2s)]
*  because of disease and and and [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4551.96s)]
*  Basically bad health care combined with high fertility like, you know, the population pyramid was just pointing towards [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4554.36s)]
*  Folks being very young but things are changing and so in a lot of low and middle income countries now from latin america to china [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4560.679999999999s)]
*  Kind of famously people know china's aging very quickly [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4566.36s)]
*  India and now increasingly in sub-saharan africa [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4569.32s)]
*  They're just growing shares of old people in the population [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4572.28s)]
*  and in a lot of [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4576.2s)]
*  Poor societies the institutions and policies really aren't set up to deal with aging populations. They don't have in most countries [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4578.2s)]
*  pensions for old people so very few african countries have an old age pension that [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4585.400000000001s)]
*  Covers more than a few percent of the workers, you know, maybe government employees get a pension, but you know nobody else [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4590.36s)]
*  um healthcare systems aren't set up to deal with the problems that old people have [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4596.4400000000005s)]
*  There isn't sort of long-term care solutions set up for older people [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4601.639999999999s)]
*  and on and on and so [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4606.36s)]
*  A lot of poor countries are reaching this point where they're going to have to start making big policy choices [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4608.28s)]
*  They're going to have to design systems health systems and pension systems [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4612.599999999999s)]
*  And it's kind of an exciting time because they can design them from scratch in many cases and they can learn from the research [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4616.5199999999995s)]
*  on on these issues in the rest of the world and so [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4621.719999999999s)]
*  Part of what we want to do is help translate those lessons [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4625.0s)]
*  So that african countries that are starting to move in this direction towards health insurance and [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4628.5199999999995s)]
*  Elder care and pensions do so with the best evidence base. So i've mainly focused on this in african settings [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4633.16s)]
*  We're starting to collect some new data on middle-aged populations and older populations [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4639.48s)]
*  You know systematic data on their cognition and on their health and what their needs are [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4645.32s)]
*  So I see this as a really exciting new area [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4649.88s)]
*  um that again [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4653.08s)]
*  Is a big problem it's a big policy problem, but this is one where the scientific evidence base is really limited [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4654.84s)]
*  So it's a little bit like when we were tackling cash transfers 10 or 15 years ago [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4660.4400000000005s)]
*  We didn't know much about them [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4664.52s)]
*  I hope in the next 10 or 15 years we can make a lot of progress on these economics of aging issues [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4665.96s)]
*  So governments can make good choices [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4671.0s)]
*  In the coming years [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4674.6s)]
*  It's impossible not to think though [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4675.8s)]
*  when we were talking about topics like corruption and the existence of poverty and an inability to take care of [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4677.8s)]
*  Older citizens that all of these are right here in our country very very strongly and not obviously getting better [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4684.76s)]
*  not not to pull it back to the discouraging side of things, but [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4691.64s)]
*  We will have to take some lessons ourselves. I guess [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4695.64s)]
*  I agree with that and I think [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4698.92s)]
*  You know for those of us that study low and middle income countries [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4700.84s)]
*  We've always looked to the u.s [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4703.72s)]
*  And canada and the uk and you know japan and rich countries as models and and rightfully so right the u.s [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4705.4800000000005s)]
*  Is the richest most prosperous society in the history of human civilization. We shouldn't forget that like we've done a lot of things [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4711.32s)]
*  Really really well [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4717.5599999999995s)]
*  And so we you know, there's a lot other countries can learn but [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4719.24s)]
*  My fear right now is it feels like we're kind of unlearning some of our own lessons [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4722.28s)]
*  Like there's a lot of things that have powered our prosperity [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4725.88s)]
*  Big social investments in old folks are are being threatened politically [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4729.8s)]
*  Obviously big investments in scientific research. I mean that and health care and nih and nsf and [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4735.0s)]
*  The last few months have seen just, you know slashing of budgets there [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4741.5599999999995s)]
*  But we wouldn't know how to design policies and we wouldn't know how to you know, carry out [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4746.76s)]
*  Social programs or health programs or public health programs if we didn't have the evidence base [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4751.48s)]
*  So, you know again, i'm hoping the pendulum will swing back [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4755.24s)]
*  I'm hoping that we can convince folks who who are skeptical about scientific research and health spending [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4758.04s)]
*  I hope we can find a way to convince them [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4764.599999999999s)]
*  And show them the benefits of all these investments they really are investments so that we don't [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4767.8s)]
*  Become poorer and less healthy, I think it really comes down to that like we wouldn't have [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4775.72s)]
*  Uh the life expectancy we do we wouldn't have the prosperity we do we wouldn't have our iphones. We wouldn't have [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4781.08s)]
*  airplanes, whatever if we hadn't been investing in [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4786.36s)]
*  in scientific research for generations now and and and the i'm so proud that the u.s [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4789.56s)]
*  Since world war two has been the focal point for global science and [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4793.72s)]
*  You know, hopefully we don't we don't lose that [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4798.360000000001s)]
*  I don't think that quite counts as an optimistic place to end [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4801.16s)]
*  But we can at least aspire to the pendulums swinging back. I think that's a good thing to cross our fingers for so [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4803.64s)]
*  Ted mcgill, thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast. Thanks. It's really fun to talk to you. Thanks [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4809.240000000001s)]
*  You [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTfg565Sk&t=4823.72s)]
