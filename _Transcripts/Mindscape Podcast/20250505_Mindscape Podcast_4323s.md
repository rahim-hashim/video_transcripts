Medical science is advancing at an astonishing rate. Today we talk with leading expert Eric Topol about two aspects of this story. First, the use of artificial intelligence in medicine, especially in diagnostics. This is an area that is a perfect match between an important question and the capabilities of machine learning, to the point where AI can out-perform human doctors. And second, our understanding of aging and what to do about it. Eric even gives some actionable advice on how to live more healthily into our golden years.

Eric Topol received and M.D. from the University of Rochester. He is currently the Gary and Mary West Chair of Innovative Medicine in the Department of Translational Medicine at Scripps Research. He is also the Founder, Scripps Research Translational Institute, and Senior Consultant, Scripps Clinic, Division of Cardiovascular Diseases. Among his awards are the Hutchinson Medal from the University of Rochester and membership in the National Academy of Sciences. His books include Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again, and Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity.

# Mindscape 313 | Eric Topol on the Changing Face of Medicine and Aging
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. A couple years ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=0.0s)]
*  2023, I did a holiday message entitled Reflections on Immortality. This was in response, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4.96s)]
*  or at least inspired by a workshop we had at the Santa Fe Institute on immortality, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=12.24s)]
*  what would mean, how you might get there. And I mentioned there that a lot of the people at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=17.36s)]
*  the workshop basically said they don't want immortality. Like that's too much. Either [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=21.72s)]
*  personally they couldn't imagine what to do for all that time, or socially they think that society [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=26.799999999999997s)]
*  would stagnate if people just live forever rather than being replaced. That's fine. You can argue [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  whether or not you'd want to live forever or not. Most people though would want to live a little [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=38.36s)]
*  longer, at least, than they probably will live. We're very interested in longevity and aging, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  not only living but living in healthier ways. I just now, for this intro, looked up the graph [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=50.199999999999996s)]
*  of life expectancy in the United States for the last 100, 150 years or so. And it's been going up, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  that's the good news. It went down once in this particular graph shows five-year bins, right? So [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=64.16s)]
*  only once in the 20th century did the life expectancy decrease from one five-year bin to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=73.92s)]
*  another between 1915 and 1920. I'm not exactly sure why that was. The Spanish flu maybe? Until [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=79.92s)]
*  2015 to 2020 it also decreased. It only decreased a little amount. In 1920 it was 53 years old, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=87.88s)]
*  the life expectancy from birth in the US. In 2020 it was 78.8. So it's gone up quite a bit. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=96.92s)]
*  That's impressive. But in 2015 it was 78.9. It was a little bit bigger. And we can talk about why [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=103.52s)]
*  that's true, the healthcare system, nutrition, whatever. That is the kind of thing we're going [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=109.8s)]
*  to talk about on today's podcast. Eric Topol is a leading medical researcher. Cardiovascular system [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=114.88s)]
*  is his specialty, but he's a broad thinker who's done a lot of work and has been thinking for a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=122.28s)]
*  while now about medicine in a very broad way and been writing books about it. We will actually [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=127.76s)]
*  take a little bit more than a little bit of a detour to talk about his previous book, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=133.44s)]
*  which was called Deep Medicine, How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again. He [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=138.36s)]
*  has this fascinating point of view that not only can AI be super duper useful in recognizing, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  diagnosing some medical conditions that human beings are not very good at, but in fact it can [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=150.56s)]
*  be better than human beings in some very, very important ways. We think about how to make an [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=157.84s)]
*  ideal system where there'd be both humans and AI there, but one of the steps there is making the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=164.2s)]
*  humans understand that the AI can actually be pretty good at some things. It's not about AGI or [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=169.84s)]
*  super intelligence. It's about pattern recognition, which is what AIs are very good at. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=175.84s)]
*  But mostly in today's podcast, we're going to talk about Eric's new book called Super Agers, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=179.6s)]
*  An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity. Here we're not talking about modifying the human genome to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=185.6s)]
*  live for centuries or anything like that. We're just talking about living a healthier life and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=192.46s)]
*  preventing disease in ways that are very plausible, very down to earth, very tangible, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=196.56s)]
*  and can actually add several years, maybe decade, to an ordinary human healthy life expectancy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=201.84s)]
*  This is something which most people would sign up for if they had that option. It's a combination [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=210.24s)]
*  of understanding the diseases that tend to end our lives at some point. In particular, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=216.12s)]
*  the fascinating thing that we learn is that many different sounding diseases are all related to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=223.12s)]
*  the immune system and inflammation, which might be promising for treating or preventing them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=228.44000000000003s)]
*  Then of course, the other thing is that things that we individually can do, things that have to do [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=235.08s)]
*  with diet and exercise, as you might expect, but also mental health, mental acuity, social activity, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=239.4s)]
*  these all turn out to be really, really important for not only living a long time, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=246.52s)]
*  but living a long time in a healthy way. Maybe this is a podcast which, unlike many Mindscape [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=251.24s)]
*  episodes, has a really tangible effect on how people live their lives. I hope it does, so let's go. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=257.56s)]
*  Eric Topol, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  Great to be with you, Sean. Thank you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  We're going to talk about a lot of things with medicine, aging, AI, things like that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=285.8s)]
*  One thing, there's a little news item that struck me and I thought I don't want to forget asking you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=290.36s)]
*  about it while I have you here, which is, as a person of a certain age, I recently got the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=296.04s)]
*  shingles vaccine. Now I'm told that this might even have a positive effect on preventing dementia [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=301.16s)]
*  in the future. That doesn't seem what it's there for. Is this something that is completely weird [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=308.12s)]
*  and surprising or true and understandable? Well, it's a mixture of your questions about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=312.52s)]
*  surprising and understandable. It's really fascinating because there are these two so-called [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=319.4s)]
*  natural experiments whereby huge numbers of people got the vaccine just because of a policy change [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=326.36s)]
*  or a date change. It's like a randomized trial. In fact, it's even better because there's no [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=335.88s)]
*  selection criteria. Whether it was comparing the new Shingrix vaccine versus the old live attenuated [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=340.68s)]
*  virus vaccine called Zostavax or the old vaccine versus no vaccine, everything pointed to this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  about 20% reduction of dementia. This is fascinating because while other studies had suggested this, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=356.68s)]
*  they weren't this ideal natural experiment. It does look like there's a twofer. It helped me [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=366.12s)]
*  decide to get the shingles vaccine because I don't do well with these vaccines in terms of acute [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=372.76s)]
*  reactions. It's unpleasant. I was lucky because of all things, this vaccine didn't knock me out [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=378.68s)]
*  like some others do. I think for people over 50 in the US, it's wise to get this because there [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=385.08s)]
*  really appears to be an added bonus. It doesn't mean for sure that the virus, herpes zoster, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=394.04s)]
*  causes Alzheimer's, but it could be that just revving up your immune system with this vaccine [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  helps. It isn't unequivocal proof that there's a root cause of a virus for Alzheimer's or dementia, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=408.20000000000005s)]
*  but it does certainly suggest the immune system plays a role. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=416.12s)]
*  We're still pretty unsure what the root causes are for dementia for Alzheimer's. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=420.52s)]
*  Yes. The theory of a virus like for multiple sclerosis, Epstein-Barr virus, which is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=425.4s)]
*  unequivocal, it's very soft here. We don't have anything like the multiple sclerosis story, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  but there's still people who believe the virus plays an important role and perhaps in a subset [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=438.6s)]
*  of people and even other viruses besides the herpes zoster varicella virus may be invoked. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=443.8s)]
*  So there's still work to be done on that one. There usually is, especially in medicine. It's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=451.48s)]
*  very hard. Thank you for indulging me with that. Now we can get on to the work you've done, the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=457.0s)]
*  books, et cetera. Part two of the podcast is going to be about your most recent book on aging, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=462.76s)]
*  which is something everyone cares about. Previously you talked a lot about the potential [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=469.72s)]
*  impact that AI can have on medicine. I think this is perfect for this podcast because [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=475.72s)]
*  I love the idea of AI. I'm very skeptical about some overblown claims about artificial general [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=483.24s)]
*  intelligence, but here is an actual use case where you don't need to worry that the AI is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=489.08000000000004s)]
*  conscious or intelligent or anything. You can just use it. So why don't you give us the big [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=493.56s)]
*  picture overview of why AI might be helpful in medicine? Yeah, I mean, in some ways it's stunning, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=498.2s)]
*  Aishan. I mean, we're going to get into some of the concerns, of course, but some of the things [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=506.44s)]
*  that AI is bringing to us, we couldn't even have conceived, frankly. So perhaps the one that is [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=511.71999999999997s)]
*  just kind of knocks you out in terms of wow factor is this so-called machine or digital eyes, the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=519.72s)]
*  vision that AI has, which is so it makes our vision as physicians, experts in certain domains [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=526.84s)]
*  look weak. Okay, because it turns out that the accuracy once you train an AI to see things, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=535.96s)]
*  if you will, is so much better, not just for the things that you're supposed to be looking at, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=546.84s)]
*  but for finding things that you can't even see. So for example, the retina is a perfect example [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=552.12s)]
*  because it turns out even ophthalmologists, the retina specialists, they can't see things that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=559.88s)]
*  the AI can. So not just about retina disease, but about every system in our body, essentially. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=567.16s)]
*  Not just the brain, but about risk for heart attacks and strokes and kidney disease and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=573.88s)]
*  liver disease. I mean, the list goes on and on. So the point being is that there's this opportunistic [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=579.72s)]
*  aspect because the supervision of AI is just extraordinary. And so that is something that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=586.2s)]
*  I think we're just starting to get in touch with. No one had anticipated the richness of ability to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=594.44s)]
*  interpret medical images, which is a big part of practice of medicine. But then we're also seeing [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=602.2s)]
*  some things that also are surprising. That is, one of the most important parts of medicine is [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=608.04s)]
*  making the diagnosis. There were things that were listed as the three most important things, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=614.68s)]
*  diagnosis, diagnosis, diagnosis. It turns out we have 12 million serious diagnostic errors [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=621.7199999999999s)]
*  a year in the United States. We see 800,000 Americans either disabled or dead from these [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  serious diagnostic errors. So it's hard to make things worse. Well, it turns out, you know, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=639.1600000000001s)]
*  even though the medical community doesn't like to fess up to these problem of errors, these errors, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=644.9200000000001s)]
*  the AI is making a big difference because it is so good at coming up with a differential diagnosis [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=650.84s)]
*  from a person's data, much better than we expected. So the chance of it being as good as [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=657.24s)]
*  one of the experts for coming up with the diagnosis, like we see with the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=664.28s)]
*  storied case presentations at the New England Journal of Medicine sort of thing, it's amazing. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=670.12s)]
*  So this is another way to accuracy, not just medical images, but also for helping making [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=676.04s)]
*  the diagnosis through what's really fascinating now, Sean, is this, we're not just seeing large [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=682.44s)]
*  language models, we're seeing large reasoning models. And so this is really helping that [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=689.0s)]
*  reasoning and following the chain of thoughts. So you can just say, how did you get there? How did [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=694.2s)]
*  you come up with these diagnoses and get the details of how the AI is thinking, if you will? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=699.32s)]
*  Now, the other thing that I think we wouldn't have expected, and again, some of these are really [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=706.2s)]
*  outgross of the transformer architecture of AI. But now when you go with a patient in a clinic [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=711.96s)]
*  visit, or even at the bedside, that interaction can not only be transcribed, that's nothing. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=719.32s)]
*  But what it can do is do all the downstream tasks. So it would do, like if you need prescriptions, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=727.0s)]
*  follow up appointments, procedures, labs, setting up follow up appointments for [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=734.12s)]
*  and nudges for things that were discussed during the interaction. Like did you check your blood [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=743.8s)]
*  pressure? What are the values? Can you get it back to the doctor? And even pre-authorization to deal [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=748.68s)]
*  with the darn insurance companies. So what we're seeing is average for those who are adopting these [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=753.8s)]
*  two to three hours less data clerk work for doctors. And then the other thing that's, I think, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=760.36s)]
*  very refreshing is to see the patients getting empowered to make their own diagnoses through [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=767.24s)]
*  these tools. So whether that's for heart rhythm or skin lesion or ear infections in a child or [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=773.4s)]
*  urinary tract infection. So all around, they're seeing effects and they're just real starting [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=781.32s)]
*  to take hold. I love the example that you already mentioned it briefly, but I saw you give it in a [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=787.0s)]
*  talk and it really stuck with me of this retinal scan. So you're literally looking at a picture [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=792.6s)]
*  of someone's retina and you ask human doctors, okay, is this a man or a woman? And they have no [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=797.48s)]
*  idea. It's 50-50. They're just guessing. And the AI gets it right 99% of the time. Yeah, yeah, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=804.52s)]
*  it's amazing. And we still don't really know why the AI is so good. But that is perhaps the best [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=809.88s)]
*  single example of the gap between human eye discrimination and what an AI when it's seen [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=816.52s)]
*  train with hundreds of thousands of images. It's actually pretty mind boggling to me. And [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=826.92s)]
*  I've known about it for years and there's just now so many other examples, whether it's a cardiogram [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=833.64s)]
*  or a path slide and X-ray. I mean, who would have thought you could diagnose diabetes from [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=838.76s)]
*  a chest X-ray? I mean, these are crazy things. So it's wild. But it kind of makes sense because [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=846.12s)]
*  you're kind of using the AI for what it seems like it should be good at. It's pattern recognition, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=853.96s)]
*  right? And it's looking for differences and human beings are okay at that, but they're not perfect. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=859.08s)]
*  But you're not trying to shoehorn the AI into something that being something that is not. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=864.6s)]
*  That's right. I mean, and what's really interesting is that capability was just an [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=870.04s)]
*  outgrowth of deep learning without the extra turbocharged capability of the newer models. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=874.28s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, just think of where we're going to go with the models that continue to get [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=883.0799999999999s)]
*  refined and improved on a weekly basis. It's just crazy right now. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=888.1999999999999s)]
*  And it's a reminder, I guess, probably as a medical doctor, you don't need to be reminded of this, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=892.8399999999999s)]
*  but the human body is very interrelated. I mean, the fact that there is some subtle difference, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=898.8399999999999s)]
*  even if human beings don't know what it is between a male retina and a female retina, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=903.64s)]
*  maybe makes sense if you tell it to me, but I wouldn't have been surprised if it hadn't been [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=908.84s)]
*  there. But yeah, the body is all the different parts are talking to each other all the time. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=912.6s)]
*  That's right. Absolutely. And this is something where, again, AI, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=917.56s)]
*  is the AI able to tell us why it thinks that a certain retinal skin is man or woman? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=923.0s)]
*  Well, this explainable AI is kind of an overarching goal. And sometimes we do get a pretty good [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=930.4399999999999s)]
*  explanation. But in the case of the retina, it's still elusive. There's these things called saliency [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=938.76s)]
*  maps and masking and all these techniques that you can use to try to kind of reverse engineer, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=946.5999999999999s)]
*  what is this neural network doing? But it hasn't been as good an explanation yet provided for the [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=953.48s)]
*  retina as it has for many other capabilities that were not anticipated. OK, perfectly fair. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=963.16s)]
*  I guess on the flip side, there are many people who worry that their medical care is going to be [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=968.84s)]
*  handed over to computers rather than human beings. And I suppose ideally it should be both, right? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=974.52s)]
*  There should be both in the loop and there should be interactions. But like you said, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=980.2s)]
*  with the paperwork, at least in principle, the existence of AI could give us more interactions [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=983.96s)]
*  with human beings. That's right. And there was something other another thing that caught us by [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=990.44s)]
*  a big surprise recently. And my colleague Pranav Rajpurkar and I wrote an op-ed in the New York [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=995.8000000000001s)]
*  Times about it. Six studies, now there's seven, where the AI was compared to a doctor with AI [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1003.16s)]
*  for various tasks, whether it's a diagnosis or images. And the AI was better than the doctor [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1013.8s)]
*  with the AI. OK, we would not have expected that. OK, everyone, including us, all anticipated that [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1021.88s)]
*  the AI and the doctor is the best winning combination. Now, what is the reason for this? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1029.56s)]
*  Well, it could be because the AI right now isn't in high regard for doctors. And so they don't [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1036.44s)]
*  really take it seriously. Or they could just have a bias against it or they're not grounded yet on [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1042.04s)]
*  how to use it. But it's a little concerning that the AI could have this superior performance [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1049.56s)]
*  in various medical tasks, important tasks. We're going to have to see how this plays out. But [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1055.24s)]
*  one thing for sure is I think it's going to be imperative that all physicians learn the nuances [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1061.32s)]
*  of AI not to immediately reject it, but to actually consider embracing it because it can help. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1067.64s)]
*  But when AI beats out the doctors, that's a flag right there. Yeah. Right. OK, good. That is [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1074.1200000000001s)]
*  absolutely food for thought. But I would imagine that in some circumstances, like looking for [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1079.64s)]
*  polyps or nodules in some scan, if the AI could say, look here, it looks like there's something [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1085.24s)]
*  like that, that just sounds unambiguously helpful to the doctor. Yeah. The biggest study yet, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1092.4399999999998s)]
*  you touched on one, which is the second biggest, which is colonoscopy cumulatively. But the biggest [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1099.0s)]
*  single study over 100,000 women in Sweden had either the doctors, radiologists with AI [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1104.28s)]
*  interpret the mammograms or doctors without the AI, randomized. And what was amazing, of course, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1113.32s)]
*  is that there was this 20 some percent better detection of important cancers with the doctors [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1120.36s)]
*  who had the AI. So you would say now, in addition to other studies, that why are we doing mammograms [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1127.24s)]
*  in women without AI? Because now that's missing, you know, one out of five. That's a lot of [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1134.84s)]
*  potential cancers. And we've known for years that mammography has lots of inaccuracies with false [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1143.9599999999998s)]
*  positives and false negatives. So, you know, there we're seeing that should probably be universally [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1149.32s)]
*  adopted. The problem in the United States is that the company, the big radiology company that's got [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1156.52s)]
*  scans all over the country, they're charging the women extra if they want to have the AI reading [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1163.0s)]
*  thirty five dollars or something like that. That's crazy. That should be part of a normal. And [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1168.6s)]
*  someday, I guess it will. But we're in a transition zone right now. We are. Are the AIs that are being [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1173.8s)]
*  used or like off the shelf GPT kind of things? Or do you need like a specially tuned medical AI? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1179.32s)]
*  Yeah, these are commercially available software packages, you know, that have been FDA approved [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1186.3600000000001s)]
*  now. The ones that are here in the US, particularly one that Radnet uses is different than the one [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1194.1200000000001s)]
*  that was in the randomized trial in Sweden, but they're pretty similar. The point being is they [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1200.0400000000002s)]
*  good ones have all validated this 20 percent improvement of making the diagnosis. And so for [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1206.8400000000001s)]
*  polyps, it's similar to the gastroenterologists miss lots of polyps, you know, like about 20 percent. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1214.28s)]
*  So the fact that AI can give us a boost of accuracy, who wants to go through a colonoscopy [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1221.32s)]
*  and have a tired gastroenterologist who's been working all day doing this stuff? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1228.12s)]
*  Particularly that's when it happens is later in the day, human eyes start to lose some of their [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1232.6s)]
*  and, you know, who wants to go through all that and have a missed important polyp? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1238.52s)]
*  I got that from your talk that you should always have your colonoscopy in the morning. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1243.72s)]
*  The doctors are fresher. I would. Plus it avoids you having a fast, you know, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1247.1599999999999s)]
*  gone through everything another day. So, yeah. And maybe other than diagnostics, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1253.1599999999999s)]
*  are there other promising uses of AI? Yeah, I mean, I think it's across the board. I mean, it's just, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1258.52s)]
*  you name it, there's like, you know, for years as a cardiologist, we had the electrocardiogram had [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1265.0s)]
*  an over read or what do you call it, under read by the machine. And it was stupid. The readings were [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1273.6399999999999s)]
*  terrible. The error rate was really high. Well, now, not only is the error rate really impressive, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1280.76s)]
*  it low, impressively low, but also what we're seeing is, is making diagnoses that were [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1287.08s)]
*  were the cardiologist might not have come up with accurately. So, for example, you can say, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1293.72s)]
*  there's a low ejection fraction and say what, and in fact, Mayo Clinic has already made that [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1301.32s)]
*  routine for all of their ECG AI interpretation, but also things like there's a risk of developing [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1306.12s)]
*  atrial fibrillation, even though there's no atrial fibrillation in this person. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1314.36s)]
*  Okay. There's a risk of stroke or this or that, kind of like the retina. So, not only have we got [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1318.92s)]
*  rid of the error rate, that was kind of a major deal, but we're getting all this opportunistic [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1326.6000000000001s)]
*  readings that we never had before. Just a pretty, again, you know, I just don't see, don't expect [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1332.04s)]
*  this kind of thing. And it's just happening. And how prevalent is it right now for these kinds of [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1341.64s)]
*  things? Is it yet to ask special and pay or is it already there? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1347.32s)]
*  The ECG is not anywhere else that I know of yet, except for Mayo Clinic. I hope it will be [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1351.16s)]
*  universally used because it's a sense, Sean, that we're just leaving all this stuff on the table, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1356.68s)]
*  you know, that all these extra bonus interpretations that could be useful for a patient, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1363.48s)]
*  this should be of no charge. It's there. You know, it's in the data. We need the AI to extract it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1371.24s)]
*  Well, tell me, as someone who's been around for a while, do you get the feeling that [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1379.4s)]
*  practicing clinical doctors are open to these kinds of changes in general? Are they looking [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1383.6399999999999s)]
*  to be on the cutting edge or is it that they have a way that works and are kind of happy with that? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1389.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, the older ones like me are usually not too receptive. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1393.56s)]
*  Younger digital docs, you know, they kind of grew up in this environment. They're apt to be a little [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1399.72s)]
*  more willing. But overall, there's not an embracement eager to adopt AI. And it's because [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1406.04s)]
*  of the other concerns like the, what is this going to do with errors, hallucinations and privacy [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1415.56s)]
*  and security and biases, which we know exist? You know, there's many things that are deterrent, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1421.4s)]
*  perhaps the one that I think that doesn't get enough emphasis, is you really have to have [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1428.92s)]
*  compelling data to get the medical community to move. And the only compelling data we have [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1434.6000000000001s)]
*  that move really compelling is what we're seeing with the mammography, colonoscopy, perhaps, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1440.68s)]
*  certain things where it's just unequivocal benefit. But a lot of things that we're seeing [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1448.12s)]
*  evidence of, they're still looking for the proof points that are just so clear cut that it would be [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1455.24s)]
*  considered below the standard of care, which is kind of a bit nebulous term, but it's changed when [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1461.96s)]
*  the needle is moved, when the stuff, the data evidence is just overpowering. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1469.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, it does seem to me like having better diagnoses of cancer or heart disease would help [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1475.72s)]
*  me live longer, which provides a natural segue into our next big topic, which is your new book [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1481.64s)]
*  on aging. And again, let me just start at the very highest level. Aging and especially extending [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1487.88s)]
*  human lifespans. This is a topic that gets a lot of talk. A lot of the talk is maybe not reliable. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1494.76s)]
*  How do you feel waiting into this area? Yeah, I felt, Sean, I had to wait in because the [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1501.56s)]
*  pseudoscience and the false claims are totally out of control. And basically it's kind of predatory, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1507.8799999999999s)]
*  all these anti-aging supplements and stem cell clinics and peptides. I mean, you name it, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1516.12s)]
*  it's just so much malarkey, so much hype of false. You could say some of this is fraudulent. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1523.4s)]
*  It's a shame. And it basically is playing into the interest that people not just want to live [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1533.5600000000002s)]
*  longer, but live longer, healthier health span. And that's why I decided it was time for me to [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1540.6000000000001s)]
*  go deep on this and write a book, which is Superagers, which is trying to set the record [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1547.16s)]
*  straight to really put the excitement in context. And it isn't about reversing aging amazingly. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1552.04s)]
*  It's about extending health span to quash age-related diseases. So basically what this [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1560.76s)]
*  is doing is taking the science of aging, which is formidable, big advances, and using that, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1568.76s)]
*  not to come up with some magical potion, which doesn't exist for people, but rather to use those [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1575.88s)]
*  advances so that we can take the big three, heart, cancer, and neurodegenerative, mainly Alzheimer's, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1583.5600000000002s)]
*  how we can apply these advances in science of aging to prevent these three major killers and [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1594.1200000000001s)]
*  major causes of losing one's health span. And just to be super clear, on the podcast, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1601.4s)]
*  sometimes we talk about very science fiction-y topics. So your focus is not on genetically [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1607.5600000000002s)]
*  engineering human beings so they live for 10,000 years. You're really thinking about how we can [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1612.92s)]
*  just live a few more years in a more healthy way. Yeah. I mean, as I go through in the book, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1617.72s)]
*  if you were to really work on this, you could eke out seven, perhaps even 10 years of health span. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1625.0s)]
*  Health span meaning freedom from these three major diseases, age-related diseases. So yeah, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1631.48s)]
*  that's exciting to me. We're not talking about a few weeks or months. We're talking about years. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1638.68s)]
*  And the fact is that we don't need a magic potion to do this. As we'll get into, we need lots of [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1644.1200000000001s)]
*  data on a person and we need AI. And we need to use the advances, which are basically these clocks, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1650.92s)]
*  molecular clocks. That's perhaps the biggest thing that's a shakeup in medicine that people [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1658.1200000000001s)]
*  don't realize right now. Biomarkers and clocks. And that's what's given us this newfound potential. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1665.08s)]
*  Well, let's get into that right away. I mean, where does human lifespan come from? It seems [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1671.48s)]
*  clear from even the most obvious data that people tend to live a certain amount. And if they don't [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1678.04s)]
*  have something terrible happen to them, then they're going to die. It's not an exponential [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1683.4s)]
*  fall off, right? It's not like the same number fraction of people die every day. Our biology [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1687.8000000000002s)]
*  gives out after a point. Probably we can guess at evolutionary explanations for that, but maybe give [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  us a clue as to what's going on. Well, everybody used to think it was the genes. And that was [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1698.68s)]
*  deterministic. And that turns out to be completely wrong. While it may be an issue in a very limited [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1704.1200000000001s)]
*  number of people, it's not really about our genes. And so a lot of this is, it turns out, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1710.6s)]
*  it's a multi-dimensional complex story about why we don't just have this what's called compression [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1721.8s)]
*  of morbidity, where you live perfectly healthy and then you just fall off a cliff. It doesn't work [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1730.9199999999998s)]
*  that way. The way it works is, at some point, you're going to start to see some frailty, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1737.56s)]
*  some decline in capabilities, whether it's cognitive or other. And so the point being is, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1744.6799999999998s)]
*  how can we extend that intactness, lack of this compromise or frailty? And so what is the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1752.2s)]
*  determinant of that? Well, we studied 1,400 people who we call the welderly. And they had been over [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1761.64s)]
*  85 and never been sick. They had none of these diseases. And what was interesting, we sequenced [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1769.0800000000002s)]
*  all their genomes, whole genomes. We found almost nothing from that. That is, the genes were some [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1775.64s)]
*  of the story. And the protagonist patient of mine in the book, Mrs. LR, she's 98. And she has [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1783.32s)]
*  never been sick. I mean, I saw her for a trivial thing as a patient. But what's fascinating is, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1793.3999999999999s)]
*  all her relatives, her brothers and sisters, her parents, they all died in their 60s, 50s. She's [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1800.12s)]
*  98. OK, so that's basically the story. It's not the gene. So like for me, I have terrible family [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1807.48s)]
*  history. But as the more I've learned about this, the less worried I've been about it. Most of us [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1814.3600000000001s)]
*  have this overhang throughout our lives. Oh, my father had this, my mother had that, whatever. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1820.52s)]
*  We don't need to succumb to those thoughts because there's so much we can do now to find out our [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1826.28s)]
*  risk, individual, at the individual level. And that's what's a sharp contrast to the way we used [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1833.48s)]
*  to think about this in the past. So specifically in this study, you had these people who were [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1840.04s)]
*  living long and they were healthy. And I presume that you were hoping to see, oh, they all share [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1845.56s)]
*  this gene, or at least many of them do. But in fact, essentially no connection whatsoever. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1851.24s)]
*  Just about no connection. I mean, certainly nothing that had a lot of weight. So we were [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1856.76s)]
*  surprised. We were very disappointed at the time. But now in context, it's starting to come together [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1863.56s)]
*  that we have to have a rethink about the gene's story because it just doesn't really click. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1870.3600000000001s)]
*  There may be something to it if you're over 110. There's not too many people like that. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1878.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're called super centenarians. But there's so few of those. And even that's [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1884.84s)]
*  questionable. But is there something to the idea that once we're past our reproductive age, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1890.84s)]
*  evolution is done with us and it sort of lets us decay? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1896.76s)]
*  Yeah, we're in steady decay mode, sadly. So what happens is, for these three diseases in particular, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1900.84s)]
*  it takes 20 years for them to take hold, incubate, if you will. So you don't have a heart attack [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1909.48s)]
*  without having your arteries getting clogged up with acylsclerosis for two decades or more. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1915.96s)]
*  Cancer, you don't just all of a sudden show up with pancreatic cancer. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1922.04s)]
*  This has been developing over more than two decades. These clones and their ability to [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1926.36s)]
*  eventually proliferate and spread throughout the body. And the same thing is for Alzheimer's. We [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1933.16s)]
*  now know it's 20, 30 years you could predict ahead of time, if that is going to be a risk. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1938.12s)]
*  So these processes of our deterioration, the good thing is, they're really slow. It gives us a great [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1943.6399999999999s)]
*  opportunity to get ahead of them. Imagine if they took place over months or a year, and then of [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1951.4799999999998s)]
*  course, we wouldn't have that anticipatory runway to work with. So we're really lucky in that respect. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1957.9599999999998s)]
*  And it's that combination of these long lag time periods and the tools that we have today that's [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1964.36s)]
*  making this exciting opportunity going forward. So you mentioned the big three. Let's dig into [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1970.28s)]
*  them a little bit more. Probably if you ask people on the street, what are the three big diseases that [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1976.6s)]
*  will end your life, they probably would have come pretty close to saying like cancer, heart disease, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1982.36s)]
*  brain diseases. Are they related? Are they all completely different causes? What do we know [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1986.68s)]
*  about why these things start kicking in at a certain age? Great question. There is a common [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1992.76s)]
*  thread besides the fact that they each take 20 plus years. And that thread is the immune system [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=1998.2s)]
*  and inflammation. So our immune cells can secrete all these cytokines, chemokines that are [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2004.84s)]
*  inflammatory mediators. And so what's the problem with the three diseases is that they all have [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2012.84s)]
*  a marked untoward inflammation. So inflammation in our artery wall or in our brain or the immune [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2021.16s)]
*  system not responding to the appearance of a tumor cell or tumor clone. So our immune system [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2030.84s)]
*  is the real problem for the three diseases. And that's one of the big deficiencies we have right [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2041.72s)]
*  now. We don't have a way like you can go to the lab and get a blood count kind of thing. You can't [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2049.08s)]
*  get an essay to tell you what is the status of your immune system. And we really desperately need [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2055.4s)]
*  that. That's like the next frontier. And people say the brain is really complex. Well, I got to [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2062.6s)]
*  tell you the immune system is right up there. It's very, you know, I have a whole chapter about that [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2067.88s)]
*  in the book. And what's exciting, of course, there is we're learning about how to rev it up and tone [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2073.08s)]
*  it down, suppress it like never before. So if we can start to get a routine way, people can get [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2078.44s)]
*  their immune system and inflammation markers assessed, that's going to give us even better [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2085.48s)]
*  ways to prevent these diseases. We did recently do a podcast with James Allison about using the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2091.96s)]
*  immune system to fight off cancer. So this this fits in very well. But let's assume that some of [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2100.44s)]
*  our listeners didn't listen to that episode yet and maybe explain more the details about how our [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2105.08s)]
*  immune system is supposed to work when everything's going well. Well, you know, that breakthrough that [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2109.56s)]
*  Allison had for immunotherapy was just the beginning of now a chain of many discoveries. And the point [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2114.52s)]
*  is, is that it's pretty hard to get cancer spread around the body if your immune system is completely [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2121.96s)]
*  intact. Cancer tries to hijack cells and suppress your immune system, but it's hard to get it rooted [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2128.12s)]
*  if your immune system is really high integrity. But the other thing we've learned is that as we keep [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2135.64s)]
*  adding more different ways of revving up the immune system and people with cancer that aren't responding [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2143.72s)]
*  to the current therapies, we keep getting more successful of getting cures. So it's almost like [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  we can't do enough with personalized neo antigen vaccines and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2157.24s)]
*  conjugate drugs. All these things are basically trying to get the immune system to go into high [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2164.8399999999997s)]
*  power mode, you know, and that's a big learning. And the point being is, if if I could say, well, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2170.52s)]
*  let's say you, Sean, you have this significant risk of cancer in your lifetime, what I'd be doing is [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2177.72s)]
*  maybe every year assessing your immune system. And when it was showing signs of showing a bit of [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2184.68s)]
*  what we call immunosensence, you know, we would give you something like a vaccine, like we were [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2191.16s)]
*  talking about at the, you know, the shingles type vaccine, but we might give you a vaccine just to [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2198.68s)]
*  give you a higher gear of your immune system so that you are in defense mode. Yeah. And of course, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2204.12s)]
*  we don't want to go too exuberant because we don't want you to go into self-attack mode either [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2212.6s)]
*  and develop an autoimmune component at all. But that's where this is the cancer story [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2217.24s)]
*  that's unraveled since the great work of Allison and others is really built on the fact that it's [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2225.72s)]
*  really an immune system defect that's allowing cancer to take hold and spread in our body. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2234.04s)]
*  And we have got to prevail over cancer. This is a fundamental goal. We've been talking about this [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2243.32s)]
*  moonshot, you know, for years, for decades. But now there's a there's a way to see through it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2249.08s)]
*  **Matt Stauffer** So tell me more about the cellular biology here. I understand that there's like [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2255.32s)]
*  T cells involved. What is supposed to be happening in my bloodstream when my immune system is going [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2260.84s)]
*  great guns? **Dennis Wiggins** Well, there's a lot of different components. The B cells that are known, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2266.6800000000003s)]
*  of course, they're making the antibodies and the T cells that are kind of a primary way that we can [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2273.0s)]
*  kill cells that are troublesome, that have foreign proteins on their surface. And of course, there's [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2280.04s)]
*  so many other aspects of, you know, interferons, and there's regular neutrophil white cells, and [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2287.72s)]
*  there's natural killer cells. And it's a big system. But it comes down to when you when you're [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2294.52s)]
*  trying to deal with cancer, as an example, you really want to have the ability to recognize [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2302.04s)]
*  these foreign antigens on surface of cells or cancer cells. And that's where the T cells really [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2310.9199999999996s)]
*  kick in. And so what you can do now, which is really quite extraordinary, we've seen, like we've [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2316.76s)]
*  never seen before, a small numbers of patients, but refractory cancer, they failed every therapy, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2322.44s)]
*  kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, they had the kitchen sink of everything we got, and they [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2328.92s)]
*  couldn't respond. And then they got a so called neo antigen personalized vaccine for their cancer. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2335.0s)]
*  That is, they were the cancer cells, they looked at these antigens taken out of the body, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2342.36s)]
*  and then engineered T cells to fight them for that person's specific cancer. And guess what [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2350.04s)]
*  happened? I mean, that was melted away. I mean, just now, the problem, of course, is it's not [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2357.7200000000003s)]
*  something that you could scale in millions of people who have cancer each year around the world. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2364.76s)]
*  But on the other hand, if we can get off the shelf ways to do this, that's where the prospects lie [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2370.44s)]
*  today is that we don't want to have to necessarily make T cells that are individualized. But rather, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2377.6400000000003s)]
*  if we can come up with the common antigens or proteins that are responsible, that can stimulate [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2384.44s)]
*  our immune system, that's what we want to do. And well, I don't know, I mean, can we imagine [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2391.88s)]
*  some combination of AI and DNA robots and I don't know, that will sort of fix up our immune system [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2398.8399999999997s)]
*  in a kind of bespoke way for whatever it is that we're most in danger of? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2406.12s)]
*  I wouldn't rule it out. Certainly possible. I like your thinking. It's futuristic and very [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2411.08s)]
*  futuristic, bringing all this stuff together. I'm more kind of looking at the here and now [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2417.72s)]
*  potential, but you're right. Already AI is being used to determine the matchup of a person's [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2423.32s)]
*  antigens of their tumor cells and the T cells. We're already starting to rely on AI because [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2431.96s)]
*  in any given cancer, there's hundreds and hundreds of these particular proteins. And so finding the [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2439.8s)]
*  ones that are to develop a vaccine against is, you can't do it against hundreds. You got to pick [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2446.52s)]
*  the most important ones and AI is helping to do that. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2454.84s)]
*  Okay, good. And I think I do see what we're talking about here vis-a-vis cancer, especially [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2457.64s)]
*  because we did talk to Jim Allison before. So what's the analogous story for cardiovascular [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2464.36s)]
*  disease, neurodegeneration? Yeah. So the Alzheimer's story [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2469.88s)]
*  is a lot of people don't realize this, how extraordinary change there is. So there's a [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2476.44s)]
*  blood biomarker called P-tau-217 and there's a couple others like it. And basically what they [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2482.76s)]
*  are is as good as a PET scan for the brain. Okay, so you just have simple blood tests, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2490.12s)]
*  it's available. It tells you your risk of Alzheimer's. And by the way, if that marker is high [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2495.64s)]
*  abnormal and you get another one in six months or a year, then you can say exactly when you might [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2501.8s)]
*  get mild cognitive deficit. So it stages the disease, no less makes the diagnosis of risk. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2507.6400000000003s)]
*  Now, and it used to be we have a genetic test and we'd say, oh, well, you have a higher risk [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2515.48s)]
*  of Alzheimer's. And we didn't know if it was at age 98 or 68. Now we know, very precise timing, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2522.2000000000003s)]
*  not just the extent of the risk. Now what's amazing here is that you can do all these things [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2530.68s)]
*  that reduce inflammation in the brain, which we didn't know before. So like, for example, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2537.56s)]
*  diet and exercise, the right kind of diet and the right kind of exercise can really help reduce [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2545.48s)]
*  inflammation in the body and the brain, lifestyle factors. Okay. But also what's really intriguing [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2552.44s)]
*  right now is all these GLIP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mungiro, they reduce inflammation in the brain. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2558.84s)]
*  It's one of the most important ways that they work. So they're being tested now to reduce [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2567.08s)]
*  Alzheimer's in big trials that are due out in less than a year. So there are other ways to reduce [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2573.0s)]
*  inflammation. The point being is that you might have some amyloid plaque in your brain, but if [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2581.08s)]
*  you are, if your brain is reacting to it and it's inflamed, that's the ticket to developing [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2586.6s)]
*  Alzheimer's. So knowing your risk and getting all over it with the lifestyle of preventable factors [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2594.44s)]
*  and likely drugs in the future, not the kind of drugs we have right now that are used for people [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2600.92s)]
*  already have Alzheimer's that are dangerous drugs and don't work very well. But this is the ability [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2606.84s)]
*  to prevent Alzheimer's in the future, which is really quite remarkable. I don't know a lot about [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2614.76s)]
*  Ozempic, the weight loss drug, or it's usually marketed as a weight loss drug, but I keep hearing [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2620.92s)]
*  how, oh, it has this extra unanticipated good side effect, which is kind of the opposite of what [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2626.36s)]
*  I'm used to hearing about all the deleterious side effects. Are we learning more about why this is [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2633.1600000000003s)]
*  so awesome? Does it have something to do with the immune system? Yeah. I mean, I think what's fascinating [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2638.44s)]
*  here that if you take these drugs, it's called GLIP-1 drugs, they don't get into the brain very [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2643.96s)]
*  well. So people started to wonder, how do you see such great reduction of brain inflammation? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2651.0s)]
*  No less, how do you see the reduction in appetite and desire for healthier foods and [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2656.76s)]
*  basically completely rewiring your reward circuits? And it turns out the gut brain axis. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2665.4s)]
*  So basically, it's affecting the gut. There's a vagal nerve that connects the [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2672.6s)]
*  gut to the brain. And it's through this circuitry that basically, the brain is kind of the master [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2679.16s)]
*  regulator of our inflammation, both in the brain and throughout the body, which we only learned [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2685.24s)]
*  about that in the last couple of years. We thought it was just the blood, but no, the brain's talking [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2691.24s)]
*  to the blood and the gut's talking to the brain. And so this is what we're learning about these [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2696.6s)]
*  GLIP-1 drugs that have had more impact across more diseases, some of which have nothing to do [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2703.0s)]
*  with weight loss. The inflammation is reduced before anyone loses weight. Okay? So this is a [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2710.68s)]
*  whole new day for understanding these inter-organ connections. And okay, and then heart disease, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2719.96s)]
*  this is your thing, right? I mean, it does sound different than the other two. Like, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2728.6s)]
*  heart disease seems more sudden or maybe that's just my misimpression. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2731.88s)]
*  Yeah, people think, oh, I had a heart attack and this was sudden. No, no, it's been brewing [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2735.7200000000003s)]
*  for at least 20 years. We have seen autopsies from 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds, that they already have [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2740.68s)]
*  plaque building up in their arteries, in the heart arteries, the so-called coronary. So no, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2748.28s)]
*  this is something, the only sudden event is that finally there's a crack in the plaque. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2753.6400000000003s)]
*  But that plaque has been growing and kind of inflamed. And here's another point is that if [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2759.1600000000003s)]
*  it wasn't that the plaque got inflamed, it wouldn't have a heart attack. And that's in part why statins [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2765.2400000000002s)]
*  work. They not only lower the LDL, but they reduce inflammation. They're not as powerful as the GLIP-1 [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2772.52s)]
*  drugs, but statins and anything that reduces your LDL cholesterol will also reduce some inflammation [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2778.04s)]
*  for the arteries. Because those are a species of the fatty proteins in our blood that [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2786.84s)]
*  the artery does not like that having it in their wall. It just reacts to it. And so years and years [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2795.08s)]
*  of accumulation of bathing your arteries and bad cholesterol, LDL, and now there's another one that [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2802.04s)]
*  will become routinely measured and new drugs to fight against called LP little A, which we never [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2809.16s)]
*  had anything for. But now we are seeing five different drugs that are emerging to tackle that [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2816.6s)]
*  one. So this is exciting too that we're coming up with new ways to prevent the toll of heart disease. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2822.84s)]
*  People don't die of a plaque. They die of a heart attack or a stroke for the arteries that go up into [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2831.64s)]
*  the brain. Sometimes informally people talk about dying of old age. Is that a thing or is that just [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2837.96s)]
*  like a catchall term for your immune system not doing what it's supposed to be doing? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2844.2799999999997s)]
*  You don't die just of old age. You got to die of something, right? Because age itself isn't a killer. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2849.72s)]
*  So there's got to be something else like explaining it. Could it be heart rhythm problem? Could it be [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2855.96s)]
*  something that doesn't get diagnosed, an indolent infection, many, many possible things. But you [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2864.76s)]
*  don't die just of old age. There is the idea that one's telomeres decay, right? As cells divide or [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2871.96s)]
*  genetic code is sort of being eaten away from the ends. How relevant is that? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2880.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of things happening as we age. Our telomeres, which the end of our chromosomes, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2885.4s)]
*  they get shorter and shorter. But there isn't any good way of lengthening them or lengthening them [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2890.2s)]
*  safely because they are also connected to your propensity to develop cancer. You don't want to [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2896.36s)]
*  muck around with them. And they're not nearly as good as the new clocks for telling you about your [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2901.72s)]
*  aging. So the new clocks, they include organ clocks. So what's amazing here is I could get a [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2908.52s)]
*  blood tube of blood from you and I could check. It's kind of like going to your car for every [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2916.84s)]
*  system, right? It would tell me about your aging of your brain, your heart, your kidneys, your liver, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2921.64s)]
*  your immune system, eight systems of your body from a tumor blood to say, is that organ in you [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2930.52s)]
*  aging faster than your chronological age, your actual age. And then I say, you know what, Sean, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2937.96s)]
*  I got to get all over this risk for your heart. And I'm going to check these other things. I'm [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2946.2000000000003s)]
*  going to confirm that this is it. And now this is what we're going to do for you. So you never, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2951.32s)]
*  first of all, we're going to slow your heart aging. We're going to slow it. Here's how we're [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2956.76s)]
*  going to slow it. And we're going to measure it again to prove that we slowed it. Okay. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2961.32s)]
*  That's what's so different today. We didn't have organ clocks. We didn't have epigenetic clocks [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2966.92s)]
*  that tell us our body wide aging relative to our actual aging. We have all these ways to detect [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2974.44s)]
*  what someone is not just a person, but the organ is off track. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2982.76s)]
*  And this is the science of aging crystallized to make a difference. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2990.5200000000004s)]
*  That's great. Yeah. And I do want to get into sort of the nitty gritty of what an individual can do [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=2995.32s)]
*  to live longer and more healthy. But maybe we can sweep the deck of some of the crazier ideas out [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3001.6400000000003s)]
*  there first. I mean, if I got a blood transfusion from, you know, children's blood or something [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3008.44s)]
*  like that, would that clean out my system and help me live longer? Yeah, there's a lot of these [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3014.68s)]
*  things that are out there, certainly in mice and animals that if you take old, young blood plasma [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3019.32s)]
*  and put it in old, you can see some improvements in metrics in people. It's never been established [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3026.76s)]
*  that it's safe or effective with any durable impact. And it's a very expensive procedure [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3036.92s)]
*  called plasma for races that these clinics, particularly out here in California, which [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3044.52s)]
*  California exactly. Yes. Horrible. But they're around the country, too. They're even in other [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3049.8s)]
*  countries. It's shameful because there's no data and, you know, very this is not covered by any [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3054.6800000000003s)]
*  insurance. This is really expensive. And this is for the likes of these extremists like Brian [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3061.08s)]
*  Johnson, the guy who had the Netflix special who takes hundreds of supplements a day and has, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3067.64s)]
*  you know, a penile sensor and night. And I mean, this guy and he had his blood transfused from his [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3073.3199999999997s)]
*  son. You know, this is crazy stuff. And he's kind of the one this don't die. He's promoting this [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3079.48s)]
*  stuff and people believe it, which is which is a shame. When a 200 year old person starts promoting [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3087.0s)]
*  that, I'm going to start believing them. But until then, I'm going to be skeptical. But I was I was [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3092.6s)]
*  shocked to learn recently that the supplement industry in the United States is several times [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3097.56s)]
*  larger than the entire prescription drug industry. You know, that's a really sad fact, as far as I [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3104.04s)]
*  know, it's true. And a lot of it is anti aging. Yeah, you know, the other day I was in an airport [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3111.56s)]
*  in Oakland, and there was a vending machine of anti aging supplements. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3119.48s)]
*  Wow. Wow. I mean, wow. What are we doing here? Right? Well, I happen to know that the anti [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3125.96s)]
*  aging supplement industry is very fond of advertising on podcasts. So I don't do that. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3133.64s)]
*  I don't actually I turned those down. But we're all over the place. The sad truth about that is [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3138.44s)]
*  that these longevity so called longevity doctors and scientists, they're the ones that are hawking [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3144.12s)]
*  the supplement. Yeah. Horrible. None of them are proven. And they're not, you know, they're not only [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3149.0s)]
*  lack of efficacy, but they're also questioning safety. And of course, they're a big dent in your [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3156.76s)]
*  finances. Everything bad about it. Okay, good. So you've gotten that off the deck a little bit. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3162.36s)]
*  I guess there's things we can do individually and things we can do as a society. I mean, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3169.2400000000002s)]
*  let's talk about as a society first. One cause of death is just, you know, a pandemic or an infectious [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3173.56s)]
*  disease or something like that. I mean, how how good are we at? I know, this is a politically [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3180.92s)]
*  charged question right now. But how good are we these days at protecting against future pandemics? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3187.32s)]
*  Not good. And the problem here is, you know, obviously, we didn't do well for the COVID [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3191.96s)]
*  pandemic, but we haven't learned the lesson. So instead of, you know, taking advantage of [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3200.44s)]
*  things we learn, we're seeing gutting of our resources in the United States. I mean, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3206.76s)]
*  unbelievable takedowns of the programs at CDC, NIH, FDA. So this anti vaccine, anti science culture. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3213.16s)]
*  So we're we're actually in much worse position than we were for COVID because of this movement [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3225.0s)]
*  against science. And it's a shame because we learned a lot of what it takes to be ready. And now, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3231.96s)]
*  even with threats that are out there, whether it's avian flu, or, you know, others that we know [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3240.92s)]
*  are potential pandemic threats, there's there's reluctance, there's denialism to confront what we [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3249.72s)]
*  should be doing. And it's really sad. Do you find yourself personally involved in political [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3258.36s)]
*  discussions or strategic discussions? Or is it something where, you know, the all the scientists [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3263.48s)]
*  are already on one side, we sort of don't have to talk to them? Yeah. No. And then the problem is [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3269.0s)]
*  that the people who are running the show now, you can't reason with them. Yeah. Because they were [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3274.68s)]
*  now empowered to take apart the systems that we had. And so we're kind of in this auto destruct [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3282.76s)]
*  mode. And you're trying to whether you're dealing with measles, and you say you got to get everybody [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3290.68s)]
*  vaccinated. And, you know, this is our best protection. And what you're hearing is, take [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3297.0s)]
*  cod liver oil and vitamin A, vitamin A, you have children in the hospital, because of liver toxicity, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3301.48s)]
*  that has nothing, there's no data to support that for preventing measles. But there are data, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3308.44s)]
*  obviously, for the toxicity of taking these at high doses is really, this is a sad state, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3315.0s)]
*  we're going backwards. It's almost like we're going in the dark ages here. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3322.68s)]
*  Yeah, I figured that was true. I figured it was nevertheless important to get it on the record [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3327.08s)]
*  there. So thanks for that update. Let's instead ask questions about what you and I can do a little [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3331.3999999999996s)]
*  bit. I mean, you have a really interesting section of the book where you talk about lifestyle plus [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3338.52s)]
*  explain what that is. Yeah, so we used to think lifestyle was all about diet, exercise, and then [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3343.72s)]
*  more recent years sleep health. Turns out there's missing about 10 other layers of lifestyle. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3349.8s)]
*  They extend through things like ultra processed foods as a component of diet, no less the protein [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3357.88s)]
*  component, and all the details of not just food, but also beverages, you know, alcohol and all that [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3367.0800000000004s)]
*  caffeine. But then as you get into other layers, like exposure to air pollution, micro plastics, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3375.24s)]
*  forever chemicals, social isolation, time in nature, I mean, it's a long list of what we would [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3382.7599999999998s)]
*  consider lifestyle plus, you could say lifestyle, environmental, socioeconomic, you know, all these [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3392.4399999999996s)]
*  other factors, but it's hard to, it's too many syllables and words. So I just call it plus, you [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3399.96s)]
*  know. So okay, I mean, that's just I know that some of these are kind of cliched and everyone [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3405.4s)]
*  is supposed to know them. What is a healthy diet and if first specifically aimed at the goal of [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3410.04s)]
*  being healthy and active for more years? Yeah, so this is really topical, because very recently, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3417.16s)]
*  there was a study 30 years a follow up of over 105,000 people and only 9% lived to age 70 without [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3423.72s)]
*  the chronic diseases we've been talking about. Age related chronic diseases, the big three. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3435.24s)]
*  And so they could zoom in on what did they eat? What were these 9% was different than the rest of [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3441.64s)]
*  the folks. And what was fascinating is it just confirmed everything we knew at this powerful [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3448.04s)]
*  study, fruit, vegetables, the Mediterranean light diet, reduction in, you know, red meat, animal fat, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3455.96s)]
*  ultra processed foods. So it was confirming everything we've known, but now in a whole new [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3465.48s)]
*  study, and it's called the optimal diet for healthy aging. So that's one thing. The other [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3472.2s)]
*  point about it is we don't, as we get older, we don't want to be light on our protein intake, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3479.7999999999997s)]
*  but we don't want to be too heavy either. You take too much protein, which you got to work at [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3487.3199999999997s)]
*  getting but there's at least some people out there advocating these super high protein diet. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3493.0s)]
*  Wrong. Because that promotes inflammation and promotes atherosclerosis. So you don't [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3498.68s)]
*  necessarily want to be at the recommended dietary allowance of 0.8 grams per kilogram. You want to [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3505.48s)]
*  be maybe around 1.2, but you sure don't want to go to, you know, 2.0 or higher, which is what [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3513.08s)]
*  some of the people out there have been without data, you know, to preserve your muscle mass [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3519.72s)]
*  as you age. But then you go into other things like, you know, what type of exercise and [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3526.84s)]
*  resistance training is really important. And it doesn't mean there's no such thing as 10,000 [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3532.2000000000003s)]
*  steps. You know, it's like, no, no one ever, there's even less than that. You even weekend [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3537.7200000000003s)]
*  warrior exercise is great. And then sleep, the sleep thing is wild because we always think that, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3543.48s)]
*  you know, how many hours did you sleep? No, it's about how much deep sleep you got, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3551.2400000000002s)]
*  which we was reduced with aging. And also people take drugs like Ambien, which backfires. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3556.2000000000003s)]
*  They sleep, but turns out that sleep is how you get rid of all your toxic waste products in your [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3564.6s)]
*  brain that promote inflammation. So if you take Ambien, what's amazing is you sleep more, but it [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3571.2400000000002s)]
*  blocks the efflux of these toxic chemicals from your brain. It's like the worst thing you could do. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3580.44s)]
*  I didn't know that. Probably extends to all the other drugs, because that's the only one that's [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3590.2000000000003s)]
*  been carefully studied. So I knew that sleep helps sort of rewire the connections in our brain a [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3594.84s)]
*  little bit, but I didn't know that it was literally cleaning out toxic chemicals. Cleaning out. That's [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3600.44s)]
*  what it's all about. And so you don't get deep sleep. It's actually extraordinary. And there's [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3607.16s)]
*  interactions with our heart rhythm and the efflux of these ways, but drugs don't help at all. They [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3614.44s)]
*  seem to make things worse, especially the one that's most commonly used. So you can learn [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3622.2799999999997s)]
*  how you get better deep sleep. You know, you can, you get a smartwatch or a fitness band or, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3628.44s)]
*  you know, the aura and other rings, and you can train yourself. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3634.84s)]
*  Okay, so that's crucially important. So say more about that. So like, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3640.2000000000003s)]
*  because everyone says sleep is good. I like sleep. It sounds good to me. But the fact that the drugs [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3643.88s)]
*  are counterproductive, and nevertheless, I can train myself in what sounds like a more natural [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3649.1600000000003s)]
*  way, actually, and that the smartwatches are actually helpful. That sounds important. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3654.92s)]
*  Yeah, because turns out if you start tracking it, like I've done, what you can see is, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3659.8s)]
*  I had terrible amount of deep sleep. And of course, it does reduce as you age and men are [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3666.36s)]
*  generally less than women. So I was kind of in a high risk group to start. But what was interesting [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3673.08s)]
*  is, by trying different things, I could see, oh, wow, I'm getting more and more and more deep sleep. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3678.52s)]
*  So for example, I never was trying to go very precise about, you know, when I was going to go [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3686.2s)]
*  to bed each night and try to get into as close to a ritual as possible. That makes a difference, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3691.72s)]
*  you know, your clock, your biologic clock. Other things like, you know, attending what, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3697.7999999999997s)]
*  what exercise you're doing, what, what you're eating, how late in the day you're eating and [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3703.08s)]
*  some, you know, so many things, interactions that you can start to see the pattern without AI. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3710.52s)]
*  And with AI, of course, it even better. We don't have that yet, but we will. Anyway, each person [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3717.08s)]
*  can learn about getting better deep sleep. And it's really important. And I don't want to skip over [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3723.64s)]
*  something you mentioned already, but it's worth emphasizing, which is the ultra processed foods. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3732.3599999999997s)]
*  That's something that's hard to avoid in the United States of America in the year 2025. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3737.1600000000003s)]
*  Hard to avoid, but easy to reduce. Okay. What counts as ultra processed? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3742.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, gosh, anything that you don't have in your kitchen, that's normal, you know, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3749.48s)]
*  normal ingredients for, you know, good home food. So you can tell pretty, you kind of do a smell [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3753.96s)]
*  test or a site test. If you look at a package and you see lots of ingredients, that's a bad sign. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3762.6s)]
*  Okay. And there's different types of ultra processed bad things. There's some of these [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3768.12s)]
*  are emulsifiers like, you know, xanthan gum. And, but if you don't recognize this stuff, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3774.7599999999998s)]
*  it's bad. It's bad. And what, again, it goes back to that theme we've been talking about is [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3780.68s)]
*  promoting inflammation in our body, no less our brain and putting us at risk. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3785.48s)]
*  It's like the opposite of what we've been talking about is increasing the risk of the big three age [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3792.36s)]
*  related diseases. Now the average American takes in 60% of their food is ultra processed, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3797.96s)]
*  which is the highest in the world. I'm sure. And a friend of mine who wrote a book, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3804.68s)]
*  Ultra Processed People, Chris Van Tulliken, is a UK physician scientist. He did a 30 day test [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3810.2799999999997s)]
*  of maximizing ultra processed food intake and a brain scan before and all these inflammation [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3818.92s)]
*  markers. And what happened was, you know, he gained 20 pounds. He had big time inflammation [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3825.0s)]
*  in his brain in 30 days of this. And he had all these off the charts inflammation blood tests. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3833.32s)]
*  So the point being is that it makes you eat more. It creates much more inflammation. And if you just [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3841.0s)]
*  are careful about what you know, the food that you intake intake and includes beverages that [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3847.64s)]
*  they have added stuff in there, particularly, then you can reduce this. It's not hard to get it down [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3853.96s)]
*  to 20 or 30% instead of 60 or 70%. Kids eat, it gets 70 or 80% of their diet. Yeah. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3860.36s)]
*  Do you have strong feelings about what are marketed as nutrition bars? Like, you know, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3870.84s)]
*  these little bars that have everything good for you in them, but it seems like they're probably [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3875.16s)]
*  pretty processed. Most of them are horrible. Okay, horrible. You look at them in degrees. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3878.7599999999998s)]
*  The other day, person gave me one that I said, Oh, wow, this one's pretty good. It was, you know, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3884.04s)]
*  just truly natural, nothing added. But you have to really read the labels and some of them that [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3888.6s)]
*  are widely used, marketed, that you think, Oh, these are great. Just just be open minded, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3895.08s)]
*  because you'll find that those labels are the good thing is that labels exist. Yeah. And the [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3904.36s)]
*  bad thing is they got lots of ingredients that you don't recognize. Okay. All right. Eat a carrot, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3909.2400000000002s)]
*  I suppose. I guess I'm not surprised. Carrots are great. Yeah. So okay, I mean, even though it is [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3915.48s)]
*  obvious, this is very, very good to be reminded. It's not obvious, but it's it should be well [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3923.96s)]
*  known that eating better alcohol not actually good in anything other than the tiniest of doses, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3928.44s)]
*  right? Yeah, I think there's a lot of debate about that. The question is, what is a moderate [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3935.0s)]
*  dose, right? You know, I recently had a patient, and his wife are seeing them. And just before [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3941.96s)]
*  we were wrapping up, the wife said to me, Is it okay if he has continues his moderate drinking? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3948.44s)]
*  And I said, Well, what is the moderate drinking? And he and she said, Well, he has two tequilas [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3954.8399999999997s)]
*  and six beers each night. I thought she was joking with me. Yeah, he was joking with me. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3960.92s)]
*  Well, that's a lot. Yeah. So the question is, what is moderate? And, you know, if it's two drinks [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3968.6s)]
*  on each of a weekend day, you know, because it's help social interactions, and it's enjoyable, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3976.2799999999997s)]
*  there's probably little data to show that that's harmful. Sure. On the other hand, if you're drinking [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3983.24s)]
*  every day, and you're having, you know, a fair amount of intake, and, you know, usually it's [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3988.68s)]
*  more than people like to admit or think. Anyway, that that when you start getting to high doses, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=3995.08s)]
*  as you point as you pointed to, that's a problem. And I guess the other thing to sort of wrap things [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4000.9199999999996s)]
*  up, the other thing that struck me in the book was your talk about mental health and social [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4006.52s)]
*  interactions. You have a very vivid graph that you reproduce that basically, if I read it correctly, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4012.12s)]
*  says, after age 60, people are either alone or they're with their partner, and they don't [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4018.6s)]
*  interact with other people that much. Yeah. And that's a contributor. Absolutely. And it got worse [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4024.44s)]
*  during the pandemic, people just living in a cave, especially the older the more likely, but it's [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4030.04s)]
*  still a big problem that anodated the pandemic. And this is really bad for your health. Really, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4035.96s)]
*  as it turns out, the connection of that with bad outcomes is striking. So for mental health, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4042.12s)]
*  but obviously, as you well know, everyone knows, there's a lot of interactions between our mental [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4049.7200000000003s)]
*  health, our stress, and our physical health. And for mental health, with the more social interaction, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4055.88s)]
*  less isolation, the aversion to loneliness, these are really important things to strive against, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4063.96s)]
*  that, again, going back to that feature, patient of mine, she has, you know, she plays Rummy Cube for [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4072.36s)]
*  every, every week with eight of her friends. There you go. All in their 90s, you know, and that's a [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4081.6400000000003s)]
*  good thing. And she, you know, frequently interacts with other people in her retirement [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4088.52s)]
*  community building. So these are things that are really much more, they seem like social science, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4095.08s)]
*  but the data are striking. And so we really should pay attention to it. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4101.64s)]
*  Is there any truth to the idea that if I just, if I solve puzzles, if I do the crossword puzzle, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4106.12s)]
*  if I keep my brain active in that way, play video games, read novels, does that help at all with [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4111.88s)]
*  aging? Well, that's an interesting question. You know, the studies are mixed. There's a new one [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4116.68s)]
*  coming out that says, the more you work as yet older with technology, like iPads and computers, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4122.84s)]
*  it's actually better, you know, which is interesting. But brains, just like humans [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4131.72s)]
*  are meant to be interactive, as a social as we are really a social animal, even though people like to [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4138.92s)]
*  not be that way. The same thing is stimulating the brain, it's got to be good for it. Proving it [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4146.12s)]
*  is tricky, because, you know, the we didn't have the right tests. Like, for example, what I'd want [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4154.12s)]
*  to know is that biomarker we had for Alzheimer's, which is going to be improved by exercise and diet. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4160.68s)]
*  I want to see that biomarker go down with this brain stimulation. Yeah. No, no studies like [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4168.84s)]
*  that have yet been done. Interesting. Okay, it seems like an obvious thing to do. Why haven't [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4175.96s)]
*  they done that one yet? Because these are new, you know, we didn't have a brain organ clock [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4180.44s)]
*  until like the end of 2023. I see. Okay. So it's these are studies are going to be and then we can [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4186.04s)]
*  ice it and we can say, Hey, you know what, these things are really good for you. And you know, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4192.84s)]
*  the other thing, Sean, it might be really good for you, but not for another person. Of course, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4196.76s)]
*  none of this stuff is like all one one size fits all. And we have to keep that in mind, too. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4202.52s)]
*  And to bring it home. That's another place where AI might be useful, right in personalizing your [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4207.96s)]
*  regimen, whether it's diet or exercise or mental activity. That's exactly right. So that we would [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4213.64s)]
*  know in general, the things that would help, but then by tracking these different metrics over time, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4220.84s)]
*  and people who are at high risk, they I can say, Well, this is what's working. And this is what you [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4225.64s)]
*  know, the gaps and this is what's going to change. I call it precision medical forecasting. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4230.84s)]
*  We you may know this, but AI is radically changed weather forecasting. It hasn't been implemented. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4237.88s)]
*  But now you can have 99.99% accuracy in weather forecasting like we never had before. I mean, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4245.56s)]
*  most of the time, it seems like the weather forecasting is, you know, pretty far off, but [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4253.400000000001s)]
*  that's going to be changed quickly because multiple groups have shown that now with these [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4256.84s)]
*  large language models, multimodal data, you can get such remarkably accurate weather forecasting. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4262.84s)]
*  Well, we're about to do that for people for their health. And that, to me, is even more important [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4270.12s)]
*  in the weather. Recognizing patterns. That's what they're very, very good at. And I'm sure so we can [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4276.2s)]
*  finally all agree that listening to the right podcasts is probably the best thing that can help [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4281.96s)]
*  you live healthier, longer life, right? You got it. No, this, this has got to be the one. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4286.52s)]
*  This is definitely stimulating the mind. So that's all we can ask for. Eric Topol, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4291.72s)]
*  thanks so much for being on the Mindscape podcast. Thanks for having me, Sean. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-GjR1nkJSc&t=4296.120000000001s)]
