Welcome to the February 2023 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). We take questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable number — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

The big news this month is the successful awarding of the first ever Mindscape Big Picture Scholarship. Congratulations to Lyat Melese and Rehman Hassan! We continue to collection donations for next year’s scholarship contest.

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | February 2023
**Mindscape Podcast:** [February 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3uIiv48q98)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the February 2023 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  As usual, we skipped January Ask Me Anything, so we've accumulated quite a bunch of questions
*  here for the February one.
*  I had to be a little severe, a little harsh in cutting down the questions to a reasonable
*  size, so I do apologize to all the people who asked perfectly good questions who are
*  going to get ignored.
*  The other thing to mention is that we've been doing the AMAs for a while now, and as a result,
*  there are questions that I've answered more than once, or very, very similar questions.
*  And I'm torn by this, because on the one hand, not everyone has listened to every single
*  AMA or was not there in the early days.
*  On the other hand, the people who are don't want to hear the same discussion over and
*  over again, so I kind of pick and choose.
*  If there's a question that I'm pretty sure I've talked about before, I will be less likely
*  to answer it, but if there's something I can say that might be new or interesting or whatever,
*  then I will nevertheless consider it.
*  So don't be completely discouraged from doing that.
*  I do have one piece of very good news to share with everyone.
*  You might remember that we had a scholarship competition at bold.org.
*  You can see what was going on there at bold.org slash scholarships slash mindscape.
*  We had the mindscape big picture scholarships, which give $10,000 to the winners to help
*  defray the costs of going to college and studying something in science or philosophy or math
*  or whatever it is that constitutes thinking about the biggest ideas in the universe, broadly
*  speaking.
*  And I was very happy that we raised so much money for this that we were able to give two
*  $10,000 scholarships and we've chosen the winners.
*  And I'm very, very happy to announce that the winners are incredibly deserving students
*  who are in high school now will be going to college.
*  One is Raymond Hassan, who wants to be studying biophysical sciences, different kinds of biology.
*  Both students are more biological than physics.
*  That's okay.
*  That still counts as a big picture in my book, as we know from the fact that we have lots
*  of biologists on the podcast.
*  Anyway, Raymond is an amazing student who is the founder of iCure Health, which has
*  now over 30 international chapters that have helped 45,000 people to ensure everyone has
*  access to quality public health knowledge and preventative care services.
*  And this is while they were in high school.
*  And they've become an adolescent champion of the World Health Organization and a whole
*  bunch of other wonderful accomplishments, wrote a wonderful essay and is a very deserving
*  winner here.
*  The other winner is Liat Melis.
*  I'm not actually sure that I'm pronouncing her name correctly, M-E-L-E-S-E, who is also
*  interested in studying neurobiology and cognitive science kinds of things.
*  And again, extremely impressive high school resume, working at Virginia Tech in the lab,
*  designing studies to study how impulsive neurological behaviors play a role in diabetes self-regulation.
*  A published author in the New York Times.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what I was doing back in my high school days, but not stuff that was nearly
*  that impressive.
*  So I'm very, very happy to announce both of those winners of the Mindscape Big Picture
*  Scholarship and extraordinarily thankful to all the Mindscape listeners who have donated.
*  You don't have to be a Mindscape listener to donate, but you are the primary target audience
*  for my solicitations.
*  And we're doing it again next year.
*  So we already have enough money in the scholarship fund to give away at least one more scholarship
*  next year.
*  And we're going to continue to remind you that you can donate and maybe more and more
*  students will win.
*  And that will maybe help someone who might not have been able to study these kinds of
*  things in college.
*  So that's bold.org slash scholarships slash Mindscape.
*  Anyway, that was the big announcement I wanted to make.
*  I do want to remind you that these AMAs are funded by Patreon supporters of Mindscape.
*  And you can be a Patreon supporter if you want.
*  All you have to do is go to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll, pay a dollar or $2 or $5,
*  whatever you want per episode.
*  And then you get ad free versions of the episodes as well as the ability to ask questions for
*  the AMAs.
*  I do try to eventually hit everyone who asks a question, but as I just said, can't get
*  to all the questions these days.
*  There's too many good things to say.
*  And with that, let's go.
*  First question is from Peewee Munster, who let me talk a little bit about what the question
*  is before I ask it.
*  So the big news that has happened in our kinds of interesting questions around the world
*  in the past month or so has been dramatically forward in these artificial intelligence programs
*  that have been going into the public domain so anyone can play with them.
*  There was Dolly that was making images.
*  ChatGPT is one that will respond to prompts that you give it and give back text responses
*  that will more or less sound like what you want to do.
*  The great thing about ChatGPT is not only can you say, you know, explain to me the many
*  worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, but you can do so in different styles, right?
*  You can say, explain to me the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics in the
*  style of Ernest Hemingway and ChatGPT will do that.
*  And it's really an incredible kind of thing to play with and to learn what it will do.
*  And there's been some controversy, but both excitement and controversy.
*  The excitement is clear because this is a step forward in artificial intelligence.
*  And where will it go?
*  What will it be used for?
*  Right?
*  Is it going to replace a lot of people who have jobs that, you know, don't require heavy
*  lifting if you can just do them by artificial intelligence?
*  Professors, of course, immediately panicked that students are just going to use this to
*  write their essays and that's going to make evaluating essays a lot harder, a lot papers
*  and things like that.
*  I don't know about that.
*  I'm going to worry about that too much.
*  But certainly there are going to be tremendous ramifications of this.
*  One ramification is at what point do we declare the Turing test to have been won, right?
*  The Turing test proposed by Alan Turing was that an artificial computer intelligence would
*  be conscious by human standards once it can fool a human being into thinking that it really
*  is a human being.
*  I'm not sure if that's the best test to be honest, but it gets across some of the
*  thing that we would want out of artificial intelligence to sound human enough to pass
*  for human.
*  And in some sense, things like these large language models constructed by machine learning
*  techniques like chat GPT pretty clearly could pass a test like that.
*  So the question is, you know, do they count as conscious or aware?
*  And there are some people who want to argue that they do.
*  They clearly don't, by the way.
*  That's the answer.
*  They are not.
*  They're certainly not conscious.
*  And this question that Peewee Munster asks actually gives a wonderful way of illustrating
*  that.
*  So what Peewee says is, I was going to ask the obligatory question on chat GPT, but then
*  realized I don't have to.
*  I can just ask chat GPT.
*  So what Peewee did was asked chat GPT three different questions and asked the computer
*  to answer them in my voice, right, in the voice of Sean M. Carroll.
*  And so let me just read you the three questions and the three answers because I think they
*  do together a remarkably good job of illustrating both the impressive and not so impressive
*  aspects of this kind of technology.
*  So one question is, this is a prompt to the chat GPT.
*  Okay, so the prompt is, you are the renowned physicist Sean M. Carroll and you are hosting
*  the Ask Me Anything episode of the Mindscape podcast.
*  A listener asks you what you think of chat GPT.
*  As Sean M. Carroll, how would you respond?
*  And then chat GPT responds, as a physicist, my primary area of expertise is not in artificial
*  intelligence or natural language processing.
*  However, I am aware of the recent advancements in GPT based language models like chat GPT.
*  I find it fascinating how these models are able to generate human like responses to a
*  wide range of prompts.
*  However, I also recognize the limitations and potential dangers of these models, such
*  as the risk of them amplifying biases and misinformation.
*  Overall, I think it's important to approach these models with a healthy dose of skepticism
*  and critical thinking.
*  So let me just very quickly say before going on to saying other things, this is the real
*  Sean now talking.
*  What is real anyway, this is the real host of the podcast talking.
*  This is very typical of chat GPT's answers whenever you ask it to evaluate something.
*  It's always pretty wishy washy.
*  It's always like, well, I don't know, there's arguments one way or the other.
*  You get that a lot.
*  So let's think about that and keep that in mind while I read the next prompt.
*  The next prompt is another listener asks, how did you meet your wife as Sean M. Carroll?
*  How would you respond?
*  The response is as Sean M. Carroll, I would respond to my wife and I met in graduate school
*  at the University of Chicago.
*  We were both studying physics and our paths cross in various classes and research groups.
*  We quickly became friends and eventually started dating.
*  It's been a wonderful and exciting journey ever since.
*  And I'm grateful to have her by my side in both my personal and professional life.
*  So whether you know or not, let me just be very clear.
*  All of that is complete nonsense and is utterly wrong.
*  It's very convincingly said and it's a very reasonable set of things, but no relationship
*  whatsoever to reality.
*  My wife, Jennifer, we did not meet at the University of Chicago.
*  I was never in graduate school at the University of Chicago.
*  I was a professor there.
*  Jennifer was never affiliated with Chicago at all.
*  Jennifer was never a graduate student in physics.
*  Our paths did not cross in classes.
*  This is all entirely made up.
*  No connection to reality.
*  The final question was another listener asks, what is your favorite pizza?
*  As Sean M. Carroll, how would you respond?
*  And the response is as Sean M. Carroll, I would respond that my favorite pizza is a
*  classic margarita pizza.
*  I love the simplicity of the ingredients with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, and a drizzle
*  of olive oil.
*  It's a pizza that really highlights the quality of the ingredients unless the flavors shine
*  through.
*  I also enjoy trying new and unique pizzas, but for me, the margarita will always hold
*  a special place in my heart.
*  One impressive thing, by the way, that's actually very subtle here is the consistency
*  of the answer from the beginning to the end.
*  The answer is margarita pizza and at the end, it's still margarita pizza.
*  It's not just like a random collection of words.
*  However, once again, entirely wrong.
*  No connection to reality here.
*  Margarita is not my favorite pizza.
*  I have no problems with a good margarita, but my favorite kind of pizza would absolutely
*  involve pepperoni in some way or another.
*  And so that's why I love all of these answers here.
*  None of them are right.
*  None of them are what I would actually say.
*  And it's weird to me to see a whole bunch of people online saying like, this replaces
*  Google for me now.
*  This replaces Wikipedia.
*  Just ask ChatGPT my questions.
*  ChatGPT is very good at constructing sentences that sound cogent and human made.
*  It's not good at all at telling you the truth.
*  It is, I admit that when you use a large language model like this, it can seem really, really
*  impressive and almost as if it has a mind of its own.
*  It can seem very human.
*  Why is that?
*  Well, the way that these things work to hugely oversimplify a very complicated thing is large
*  language model means you feed it a lot of language.
*  You have a machine learning algorithm and you just feed it an enormous amount of text
*  of words that seem to fit together in certain ways.
*  The large language model has zero understanding.
*  It does not know what pizza is.
*  It does not know what a margarita pizza is.
*  It does not know what to be married is or a spouse or a graduate school because it doesn't
*  know anything because it doesn't have any concepts in its brain.
*  This is a fascinating philosophical question, of course, and that's why I think that these
*  kinds of artificial intelligence attempts are really going to help us understand what
*  we mean when we talk about to know, to understand, to have concepts.
*  The point is that when you and I talk about a spouse, that's a concept and it comes along
*  with different associations.
*  You know, like generally people have one spouse, not 20.
*  People don't have negative numbers of spouses.
*  There's no such set of information in ChatGPT.
*  What ChatGPT is doing is looking at what words tend to appear next to what other words or
*  what other sentence structures appear next to other sentence structures.
*  So if you go back to the how did you meet your wife question, as Sean M. Carroll, I
*  would respond that my wife and I met in graduate school at the University of Chicago.
*  We were both studying physics and our paths crossed in various classes and research groups.
*  We quickly became friends and eventually started dating.
*  That's no relationship to the truth of how I met my wife, but it all sounds very reasonable
*  for how someone might meet someone's wife.
*  And there's little details in there about studying physics in Chicago that are associated
*  with me, but none of it fits together to tell the truth.
*  It's just the machine learning algorithm is noticing that these kinds of phrases and
*  words fit together very frequently and it's doing its best job.
*  By the way, there's some random numbers thrown in there, so if you ask the same question
*  again it wouldn't give you necessarily exactly the same answer.
*  And that's a huge difference, this idea of looking at what words come together versus
*  actually having a conceptual symbolic understanding of the world, having a model of the world
*  and using that to better understand what is happening in the world is a vast gulf.
*  So I think that things like this, Chach-GPT and its relatives are extremely, extremely
*  important and extremely, extremely illustrative.
*  I think that they're nowhere close to true artificial general intelligence, but they're
*  clearly super duper good at mimicking intelligence.
*  That's the important thing.
*  That's the important thing to notice about this.
*  It's not that we're anywhere close to artificial general intelligence, but that we can trick
*  you into thinking that we are.
*  We could easily program these things to answer phones, to answer emails, etc. in ways that
*  you would think you were getting a response from a human much better than we're doing
*  today.
*  But not one right now in the state of the art where you would be confident they were
*  telling the truth or be on the right track.
*  And they don't know that they're making these very basic mistakes.
*  I mean, there's lots of examples online that you can go search for where, you know, Chach-GPT
*  will say with absolute sincerity exactly the opposite of the truth.
*  So I think it is very important, very interesting.
*  It's going to have huge ramifications for the future.
*  I do not think it is a substitute for actually doing research on anything.
*  It's certainly not a substitute for true knowledge in any sense, but it's just very early days.
*  The amount of progress that's going to be made is going to be considerable.
*  OK, and so I sort of buried some other Chach-GPT questions that were there thinking that that
*  particular discussion would give you most of my opinions about these things.
*  Nikola Ivanov has a priority question.
*  So you remember, again, if you're a longtime listener, there's something called the priority
*  question.
*  If you have a question that you really, really want answered, once we instituted the idea
*  that I'm not going to answer all the questions, for every Patreon supporter, you have once
*  in your life the ability to ask a priority question and I will answer it.
*  I will do my best to answer it.
*  You know, look, I might misunderstand the question.
*  You don't get to keep asking the same question over and over again.
*  You get a one priority question.
*  I do my best to answer it.
*  That's how it goes.
*  So Nikola's priority question is, in your podcast with Penrose, when discussing the
*  low entropy hypothesis for the beginning of our universe, you commented that the fact
*  that the CMB spectrum matches that of a black body, i.e. already has maximum entropy, does
*  not violate this hypothesis because there's already a gravitational entropy which was
*  low and that was not taken into account.
*  My question is, what is this gravitational entropy at the time of the Big Bang?
*  It can't be the entropy of primordial black holes since they also have very high entropy.
*  And should we understand the low entropy hypothesis as relating only to the gravitational
*  entropy and not the thermodynamic one?
*  Let me emphasize that there is no clear rigorous division of entropy into gravitational and
*  other forms, okay?
*  This is a very, very loose way of talking that gives some physical insight.
*  The point is that the correct absolute thing to say about the early universe is that the
*  entropy was low, full stop.
*  That's the correct thing, okay?
*  There's no sense in which the entropy was high.
*  But then we do try to give some understanding to that true statement.
*  In what way is the entropy low?
*  There's only one way for entropy of a system to be very, very high.
*  You're in equilibrium and there's a unique sort of equilibrium state.
*  But once the entropy is low, there's many different ways for the entropy to be low.
*  So we have to ask about the early universe, what is this specific kind of low entropy
*  state in which it started?
*  For what it's worth, for whatever reason that we don't know, the specific way that
*  the early universe started is that the space time was nearly flat.
*  Sorry, I shouldn't say space time because it's rapidly explaining me.
*  But space was nearly flat.
*  It was extremely smooth.
*  It was extremely homogeneous, okay?
*  The stuff inside, at least at the moments when we have observational access to it, the
*  matter that was populating that nearly flat space was thermal, had a black body radiation.
*  So this is very specific and very provocative to physicists, okay?
*  It's low entropy because in a universe with gravity, like ours, densely packed material
*  will be high entropy when it's lumpy, not when it's smooth, okay?
*  See a black hole surrounded by empty space or a collection of black holes with empty
*  space in between them, that's what high entropy would be like.
*  And the early universe was nothing like that at all.
*  It was very, very low entropy.
*  However, weirdly, interestingly, if you think about a situation where gravity is not that
*  important, like a box of gas in a container here on the surface of the earth, gravity
*  is pulling it down, of course, but the internal gravity of the gas inside is just not that
*  big a deal, right?
*  There's just not that much stuff and gravity is a weak force.
*  If you have that very different kind of situation and you ask what the high entropy equilibrium
*  state would look like, it would be a thermal distribution.
*  It would be black body radiation being emitted by a thermal distribution of particles.
*  So the weird thing about the early universe, there's two weird things.
*  One is that it has low entropy.
*  I mean, there's many weird things, but in this question, one, it has low entropy, two,
*  the specific way in which it has low entropy seems to be what would look like high entropy
*  if it weren't for gravity.
*  Okay?
*  What does that mean?
*  I don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  We don't know why the early universe had low entropy.
*  We don't know why it takes that specific form.
*  It's provocative and there's sort of some obvious things to try.
*  One thing to try is, can you just imagine turning off gravity in the early universe
*  so that it went to a high entropy state that looked thermal and then you turn gravity back
*  on?
*  Brian Green and some of his collaborators, Brian was a former Mindscape guest, tried
*  that.
*  They actually wrote a paper literally about that possibility so you can check that out.
*  I don't really think it works, that specific scenario, but it's a natural thing to try.
*  Roger Penrose has his own ideas about how to specify it.
*  To me, Penrose's ideas are more about, once again, characterizing the way in which the
*  early universe has low entropy and less hopeful in actually providing an explanation for why.
*  It is the entropy that is low.
*  There's no different kinds of entropies, but there's some rough explanation, some intuition
*  that we get by thinking about a separation between gravitational and non-gravitational
*  entropy.
*  Larry Rossi says, I must confess that I sometimes listen to the Mindscape podcast when I cannot
*  sleep.
*  This is not to say they are boring.
*  The exact opposite is true.
*  My brain is distracted and spinning through many worlds, the arrow of time, whatever the
*  topic is, and I'm out.
*  Do you ever struggle to sleep and if so, what helps you?
*  I need to comment on the listening to Mindscape when you go to sleep stuff.
*  That's fine.
*  I love it.
*  People have said many, many times that they listen to Mindscape while going to sleep or
*  they listen to the biggest ideas in the universe videos or something like that.
*  I don't get it.
*  I don't understand because if I were doing that, the things I was listening to, I would
*  start thinking about and that would prevent me from going to sleep.
*  If I can't get to sleep, it's because I'm thinking about something and I can't stop
*  thinking about it.
*  Now, having said that, it's well known.
*  I'm not breaking any psychological ground here, but you can fall into a rut thinking
*  about something.
*  I mean, you can think about something and maybe your thoughts are not that productive.
*  You're not really making any progress, but you just can't stop thinking about the same
*  thing over and over again.
*  You had a conversation, you said something dumb and you're replaying the conversation
*  in your mind and in your replaying of the conversation, you are brilliant and witty
*  and everything that you say is not embarrassing at all.
*  That's the kind of thing that just keeps your mind locked into a rut and then that makes
*  it hard to sleep also.
*  It used to be that I did struggle to fall asleep and then once I fell asleep, I was
*  out.
*  Still more or less true that once I fall asleep, I'm out.
*  I'm a sound sleeper once I get to sleep, but again, this is not any genius breakthrough.
*  I just realized that I was probably going to bed too early.
*  It works for me to just stay up until I'm super tired and then I will fall asleep.
*  So I'm working hard enough these days and I go to bed late enough that I don't really
*  have trouble falling asleep anymore.
*  I don't really have any more wisdom than that.
*  This is certainly something where I suspect that the way to think about it is that different
*  people are very different from each other.
*  So if you read about a way to help you fall asleep and you try it and it doesn't work,
*  I wouldn't be too depressed by that or disappointed.
*  I would just try other ways.
*  I think different people are just different there.
*  Brian Maitz.
*  So I have two questions in a row here, both about the Lara Buczak episode that we had
*  on Mindscape recently, but they're slightly different questions.
*  So I'm going to not group them together.
*  I'm just going to read them in order.
*  So Brian says, from the utilitarian ethics of the Lara Buczak episode to your discussion
*  of fitness landscapes and the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the
*  very concept of optimal has started to seem problematic to me.
*  Because inequality only has meaning on the number line, there is always a single scalar
*  ruling everything.
*  Even if it is some complicated risk adjusted weighted sum of multiple virtues or costs
*  or penalty, so many worlds for this one thing.
*  The question is, do you think this is a blind spot or weakness for science and rational
*  ethics and so on?
*  Could you imagine some sort of alternative, some calculus of good enough that isn't such
*  a slippery slope to an optimum whose unitary nature cements us into possibly dystopian
*  hazards for a poly vocal multi agent world full of uncertainties?
*  So I think that there's actually two different things going on here that are both interesting
*  and important, but worth teasing apart a little bit.
*  One is the existence of thinking of some decision procedure as optimizing some number that can
*  seem that kind of thing where you know, it's certainly what utilitarians do, right?
*  Utilitarian say there is a number called the expected future utility of your actions and
*  over the space of all possible actions, we would like to maximize that number.
*  That's what we want to do.
*  We want to optimize our actions to increase this particular number.
*  But other moral strategies don't seem that way, right?
*  In a deontological strategy, your idea is to follow certain rules, not to calculate
*  a certain number and optimize it.
*  In a virtue ethic strategy, your goal is to be virtuous in certain ways, again, rather
*  than adding up a number.
*  I think that that particular distinction is a bit fake.
*  Okay, it's true that utilitarians explicitly optimize a number, but I also think it's
*  true that everyone optimizes a number.
*  In other words, maybe they don't think that they're optimizing a number, but anything
*  that you do, any procedure that you can invent for making decisions can be thought of as
*  maximizing some quantity.
*  If you're a deontologist and you say, never lie, okay, well then attach a number 1 or
*  a number infinity to all the true things you say, a number minus infinity to all the false
*  things you say, and you try to maximize that number.
*  That's not a convenient or useful way of thinking about it, but you can always think about it
*  that way.
*  I don't think that there's any inherent problem in the idea that we should optimize a number,
*  that we should maximize a number, that we should optimize some strategy, anything like
*  that.
*  It may not always be the way we think, but we can always formally map the way that we
*  do think onto that kind of strategy.
*  The second aspect you're saying here is, okay, given that we're trying to maximize a quantity
*  or optimize a number, how strict should we be about actually optimizing it?
*  Like you say, is there some calculus of good enough?
*  In fact, there absolutely is.
*  This is something that people have very much put thought into.
*  That is where the satisfying comes in, which I think I talked about with Laura.
*  I talked about it on the podcast other times though.
*  By the way, parenthetically, one place I talked about that idea was with Herb Gintis, the
*  economist who sadly passed away recently.
*  As far as I know, he's the first mindscape guest to have passed away since being on the
*  show.
*  It was a really great episode about game theory and evolution and human beings and how we
*  construct our social lives using game theory kind of things.
*  Herb was very clear that we are constrained or what is the technical term here?
*  We're limited in our capacity to do reasoning and information processing.
*  It's not constrained, but there's some phrase that I'm forgetting.
*  Sorry about that.
*  Limited computation, is that it maybe?
*  We're bounded in our abilities to both collect information about the world and then to process
*  that information.
*  In practice, even if we think that the right thing to do is perfectly well expressed by
*  optimizing some number, in practice we never really do that.
*  If you go back to Carl Friston's episode where we talked about the Bayesian brain and the
*  free energy principle, one of the big things in Friston's approach is that in principle,
*  the human brain would like to build the best possible model of the world.
*  Way to build the best possible model of the world, as we know, is to be a good Bayesian,
*  to take the priors that we have and update them when information comes in.
*  You can write down Bayes' formula, and it's actually a very short, easy to remember formula,
*  but calculating it carefully and in real time actually turns out to be very difficult.
*  The free energy principle that Friston looks at is a way to get approximate Bayesian updating
*  in a very rapid period of time.
*  I think that something like that, satisfying, good enough, is always what we do.
*  I think that you're right, your implication is correct, Brian, that we should be more
*  admitting of that.
*  We should be aware of it.
*  The philosophy of how we should act, how we should be moral, what decisions we should
*  make should do a better job.
*  People do talk about this, but maybe not as much as they should.
*  The fact that we are not perfect reasoners or in possession of perfect knowledge about
*  the world, I think yes, we do need to take that into account.
*  I'm not quite sure what the possibly dystopian hazards are that you're referring to.
*  I think the dystopian hazards come more from having a bad thing that we're trying to optimize
*  rather than trying to optimize something at all.
*  Janice or Janice Funk says, in episode 220 with Laura Buchak, when considering from a
*  many worlds perspective, whether you would rather give 100 future possible Schons a million
*  dollars or give 98 of them a million dollars and giving one of them nothing, sorry, giving,
*  oh yes, giving 98 of them a million, giving one of them nothing and one of them 20 million.
*  You seem to suggest that these different versions of Schons need to be treated like 100 strangers.
*  While I agree that you are not the same person as the Schons in other branches, all these
*  possible Schons will remember having made that decision for themselves.
*  Don't you think their complicity in the decision changes the moral situation compared to a
*  scenario where you get to distribute money from non-complicit strangers, among non-complicit
*  strangers?
*  I'm not exactly sure what to say here.
*  I think you're on to something, but I'm not quite sure that it matters in this case.
*  I might be misunderstanding or misreading here.
*  Let me just say what my thoughts are.
*  Again, just to be clear, because maybe I read it a little bit too quickly or awkwardly,
*  we're trying to decide between two different ways of distributing money.
*  You have 100 people, give a million dollars each.
*  That's one way of doing it.
*  The other way is you have 100 people, give 98 of them a million, one of them zero, and
*  one of them 20 million.
*  There's more being given away in the second scheme, but it's a little bit more unequal,
*  a little bit less fair, because someone's going to get nothing.
*  The question is that I'm treating the different versions of myself like strangers, and don't
*  I think that the complicity in the decision changes the moral situation?
*  I'll absolutely confess I forget what I said in real time in the episode.
*  I don't think that strangers is the right way to put it.
*  I'm just going to try to say true things now.
*  I'm not going to necessarily try to fix what I said then.
*  They're different people, and they're people who will never talk to each other, but you're
*  certainly right in that they share memories.
*  The decision that was made that they need to live with the consequences of is absolutely
*  a decision that they made.
*  That's very true.
*  If the question is, does it matter whether one makes a decision for oneself or for others,
*  in principle, yeah, it absolutely could.
*  I don't think it does very much in this case.
*  I don't think that the many worlds thing matters that much in this kind of analysis.
*  I think many worlds is just a distraction.
*  Just think of it in terms of probabilities.
*  I think it's exactly the same analysis, whatever that analysis is.
*  If you say 98 people get a million dollars, one gets 20 million, one gets zero, to me,
*  that's exactly equivalent to saying there is a 98% chance that I will get a million
*  A 1% chance I get nothing and a 1% chance I get 20 million.
*  Whatever the answer is in one of those cases, it's the same in the other one.
*  I forget what I said.
*  I think that I would, I really don't know.
*  I can see arguments for either way.
*  I'm probably going to go for the 20 million, that the 1% chance of the 20 million.
*  I hope I'm consistent in what I said, but maybe not.
*  Maybe I've updated my beliefs.
*  A guaranteed 1 million is nice, but a 1% chance of winning 20 million versus 1% chance of zero,
*  maybe I go for the 20 million.
*  If I were destitute and poor, maybe I would feel very differently about that.
*  Certainly in those kinds of questions, I think that if one has the chance to give the people
*  who are getting the reward the ability to choose rather than me doing the choosing,
*  then yes, you should do that.
*  You should listen to what the people want.
*  So I guess, and this is one of Laura's points, is that it is absolutely okay that different
*  kinds of people have different risk tolerances.
*  So the point about the question 100% chance of 1 million versus 98% chance of 1 million,
*  1% chance of 20, 1% chance of zero.
*  By the way, you could also contrast that with, forget about the people who get 1 million,
*  they're all just the same, 100% chance of getting 1 million versus 50% chance of getting
*  20 and 50% chance of getting zero.
*  That's another comparison you could do.
*  But anyway, Laura's point is, it's okay to have different risk tolerances about this.
*  There's not a one unique answer to which you should prefer on the basis of rational
*  choice theory.
*  It is okay to say my preference is not to risk it and go for the 100% guarantee of a
*  million.
*  It is also okay to say, let those dice roll and give me the 50-50 chance of 20 million
*  versus zero.
*  So therefore, yes, if I interpret the question as saying, does it matter that you give people
*  choice about which bargain to accept, yes, it does matter a lot because they know what
*  their preferences are.
*  In the case of me doing it with my future selves in the multiverse, then I am doing
*  it, and so that's okay.
*  So I don't think that any of the future selves would have any right to complain.
*  That's the bottom line, right?
*  As long as I'm making the choice now, there's 100 future selves who have to live with the
*  consequences, none of them has a right to complain.
*  And it's exactly the same with the 100 real ones in the multiverse versus a 1% chance
*  of a hypothetical one in a single universe with truly stochastic choices.
*  Okay, Eric Dovighi says, the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
*  How much longer will Earth-like planets and thus the possibility of Earth-like life be
*  able to form?
*  If it is a very long time, isn't it remarkable to find ourselves alive at such an early stage
*  of the universe?
*  In other words, does the Copernican principle apply to where we are in the timeline of the
*  universe or doesn't it?
*  So I think the Copernican principle is pretty much nonsense, to be honest.
*  Let's say that.
*  I did a whole podcast episode about the philosophy of the multiverse where I talked about this
*  a little bit.
*  But I think there are good questions to ask about this because in exactly this case, it's
*  a very good question, by the way.
*  So how do we think about the Copernican principle, which says we're not special in the cosmos?
*  Does that mean that every year of the history of the universe is created equal?
*  Or does it mean every person in the history of the universe is created equal?
*  I personally mean some very accepting notion that smart aliens count or whatever.
*  What if they have a collective intelligence, though?
*  So there's a trillion organisms, but they only have one intelligence.
*  Do they only count once or do they count a trillion times?
*  It's a little ill-defined.
*  It's more than a little ill-defined.
*  It's utterly ill-defined.
*  But putting that on the side, I just want to get that off my chest, but then try to
*  answer the question.
*  I believe, and I'm not, despite appearances, really a professional astronomer, but my recollection
*  is most stars that will ever form in the history of the universe have already formed.
*  I think maybe that's accurate, but I think the more accurate thing to say is the peak
*  era of star formation is in the past, not the future.
*  I mean, it's possible because there's an integral here, right?
*  So it's possible that the rate of star formation has peaked, but nevertheless, it will putter
*  along at some low rate for a very, very low time and we'll still get more stars in the
*  future.
*  So I'm not sure about that.
*  But the point is that, to answer the impression that you have, that it's a very long time
*  in which Earth-like planets are going to be able to form, probably not.
*  We don't think that that is true.
*  We don't think that the universe is 13.8 billion years old.
*  We don't think that Earth-like planets are going to be forming at this kind of rate that
*  they have been for the next 100 or 1,000 billion years.
*  That's not what we think.
*  The universe is slowing down quite dramatically.
*  Now from some purely physics-based perspective, there's no reason to think that the universe
*  won't just keep expanding forever.
*  And the fact that we're in the first 13.8 billion years of its life is very, very short,
*  right?
*  It's very, very early in the history of the universe.
*  Not early in the history of star formation, but that's hard to take into account, as I
*  just said.
*  So I think it's maybe a little bit strong to say that it's remarkable.
*  There certainly is plenty of opportunity to have had intelligent life already form.
*  In some sense, I think you could make the argument that we're pretty late in the likely
*  to form life stage of the universe's history.
*  And this is part of the problem behind the Fermi paradox, right?
*  Why haven't we met other intelligent aliens?
*  Five billion years after the universe formed, I think that it would have been plenty of
*  opportunity to have intelligent life come along.
*  And we're more than eight billion years after that.
*  So that is something to think about.
*  So I think all these things are things to think about.
*  I think the mistake would be to decide ahead of time that you know what the distribution
*  should be and think that it's remarkable that the reality doesn't fit it.
*  I think that it's more sensible just to keep in mind how much we don't know about these
*  questions and to note how different things could have been.
*  So it is true that it's 13.8 billion years after the beginning of the universe or after
*  the Big Bang anyway.
*  So could life have started earlier?
*  Could it start later?
*  Under what conditions could it have started?
*  Those kinds of things it is worth looking at rather than just saying, well, we started
*  13.8 billion years after the Big Bang.
*  So that's a natural thing for it to be.
*  I don't think it's at all natural.
*  Our single data point is not enough for us to draw those conclusions.
*  Sorry, I don't know how to pronounce that.
*  It says, since I learned how contingent inflationary models are on supersymmetry, it's been curious
*  not to see much concern as the LHC results have eliminated the most likely models of
*  supersymmetry.
*  What can you say about the relationship between the two theories and what do you expect to
*  happen to inflation if supersymmetry is wrong?
*  Well, I don't actually think it's true that inflationary models are very contingent on
*  supersymmetry.
*  To be honest, I've not kept up in the most recent wrinkles of explorations of the space
*  of possible inflationary models.
*  So maybe the conventional wisdom has shifted a little bit.
*  There is the following set of true facts.
*  When you look at the perturbations in the cosmic microwave background that are temperature
*  anisotropies that grew into density perturbations in galaxies and clusters and so forth, they're
*  pretty small, right?
*  It's one part variation in the microwave background per 100,000, so 10 to the minus 5 fluctuation.
*  If you believe that those fluctuations came from inflation, you can translate that small
*  amount of perturbation into statements about the shape and the slope of the inflationary
*  potential.
*  Also, by the way, in order to solve the traditional fine-tuning problems of the early universe,
*  inflation has to persist for a long time.
*  If you think that the usual way to quantify it is think about e-folds of expansion.
*  You have the expansion parameter, the scale parameter of the universe, the scale factor
*  a of t, and every time it gets multiplied by the number e, 2.71, et cetera, you call
*  that an e-fold.
*  So e squared multiplies it by e squared, et cetera.
*  Two e-folds multiplied by e squared.
*  To do the job that inflation is supposed to do, you need 60 e-folds of inflation.
*  The idea that inflation would happen at all is actually pretty easy, pretty robust, easy
*  to implement in a particle physics model.
*  But the natural amount of e-folds for inflation to go on, there's two possible natural numbers.
*  One e-fold, it happens a little bit and then it ends, or infinity e-folds.
*  You just get stuck inflating forever.
*  To get 60 and then to stop is hard.
*  And you need the slope of the potential to be very shallow in order to get the right
*  density perturbations that we see in the microwave background.
*  So together, these two facts say that even though inflation is supposed to help us understand
*  the fine-tuning of other early universe things, the inflationary potential itself does have
*  to be fine-tuned in the sense that – not fine-tuned for the existence of life, but
*  there needs to be some small numbers in there that could have been of order one.
*  They need to be much smaller than one.
*  And Alan Guth, who invented inflation or invented the most popular versions of it, is very clear
*  about this.
*  It's quantifying exactly how fine-tuned it has to be.
*  And supersymmetry is good at allowing small numbers to be small numbers, at allowing small
*  numbers to survive the effects of quantum corrections, etc.
*  I personally think that this whole discussion we have about naturalness and fine-tuning
*  is a little bit sloppy.
*  And not that we shouldn't do it, but I don't think we do it well enough or careful enough.
*  So I don't want to say exactly what I think about those things.
*  But it is natural to imagine that supersymmetry plays a role in explaining why the inflaton
*  potential has the special properties that it does.
*  But it doesn't need to be.
*  You can just do it without supersymmetry anyway.
*  As far as I know – and again, not an expert on the most recent wrinkles here – as far
*  as I know, this is completely unaffected by the fact that we have not seen supersymmetry
*  at the Large Hadron Collider.
*  There is something that is very strongly affected by that, which is the hierarchy problem.
*  The hierarchy problem in particle physics is the idea that those same quantum corrections
*  that you would expect to be relevant for the inflaton potential, you also expect to be
*  relevant for the potential of the Higgs boson, which breaks the electroweak symmetry.
*  And therefore you expect the mass of the Higgs boson and the expectation value of the Higgs
*  boson to be pretty big numbers, because they're driven up by quantum corrections.
*  But they're not very big numbers.
*  They're very small compared to the Planck scale or the Grand Inification scale or whatever.
*  That's the hierarchy problem.
*  And that was really what was purportedly going to be solved by discovering broken supersymmetry
*  near the electroweak scale, or something that would do the same job as broken supersymmetry.
*  And maybe we will.
*  Maybe we will tomorrow, you know.
*  But we could have by now and we didn't.
*  So a lot of the parameter space has been ruled out.
*  And it very easily could have happened that you turn on the LHC and next week you've
*  seen supersymmetric particles all over the place.
*  That didn't happen.
*  So that is a puzzle, OK?
*  What is the – our favorite explanations for the hierarchy problem didn't work.
*  We need better ones or we need to rethink whether it's a problem at all.
*  We need to do some thinking.
*  That's OK.
*  That's why they pay us the big bucks.
*  We need to do some thinking.
*  But that – in order to be relevant to the hierarchy problem, supersymmetry needed to
*  be broken and needed to be broken near the electroweak scale.
*  That's not really the same for inflation.
*  You could have supersymmetry broken at a much higher scale and still way up high at the
*  inflation scale, it's still unbroken and still important.
*  So I don't – so maybe not finding supersymmetry in the LHC has decreased your credence in
*  supersymmetry overall.
*  That's perfectly fair.
*  But it's not directly relevant to the question of inflation in a way that it's directly
*  relevant to the hierarchy problem.
*  OK.
*  I'm going to group two questions together.
*  One is from Charles Hertz who says, I'm having trouble understanding the concept of a spinning
*  black hole.
*  This is sponsored – prompted by the conversation we had with Andy Strominger in the beginning
*  of January.
*  And then, Michael Kramer says, what does it mean to speak of a body, in particular a black
*  hole, spinning at or faster than the speed of light?
*  So two questions here.
*  The connection should be obvious.
*  What is spinning black hole and what does it mean to be spinning at or faster than the
*  speed of light?
*  So these are perfectly legitimate questions.
*  And it's just an example of physicists talking a little bit sloppily.
*  But they talk a little bit sloppily for good reasons because the concepts that they're
*  are very mathematically, physically well defined but are not in the realm of language that
*  we would think of having developed over the past several thousand years when we invented
*  language, right?
*  We don't have the words to describe these things.
*  So can a black hole spin?
*  Because a black hole, after all, forget about the stuff from which the black hole was made.
*  The black hole is created.
*  A bunch of matter falls in or whatever.
*  And then you make a black hole.
*  But after that happens, the black hole itself is nothing more or less than a region of space
*  time.
*  It's not a thing with stuff, with matter.
*  The black hole right up to the event horizon and even past the event horizon can be essentially
*  empty space time.
*  There's nothing there other than space time itself.
*  So to ask what it means for a black hole to be spinning is perfectly 100% fair.
*  What does it mean?
*  Well, it means that the black hole has angular momentum.
*  That's really what it means.
*  And how is that possible that a region of space time has angular momentum?
*  Well, and actually this is going to go to a question we're going to talk about later on also.
*  But there's two things going on when we talk about space time.
*  We talk about space time and its curvature and things like that.
*  But then again, we're being sloppy because there is space time in the sense of a set of locations,
*  right?
*  A set of points in space time or events as we call them, located in space at a moment in time.
*  And then there is the metric tensor field.
*  If you want to read more about the metric tensor field, I can recommend to you my new book,
*  The Biggest Ideas in the Universe, Space Time in Motion, where we talk about it in great detail.
*  It is the metric tensor field that defines the geometry of space time.
*  So there's space time and then it has something.
*  It has a particular field, the metric tensor field, from which we can calculate its geometry.
*  And so the thing that has angular momentum is really the value of the metric tensor field.
*  And that by itself seems a little weird.
*  How can a field have angular momentum or be spinning?
*  A field has a value at every location in space, but this is a very common thing, right?
*  Magnetic fields can have angular momentum, electromagnetic fields.
*  So the fact that the metric can also shouldn't surprise you.
*  And operationally what it means is, if you start with a spinning star and it collapses to a black hole
*  and you do it in such a way that it doesn't spit out any matter to the outside world,
*  the angular momentum that the star had will be the same as the angular momentum that we calculate
*  in the metric tensor defining the black hole.
*  So that's really what we mean by a spinning black hole.
*  When we say spinning black hole, we mean the configuration of the metric tensor
*  that defines the curvature of space-time is associated with a certain angular momentum.
*  And that association, that angular momentum, has physical effects.
*  For one thing, it changes the shape of the black hole.
*  A non-spinning black hole is perfectly spherical, the Schwarzschild solution to general relativity.
*  The spinning solution, what is called the Kerr metric to general relativity, is oblate,
*  just like the earth is a little bit oblate because it's spinning, likewise the black holes are.
*  So it has a very well-defined north pole, south pole equator kind of thing.
*  And it affects the motion of particles as they fall in.
*  If you fall into a black hole, again, that is stationary, you can fall in more or less in any direction, right?
*  Like you can fall in just straight down, but you can also fall in spiraling to the left or spiraling to the right.
*  Not true for a spinning black hole.
*  When a spin pulls you around, or really, again, to be slightly more precise about it,
*  what the metric does is it changes the geometry of space-time,
*  and that includes the light cones of space-time.
*  That includes what the local definition of what it means to be moving slower than the speed of light.
*  So in general relativity, when space-time can be curved,
*  at every point in space-time there is something called what it would mean to move slower than the speed of light.
*  So a set of trajectories you could possibly travel into the future.
*  To travel in a space-like direction from that point in space-time would mean to move faster than the speed of light.
*  You're not allowed to do that.
*  And that's true at every point in space-time, but then globally you need to knit these together.
*  At every point there might be a different notion of what it means to move forward in time, stay inside your light cone.
*  And what happens in the case of a spinning black hole is that from the perspective of someone outside,
*  the light cones are tilting in such a way that if you're moving slower than the speed of light,
*  it looks like you are being dragged around.
*  So if you have a spinning black hole and you drop an object into it,
*  it doesn't fall straight on through.
*  It starts following the direction of spin of the black hole and spirals in before it actually enters.
*  Now, nothing goes faster than the speed of light, so there's no spinning faster than the speed of light.
*  That's not allowed.
*  But there are what are called extremal black holes that essentially,
*  in this understanding that I just tried to explain, are spinning at the speed of light.
*  We don't think that they can exist in the physical world, extremal black holes,
*  but mathematically we can write them down.
*  So I wouldn't worry about them too much, but they're a good little mathematical playground
*  for theoretical physicists.
*  Paul Cronin asks, if space-time is emergent, what could it be emergent from?
*  Would love your gut feeling on this.
*  So I kind of want to unask this question.
*  I do that occasionally, maybe more than occasionally,
*  because I mean, I think by the structure of the question it's pretty clear,
*  it presumes there is something from which the space-time is emergent.
*  And I know why you would get that impression,
*  because the classic examples we have of emergence are something like
*  treating the air in the room as a fluid, obeying the fluid equations,
*  rather than treating it as a set of atoms and molecules that have individual positions in momenta.
*  In some very real sense, in that case,
*  the fluid description is emerging from the atomic description.
*  So just parenthetically, let me say this,
*  the word emergent is not a good word for this,
*  in part because the word emergence has some connotations of a process happening in time.
*  The thing was one way and it emerged into something else or something emerged from it,
*  like a chick emerges from its shell when it gets born.
*  That's not what's going on.
*  The emergent description of the air in the room as a fluid
*  is not something that didn't exist in the past and now exists,
*  it always existed for all intents and purposes for us.
*  It simultaneously exists.
*  We still have the way of describing the atoms and molecules,
*  but we also have the way of describing the air as a fluid.
*  So it's not emergent in time.
*  But the other thing is these examples are very clear examples
*  where there's one thing that we know and love
*  and its emergent description is a different thing that we know and love
*  and that might not be the case for space-time.
*  I could give the glib answer that it emerges from the quantum wave function.
*  That's the answer.
*  But there's not a thing, there's not a stuff, not a substance,
*  not a known familiar kind of thing that I could point my finger at
*  like, oh, strings or atoms or bits or, I don't know,
*  brotherhood and sisterhood from which space-time emerges.
*  All it means is that the fundamental description of nature
*  is a quantum state, a wave function evolving in time
*  according to the Schrodinger equation,
*  and there is some higher level description of that,
*  some coarse-grained description that looks like space-time
*  obeying the Einstein equations.
*  That's very analogous to, there is a microscopic description
*  of atoms and molecules pumping into each other,
*  and there's an emergent higher level coarse-grained description
*  as fluid mechanics.
*  That's what it means, but there's nothing that space-time is emergent from
*  other than the quantum wave function.
*  And if you want to ask what that is, it's the quantum wave function.
*  It's the best way we currently have of describing all of reality.
*  There you go.
*  Stuart Haynes says,
*  Yeah, I'm from the East Coast, right?
*  I was born in the suburbs of Philadelphia,
*  spent eight years in Boston, in college and postdoc, et cetera,
*  so this is not a culture shock to me.
*  And honestly, like, I want to be a little contrarian about these questions
*  and say that there are differences between the East Coast and the West Coast,
*  but they're much, much tinier than the similarities.
*  And I think that's a good point.
*  I think that's a good point.
*  I mean, people say, oh, yeah, it's so different in that other country.
*  What always strikes me about going to other countries
*  is how similar things are, the same basic way of doing things.
*  You know, you always have your convenience stores
*  and your subways or your cars or your farms or whatever.
*  Like, the same basic structures of human life
*  are not completely universal but very, very common, OK?
*  The East Coast and West Coast aren't that different.
*  I think they kind of like each other,
*  but they're very, very similar.
*  The East Coast and West Coast aren't that different.
*  I think they kind of like to exaggerate their differences a little bit.
*  There are differences.
*  I mean, Caltech is a very unique place
*  among institutions of higher education and research,
*  so there are differences from Caltech to other places.
*  You know, having been at various other universities,
*  including MIT, which I think to the people on the outside
*  probably they're going to think it's similar to Caltech,
*  in various ways, for good and bad, OK?
*  You know, I've had parents and high school kids
*  ask me about going to Caltech for undergrad
*  and I have to tell them it depends very, very, very strongly
*  on who you are and what you want.
*  Caltech is perfect for some people
*  and not so good for many people,
*  so you have to be right for it.
*  And, you know, in many ways, it was not right for me.
*  That's one of the reasons why I left.
*  You know, as good as it is,
*  the thing that Caltech is good at
*  is creating a space for brilliant creative people to go,
*  especially sort of science and techie people,
*  to go and do their research in their area.
*  It's really, really good at that.
*  And, you know, already, like, the increased bureaucracy
*  at Johns Hopkins is getting to me.
*  And Caltech is just so easy to get things done
*  compared to other places.
*  Whereas at most universities, including Hopkins,
*  you have to get, like, permission from certain people,
*  et cetera, et cetera.
*  So, but there's something missing there.
*  There's not a lot of talking back and forth
*  between people in different fields.
*  There's not a sense at Caltech that we are a university, right?
*  I mean, it is a university in every realistic sense,
*  but it's very dedicated to science and technology
*  and math and engineering and those kinds of things.
*  It's not trying to be more comprehensive.
*  There are humanists and social scientists there at Caltech,
*  but there's such a tiny minority
*  that they're just not very important
*  to the life of the institute.
*  Whereas, you know, here at Johns Hopkins,
*  there's a lot of different departments.
*  You know, I already have more people I socialize with
*  on the faculty at Johns Hopkins,
*  having been here six months,
*  than I did at 16 years of being at Caltech.
*  I'm invited to be doing a whole bunch of different things.
*  I'm involved with the Humanities Institute
*  and the Democracy Institute,
*  you know, and a whole bunch of things
*  that didn't even exist at Caltech.
*  So there's a big cultural difference
*  between those two institutions.
*  Hopkins makes it a lot easier to be interdisciplinary,
*  to talk to people, to think outside of a box
*  in different ways than Caltech encourages you
*  to think outside of the box.
*  West Coast, you know, Baltimore versus LA,
*  yes, those are two very different cities.
*  LA, just very, very car culture centered.
*  You know, I know that this is a cliche,
*  but it is so true.
*  Every restaurant has valet parking.
*  There's, you know, parking lots everywhere.
*  There are car washes everywhere.
*  It's hard to get a decent California quality car wash
*  here in Baltimore, I gotta say.
*  But, you know, the people in Baltimore,
*  this is the thing, and this is very, very honest.
*  I'm not just trying to shine you on here.
*  But the single most surprising thing
*  is how nice people are in Baltimore.
*  Maybe this is because it's, you know,
*  right at a sweet spot on the edge of the Northeast
*  and the Southeast of the United States.
*  It gets a little bit of both kinds of sides of the culture.
*  But people are just really helpful, polite.
*  You know, we moved a new house,
*  people who did our floors and, you know,
*  delivered our things and did our moving
*  and the people who serve you in restaurants, et cetera.
*  Everyone is really nice.
*  It's very, very surprising and very, very pleasant.
*  So I really like that aspect of it.
*  Not to say there aren't nice people in Los Angeles, too,
*  but Los Angeles is full of strivers trying to get ahead.
*  And they look at you and judge you
*  to see whether or not you can help them get ahead.
*  And they measure you on that scale very, very quickly
*  and that can get a little tiresome at times.
*  Tyler Ogarek says,
*  what are your thoughts on the current length of PhD programs?
*  Back in the day, I hear that folks could reliably get out
*  in about four years,
*  but that number has been creeping up and up.
*  For example, my school's average time to PhD
*  just hit 5.7 years.
*  I'm a little suspicious that it was ever four years.
*  This is a number that the length it takes to get a PhD,
*  length of time, varies a lot from field to field.
*  You know, in humanities, it generally takes
*  substantially longer than in science.
*  But my impression within physics and related sciences
*  is always that the aspiration was five years.
*  That's how long it takes to get a PhD.
*  In the United States, in different systems,
*  in the UK, it can be three years.
*  But there's again pluses and minuses there.
*  In the UK, you go and you start doing research
*  and you're expected to know what you're doing.
*  In the US, very often the first two years are mostly
*  you're still taking classes and learning things
*  and deciding what you want to do.
*  And I kind of like that system better,
*  to be perfectly honest,
*  but there are definitely pluses and minuses there.
*  I took five years.
*  Most people I know took five years.
*  Occasionally, someone would take six.
*  Very occasionally, longer than that.
*  But if you start taking more than six,
*  people begin to look at you a little weird.
*  I know that Princeton sort of started just,
*  you would show up and you wouldn't have any funding
*  if you took too long.
*  But I think it depends a lot on the school.
*  So I don't even know if it's creeping up and up.
*  I don't think it's a big deal,
*  honestly, one way or the other.
*  I don't think that there's certainly,
*  I certainly don't think that professors
*  are trying to keep students around longer
*  or anything like that.
*  Of course, I might have a very narrow view there
*  because in theoretical physics,
*  you don't have a big laboratory.
*  You can't just plug people in.
*  As an advisor of PhD students,
*  there is a give and take.
*  Especially in their early years,
*  you are putting a lot more time into them
*  than they are giving back to you
*  in terms of useful research.
*  In later years, they're giving back to you
*  a lot more in useful research
*  than you're putting into them if all is going well.
*  Whereas in a more experimental,
*  lab-based area,
*  the graduate student can learn enough
*  to be useful in a lab very quickly.
*  And this is maybe even true in some areas of physics,
*  but certainly in biology and chemistry.
*  So there is in those areas
*  maybe more of a feeling like
*  the good grad students are useful.
*  We want to keep them around.
*  But I have no personal evidence of that
*  or anything like that.
*  So I think the issue is post-docs, honestly.
*  The amount of time we take
*  being a post-doctoral scholar,
*  that's an issue that is weird
*  and we have to face it.
*  We're asking people to spend too much time as post-docs.
*  That's what I would worry about,
*  not the PhD programs.
*  T.O. Alexander says,
*  if it is true that the Higgs field
*  is responsible for mass,
*  and if it is true that mass is responsible
*  for the curvature of space-time,
*  then why is there the necessity for a gravity particle
*  since all objects are simply in free fall
*  when no outside forces are present?
*  Well, so I know that
*  I edit these questions because some of them,
*  man, you just write very long.
*  And this is not you, T.O., but I just
*  edit for things I don't think are crucial.
*  But I think that T.O. did disclaim
*  the non-expert question, which is fine.
*  I absolutely love and encourage
*  the non-expert questions.
*  I encourage them more than the
*  hyper-expert technical questions
*  because for those, you can just go
*  somewhere on core or whatever to get
*  those kinds of answers.
*  Anyway, let me say two things.
*  It is not true that the Higgs field
*  is responsible for mass.
*  And it is not true that mass is responsible
*  for the curvature of space-time.
*  Both statements are close,
*  but they have some relationship to the truth.
*  They're not blatant falsehoods.
*  But it's an example where
*  there are oversimplifications
*  that get you into trouble
*  when you think about them too hard.
*  So, for one thing,
*  there's zero sense in which
*  the Higgs field is somehow necessary
*  for the idea of mass
*  to exist.
*  Protons and neutrons,
*  which are the particles that make up
*  most of your mass as a human being,
*  get most of their mass
*  from quantum chromodynamics,
*  from the strong nuclear force.
*  Nothing to do with the Higgs field at all.
*  The Higgs field doesn't need to be there
*  for things to have mass.
*  Mass in relativity
*  is simply the energy
*  of an object that is stationary,
*  that is not moving.
*  It's the intrinsic energy
*  that an object has just by existing.
*  That's what mass is.
*  Mass is rest energy divided
*  by C squared,
*  to quote a famous equation.
*  So, it turns out
*  that in the standard model of particle physics,
*  most of the elementary particles,
*  the quarks, the leptons,
*  and the W and Z bosons,
*  they have symmetries
*  that, if it weren't for the Higgs,
*  would keep their mass zero.
*  So, when we say
*  the Higgs boson,
*  the Higgs field,
*  gets an expectation value,
*  breaks that symmetry,
*  allows them to get mass,
*  and gives it to them.
*  So, the Higgs field is responsible
*  for the mass
*  of certain elementary particles
*  in the standard model of particle physics.
*  That is a much narrower
*  and more constrained statement
*  than the Higgs field is responsible for mass.
*  So, your electron
*  needs the Higgs field to get its mass,
*  but the proton doesn't.
*  There's some contribution
*  to the mass of the proton
*  from the Higgs, because
*  the up and down quarks get their mass
*  from the Higgs field, but
*  the up and down quarks are a tiny fraction
*  of the total mass of the proton.
*  So, the Higgs field is not exactly
*  responsible for mass.
*  It's a more specialized relationship.
*  And then you say, mass is responsible
*  for the curvature of spacetime.
*  Again, not quite true.
*  The energy-momentum tensor,
*  and other things, by the way,
*  in general relativity,
*  energy is unified
*  in relativity with
*  mass, but also
*  momentum and heat and pressure
*  and all of those things.
*  And they all contribute
*  to the curvature of spacetime.
*  And their contribution
*  does not define
*  the curvature of spacetime, because
*  even when there is no mass or energy
*  or anything, spacetime can still be
*  curved. You can have a gravitational
*  wave propagating through empty space.
*  So, it's
*  just not true that knowing energy-momentum
*  is enough to know the curvature
*  of spacetime. You need to specify that
*  in some independent way, and as we already
*  talked about, the way to do that is through the metric
*  tensor. All of this is explained
*  in the book that I already told you to read,
*  the biggest ideas in the universe, so I encourage
*  you to check that out.
*  Jason Richiardi says,
*  Since quantum computing is based
*  on quantum mechanics, have you ever
*  learned to code in Qiskit
*  or another quantum computing language
*  or is it a part of your job in any way?
*  General impressions about the field
*  and its direction are much appreciated.
*  Short answer, no. I had never even heard
*  of Qiskit before your question. I googled it.
*  So, I did not ask
*  Chet GPT about it.
*  But no, I've never used that. But I effectively
*  have. I have
*  written down quantum
*  algorithms. So, at my level
*  of being a theorist, and I've taught
*  the very, very basics of quantum computing,
*  what I would be doing
*  is sort of the quantum computing equivalent of
*  assembly language, of literally
*  stringing together gates,
*  not gates and end gates
*  and things like that. At the quantum level, the quantum
*  version of those things, that's what I know
*  how to do, to make a very simple quantum algorithm
*  out of a collection of gates.
*  And you can do this, by the way,
*  and I occasionally mention this, but I just like
*  to keep mentioning, there's something called the
*  IBM Quantum Experience,
*  which is a working quantum computer
*  that you can go
*  and get an account and
*  write a little algorithm and run it on the quantum
*  computer. Now, that's less
*  impressive than it sounds because there's
*  only a few qubits. I forget how many there are.
*  Ten? I don't know. I'm making that number
*  up, but a very small number. You're not going to crack
*  any RSA encryption or anything like that
*  or solve the travelling salesman problem.
*  But you can practice.
*  And in fact, it's such a small number of
*  qubits that because we understand quantum
*  mechanics in the Schrodinger equation, you could
*  easily run
*  that quantum algorithm on a classical
*  computer much faster than you
*  can run it on the quantum computer. So
*  at the IBM Quantum Experience,
*  it will literally allow you to test your
*  algorithm by running it classically
*  before you run it quantum mechanically.
*  And when you do run it quantum mechanically,
*  either you get the same answer
*  as you did in the classical version or you made a
*  mistake somewhere. Okay?
*  So the reason to run it
*  on actual qubits is just for the thrill
*  of knowing that you ran it on actual qubits,
*  not for any result that's going to come out
*  of the algorithm. But anyway, that's the level
*  I will do it at. There's
*  no reason for me in my professional
*  life to program a quantum
*  computer. I'm interested in the foundations
*  of quantum mechanics, not in
*  solving particular, well-defined
*  calculations
*  that a quantum computer would be useful
*  for. That could always change.
*  Who knows? You know, that's the great thing about being
*  a theoretical physicist. What I'm doing five years from
*  now might be unrelated, so I might have
*  to learn QQiskit
*  or, you know, QuantumPython
*  or whatever it is that exists out
*  there in the future.
*  Okay, I realized belatedly
*  that I actually have more questions
*  that are related to the Laura Buczak
*  podcast, which is great,
*  by the way. I love it when questions
*  have to do with recent or
*  older podcasts. I like
*  the idea that there are ideas and questions bubbling
*  along in our minds. So there are
*  three questions here that
*  I'm going to group two of them together, and
*  then I'm just going to ask the third one separately.
*  I forget why I did this, but
*  we'll see if it works. So the first is from
*  Jeffrey Seagal, who says,
*  Your conversation with Laura Buczak about many worlds
*  and whether future Sean Carrolls are the same or different
*  inspired me to wonder about
*  how differences accumulate
*  between the present me and one particular point.
*  Oh yeah, I
*  I'm sorry, this is me talking to myself.
*  These two questions that I'm grouping together
*  have nothing to do with the Laura Buczak
*  conversation. Jeffrey's question was inspired
*  by it, but they're very different questions.
*  So I'm grouping together two questions
*  here. It's about many worlds.
*  They're not about that particular podcast.
*  So
*  inspired me to wonder about
*  how differences accumulated between the present
*  me and one particular point of Hilbert space
*  and the future me that evolves from that point.
*  You've noted before that quantum phenomena
*  have extremely small likelihood of affecting
*  human scale events unless, as you noted,
*  a quantum random number generator is used
*  to make decisions. Therefore,
*  if I do not use a quantum random
*  number generator, the wave function that represents
*  my behavior may remain very tight.
*  My decisions are driven by
*  macroscale phenomena such as neuronal
*  membrane potentials, and those
*  are in theory highly predictable and not affected
*  by quantum phenomena. I'm assuming
*  that quantum tunneling or the various radioactive
*  decays in my body are also extremely
*  unlikely to actually affect the firing
*  of even one neuron. Has anyone
*  estimated how long on average it might take
*  before there is a change in my
*  external behavior due to
*  internal quantum variations?
*  The other question is from
*  Josh Charles who says,
*  while I was considering how many quantum branching events
*  happen to my own body, I was struck
*  by the notion that the vast majority of those
*  events do not make any difference to the
*  macrostate of my body. And even
*  if it made a difference in my body, it would
*  not make a difference to the moon
*  or to Jupiter or the Andromeda Galaxy.
*  It seems like the vast majority of quantum events
*  would not be consequential in
*  large-scale considerations. Are all
*  multiverses actually pretty much the same?
*  Is there an example of a quantum event that can
*  domino up to measurable macrostate changes?
*  So both questions have to do
*  with the idea that there is a
*  pretty good classical approximation
*  to quantum mechanics
*  and to a very, very, very good
*  approximation. We can think about the world in
*  which we live macroscopically
*  as obeying the rules of classical
*  mechanics plus maybe some
*  random tiny events.
*  And then the question is can we quantify
*  the effect of these random tiny events
*  on the classical
*  behavior that does
*  most of the work? So it
*  depends. The answer is it depends
*  and I actually am not going to be able to give you any
*  or many quantitative insight
*  here. But let me tell you
*  how to think about these issues.
*  If you're thinking about something like the earth
*  going around the sun,
*  quantum perturbations have
*  zero impact there
*  or essentially zero impact. You have such a big
*  object moving in such a predictable
*  classical way
*  that quantum fluctuations are not that big.
*  But the reason why I bring up
*  that example is because even
*  within just the realm of
*  large astrophysical objects
*  there are well-known examples
*  where quantum fluctuations do matter.
*  And I've talked about this before but the classic
*  example is Hyperion, which is a moon
*  of Saturn.
*  Hyperion is
*  a moon now but of course like many
*  of these moons it was an asteroid that was captured
*  so it's a lumpy thing.
*  It's not a spherical thing. It looks like a
*  potato. And
*  astronomers have calculated when they
*  look at the shape of the lumpiness of
*  Hyperion that it
*  tumbles in a way that
*  is technically
*  fits into the definition of chaotic
*  behavior. That is to say
*  the different ways in which Hyperion
*  tumbles have the feature
*  that a small variation
*  in its initial position and orientation
*  and speed leads to a large change
*  in the orientation later on.
*  So when that
*  kind of behavior is present at the classical
*  level, when there is classical
*  chaotic behavior then guess
*  what? A tiny variation
*  is really important.
*  Even a variation that is small enough just to be
*  due to quantum effects.
*  So Wojciech Zurek, who is a pioneer
*  of decoherence and
*  pointer states in quantum mechanics and things like that
*  wrote a famous article, I think in physics today
*  where he points out
*  that he ran the numbers
*  and Hyperion is chaotic
*  enough that
*  if you just leave it alone for a short period of
*  time when you look back at it
*  you should not see a potato
*  by the rules of quantum mechanics you should see just a
*  big smooth blob of wave function.
*  Now you don't,
*  of course you don't. Why not?
*  Well because Hyperion is not alone in the universe
*  it is constantly being
*  monitored by the environment.
*  Sunlight, cosmic microwave
*  background, little micro particles
*  etc. Like anything else in the
*  universe it interacts with its environment
*  and it decoheres.
*  So there are different branches of the wave function
*  of the universe which are almost the same
*  in many many ways except
*  that the moon Hyperion is in slightly
*  different orientations
*  in all of these different branches of the wave function.
*  Okay, so it can happen
*  but what you really want to know about is
*  human beings, right?
*  Well there's another very famous way
*  in which a tiny quantum fluctuation
*  or perturbation can
*  grow up and be amplified
*  to macroscopic behavior.
*  Well there's two famous ways, one is which you just
*  listen to a Geiger counter, right?
*  And if you're reacting in any way
*  then that's going to be different
*  in different branches of the wave function.
*  But the other one is
*  mutations, right?
*  As evolution happens and you
*  pass on your genome from generation
*  to generation and there
*  is not just sexual selection mixing up
*  moms and dads, genomes, but there's also
*  mutations.
*  Mutations are associated with quantum
*  events and so any given
*  mutation happens in some branches
*  of the wave function and not in other branches of the wave
*  function. So the history of
*  humankind to the extent that it
*  depends on the history of the evolution
*  of our species is very
*  very different in
*  different branches of the wave function if you go
*  all the way back to things that
*  might have affected evolutionary history.
*  Now if you want to zoom in on
*  the life of one person
*  the simple answer is
*  I don't know.
*  The quantitative question is
*  if you start with a single person and their wave
*  function and just propagate it forward
*  in time and don't let them
*  make important life decisions based on quantum
*  random number generators or anything like that
*  will their future, let's say
*  five years in the future
*  will their lives be very different on different branches
*  of the wave function? That is a quantitative
*  question that I don't know the
*  answer to because it's like the Hyperion
*  question. You had to run the numbers
*  to figure out just classically
*  how sensitive is the behavior
*  to small perturbations.
*  If you knew that
*  then you could figure out how small the
*  actual perturbations were made by quantum
*  mechanics and then you could
*  figure out the average difference
*  between one life and another. But I don't know
*  either one of those. I don't know either
*  how sensitive human behavior is to these small
*  variations nor do I really know
*  how big the variations are
*  just due to different quantum measurements
*  being made or different decoherence or branching events.
*  So I'm open to
*  the possibility that it is important
*  but I don't know that it's important. It might very well
*  not be.
*  David Maxwell says
*  this is the other question
*  that does actually have something to do with Laura Buczak's
*  podcast.
*  In your great conversation with Laura Buczak you explored
*  your own risk aversion and concluded
*  that it might have implications for your
*  stance on the moral significance of many worlds.
*  You noted you do need to think about
*  it further. It was one of those moments so great
*  about interdisciplinary chats and I could hear
*  the excitement in your voice.
*  Has this conversation had any effect on your
*  priors or your philosophical position?
*  So yeah let me give a little bit of
*  the background to that.
*  It could be interesting and important. I just don't know.
*  Be very honest. I'm swamped
*  with other things right now.
*  One of which is doing this
*  AMA. But I love doing the AMA.
*  Don't take that the wrong way. But there's a lot of things going on.
*  I haven't had real time for
*  doing research
*  in the past few months. I did come out
*  I did finally submit a paper the
*  other day in case you're interested on
*  reality realism is what I called it.
*  It was
*  remember the conversation I had with
*  Justin Clark Doane on morality
*  and mathematics. Justin is a philosopher
*  at Columbia who's an expert
*  in both meta ethics
*  and also the philosophy of math
*  and he draws parallels but also
*  distinctions between them. And in his
*  little book Morality of Mathematics
*  he actually starts by quoting me
*  and I was a little bit surprised to see that
*  but he quotes me in the big picture
*  talking about
*  moral realism
*  and the fact that I'm not a believer in it.
*  I'm not a moral realist but I am a realist
*  about the physical world. And Justin in
*  his book says but someone
*  like Carol would have to be a mathematical
*  realist in order to like do math
*  about the standard model of particle physics
*  and things like that. But interestingly
*  that's actually not what I believe.
*  I'm not a mathematical realist.
*  I'm also not an expert so I
*  try to be very humble about this.
*  Maybe I should be a mathematical realist.
*  I've listened to people give their sales
*  pitch and they're not convincing.
*  Jody Azuni was the other person who I talked
*  to on the podcast who is
*  not a mathematical realist. He's a good example
*  of what we call a nominalist in the philosophy
*  of mathematics which is closer to my
*  position. Anyway the point is
*  I wrote up a paper saying why I think you can be
*  not a mathematical realist and yet
*  a physical realist. And that's the only real
*  research publication I've had in the past
*  12 months but I'm hoping that this upcoming
*  year will be better. So maybe there's
*  a future publication here. I don't know.
*  But here's the point to get back to David's
*  question.
*  I have had this thought
*  that for realistic
*  versions of
*  moral philosophy
*  many worlds and
*  theories where you have a single world
*  with true randomness, with true quantum
*  randomness. In other words when you measure
*  that spin on the particle and you say it's 50-50
*  imagine a theory where there
*  really is only one world but we just don't know
*  which one it's going to be. It's going to be one where the spin is up
*  or the spin is down.
*  And my position has been
*  that for realistic moral theories there is
*  no difference in how you should
*  behave in
*  many worlds versus a stochastic
*  single world theory. Here was my
*  reasoning for that.
*  Think about realistic moral theories. Think about
*  utilitarianism. Think about
*  deontology, virtue ethics, whatever it is.
*  Things like deontology and virtue ethics
*  which say either obey rules
*  or be virtuous. Those are exactly
*  the same no matter what your theory of quantum mechanics is.
*  So there's no danger, there's no temptation
*  to think maybe they should be different in many worlds.
*  Utilitarianism
*  is a little bit trickier so you have to
*  think harder. I talk about this in something
*  deeply hidden if you're interested.
*  The very naive thing
*  that you might say is
*  well I want to maximize the amount
*  of utility in the world.
*  If I have two universes
*  that are more or less the same
*  that is twice the utility of just one
*  universe with the same situation
*  in it. So therefore the
*  way to maximize utility is just to make
*  the most universes I can to branch the wave
*  function of the universe. Now that's
*  just dumb, that's just silly. And so I do
*  explain in something deeply hidden why that's
*  silly and why what you really should do
*  is weight your utility
*  calculation by the wave function
*  squared just like you calculate probabilities.
*  And if you do that then in the standard
*  expectation value calculation
*  that you do in utilitarianism
*  you know in utilitarianism
*  you try to maximize utility but you admit
*  that you might not know
*  what the consequences are going to be
*  so you have different probabilities
*  for different outcomes and you calculate
*  the expected utility.
*  That's very very well known kind of thing.
*  My point was just that that's
*  the same calculation that you would do
*  in many worlds as you would do in the
*  stochastic single world.
*  I did in something deeply hidden
*  say look you can
*  come up with silly
*  moral theories
*  that would have a difference
*  between many worlds and a single world
*  version of quantum mechanics.
*  And the one I came up with I don't remember it exactly
*  it's been a while but the point of it
*  was the following. Imagine
*  that you really
*  had a moral aversion
*  to inequality.
*  To actually existing inequality
*  that your moral philosophy whatever it was
*  was maximized
*  said to
*  maximize the amount to which
*  everyone's situation is the same.
*  Everyone in the multiverse's situation is the same.
*  In that case
*  imagine the following thought experiment
*  you're given a quantum
*  spin to measure, spin up or spin down
*  and you're given a bargain
*  by a wealthy slightly
*  crazy philanthropist who says
*  pick some group of people
*  if the spin is up I will give them
*  all $10. If the spin is down
*  I will give them all $20.
*  Now
*  if your goal is
*  to maximize
*  equality
*  to minimize inequality
*  but then within that
*  constraint you want to maximize the amount
*  of wealth and happiness everyone has
*  if there was just a single
*  world with
*  probabilistic quantum events
*  you would accept that bargain
*  there's a 50% chance everyone gets
*  $10, 50% chance everyone
*  gets $20 but either way
*  everyone gets the same amount of money
*  whereas
*  if you thought that many worlds was
*  right then there is a world
*  in which everyone gets $10
*  and a world in which everyone gets $20
*  and you might feel
*  that's unequal
*  right because everyone knows what
*  this experiment is
*  what the bargain is from the philanthropist ahead of time
*  the people in the $10 world
*  are going to know there are other people
*  who really exist in the $20 world
*  and they're going to be sad because of that
*  now I don't think that's a good
*  moral philosophy but I did want to
*  acknowledge the fact that
*  in principle you could
*  invent moral theories which
*  differentiate between them
*  it's a very long prolegomena to saying
*  that what Laura was talking
*  about opens
*  the possibility
*  of a
*  more realistic moral theory
*  that does differentiate
*  between many worlds and
*  single world theories
*  because and I'm not going to get it exactly
*  right again because I haven't thought about it
*  very deeply but the idea would be
*  that if you're not just maximizing utility
*  but you're taking risk aversion
*  into consideration
*  then maybe
*  you could imagine
*  a reasonable moral theory
*  which distinguished
*  between a
*  10% chance of something
*  happening and a 90% chance of it not
*  happening versus
*  it really happens to 10%
*  of the people and really doesn't happen
*  to 90% of the people
*  in that latter case there's a 100% chance
*  that it happens to someone
*  in the former case there isn't
*  and that might be something you want to differentiate
*  between so it's actually like not that different
*  in spirit than the crazy example
*  I came up with in the book but you know it's
*  a little bit much more
*  reasonable as a moral theory
*  so I would like to think about that more whether or not
*  one can come up what is the most
*  reasonable plausible
*  defensible moral theory that one can come
*  up with for which it matters
*  to you whether the fundamental ontology
*  of the world is single world plus
*  randomness versus
*  let's see
*  Joshua Everett
*  Hedgepath says
*  a priority question
*  I've always been somewhat confused about what it means
*  to branch
*  when a world branches into two or more is the realm of
*  thought that there is one more world
*  than there used to be in the quantum cosmos
*  or rather there already are
*  two distinct worlds before the branch
*  but before the branch one state of the world
*  the state of each world
*  was identical
*  they are labeled as one world so this is a question
*  I've addressed before and the answer is
*  it depends
*  I don't know whether to say it depends
*  on your choices or I just don't know
*  the right answer so
*  the question is is it okay
*  when worlds do branch
*  is it okay to think of them as already
*  having been separate worlds
*  even before they branched even though
*  they were separate they were
*  identical is it okay to think of them that
*  way my impression
*  is it is not okay to think of them
*  that way because before
*  they differentiate and decoher
*  things can happen that can
*  involve interference
*  that's what makes a world
*  a world is that what happens in that
*  world cannot affect what happens
*  in other worlds okay
*  and I don't think that's true before
*  the decoherence and the branching happens
*  in the conventional way of thinking it which is why
*  the way I prefer to think of it is
*  there is one world
*  and then it branches and there are many worlds
*  I think that's a perfectly legitimate way
*  to think about it there are benefits
*  to trying to think about it the other way
*  the most obvious benefit is
*  it makes it a little bit more plausible
*  how we calculate probabilities
*  we calculate probabilities
*  by weighting things by the wave function squared
*  and if you can
*  always subdivide
*  branches into worlds
*  then that is literally counting
*  the maximum number of worlds you can
*  subdivide into because that's just the dimensionality
*  of Hilbert space and so
*  if you tell someone your probability calculation
*  is literally just counting things
*  they're more persuaded
*  than if you say it's a weighting
*  of a Bayesian credence in a state of self-locating
*  uncertainty I know this empirically they're more
*  likely to be persuaded but I'm not sure if it
*  works I do know there are people who take it very
*  seriously I believe that David Deutsch
*  is someone who thinks and talks that way
*  and I haven't thought about it very deeply
*  because I don't care that much I've always
*  been of the opinion that worlds
*  are convenient
*  higher level human constructions
*  that are very convenient
*  but they're very obvious when they happen
*  when the branching happens and what happens
*  in more subtle cases just doesn't bother me
*  that much different people are welcome to do
*  different things as far as I'm concerned
*  Ghost Composer
*  says I just bought the biggest ideas
*  in the universe space time and motion
*  I plan to work through this book very slowly
*  but you have a rough estimate of when you might
*  finish books two and three of your trilogy
*  I don't exactly
*  but I think that the rule of thumb
*  should be between a year
*  and a year and a half between books
*  I am working to finish book two
*  but it's not yet finished and
*  I'm beginning to think that it's not going to be out
*  this September since I should be
*  done it already if that were going to be the case
*  so I'm thinking whatever it is
*  later than this September
*  Tyroon says it seems to me
*  that determinism emerges at a
*  macroscopic level
*  this is why we can send rockets to the moon
*  how do I reconcile this with your statement that
*  we simply do not live in a deterministic world
*  given quantum mechanics
*  even if determinism is just an approximation
*  it seems to be so accurate that we can ignore
*  any uncertainty at the human scale
*  well we talked about this a little bit above
*  but I think it depends on what you mean
*  we certainly can't ignore any
*  uncertainty at the human scale
*  if the uncertainties are big
*  then we can't ignore them the uncertainties are certainly
*  noticeable listening to a Geiger counter
*  is an obvious
*  example and so
*  it depends on the purposes for which
*  you want to model whatever you're thinking
*  about
*  the only statement that I would make absolutely
*  is that the world in which
*  we live
*  behaves non-deterministically
*  that is just the lesson of quantum mechanics
*  can't get around that it may very
*  well be that certain subsets
*  of the world have deterministic
*  approximations to them
*  and you can ignore it
*  for whatever purposes you
*  for some specific purpose that you want
*  but whenever you make approximations
*  what you can ignore and cannot will depend
*  on those purposes you have to be
*  explicit
*  Clyde Schechter says regarding your blog
*  what is it about the universe that you
*  find preposterous so
*  the website that I have is called
*  preposterousuniverse.com in fact
*  I think that people don't always know this but there is
*  a website web page for the
*  podcast preposterousuniverse.com
*  slash podcast where you can listen
*  to all the podcasts and get
*  all of the show notes and links and things
*  like that so I encourage you to visit that from time
*  to time even if when you're listening
*  to podcasts you're not always in front
*  of a computer or anything like that
*  the name
*  preposterousuniverse.com
*  came from way back in the day when I was thinking very
*  hard about dark energy
*  and we had discovered
*  that 70% of the universe is dark energy
*  and there is something called the coincidence
*  problem as well as the cosmological
*  constant problem the cosmological constant problem
*  is just why is the vacuum
*  energy so much smaller than you might
*  expect it to be the coincidence
*  problem is why is the amount
*  of vacuum energy or dark energy
*  of the same order of magnitude
*  as the amount of matter in the
*  universe and that's especially weird
*  because these two things change
*  with respect to each other as the universe
*  expands right now there's
*  two or three times as much dark energy as
*  matter but there used to be a lot more matter
*  than dark energy and so why
*  are we so lucky to live at exactly
*  the right time before we had discovered the
*  dark energy these
*  weirdnesses were very good reasons
*  and I think perfectly respectable reasons
*  even though they turned out to be wrong to
*  suspect that the cosmological constant
*  would be set to be exactly zero
*  by some as yet unknown
*  mechanism that we
*  haven't yet figured out so
*  the preposterousness of the universe
*  is just that we have measured these
*  parameters of the universe and not only that there's
*  also other things like the hierarchy problem and
*  inflation that we talked about before
*  features of the universe that
*  seem very different than what we would
*  expect given what we know about other
*  features of the universe
*  now of course it's a joke
*  the universe is the universe it's
*  not allowed to be preposterous or weird or
*  unnatural or anything like that it is
*  what sets our expectations as well as
*  lives up to them or otherwise
*  but in the real world
*  our expectations are set by some subset
*  of everything that happens in the universe
*  and so whenever
*  there's something that seems unnatural to us
*  we're making a mistake
*  it's not a criticism of the
*  universe when I say the preposterous universe
*  it's a reminder that there is something that we
*  don't yet understand and so we're
*  working to understand it better
*  anonymous says
*  ontological question about many worlds
*  does many worlds say anything about the realness
*  of probabilities before
*  decoherence specifically
*  when probabilities might
*  destructively interfere and never get
*  to branch into a world
*  I'm sorry
*  but it's a slightly
*  too fuzzy question for me to answer accurately
*  but I'll try to sort of talk around it and maybe hit
*  on what is going on
*  in my way of thinking about
*  many worlds
*  before there's decoherence and branching
*  there's nothing to be
*  probabilistic about
*  what the probabilities are
*  are the probabilities of which branch we're on
*  in the circumstances when we don't know
*  the self locating uncertainty
*  once decoherence happens
*  I don't know whether I'm the spin up branch
*  the spin down branch or whatever
*  now before
*  it is certainly true that before we do the measurement
*  we talk about a probability
*  and this again is because we invented all
*  these words before we knew the physics or the
*  philosophy behind what was going on
*  so what we experience
*  as real human beings in the world
*  is I'm going to measure
*  the spin, it's going to be spin up or spin
*  down, I can't predict
*  exactly what it will be
*  but what I can do is
*  judge the probability
*  that it will be spin up or spin down
*  so I talk as
*  if there is a unique
*  event that will happen and there's a probability
*  of that event happening
*  according to many worlds that's not what
*  is really going on
*  every event happens just in different worlds
*  and the probability means something
*  different but it turns out
*  that none of that philosophical difference
*  changes the way that we talk
*  about or use the probabilities
*  so we stick with the same kind
*  of language so the way
*  that I think about it is I know
*  even though right now I know the exact
*  wave function of the universe let's say
*  the exact wave function of the spin that I have in front of me
*  and I know exactly
*  what's going to happen to it
*  and I know there are going to be two of me
*  in the future so in some sense
*  everything is deterministic
*  I also know that both of those copies
*  of me will have self locating
*  uncertainty because they don't know which branch
*  they're on when the decoherence happens
*  so I know that all
*  of my future selves will be uncertain
*  there is a sensible
*  rational way for all of them to assign
*  credences to the different possibilities
*  and therefore it makes sense for me
*  to act as if
*  and speak as if there is a probability
*  an objective probability
*  of something coming true or not
*  even though that's not what's really going on
*  that is a perfectly good way to talk
*  and that turns out to work
*  Rue Phillips says
*  if you and Jennifer were able to live
*  as you do now without aging or getting
*  sick and you could choose
*  how long you could live before you pass on
*  how many years do you think would be interesting
*  and why? Another 50, 100, 1000 years
*  until the earth is destroyed or until humans
*  are no more? It's a good
*  question, I mean it's not a great
*  question because this is very very
*  counterfactual, we're not going to live any of those
*  numbers of years. We could live
*  50 I guess, right?
*  100 seems unlikely but medical science
*  could advance
*  but I certainly think I could live way longer
*  than any of those, well
*  any of 50 or 100, let's put it that way
*  100, 1000? Yes, I think very strongly
*  that I could live at least 1000 years
*  and still keep things interesting
*  until the earth is destroyed or humans are
*  no more, I don't know how long those are going
*  to be. My
*  puny half a century
*  old self now has
*  trouble imagining what I would be
*  doing a million years from now that would be
*  interesting but maybe in the next
*  few 100,000 years I will come up with things
*  to keep things interesting so I really
*  just don't know. I mean
*  if I had to pick
*  now how long I would live
*  it would certainly be
*  I don't know, well
*  here's the extra problem that I have, I don't know
*  what's happening to the rest of the world in this scenario
*  like if there's an apocalypse or
*  you know, I'm past
*  the devastation of the earth and I'm the only living
*  being, it's a lot less fun
*  than if there's a more or less flourishing civilization
*  I'm part of
*  but assuming there is a more or less flourishing
*  civilization I can easily imagine
*  thousands or tens of thousands of years
*  of interest personally
*  Justin Wolcott says
*  do you think the benefits of
*  consuming more than 30 minutes of
*  news per day outweigh the
*  downsides? Then he goes on to list some
*  of what he thinks are the downside
*  you know I think this is actually a
*  really good question because it's
*  true that in the modern world
*  we are deluged with
*  news or the ability to
*  catch up on all sorts of news
*  and all sorts of places
*  and there is some feeling
*  that you have an obligation
*  to know what is going on in various
*  corners of the world but no one
*  that I've seen has ever
*  really set out the specifics
*  of what that obligation is or
*  where it comes from. I do think that
*  I want to be informed about
*  various things in the world but
*  you can't be informed about everything
*  right so there's clearly a choice being made
*  there's too much going on in the world to know everything
*  we need to know the name of every person
*  and their personal situation right
*  we coarse grain a little bit
*  so we're going to know maybe what goes on in a
*  country even if we don't know any of the people
*  in that country and
*  I don't know we live
*  in a world where
*  well we live in a society here in the United States
*  where the way that we govern our
*  country is by representative
*  democracy we're supposed to
*  vote for people who then
*  run the government and even those people
*  vote for even though it's their full time job
*  to make and implement policy
*  they don't know everything that's going on everywhere
*  in the world they have staff members
*  to help them decide what to do on
*  difficult issues so I
*  do think there's a case to be made that we are
*  sort of over informed
*  about some things just
*  in the sense that we can fret about
*  them and feel bad about them without having any
*  power to do anything over them
*  at the same time it's very clear
*  that some people many people
*  are under informed about
*  very important issues of the day
*  so I would feel very guilty going on some
*  campaign to think that we should
*  know less about what is going on in the
*  outside world certainly here in the USA
*  the typical person is not
*  very well informed about what is going on
*  outside the USA
*  especially in countries that don't speak English
*  etc. so I don't know
*  it depends on whether you mean
*  personal benefits or
*  societal benefits I think
*  I think that as far as personal benefits are concerned
*  you could easily make the case
*  that individual human beings
*  would be better off
*  not spending too much time
*  following the news right
*  but there is some social obligation to be a good citizen
*  also so I'm in favor of knowing
*  just enough so I guess what I'm saying is
*  I think this is a good and important question
*  and I don't know of anyone who's done
*  a systematic answer to it so I can't give
*  you mine
*  Kyle Stevens says I've seen a lot of
*  top physics articles and videos recently
*  postulating that we live inside of a black hole
*  the idea itself seems reasonable
*  at first take but what would we look
*  for to confirm whether this is true or not
*  to our observations of the world align with this
*  hypothesis so I like this
*  question because it's very easy to answer
*  no we don't live inside
*  a black hole it is not reasonable
*  there are no observations that align with this
*  hypothesis I can't
*  absolutely rule it out
*  but let me both say what
*  the right way to think about the answer
*  is and then the wrong way that some people
*  sometimes do what is a
*  black hole so a black hole is a region
*  of space time with the property
*  that if you cross into
*  it then you're going to hit a
*  singularity in the future rather
*  than ever being able to escape you're not
*  going to be able to escape without going faster than the speed
*  of light that's what a black hole is
*  is that does
*  that sound anything like our universe at all
*  no we have no
*  evidence that there's going to be a singularity in our
*  future and we have no
*  evidence that there is anything called the
*  outside right as far as
*  we can see the universe looks more
*  or less the same even to the limits of our
*  ability to look at it so it
*  doesn't look like it's embedded in some
*  larger empty space that we could
*  hypothetically imagine escaping to
*  so for both of those reasons
*  those are the two properties of a
*  black hole you can't escape to the outside
*  world and there is an outside world to escape
*  to neither one of those applies
*  to our universe so why would
*  anyone think that this was
*  a sensible thing to say that we live inside
*  a black hole well I think at least
*  half of it is it sounds kind of cool and
*  provocative right and people are going to get clicks
*  by saying those kinds of things
*  there is a better reason than that still not a very
*  good reason and here's the better reason
*  there are various proofs going back to Penrose
*  and Hawking and Geroche and
*  others that say that if you get
*  enough energy into
*  one place of the universe
*  then there needs to be
*  because of the gravitational attraction
*  a singularity either in the
*  future of that
*  region of space time or in the past
*  now of course they had to say
*  either the future or in the past
*  because the equations of general relativity
*  are not do not
*  pick out a direction of time they're perfectly
*  time reversal invariant so there's no theorem
*  that says that if
*  you just get enough energy in a region of the universe
*  it will collapse in the future to a singularity
*  because that would be weirdly picking out the
*  future rather than the past okay
*  so either one is possible
*  but a black hole
*  does pick out a direction of time
*  a black hole is a
*  region of space time into which you
*  can go but from
*  which you cannot escape as you personally
*  are moving into the future
*  so a black hole is a particular
*  solution to the equations of general
*  relativity that has a time ordering
*  that has a direction of time
*  but the theorem doesn't have
*  a direction of time so what's
*  going on well what's going on
*  is our universe if you plug
*  in the numbers comes pretty close
*  you can argue about the details of the margins
*  but it comes pretty close to satisfying
*  this criterion that says
*  there's enough energy to
*  have a singularity that's not
*  surprising because guess what we had a singularity
*  in the past called the big
*  bang at least that's the prediction
*  of classical general relativity where all of this discussion
*  is more or less taking place
*  so but that's not a
*  black hole in the black hole
*  singularity is in the future
*  and you're surrounded by empty space
*  so there's some place to escape from
*  in our universe there's no empty space that
*  we're surrounded by that we know of
*  and the singularity is in the past
*  if anything our
*  universe is like a white hole
*  a white hole is the time reverse of a black hole
*  and it has a singularity in the past
*  which you can escape it's not exactly
*  the same as a white hole because as far as
*  we know there's no outside world
*  to which we can escape right
*  but it's much much closer than that conceptually
*  than a black hole so there's literally
*  no reason to actually
*  if you understand what's going on
*  say that our universe is like a black hole
*  alright I cannot pronounce this person's name
*  Liam Impton
*  says from an epistemological
*  perspective do you see any obvious
*  ceiling for the current wave of AI research
*  or is it time to acknowledge
*  this may well be a defining moment
*  for the history of our species
*  you know I presume there's some ceiling
*  but I don't think that what you mean is
*  is the ceiling like any moment now are we being tricked
*  into thinking that there's a rapid
*  rate of progress right now but it's actually
*  going to slow down very quickly
*  I think that you know like
*  we tend to see progress as
*  something that has a rate when we look back on it
*  historically from a remove
*  real progress is very non-linear
*  right poking around
*  very slowly for a while and then there's a leap forward
*  as I said way at the beginning of the podcast
*  I think that things like
*  the current AI programs
*  that are getting a lot of publicity are both super
*  duper impressive in many
*  ways and very different than what came before
*  and also not
*  what we're kind of ultimately
*  looking for in terms of actual
*  intelligence in the world
*  in the phrase artificial intelligence
*  I think this is what people are not
*  this is what I don't see
*  people really wrapping
*  their brains around which is that
*  there is this whole set of things
*  that we're calling artificially intelligent
*  that aren't like
*  intelligence really in any
*  noticeable way but that doesn't
*  mean they're uninteresting or unimportant
*  what is actually doable
*  might end up being very
*  very different than what we set out originally
*  to do that doesn't mean it's
*  not interesting or important
*  I don't know whether the current
*  wave of AI research is going to end up being
*  a defining moment for the history of the species
*  I do think that these
*  AI advances are very important
*  and will play a large role and they're not done
*  yet that is my not
*  super duper expert opinion
*  Sean Coram says
*  if there is something like five times
*  more dark matter than regular matter
*  why do the effects of dark matter only show up
*  at galactic scales or larger
*  why doesn't the more prevalent dark matter
*  have effects in the solar system such that it needs to be
*  taken into account when calculating the orbits
*  of the planets or space probe trajectories
*  so there is a simple answer
*  there which is that dark matter
*  has different physics
*  than ordinary matter and what I mean by that is
*  the physics of dark matter particles
*  interacting with each other
*  ordinary particles have this
*  thing called electric charge
*  which is very important and
*  the reason why it's very important is because
*  the field that carries
*  the force associated with electric charge
*  the electromagnetic field
*  is a massless field it leads to
*  massless particles called photons
*  and the reason why that is important
*  why is the masslessness so important
*  it's because when two particles
*  come together to interact
*  like an electron and a proton
*  or two electrons or whatever
*  they can emit a tiny tiny
*  amount of energy in the form
*  of a very very low energy photon
*  if you think about the role
*  the relationship between mass and energy
*  E equals mc squared
*  is telling you the rest energy
*  of a particle and that's basically
*  the least amount of energy
*  it can possibly have if you want to
*  make an electron you need
*  at least mc squared
*  of energy where m is the mass of the electron
*  if you want to make a photon
*  the photons energy
*  is not mc squared photons are
*  massless photons have nothing but kinetic
*  energy they still have energy
*  but the minimum energy of a photon is
*  zero you can go all the way down
*  and that's because it's
*  massless and so when you have a
*  force that is coupled to some
*  charge like electric charge and that is mediated
*  by a massless particle
*  you can change the momenta
*  and the energies of the particles
*  with the charge by arbitrarily
*  finely
*  chosen amounts by emitting
*  just a little energy in the form of a photon
*  and what that means is
*  when different particles come together
*  they can dissipate
*  they can hit each other and then lose energy
*  by emitting some photons
*  and that makes them stick together
*  two dark matter particles
*  which as far as we know don't couple
*  to anything like electric charge
*  certainly don't couple to electric charge
*  do they couple to some analogue
*  of electric charge that was a paper that I wrote
*  with Mark Hamienkowski and others
*  dark electromagnetism
*  as a possibility
*  that's an open possibility but
*  the coupling would be very small
*  so it probably wouldn't be noticeable otherwise
*  we would have noticed it so for all intents
*  and purposes dark matter particles
*  are like billiard balls
*  okay maybe they bump into each other
*  maybe they don't but billiard balls are
*  small so the probability
*  that they bump into each other is very very very
*  tiny so for the most part when
*  you get a cloud of dark matter particles they just
*  pass right through each other they don't clump
*  they don't make larger
*  objects like the sun or the earth
*  the whole solar system
*  the whole history of the solar system is the history of
*  a cloud of gas shrinking
*  by giving off light
*  by giving off radiation by losing
*  energy to the rest of the world and therefore
*  condensing into planets
*  and objects dark matter can't do
*  that so there's lots of dark matter in the galaxy
*  there's some dark matter in the solar system
*  but a very very tiny amount
*  compared to the density of matter
*  the density of matter that we have in ordinary matter
*  and for that reason you don't need to take it into account
*  when you're thinking about orbits
*  of planets or anything like that
*  Douglas D. Young says
*  I've been told that the event horizon of super massive
*  black hole is not a special place for an
*  observer freely falling straight in
*  why then can't I bring a small black hole
*  with me is there something preventing a black hole
*  within another black hole
*  no I don't know who's been giving you
*  advice about carrying black holes into other black
*  holes but there is no problem whatsoever
*  in carrying a small black hole into a bigger one
*  I'm not sure why you would want to do that
*  but then it would
*  simultaneously be the case that
*  the small black hole inside the bigger one
*  had the property that anything that
*  entered its event horizon could not escape
*  to the
*  the surrounding area that counted as the
*  big black hole and the stuff
*  within the region of the big black hole could
*  not escape to the outside world both of those can be
*  true at the same time
*  Andrew Goldstein says to what
*  extent do you think an artificial intelligence
*  algorithm could be programmed to
*  propose unanticipated life forms
*  consistent with Stuart Bartlett's term
*  Leuf i.e. dissipates
*  energy performs self sustaining
*  chemical reactions to reproduce maintains
*  internal conditions and uses information about
*  its environment to survive
*  Andrew's referring to the podcast
*  he was Stuart Bartlett about the fact that
*  life as we know it has different aspects
*  and we can imagine hypothetical organisms
*  that have some of those aspects and not
*  others I had no trouble
*  whatsoever imagining that we
*  can create
*  in a computer
*  or nudge a computer itself to
*  creating unanticipated life forms
*  I'm not even sure if we need artificial intelligence
*  algorithms so maybe
*  that would be useful but I think this is a
*  good place to
*  be careful about what
*  is the point of invoking artificial intelligence
*  in a question like this
*  so we certainly have examples already
*  of what are called
*  and we can put evolution on a computer
*  we can imagine situations
*  that we have things
*  that we call organisms that have traits
*  and those organisms interact
*  with each other and they mutate
*  and they evolve etc. we can do
*  all that on a computer I don't know if you would call it
*  artificial intelligence at all but something
*  like that could very easily
*  have some of the aspects of life
*  as we know it and not others so I don't think
*  we've done as much of those
*  kind of simulations as we might but I do think
*  that's an interesting thing to consider
*  Sandro Stucchi says
*  in your recent episode with Andrew Stominger
*  he said the number of gigabytes of information
*  that a black hole can store is
*  proportional to its area
*  and that is very very strange because the number of gigabytes
*  you could put on your phone is proportional
*  to the volume in your phone
*  but that analogy seems problematic
*  the density of mass in my phone is low
*  the space inside it is barely curved
*  and the volume is a good proxy for the number of particles
*  you can fit inside it as is its mass
*  so what am I missing?
*  well I think that you know it's fair enough
*  because you are catching
*  physicists
*  Andy Stominger happens to be the one in
*  consideration right here
*  but there's many people who do this
*  they're being a little sloppy okay
*  really the point that is trying to be made
*  here is that
*  there is no known system
*  in ordinary physics where
*  it's really true that even though
*  it has both an area and a volume
*  the number of
*  bits of information that we could imagine
*  putting inside it scales
*  like the area of the boundary rather than
*  the volume
*  it's not supposed to be implied
*  by that that we had a good reason
*  to think that
*  inside black holes their entropy should go
*  like their volume what's really being
*  alluded to in a very indirect way
*  is that when you have a box of gas
*  when you have an ordinary thermodynamic system
*  at maximum entropy
*  the entropy is proportional to the volume
*  so when gravity is not important
*  entropy is proportional to volume
*  in equilibrium
*  black holes are in equilibrium
*  their entropy is not proportional to their volume
*  what is going on?
*  that's really the question being asked
*  it's not supposed to be that there is some
*  really reliable calculation that would have
*  made it proportional to the volume
*  we just don't know but the fact that it's so very
*  different than the volume is maybe
*  we can go back to the rocket hip
*  Domas says
*  I apologize if people are hearing a buzzing in the background
*  I live in a city now
*  there are machines outside the house
*  sorry about that
*  Domas says in the podcast with Rafael Busso
*  you had an interesting discussion on black holes
*  and their challenges on this topic I wanted to ask you
*  how much of those problems could be solved
*  if we had a black hole nearby
*  and we could send a probe there to cross the event horizon
*  would that be very exciting and groundbreaking
*  or wouldn't it tell us much?
*  we don't know
*  if we knew then we wouldn't need to do the experiment
*  but I could see it
*  happening either way
*  I could certainly see if you had a black hole nearby
*  learning a lot from
*  studying it
*  but we have very good predictions
*  for what you should see near a black hole
*  so I also imagine
*  that it's very very possible you could have a
*  black hole and all we would learn
*  is that our predictions are right
*  all we would learn is that classical general relativity
*  does a good job
*  in accounting for the space time
*  outside a black hole
*  that would not tell us
*  about the extra questions we have about quantum
*  black holes and how information gets out
*  and things like that so there's no guarantee
*  that you would learn very much
*  if
*  the space time around the black hole that we had
*  deviated from the prediction
*  of general relativity
*  that would be enormously interesting
*  and informative probably that's not what
*  I would expect but it's absolutely
*  something that's on the table
*  Matt says
*  on earth gravity makes things fall to the ground
*  but in space gravity mostly seems
*  to make things orbit around each other
*  will Andromeda and the Milky Way eventually
*  orbit around each other
*  I don't think it's right
*  to say that on earth
*  gravity mostly make things fall to the ground
*  and space orbit around each other
*  gravity is exactly the same
*  in both conditions what's different
*  in both conditions is the set
*  of possibilities
*  that you are familiar with
*  okay
*  on the earth near the surface
*  of the earth there is an escape velocity
*  and if you threw an object with that
*  escape velocity or greater it would
*  leave the surface of the earth it would not fall to the
*  ground okay but that escape velocity
*  is really really high compared to
*  your ordinary experience
*  of the velocities that you know and love
*  so what you happen to be familiar
*  with are things falling
*  to the ground the other important
*  thing to keep in mind is that the earth itself
*  is not only a source of gravity but it's a big
*  solid object if the earth
*  were a black hole
*  and you were in a spaceship
*  the same distance from the center
*  of the earth that you
*  are from the center of the earth now
*  on its surface the
*  gravitational pull of the earth
*  would be exactly the same to you
*  because you're the same distance from the same mass
*  okay but
*  the earth would be much much smaller if it were
*  a black hole so you could
*  throw a baseball very easily that would
*  go into orbit it would not hit
*  the earth just because the earth was smaller
*  baseballs fall to the ground and hit the earth
*  because the earth is big so there's
*  nothing about gravity that is special
*  there as far as Andromeda and the Milky
*  Way are concerned guess what they are coming
*  toward each other they are not really orbiting
*  I mean they're kind of orbiting for the moment
*  but eventually they will hit
*  each other and smush
*  together to make one big galaxy
*  it's going to take a while before that happens
*  but that's our ultimate fate
*  Nick B says
*  what contribution do you think professional sports
*  make to the violent rhetoric, polarization
*  and aggression that seems so prevalent
*  in US society?
*  And then he makes an argument that they are related
*  I think they're very very tiny
*  in the relationship and their
*  relationship might even be negative
*  for one thing sports are very common
*  in many other countries
*  not just the United States
*  and it's absolutely true
*  that there are lots of
*  examples of sports
*  being related to violence
*  or aggression right?
*  Soccer hooligans or
*  riots after a championship is won or
*  something like that but I think one
*  could at least as reasonably
*  make the hypothesis that rooting
*  for a sports team gives
*  a channel, an outlet for
*  one's natural aggressiveness
*  or desire to whoop it up
*  etc. So I don't know
*  of any actual data one way
*  or the other whether the existence of sports
*  tends to increase or decrease
*  the amount of real violence
*  in a society. I would not be
*  surprised if it decreased it rather than
*  increased it.
*  Varun Nara Simhachar
*  says you've often talked about
*  Julia Gallif's concept of the scout and
*  soldier mindsets. I think there's a third one we
*  should be aware of the prospector mindset.
*  Like the scout the prospector is also
*  incentivized to seek truth instead of
*  defending a doctrine but unlike the scout
*  the prospector wants exclusivity
*  and precedence in their discoveries.
*  We all know the famously bitter historical
*  contest for intellectual precedence and we
*  modern scientists are no less susceptible.
*  Do you see this as a problem
*  and how do you deal with it?
*  Well I think that
*  there are problematic aspects of it
*  but I don't like the idea that this is a
*  third category that goes
*  in there with scout and soldier.
*  The scout and soldier mindset that Julia Gallif
*  was talking about has to do with
*  do we assume that we
*  know things and we move forward and act
*  on them? That's what the soldier does
*  or do we keep ourselves
*  in a
*  combination of different possible
*  things that we don't know are true
*  go out and try to figure out which is true.
*  That's what the scout does. When you're talking
*  about what you call the prospector
*  you're not talking about the next step.
*  You're not talking about that attitude that we have
*  towards learning new things. You're talking about
*  what we do once we learn new
*  things. Do you want exclusivity and precedence
*  or do you just want to share
*  all of your knowledge widely? So that's a
*  different distinction than scout and mindset.
*  It's not a third concept within that
*  category.
*  Do I see this as a problem and how to deal with it?
*  You know, I don't want to be too
*  wishy washy here but there are clearly
*  beneficial aspects of that and clearly
*  detrimental aspects of that.
*  It's like
*  capitalism.
*  Capitalism also has beneficial
*  aspects and detrimental aspects. The idea
*  of capitalism is supposed to be everyone
*  is being selfish and looking out for their own interests
*  but it ends up helping everybody
*  because everyone's interests sort of
*  settle down to a self-organized
*  well-functioning society.
*  I believe that
*  there are ways in which something like
*  that actually does happen but I also
*  think it's more or less indisputable that there are
*  bad cases sometimes.
*  We'll talk about some
*  in upcoming podcasts.
*  Likewise in science,
*  the fact that people want
*  credit, the fact that people
*  want to get some reward for
*  discovering things, I think
*  pretty obviously increases
*  the chances that things get discovered.
*  It makes people work harder to discover those
*  things. So there are clearly beneficial
*  aspects of that. At the same
*  time there are clearly detrimental aspects because
*  people undermine other people's
*  attempts to learn
*  new things and discover new things.
*  So I kind of don't think that
*  that's the kind of question
*  we should seek a simple answer
*  for. The better question is
*  how do we let people
*  be competitive without
*  letting them hurt each other along the way?
*  That's a hard question and I don't have any simple answers to it.
*  Emmett Francis says,
*  I went back and read through From Eternity
*  to Here and I was struck by the use of extensive
*  numbered notes at the end of the
*  main text. I really enjoy reading through
*  those but sometimes I don't make the
*  effort to when going through a given chapter.
*  Can you speak to the choice to include notes
*  like these versus just incorporating these thoughts
*  into the text or including footnotes when
*  necessary? Yeah, you know, I
*  think that
*  I like in
*  my book writing to try
*  out different things.
*  That was my first trade book. I had
*  written the text book, Space, Time, and Geometry
*  beforehand but that was the first book I wrote for
*  a general audience.
*  What often happens
*  when you're writing your first general audience book is you try
*  to do everything. You try to put as much
*  you don't want to leave things out because
*  who knows if you'll ever write another book.
*  I had a lot to say about
*  the arrow of time and cosmology and
*  relativity and things like that. So I said them all.
*  Part of those
*  were historical digressions and jokes
*  and things like that which I put into
*  footnotes or endnotes
*  I should say, not footnotes.
*  So I thought that footnotes
*  would be distracting in a
*  case like this. I thought that endnotes
*  gave me the freedom to
*  say all sorts of things and I absolutely
*  admit that sometimes
*  the endnotes were not worth
*  going for. Sometimes there were little gems in
*  the endnotes. Other times it
*  was like, ah, I really skipped all the way back
*  to the book just for this. I did fight hard
*  to make sure that the cross
*  referencing worked. Like when you went
*  to the endnotes, it was made clear
*  what page the endnote was
*  on that was being mentioned, etc.
*  So I tried to make it as easy as possible
*  and these days a lot of people read
*  on an electronic device, wherever
*  it is very easy to click on an
*  endnote and go back right away.
*  Nevertheless, I haven't done it that much
*  in subsequent books.
*  I think that
*  in subsequent books it is just seen
*  given the topics and given
*  the style, etc. to be
*  more useful to go straight ahead
*  in a more or less linear narrative.
*  I mean in the
*  biggest ideas in the universe books,
*  the ways in which those books are different
*  is that there are a lot of equations that I'm aiming
*  at a slightly more technical discussion
*  but I have very few footnotes
*  and very few references or anything like
*  that. I'm really trying to, given that
*  the actual text is hard
*  and you really
*  need to concentrate on it, I was trying to strip
*  away any distractions.
*  So I think it depends. I think it depends on
*  what your goal is in writing the book,
*  what audience you're trying to reach,
*  are you trying,
*  there's a lot of postmodern books
*  that are sort of pastiches
*  written in different styles and things like that.
*  Sometimes I indulge in that a little
*  bit in something deeply hidden. We had the
*  dialogue chapter which I thought worked for that
*  particular case. But I think
*  the simple answer is I play around with different
*  things, trying different things as they are
*  appropriate and who knows what will happen
*  in the next book.
*  Brendan K said,
*  While answering a previous AMA question, you said
*  that to simulate the universe would require
*  a computer the size of the universe.
*  But why does a simulated universe have to be rendered
*  in real time? Could a smaller and simpler computer
*  simulate a more complex universe
*  given enough compute time?
*  Sure. I didn't want to be
*  taken too literally when I said the
*  simulated universe requires a computer the size
*  of the universe. I guess the better
*  thing to say is simulating the universe
*  requires an amount of computation
*  equal to the amount of computation
*  being done by the universe, okay,
*  which is very large. If you want to do
*  that computation in some other
*  arrangement, that's fine.
*  Be my guest. It's harder
*  than you might think because
*  the universe interacts
*  with itself, dividing the universe
*  up into separate bits
*  and calculating it one by one
*  and then knitting them together to make
*  the whole universe, especially
*  in a quantum universe where there's entanglement
*  and things like that, could end up being very
*  very difficult. But that wasn't the point I was trying
*  to make. The point I was trying to make was just that
*  there's a lot of computations involved in simulating
*  the universe.
*  Stevie CPW says
*  why is it necessary to reconcile
*  gravity with quantum mechanics?
*  And there's more explanation there that I
*  edited out. So, yeah, this is
*  a common question. I think this is one that I have
*  addressed before in different ways, but let me try
*  in a slightly different way.
*  We get along
*  in various circumstances
*  in physics
*  with treating part of the system
*  we're looking at classically
*  and part quantum mechanically.
*  Like you can often treat a heavy nucleus
*  classically and then the photons
*  that it's interacting with quantum mechanically,
*  for example. There's a semi-classical
*  approximation in quantum
*  electrodynamics.
*  So it is therefore
*  tempting to imagine that maybe the universe
*  just is like that with gravity.
*  The gravity itself is classical.
*  But it can't work that way.
*  It is literally just not possible
*  for it to work that way, at least
*  gravity as we know it, because
*  it's not just that there's an approximation
*  that works pretty well, but that
*  the kind of thing you're dealing
*  with is completely different.
*  It's like saying can you add
*  a real
*  number to a vector?
*  You're just trying to combine two different types
*  of things. It's not like you can do it approximately
*  and call that good enough. It's just an impossible
*  mathematical operation.
*  In general relativity,
*  you have space time
*  and you have a
*  field on space time. And so locations
*  in space are very, very important.
*  In quantum mechanics, you have a wave
*  function. That's a very different
*  kind of thing. What you want
*  to try to do,
*  presumably, is relate
*  that wave function to the energy
*  and matter that goes into curving space
*  time. But the whole point of quantum
*  mechanics is there's not a number called
*  the energy of the system at this point in
*  time. At some point
*  in space and point in time.
*  You can try to measure the
*  energy of a system at some point in space and time
*  and you can predict the likely outcomes you're
*  going to get. But there is no once
*  and for all pre-existing number.
*  So what is the gravitational field
*  supposed to respond
*  to? Maybe you're going to
*  guess it responds to the expectation
*  value, to the average, to the typical
*  energy that you might measure if you were
*  to measure things. But how you measure
*  those things matters a lot.
*  And sometimes you're going to measure something very
*  different, like in the real world.
*  So why does the expectation value
*  matter at all?
*  So there's a fundamental mismatch between
*  gravity and quantum mechanics. We can
*  get away for certain approximate
*  purposes,
*  treating gravity classical and matter
*  as quantum mechanical, but that cannot
*  possibly be the deep final
*  answer.
*  Justin Proctor says,
*  Why can I never think of good
*  questions to ask in these kinds
*  of things that haven't already been asked and answered?
*  I think that's the question. Why can
*  I think of good questions?
*  This is, ironically enough,
*  a very good question.
*  Let me rephrase it as,
*  what does it mean or what does it take to ask
*  a good question? Where do good
*  questions come from?
*  I'm not going to give you the once and all final
*  answer here. I hope you're not disappointed.
*  But I do think
*  we can think about the issue
*  in terms of, in particular,
*  Justin is asking about
*  your thinking.
*  Let's imagine, I'm putting words in Justin's mouth,
*  sorry about that, let's imagine
*  that we listen to the podcast
*  and we're imagining
*  questions we could ask
*  ex post facto after we've listened to the podcast.
*  What does it mean
*  to come up with a good question?
*  I think the important thing here is that
*  people are not empty vessels
*  into which information is poured,
*  whether in the form of a podcast or anything else.
*  People have pre-existing
*  ideas about the universe.
*  When they're listening to something,
*  when you're listening to a talk or when you're reading a paper
*  or whatever, you're trying to reconcile
*  that with what you already
*  know. It might just be as simple
*  as you have a framework for
*  kinds of things that you could be
*  learning and you're just sort of flipping
*  switches to see where this particular
*  presentation fits in.
*  Or you might actually have very specific
*  ideas about the particular topic
*  being talked about and you're trying
*  to see whether or not what is being said
*  or what you're reading
*  agrees with that or disagrees with it.
*  And I think that there's a couple of different
*  ways in which questions
*  could be engendered. One question is
*  I was expecting you to say this
*  and you didn't.
*  Either because there was a hole
*  in my understanding, like from listening
*  to you, I sort of filled in what I thought
*  you were trying to say in a systematic
*  way and I ended up with a gap.
*  I didn't understand how you got from here
*  to here or I was expecting you to explain
*  this thing but you didn't.
*  And that's obviously fruitful grounds
*  for asking questions. Help me
*  fill in my mental map of what it is
*  you are saying. Another
*  question is if there's just a conflict.
*  I think that this is true.
*  You said this other thing and you didn't
*  convince me that my version of it was
*  not the right one. So why did
*  you think your way rather than my way
*  try to convince me of it?
*  None of these are algorithmic.
*  Asking good questions is not something
*  that you could easily
*  write a flow chart that would teach you how to do it
*  if you followed it every time. There's an art form
*  in there.
*  And then the last thing is
*  practice. Everything.
*  The answer, how do I become good at it, is practice.
*  I remember there was a moment in my
*  graduate school career where I
*  just promised myself that I was going to start
*  asking questions in seminars.
*  This was a big step because
*  I often didn't understand what was going on
*  in the seminars and the people who
*  were asking questions all seemed
*  to be like the big names and things
*  like that. It was a little
*  step you had to consciously take.
*  It didn't happen automatically.
*  And also sometimes you ask a question and you realize
*  that was not a very good question to ask.
*  I could have done better than that.
*  So working at it, getting better, is the best
*  advice I can give there.
*  Kevin D is asking
*  about, he says, I'm curious
*  about joining my local physics slash science
*  society, the philosophical society of
*  Washington. However, I'm worried that I'll be
*  a fish out of water there in terms of both my experience
*  in physics and my academic background.
*  My motivation in joining would be just to listen
*  to the occasional talk and learn something new.
*  Do you think I should join or should I
*  look for a more amateur type club?
*  I actually think
*  you should join. In fact, I think I'm giving
*  a talk at the philosophical society of
*  Washington. I seem to have a recollection
*  that I agreed to do that. I can't,
*  I'm too busy now to actually know what I'm doing
*  more than a week in advance. It's not this week
*  that I'm doing it so who knows when
*  but keep a lookout for me on the calendar
*  there. You know, I think that
*  it depends on the society. I'm not very
*  familiar with the philosophical society of
*  Washington but it's generally
*  people who are interested, right? And everyone
*  wants to learn. Like, I'm not an
*  expert in most of the things I talk
*  about on this podcast so I gotta learn.
*  I gotta figure out how to
*  ask questions that get me even closer
*  to learning things.
*  I would hope that anyone
*  who is a member of a society like that
*  is similarly motivated.
*  They want to learn things and so being
*  around people who want to learn things is also
*  a good opportunity for you to learn things,
*  have them share with you. So I would be
*  in favor of it. I wouldn't be worried
*  that it's all full of experts
*  talking at a PhD level.
*  For one thing, there aren't experts
*  in all of the areas
*  that might be interested to a
*  physics slash science society.
*  Even if you're highly trained in one area
*  you're not going to be in another.
*  For another, you know, the experts who are
*  trying to do their job
*  might go to a professional conference or something
*  like that more than a
*  physics slash science society.
*  So I suspect there's going to be a lot of people
*  who are other members who are
*  educated non-experts
*  or, you know, non-credentialed
*  but taught nevertheless
*  by themselves, which it sounds like maybe
*  you'd fit into very well.
*  Gota Ainoval says
*  the polarization of American politics
*  is a worry for the whole world. I wonder
*  if the parliamentary election system
*  used, for example, in many European countries
*  could help. It would mean that the political
*  parties put up lists in each of the states.
*  Each state sends a particular
*  number of representatives to the parliament,
*  Congress, and these representatives are
*  distributed between the parties according to the
*  size of their vote. The experience from
*  the Nordic countries is, I believe,
*  that this generally reduces the power of
*  extremists and gives more power to centrists
*  since they more easily can make coalitions.
*  I think, you know,
*  I don't have a strong
*  opinion one way or the other.
*  I think that if you look at European
*  countries versus the US or whatever,
*  there's clear examples where
*  the US has done well, the Nordic countries have
*  done well, the Southern European countries have done
*  well, and examples where they've all done
*  badly. And I don't know enough of the systematic
*  history to make a final judgment.
*  I think one issue is that
*  it's always easy to see the problems
*  with the current system.
*  It's hard to see what new problems
*  might arise if you change
*  the current system.
*  It's true that the
*  parliamentary voting system might
*  very well make it
*  harder for extremists to have a lot of power.
*  On the other hand, if you get unlucky,
*  you can have two mainstream parties
*  that split the vote and some tiny
*  extremist parties, the one that needs
*  to make a coalition with one of the bigger ones,
*  and therefore you've suddenly given more power
*  to the extremists.
*  And also there was this idea
*  during the founding of the United States
*  of explicitly separating
*  the powers between presidency,
*  judiciary, and the legislature
*  to make it harder for
*  one idea to take over and quickly
*  be implemented
*  amongst a small group of people.
*  The downside of a parliamentary system
*  is that the party in power
*  has a lot of power to get things done.
*  That's also the upside. That's the irony
*  of politics. But you can't
*  have divided government between
*  president and congress. And the original
*  idea of the US
*  founders was that divided government could
*  be good. It could actually reflect
*  the people's inability to choose
*  what to do. Now,
*  or at least the people's
*  incomplete
*  fealty to one side
*  or the other.
*  I think the idea
*  originally was that
*  if you had divided government, if you had
*  congress in the hands of one
*  party and the presidency in the hands of another
*  party, they would have to compromise
*  and work together to do things that were
*  benefiting the common good.
*  In the present situation, that doesn't happen.
*  So I'm completely open
*  to suggestions for
*  ways to work in the real world
*  in a world where the game
*  theory, as we talked about with Ezra Klein
*  years ago, the game theory
*  calculation has been done by
*  politicians, and they are more
*  likely to stay in office
*  by opposing everything the
*  other party does.
*  Whether or not that's the best thing
*  for the country. Having said all
*  of that, I mean, in some sense,
*  it's just us talking here,
*  there's nothing going to be done. There's zero chance
*  the United States is going to have such a dramatic
*  change in its governmental system that will become
*  a parliamentary system. The people
*  who would need to make that happen
*  have a vested interest in not letting it happen.
*  So we
*  should be thinking about, if we want to make things better,
*  more realistic ways to fix
*  things.
*  Paul Cousin says, on the Enquiry
*  of the Minds podcast, I heard Antonio
*  Padilla talking about the weight of
*  information. Say, when you upload
*  a photo to your phone, you're making it ever so
*  slightly heavier. He did not express
*  it as a metaphor, which troubles me. Is that literally
*  true? So I don't know
*  if that's literally true in the case
*  of uploading a photo
*  to your phone.
*  Things like that can be true.
*  But they don't
*  have to be true.
*  So imagine, it's not some
*  strictly speaking law of nature that
*  an information containing collection
*  of particles
*  has more energy than one
*  that does not contain information.
*  Think, for example, of
*  a set of
*  Go pieces, pieces for the
*  game Go. So little white stones or black stones
*  arranged in a lattice.
*  If all the stones are white
*  and there's no
*  pattern there, no information,
*  it weighs a certain amount, has a certain amount of
*  mass. And if you
*  use the white and black stones
*  to write some message so that it does contain
*  information, if it's the same number of stones,
*  it's the same mass. There's no interaction energy
*  between the stones, etc.
*  If it were spins
*  in the lattice of
*  some material,
*  then the spins would interact with each other.
*  And then they might want to
*  they might have lower energy if
*  they're surrounded by all spins that are like
*  themselves. In that case,
*  the attempt to actually put
*  information in would require
*  flipping some spins and therefore raising
*  the energy. That might actually physically
*  be what happens in a camera. I don't
*  even know what the physical way
*  that real world iPhones,
*  etc. capture images are.
*  So there are actually, there absolutely
*  are examples where
*  putting information into a system
*  increases its mass. Now it might be more
*  general than that also, but it might
*  still going to be assumptions in the background
*  about are you in contact
*  with a thermal bath or something
*  like that. So I don't want to discount
*  the idea. There are very, very interesting ideas
*  about the interplay of information
*  and energy and entropy and things
*  like that. But it's a complicated
*  thing to get things exactly right. You have
*  to be very, very specific about what your
*  assumptions are.
*  I guess
*  at the end of the day, I have a little bit
*  of resistance to
*  thinking of information as
*  physical, which is
*  like a motto in some of these subfields.
*  I think that physical stuff is physical
*  and it may or may not
*  contain information. But if
*  you didn't have any physical stuff,
*  then you couldn't carry information.
*  So I think the physical stuff comes
*  first in my way of thinking about the world.
*  Brendan says,
*  Does infinity actually exist
*  in the physical world? I know time and space
*  might be considered infinite, but is there an actual
*  way of us distinguishing between truly
*  infinite and just really big
*  that is just close to infinite?
*  The answer is we don't know.
*  Infinity is a very useful
*  hypothesis
*  in many cases. In many cases, it's easier
*  to do calculus, for example,
*  where you're imagining that there are an infinite
*  number of points along the real line
*  than it is to do discrete math
*  where you divide things up into tiny
*  but finite intervals.
*  So it might be just a convenient approximation,
*  but we don't know. We don't know whether
*  an infinite number of points in space,
*  we don't even know if space is fundamental
*  or emergent, we don't know if space lasts forever.
*  I'm not
*  sure how we would know, other than
*  to be able to say at some
*  future time, not right now, but be able to say
*  thinking about the world
*  using the concept of infinity turns out
*  to be way more useful
*  than thinking about it in some finite or
*  discrete sense. So I think
*  we should keep an open mind about that. We can't demand
*  answers to all the big questions right away.
*  Speaking of which, Johann Lübeck
*  says, is there a relationship
*  between naturalness
*  and emergence?
*  The short answer is no, not that I
*  know of.
*  I'm not even sure what naturalness
*  is.
*  We use the word naturalness a lot in different
*  contexts, but again, you have to be clear
*  about what the context is.
*  So there are specific
*  examples in quantum field theory
*  where you can say that a quantity is natural
*  or not natural, and Gerard de Toift
*  and other people have given very
*  specific definitions of what they
*  mean about that context, but that
*  might not be what you mean in a more general
*  philosophical context about naturalness.
*  If you think of naturalness as just
*  this is something that would not surprise us
*  given our expectations, that
*  is such a broad category
*  that it's hard to know what its relationship
*  would be with anything, much less with
*  emergence.
*  Let me say something that I think is true,
*  but I'm not even 100% sure, but that gets to
*  the issue
*  raised by your question, which is that
*  if we think of emergence as
*  you have some comprehensive
*  microscopic description of a system,
*  whether it's atoms or superstrings or
*  whatever it is, but some low level, fundamental
*  or close to it description,
*  and you also have
*  a higher level coarse grained emergent
*  description, okay? Let's imagine
*  that you have that. Let us ask
*  the question, what
*  are the features of the lower
*  level theory that allow you
*  to have a higher level coarse grained
*  theory? I think the answer
*  is we don't know. I think it's a good question.
*  It's one that I think about at a research level,
*  but I don't have any very strong
*  opinions about what the right answer is.
*  So even if all you do is
*  ask, do most
*  possible microscopic theories
*  have an emergent higher level coarse grained
*  description, or is it very, very rare?
*  I don't even know the answer to that. I suspect
*  it's rare, so I suspect that there is
*  some non-naturalness to the existence
*  of emergent descriptions, but I honestly
*  don't know. I would like to know much more
*  about that.
*  Richard Moore says, in two previous
*  AMAs, a listener asked about lottery
*  election systems. It seems to me that
*  approval voting, in which voters
*  place a check mark next to as many candidates
*  as they wish, and each check mark is counted as
*  one vote for the candidate, removes what I
*  think are the worst aspects of our plurality
*  system. The spoiler effects and the tendency
*  to polarize both the electorate and the
*  candidates. And since it is not a ranked
*  voting system, it is not subject to the limitations
*  imposed by Arrow's impossibility
*  theorem. What do you think of this
*  system? I'm not a big
*  fan of approval voting, although
*  I do get that it has some advantages,
*  especially over plurality voting,
*  which we have right now, but that's
*  not hard, because plurality voting, everyone
*  knows is the worst, except
*  that it's the simplest. That's the only
*  as simple, you go in, you vote for one
*  person, you walk out.
*  That's simple in that sense.
*  In approval voting,
*  you say whether you approve or disapprove
*  of a long list of candidates,
*  you instantly run into the problem
*  that a lot of these names are ones you might
*  never have heard of.
*  Presumably you don't approve
*  of those if you've never heard of the names before,
*  but that might not be perfectly an accurate reflection
*  of what you would think if you did know about them.
*  But the other thing,
*  the bigger reason that I would worry about approval
*  voting is that
*  in my thoughts about this,
*  I've come to appreciate the importance
*  of the intensity of belief.
*  I don't care so much about
*  Arrows Theorem. Arrows Theorem is interesting
*  as a mathematical result,
*  but it's not a practical worry
*  in most cases.
*  What is more important in most cases
*  is the idea that if I just vote for someone
*  or don't vote for them,
*  that's a harsh binary choice.
*  It is not saying,
*  I really, really, really want this person
*  and this person I could take
*  and leave them, and it ends up being
*  the same vote. Do I approve of somebody?
*  Someone who I would go to the mat
*  for and someone who I could barely tolerate
*  might both get my approval.
*  That is information that is thrown away
*  by that kind of voting system.
*  But again, I don't have
*  the final answer. I don't know what the right
*  voting system is, so don't take me too seriously
*  about that. That's just my off the cuff
*  impression in that direction.
*  Mike Meyer says,
*  The temperature of the cosmic microwave background
*  is roughly 2.7 Kelvin in all directions.
*  If I start traveling at relativistic
*  speeds in one direction,
*  would the temperature distribution of the CMB
*  appear anisotropic, hotter in the
*  direction I'm traveling and colder in the opposite
*  direction? Yes, in fact it
*  does, even though we're not moving at relativistic
*  speeds with respect to the microwave background.
*  There is a dipole
*  temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave
*  background that is big. It's 10
*  to the minus 3 as opposed to 10 to the minus
*  5 for the intrinsic
*  temperature variations.
*  We attribute that dipole to
*  our motion with respect to the cosmic
*  microwave background rest frame.
*  Basically there is one rest frame
*  with respect to which the microwave background
*  looks completely isotropic
*  at the dipole level, at the
*  this side versus that side level.
*  No other rest frame will have
*  that property. That was actually
*  the first thing discovered in terms of
*  temperature anisotropies
*  in the cosmic microwave background.
*  It tells us how fast we're moving through space.
*  I forget the number
*  something like 300 kilometers a second
*  seems to roughly be the order of magnitude.
*  Faisal Siddiqui says,
*  On the black hole information loss paradox,
*  I've listened to the Netta Engelhardt episode
*  several times, but I'm sorry I still
*  do not understand how the book burning
*  in a bonfire case is different
*  than throwing a book in a black hole. Could you please
*  elaborate? Well roughly
*  in the book burning in a bonfire case
*  we know enough physics
*  to predict
*  given the entire
*  book and the entire fire down
*  to the level of every atom and particle
*  precisely what
*  radiation will be emitted.
*  We can make an absolute
*  prediction using the Schrodinger equation
*  and the Standard Model etc. We know
*  exactly what the information is going to be
*  the exact distribution of radiation
*  and ash and heat and whatever.
*  We know exactly what it will be in principle.
*  In practice of course, that's way too much information
*  we can never do it, but in principle we could do it.
*  In a black hole we don't have that.
*  In a black hole, according to Stephen Hawking's
*  calculation, what comes out
*  is thermal radiation
*  that tells you the spectrum
*  the average amount of this wavelength and that
*  wavelength and that wavelength, but we don't know
*  exactly what is coming out.
*  We have no way of doing that calculation.
*  There seems to be
*  in Hawking's way of formulating the problem
*  no relationship
*  between the information stored in the
*  book that you throw into the black hole
*  and the radiation that comes out
*  other than how much mass
*  the book had.
*  So it's actually a very different
*  question and the reason why it's an interesting
*  question is because you might say
*  well okay, do a better calculation
*  and that's what people are trying to do, but it turns out
*  to be very hard to know what to do
*  and there's elaborate arguments that say
*  there needs to be non-locality, I mean
*  the book falls in, it's inside the event horizon
*  and it's not bleached or anything
*  like that, all the information is still there
*  somehow it gets outside the event horizon
*  how did it do that? That's
*  the essence of the real problem.
*  Josh Powers says
*  what would be the differences between
*  real universes and simulated ones?
*  Do you think there would necessarily be
*  any significant differences or might real
*  and simulated universes be practically the same
*  for any intelligent beings
*  inhabiting them?
*  I think they could be practically the same
*  I don't think there's necessarily a significant
*  difference to put it in your terms
*  if you're interested in this kind of
*  thing, I can hardly recommend
*  David Chalmers' book on the
*  idea. We had David on the podcast
*  years ago and
*  it was interesting because David is a very
*  very famous philosopher in consciousness
*  coiner of the term the hard problem, etc
*  so I wanted to talk about that
*  but he was in the midst of writing his book
*  which is now out called Reality Plus
*  about simulated
*  universes and virtual reality
*  and does it count as reality?
*  And he tries his best to make the case that it does
*  count as reality so I would check
*  that out. It's a very very good book, very very readable
*  A Lama
*  says
*  what's a reasonable credence
*  that the accelerating expansion of our universe
*  is characteristic of the whole universe?
*  Do we assume this due to simplicity naturalness
*  or do we have some observational evidence?
*  Well, neither
*  we don't assume it at all
*  it depends on what you mean by the whole universe
*  of course. We observe
*  part of the universe, right? There is something called
*  the observable universe
*  within the observable universe
*  things seem to be the same
*  everywhere given that we're looking
*  at the past when we look at far away things
*  as far as we can tell
*  by looking at things, things are
*  on average the same everywhere including
*  the fact that the universe is accelerating
*  that's a data based conclusion
*  beyond the observable universe
*  we neither
*  have evidence that it is accelerating
*  in the same way nor do we assume
*  nor do we have to assume that it is
*  accelerating in the same way. It could
*  be that the universe continues on
*  for some finite time
*  finite distance or infinite distance
*  doing more or less the same thing that it does
*  in our observable universe or
*  things could be radically different as in
*  theories of eternal inflation in the multiverse
*  things are radically different outside our observable universe
*  so we just don't know
*  and it's good to keep an open mind
*  G Clune says
*  I listen to
*  watch some other podcasts or YouTube videos
*  of people who are doing something similar to you
*  I'm not in academia
*  or science but many of these podcasters constantly
*  say, one
*  that universities and science have taken
*  been taken over by the woke, woke culture
*  and the left which is something they always
*  paint as negative and two
*  I also hear that many physicists aren't doing real
*  science, that physics is in crisis
*  and there's a group, a lot of group
*  think and that non-mainstream
*  views are forced out, especially when it comes
*  to string theory and dark matter
*  you're much closer to this than I am
*  do you have this feeling? Is there any
*  or some truth to what these other podcasters
*  are saying? I'm skeptical but would love to have
*  your take on it. You know this is
*  the kind of thing, no it's roughly speaking
*  not true, that's the very very short answer
*  but you know they're close enough
*  to true things that you can see
*  how they can get away
*  with saying things like this
*  it's in both cases, in the case
*  of both the
*  accusation that universities have been taken over
*  by the woke, woke culture
*  and the idea that
*  science is in a crisis and there's a lot of group
*  think, in both cases
*  there is something going on that I think
*  is legitimately worth thinking
*  about and critiquing
*  but also in both cases
*  these legitimate issues
*  are taken up as
*  fuel or ammunition
*  would even be a better word for some political
*  background viewpoint
*  that they want to push. Usually
*  in the latter case when they say physics is in crisis
*  and there's a lot of group think, the thing they
*  want to push is their own physics idea
*  and they're sad that the establishment
*  does not give them recognition for their brilliant
*  physics idea. In the former
*  case when they're complaining about woke culture on the left
*  they're probably trying to support
*  things on the right. That's usually how
*  these things work.
*  Now like I said there are things, there are
*  things worth critiquing. I'm not saying
*  there's nothing to be critiqued here
*  I think that the extent
*  to which woke culture
*  has permeated and taken over
*  universities is incredibly exaggerated
*  as someone who's spent a lot of time in universities
*  but I think there are
*  legitimate critiques to be made
*  that there is a segment of
*  academia or academic culture
*  that is not open enough to listening to ideas
*  that they don't agree with. I think
*  that's a perfectly legitimate conversation to have
*  but it's a tricky conversation to have
*  and it's made much harder
*  by the politicization
*  of it which is as soon as you
*  hear people complaining about the word woke
*  they're using this for
*  some political agenda. They're not trying to have
*  some careful conversation
*  with an open mind about difficult issues
*  they're trying to bludgeon you
*  with some heavily
*  emotionally laden
*  verbiage and you should listen
*  to other podcasts in that case.
*  For the physics case
*  I might do, actually I've been thinking about doing a solo
*  podcast on this or something like that but I do think
*  that there are trends
*  within physics that are absolutely
*  worth critiquing. You know I've done it, I've critiqued
*  them. When we talk about
*  foundations of quantum mechanics
*  I've certainly critiqued it plenty of times
*  but there are deeper other issues
*  the idea that it's group
*  think that it's a crisis and things like that
*  again this is just you know emotionally
*  charged language that is trying to
*  make the issues more obscure rather
*  than making them more clear
*  and so it becomes harder
*  to talk about these issues. I don't like talking
*  about issues where
*  the issues are intrinsically
*  difficult and subtle and you have to think about
*  them but that there's a whole bunch of people
*  who turn them into
*  mannikean, black and white, politically
*  charged discussions. You know I just
*  tend to stay away from that because I don't find it
*  enjoyable personally
*  but sometimes it's better to you know
*  even if it's not enjoyable you've got to talk about
*  it one way or the other so that's my
*  take on it as you say.
*  Paul Duffield says
*  one of the ideas from past guests
*  that you bring up a lot is Paul Bloom's
*  against empathy. Is it just a coincidence
*  or is it something that you're specifically mulling over
*  and trying to get opinions on from a variety
*  of perspectives? Well I think
*  I hadn't noticed that but I absolutely
*  believe it is possible.
*  My explanation for it would
*  be that
*  I strongly believe
*  something more or less the opposite
*  of what Paul argues for
*  in that book and that
*  podcast but I do you know
*  respect Paul's thoughts on it
*  and his work as a psychologist and I
*  don't think, you know he doesn't
*  fall into the category I
*  just said of people trying to you know
*  oversimplify and politicize things. He's thinking
*  about difficult issues very carefully
*  but I strongly
*  think that having more empathy
*  is really crucially important and
*  the distinction seems
*  to be that Paul is
*  convinced, if I understand correctly
*  he's convinced that
*  empathy is just flawed because
*  we're going to always have empathy more for people
*  like ourselves and less
*  for people unlike ourselves and we should strive
*  to be more rational rather than
*  empathetic to make the world a better place.
*  I am much more impressed by
*  people's failure to be rational
*  and their even more
*  and more subtly their ability
*  to think they are being rational
*  while actually ignoring
*  some very important aspects of a
*  problem and I think that empathy
*  is one of the ways to help us
*  help us
*  what is the right way to do it?
*  To help us avoid that mistake
*  to help us make sure that we are
*  considering all the relevant aspects of the
*  problem by trying hard to figure out
*  what other people in very different circumstances
*  would be thinking about this problem.
*  Rationality is great
*  but it's almost too hard
*  to do it by itself.
*  It's not that rationality is hard
*  it's that it's too easy
*  to use rationality badly
*  and I think that empathy can be
*  a
*  something that helps us get over
*  that and Paul obviously thinks the opposite
*  so I'm interested in what other people think
*  from different perspectives.
*  Mikkel Pickle says
*  what is it about mystery movies and books
*  that you find engaging?
*  You know in some sense it's
*  science right? In some sense a mystery novel
*  or book is or movie
*  is posed
*  puzzle posing a puzzle
*  having data and you try to like
*  put the data together to solve the puzzle
*  in a way that is pre-determined
*  to wrap up nicely at
*  the end of some time so it's like science
*  where you always know you're going to find the answer
*  what could be more enjoyable than that?
*  Patricia Paulson says
*  I can get how particles can exist
*  for most forces but cannot figure out
*  how a particle, the graviton
*  could exist for gravity which is geometry
*  what am I seeing incorrectly here?
*  It's not that there's anything incorrect there
*  it's the mismatch
*  between particles, gravitons
*  and the statement that gravity is geometry.
*  Classically
*  gravity is geometry
*  but the particles, the graviton
*  comes from quantizing the theory
*  and then it's a different kind of thing
*  right?
*  The trajectory of a particle in phase space
*  is deterministic, classically
*  it's a wave function quantum mechanics
*  it's a different kind of thing, okay?
*  So you know as I alluded to before
*  earlier in the podcast there's space
*  time and there's the metric on space time
*  okay? So the metric is a
*  field that takes on different
*  values at different points in space
*  and how the values relate to each other
*  at different points in space time
*  tells you what the curvature is
*  and that's the classical way we have of describing
*  how geometry works
*  and where gravity comes from
*  but then the quantum theory of that
*  says that there is no
*  once and for all
*  gravitational metric field
*  that's the equivalent of a classical
*  trajectory right? That's not what the world is made of
*  it's a wave function
*  in principle, not in practice because it's too hard
*  but in principle the wave function
*  of the metric
*  tells you if you were to measure
*  the metric all throughout space at one
*  moment of time, what is the probability
*  of getting different results?
*  And the nice
*  thing is, so we don't have a full
*  theory of quantum gravity, but the nice thing is
*  what we can do is look at the weak
*  field limit, just imagine that gravity is
*  very very weak, in which case
*  we can approximate
*  the curved gravity of space time
*  as flat space time
*  plus a gravitational field
*  on top of it, ok?
*  And then we just have a field in flat
*  space time that we can quantize
*  and that we know how to do, we've done that a lot
*  and so the small
*  perturbations of the metric
*  tensor that
*  describe gravity in the weak field limit
*  are something we can very easily quantize
*  and out pops
*  gravitons, out pops particles
*  it's almost inevitable, in any
*  sensible quantum field theory
*  you're going to get particles in the
*  weak field limit
*  one way or the other, and the reason why
*  you get gravitons is exactly the same reason
*  you get photons or whatever
*  because there are quantization
*  conditions on the energies
*  of vibrations in
*  the field once you
*  do the rules of quantum mechanics to it
*  just wait to see
*  book 2 of the biggest ideas in the universe
*  where I talk about this a little bit more detail
*  or you could just look at the video
*  right, there's videos on
*  in the video where I talk about fields
*  in the biggest ideas in the universe series
*  I do talk about why you get particles
*  when you quantize a field
*  P Walder says, what do you consider
*  are the issues in fundamental physics that make
*  explanations of downward causation
*  difficult to accept?
*  The short answer is locality
*  ok, downward causation is the idea
*  that somehow what is going on
*  at the higher levels of a
*  series of emergent explanations
*  emergent theories
*  emergent descriptions can somehow
*  be important for explaining what happens
*  at the lower levels
*  so the caricature, it's not quite fair
*  but it's pretty darn fair is
*  electrons would
*  behave differently if they were in
*  a rock or a brain or a
*  snowflake or a fungus or something like that
*  the larger context
*  in which the fundamental particle
*  is embedded could be
*  affected by a downward
*  causation from the broader
*  ensemble of which
*  it is a part
*  that's a perfectly legitimate idea to think
*  about but it is entirely
*  100% incompatible with
*  everything we know about quantum field theory
*  in quantum field theory the
*  state of the electron
*  let's just speak classically
*  before we get to quantum field theory
*  just classically there's an electron
*  field or there's an electromagnetic
*  field or a gluon field or whatever field you care
*  about and there's an equation of motion
*  for that field that tells what it does
*  and that equation of motion says
*  the value of the
*  field at one point in space
*  is changing
*  that's what equations of motion tell you
*  and the amount by which it's changing depends
*  only on the values
*  and the derivatives of other
*  fields at exactly
*  the same point
*  it is very clear completely unambiguous
*  that nothing that is going
*  on at other points in space
*  far away can possibly
*  affect the equation
*  of motion for the field at this point
*  you can imagine equations of motion
*  that do that but they're not field equations
*  it's not a field theory it's something else
*  and quantum field theory is exactly
*  the same way but with quantum mechanics
*  so you'd need to fundamentally
*  overturn the principle of locality
*  for downward causation to be important
*  also I see no evidence for it
*  so I'm not going to spend
*  a lot of time
*  anonymous says can you
*  explain the cross product
*  to me without the right hand rule
*  like where does it come from
*  why is it always perpendicular to the original
*  vectors I dip my toes
*  into Lie algebra in my particle physics
*  course and it feels like the answer
*  is hidden there
*  this is an almost impossible question to answer
*  without knowing what would qualify
*  as a satisfactory answer
*  you can always just give the definition
*  of the cross product
*  for those of you who don't know
*  if I have two vectors
*  the two vectors in
*  three dimensional space always describe
*  a plane you can always imagine
*  the plane in which both vectors
*  are simultaneously embedded
*  so the cross product of those
*  two vectors is a third vector
*  that is perpendicular to that plane
*  and the magnitude of the vector
*  is the product of the
*  magnitudes of the two vectors you're
*  multiplying by each other
*  times the sine of the vector
*  of the angle between them
*  is that right is it the sine I believe it is
*  yes so if the vectors
*  are lining right on top of each other
*  the sine of the angle
*  the angle is zero the sine of that is zero
*  so the cross product vector is also
*  zero if they're perpendicular to each other
*  the sine of that angle is one
*  and so the magnitude of the cross product
*  is just the product of the magnitudes of the two
*  vectors so if you think about it what do you
*  do when the vectors are perpendicular to
*  each other the magnitude
*  of the cross product vector
*  if one magnitude is A
*  and the other one is B
*  and they're perpendicular the cross product
*  magnitude is A times B
*  which is also the area
*  of a little rectangle
*  that you would make by drawing those two vectors
*  and using them as two sides of the rectangle
*  right whereas if you
*  squeeze the vectors together so they're on
*  top of each other now the
*  area of the rectangle that they describe is
*  zero because they're both right on top of each
*  other and the vector is
*  zero so the magnitude of the cross product
*  vector is just the area
*  of a little parallelogram that the
*  two vectors describe
*  why is it always perpendicular
*  well we defined it that way
*  so that's one perfectly
*  legitimate answer to that question
*  but let me back up a little bit and just
*  ask you know the game
*  that is being played here
*  mathematically speaking physically
*  speaking there may or may not be uses for these
*  games but the math game is the following
*  here are two vectors based at the
*  same point okay so they have the
*  same tail and they point towards
*  different heads and let's
*  ask ourselves what other
*  vectors can we
*  construct from these two vectors
*  that are perfectly well defined by which I mean
*  they don't depend on arbitrary
*  choices we make about
*  coordinate systems or
*  components or anything like that they're just intrinsic
*  to the vectors it turns out
*  there aren't that many
*  vectors that we can define just
*  by using the information we're
*  given in these two vectors
*  the cross product
*  is one of them as it turns out in three dimensions
*  of space in higher dimensions there's a whole
*  different set of things
*  that can be done
*  you would need to read about
*  differential forms and
*  wedge products and
*  exterior products and things
*  like that I write a little bit about those
*  in my book space time and geometry but
*  I don't know of a
*  resource that is specifically aimed there
*  but I think that the philosophical
*  thing to say is
*  there aren't that many well defined
*  constructions that make a third vector out of
*  two here is one of them
*  its direction is perpendicular
*  to the first two and its magnitude
*  is the area of a little rectangle
*  a little parallelogram that they define
*  it's a perfectly good thing to define
*  and there's a whole separate thing about why that's really
*  useful in actual physics
*  that's
*  another question to get that I'm not even
*  trying to know what the answer is
*  I'm going to group two questions together
*  Josh Belsman says
*  I'm forever trying to wrap my head around the
*  vastness of many worlds theory
*  does it suggest that there's a universe
*  representing every possible permutation
*  of every subatomic particle interaction
*  or whatever is even more
*  granular than that or
*  is it more like a neural network or probability
*  tree where each new universe is based on
*  a subset of likely prior
*  permutations
*  and then John Stout says
*  John S. Bell wrote one is given
*  this is a complaint that Bell had about many
*  worlds one is given no idea
*  of how far down toward the atomic
*  scale the splitting of the world into branch
*  worlds penetrates can you address
*  this issue so two
*  things to say I mean there's the sort of background
*  philosophical point and then the
*  down and dirty point the background philosophical
*  point is as I've already said in this podcast
*  I don't care
*  different people are welcome
*  to be persnickety in different ways
*  about when the universes
*  count as different universes or when the branching
*  happens as long as
*  two things are satisfied number
*  one the whole wave function of the universe
*  is just the actual wave function obeying
*  the Schrodinger equation and number
*  two when the
*  branching has clearly happened
*  because there's decoherence and there are two different
*  macroscopic worlds you count them as
*  different macroscopic worlds as long as those two
*  things are true you're welcome to be
*  specific about whatever rule
*  you want to invent for what counts as
*  different worlds I don't really care
*  doesn't bother me doesn't affect my life
*  however
*  operationally that's the background philosophy
*  operationally
*  branching happens when
*  decoherence happens branching happens
*  when the quantum system that
*  was originally in a superposition
*  becomes entangled with its environment
*  irreversibly that's what decoherence is
*  and then what happens in the one
*  branch of the wave function no longer
*  interferes with or can be affected by
*  what is happening in the other one therefore
*  we're allowed to treat them
*  as separate worlds so I really
*  I mean this this kind of thing this
*  makes me feel like
*  Boltzmann must have felt
*  you know Boltzmann in the 1800s
*  tried to say I know what the second law
*  of thermodynamics is it's just because
*  there's a lot of particles and they probably
*  move toward higher
*  entropy because there's more ways to be high entropy than to
*  be low entropy and he got a huge
*  number of people saying what do you mean
*  probably the second law of thermodynamics
*  is a law you're not allowed to say it probably
*  happens it has to absolutely happen
*  but the probabilities are so large
*  that it didn't have to absolutely happen
*  and it didn't really matter it could
*  be perfectly okay just to be an
*  approximate kind of thing because it was more than good
*  enough branching
*  in many worlds is just like
*  that you don't need
*  a precise absolute
*  perfectly agreed upon definition of when
*  it happens it happens perfectly
*  obviously in the macroscopic cases
*  we care about in the
*  microscopic cases where it might be ambiguous
*  you're welcome to define it however you want
*  and nothing changes one way or the other
*  certainly the fundamental ontology
*  doesn't care
*  Jan or
*  Jan, not sure, says I recently
*  decided to obtain my genome sequence
*  most of the people I spoke about this topic
*  prefer not knowing their genetic background
*  because of the fear that an unknown health risk might be detected
*  I find this attitude quite
*  curious because it is ignorant
*  because being ignorant of a health problem of course doesn't prevent
*  its manifestation
*  What do you think about the pros and cons of knowing your own
*  genome sequence and have you considered
*  obtaining yours?
*  I'm
*  totally in favor of it
*  I'm absolutely on your side I think
*  if I pull out
*  the implications of your question correctly
*  that to know
*  that you are
*  susceptible to
*  getting a really bad disease
*  more than the average amount
*  seems like really really useful information
*  maybe you can take some steps to
*  prevent it or mitigate it
*  or something like that I don't know
*  but I would certainly want to know
*  that if I could so I don't get that
*  particular objection to it
*  now I do get
*  that there are worries on mostly
*  from third parties who just don't
*  trust individual human beings
*  to take probabilistic
*  information
*  and use it reliably
*  people are worried that if you find out
*  you have a 10% chance
*  of getting something rather than just a
*  1% chance you'll be panicked
*  so I think I can
*  judge my own probabilities pretty well
*  so I'm not worried about that
*  in the real world in practical
*  questions I do have
*  questions about many of the companies
*  that actually do this
*  they're doing studies
*  they're collecting data from you
*  you are the product
*  not the customer for these people
*  usually
*  they want to see various frequencies
*  of various things happening
*  and it's a little bit shady I'm not sure
*  maybe it's fine I don't know I haven't looked into it
*  I haven't done it but not out of
*  any principled objection to it just that
*  I'm busy doing other things and haven't really
*  felt the need to do it yet
*  Michael Schillingford says
*  what are your views on
*  selfhood particularly do you believe that
*  there is an emergent self
*  well I think there is a self
*  because the self is not fundamental therefore yes
*  I think it is emergent in the sense that we've been
*  talking about earlier that is to
*  say the idea of a self
*  is something that is nowhere to be found in the fundamental
*  laws of physics but is clearly very
*  useful as part of our description
*  of the everyday human sized world
*  so therefore it is emergent that is
*  the definition basically
*  and I think that you know there's a lot
*  of subtleties here
*  there are subtleties about
*  the self through time
*  is it possible to give you the same self tomorrow that you will be yesterday
*  remember we had the conversation
*  with Lori Paul about transformative
*  experiences you could be a very different
*  self in the future
*  than you are right now and how do you
*  rationally account for that possibility
*  of course
*  many worlds opens up lots
*  of metaphysical issues about
*  the self I think the easiest way
*  to deal with all of these issues
*  is to say that the self was always an
*  approximate notion or I should say
*  the idea of persistence
*  of the self through time
*  was always an approximate notion
*  you're never exactly the same person you were
*  a minute ago much less a year ago
*  but to a good approximation there is
*  some continuity there right
*  and I think exactly the same thing works in many
*  worlds or whatever
*  but you know if we ever build a
*  transporter machine you might have to think
*  more carefully about what exactly
*  counts as the self
*  David Dubrow says
*  reading from eternity to here and now something deeply
*  hidden am I right to see a parallel
*  between many worlds and your approach for
*  explaining the enigma of the past hypothesis
*  in both cases there is a puzzle
*  that seems to point outside our universe
*  for an answer in many
*  worlds the apparent collapse of the wave
*  function is no collapse at all decoherence
*  of the superposition creates multiple branches
*  of the wave function and they all exist
*  similarly you can explain
*  the seemingly low entropy beginning of our universe
*  by positing a larger system
*  that somehow spawns baby universes and when those
*  expands their entropy increases
*  it seems that it all comes down to this
*  what we think of as our universe is
*  just part of a larger system and in the
*  context of this larger universe these enigmas
*  no longer exist
*  yeah you know I
*  haven't really thought of that
*  particular commonality between those
*  two beliefs but yes I think it's there
*  I agree with it
*  and in fact you know with respect to
*  what we were saying earlier about naturalness
*  and so forth it makes perfect sense
*  the preposterous universe question
*  there are things about our universe
*  that seem mysterious why
*  because we have certain expectations
*  and there are features of the universe
*  that don't match those expectations
*  so the universe is not wrong
*  clearly our expectations are wrong
*  how do we retrain our expectations
*  like you can say well
*  fine your expectations were wrong
*  but just saying that doesn't
*  get you anywhere that's not helpful information
*  that doesn't move us forward
*  to move us forward you have to say
*  okay here is what your
*  expectations should be and where they should
*  come from and putting
*  the universe that we observe into a larger
*  context can be one way of doing that
*  I'm not going to say it's the only way
*  or the universally best way or whatever
*  but it can often be a way
*  of doing that so it's not surprising to me
*  that in these two contexts
*  that kind of move
*  works well both times
*  Jeremy Ditman says
*  in your episode featuring
*  Danny Bassett and Perry Zern
*  you briefly discussed the policing of
*  curiosity and I'm wondering
*  if the 1970s PRL policy
*  banning the publishing
*  of papers concerned with foundational questions
*  in quantum mechanics serves as an example
*  of this in the physics community
*  do you believe the ban effectively delayed
*  advances in our understanding of entanglement
*  and quantum computing for instance
*  and is something akin to this
*  still happening today in contemporary physics
*  from your perspective or has the
*  massive expansion of roots for publishing and
*  popularizing effectively mitigated
*  this sort of policing
*  I think this is one of those tough
*  questions I got to say because
*  there is absolutely policing of curiosity
*  that goes on
*  but I can absolutely
*  see that sometimes it should be
*  policing of curiosity not in
*  the sense that you literally want thought
*  police tracking
*  you down and punishing you if you're
*  curious about the wrong things
*  but in the real world especially in
*  academia where
*  we're trying to understand the universe better
*  and we're doing it by thinking about things
*  being curious about things doing research on
*  them writing them up and sharing those ideas
*  we're up against
*  the finitude of our resources
*  right of course it would
*  be best if every possible
*  idea was chased down by somebody
*  but most of those
*  ideas are not going to turn out to be very good
*  and we don't have an infinite number of people
*  so in the real
*  world we have to choose
*  it's not a matter of policing so much as
*  we have to choose to support
*  investigation of some kinds of
*  curiosity and not support others
*  if you're an advisor
*  a PHD student and your
*  students want to write a paper
*  or a thesis on some topic
*  you have to be judgy you have to say yes
*  that's a good topic no that is not a good topic
*  and the reason why it might not be a good topic
*  might be because I don't think you can do it
*  I don't think the results will be interesting
*  I don't think anyone else cares about those results
*  I think there are other questions that would be
*  better served by your talents
*  etc etc
*  so there is some necessarily
*  some shaping of
*  where we give support
*  and encouragement in different kinds
*  of curiosity and I'm sure this can
*  be extended well beyond
*  the narrow confines of academia
*  and research and things like that
*  so but of course it can also
*  be bad right it can also be
*  I don't think this question is interesting
*  therefore nobody should think it is interesting
*  so again this is a fuzzy answer because
*  not an extremist in either way
*  but I think that it's interesting
*  and important to
*  reflect on
*  whether we are
*  in good faith
*  judging that a certain
*  idea is just not worth
*  the resources to pursue
*  or whether we're just being a
*  curmudgeon and saying yeah I don't
*  know I didn't think about things like
*  that it sounds very different than what I expected
*  so go away right
*  there are good and bad reasons
*  to take a stand against
*  doing certain kinds
*  of research is what I would say
*  again if there were
*  infinite resources then there would be no good reasons
*  to prevent people from doing whatever they wanted
*  but there aren't so something
*  has to give
*  Nalita S says
*  what in your upbringing would you say
*  helped you be humble with a
*  growth mindset I'm a
*  teacher and want my students to have
*  those kinds of traits
*  I don't know yeah that's a
*  very good question you know I'm being
*  a teacher even though I am a teacher
*  you know I teach college students
*  and I presume college
*  professors call themselves professors usually not
*  teachers even though they certainly are teachers
*  and they do teach I presume that you're teaching
*  younger students than that
*  and
*  even though it's a very
*  important activity we get very little training
*  in it right we're not very reflective
*  about
*  how best to do it
*  and not even just to the explicit teaching
*  part but the guidance
*  the supervision the advising
*  of things that are
*  tangential to or completely outside
*  the classroom so
*  things like how to inculcate
*  and encourage
*  humility or growth mindset
*  or something like that
*  I really don't have any explicit
*  advice I think the one
*  thing I can say not very helpful but
*  the one thing I can say is
*  exemplify those
*  virtues if you want students
*  to get them themselves like they're
*  hard to train like you sort of
*  have to hope that the student already
*  wants to be humble if they don't want to be
*  humble it's very hard to get them to be humble
*  but if they want to be you can
*  help them move in that direction
*  you can want to be humble but not succeed
*  right or you can want
*  to have a growth mindset and not have it
*  but then at least maybe
*  you'll put some effort into trying and
*  in those cases just seeing
*  it done is as valuable
*  as anything else I can think of
*  when you're standing up
*  in front of the class
*  show some humility right
*  like be clear when you don't understand
*  something when you've made a mistake all of
*  these things it's a tricky thing to do
*  because you also need some respect
*  some level of authority
*  you don't want the students to completely distrust
*  everything you say but you want them to realize
*  that you can make mistakes
*  and I like to think that they trust
*  you more when you're honest about
*  your mistakes and you let your
*  curiosity shine through you know
*  you make it clear that you're not
*  studying or talking or teaching about this particular
*  thing because you're supposed to or you have to
*  but you're truly passionate and excited
*  about it and that's hard to fake
*  if you actually are they will get
*  it you know they're watching you
*  for hours on end and they pick up all
*  these little things that you don't even think that they're
*  noticing that's what students do so
*  but beyond that yeah I'm
*  sorry I don't have any specific
*  suggestions I
*  do think it's an interesting thing to think about but
*  someone who's a professional at being
*  a good educator would be a better person to ask than me
*  Paul Proudlock says
*  I've now attended both Brian
*  Green's and Brian Cox's
*  science physics public presentations
*  to great delight while
*  listening to Professor Green last night in Toronto
*  I could carolize his presentation
*  some by adding the ways you
*  have taught special and general relativity and
*  of course inserted the many worlds interpretation
*  were appropriate have you considered
*  putting on such a presentation and touring it?
*  You know roughly
*  speaking no
*  I'm very glad that they do it you know
*  Brian both Brian's Brian Green
*  and Brian Cox are friends of mine who
*  are enormously successful
*  popularizers
*  of science and physics
*  and so I don't know if everyone out there knows
*  but I don't even know about Brian
*  Green's stuff particularly
*  but Brian Cox in the UK
*  really has perfected
*  a show
*  that is not just a lecture it's not just
*  he gets up there and talks about
*  like I do like I get up there with my powerpoints
*  that I made the previous night and talk to people
*  I do that all the time
*  but this is a whole
*  different level of thing with high production
*  values everything really thought out
*  vivid graphics
*  computer generated stuff music
*  you know a whole
*  thing that keeps people entertained and is really
*  at the same time actually educational
*  doing
*  that it's a lot of work
*  right it's a tremendous amount of work
*  and I absolutely
*  think it's valuable and I'm really really glad that
*  they do it
*  it's just something that I've chosen
*  not to do and also probably
*  would fail because
*  the thing about both of those is you have to kind
*  of be famous before you
*  do them and I know that you all
*  know me because you're listening to the AMA you're like
*  at hour three in the AMA for the Mindscape
*  podcast but I do not have
*  the public recognition that either
*  one of those Brian's do so if I did
*  put enormous amount of work into something
*  like that and you know booked a
*  300 seat auditorium and had 15
*  people in it that would be
*  discouraging for me so
*  it is again I guess the theme of this AMA
*  is
*  satisfying
*  our desires under conditions
*  of finite resources
*  right I you know that something like that
*  would be fun but
*  given the resources I have and the other things
*  I want to do writing
*  books doing the podcast doing
*  research in physics and philosophy
*  teaching my courses all of these things
*  I don't have time
*  to do that you know when people say they don't have time to do
*  something they don't really mean they don't have time they mean
*  I am not prioritizing at as
*  high as I am the other things that I want to
*  do with my time so that's the right thing to say
*  I do not prioritize
*  trying to do something like that
*  as much as I do other
*  things with my time am I
*  making the right choices with my priorities
*  who knows but I am having fun for the moment
*  even though I have a little bit too many things
*  that I have agreed to do
*  okay
*  the very last question
*  of today's AMA comes from
*  Johan Falk who says I think it was
*  when listening to episode 206 with Simon
*  Conway Morris on evolution
*  that you concluded that we only have a sample
*  size of one when it comes to determining
*  how often life evolves
*  into civilization level life
*  then it occurred to me couldn't we
*  for all effective purposes say that life in the ocean
*  and life on land
*  evolves separately where it comes
*  to chances of reaching civilization level
*  life there are of course interactions between
*  the two biospheres but in many aspects
*  they are separate when it comes to evolving intelligent
*  life so if I am right then we have
*  at least a sample size of two do you
*  agree well I guess
*  so there is I realized only after
*  reading this question a couple times
*  that
*  it depends even by your sample size
*  is your sample size the
*  successful achievements
*  of civilization level
*  life or every appearance of life
*  right I mean we have a sample
*  size of no
*  civilization level life appeared on the moon
*  so that's part
*  is that part of the sample I think that what I
*  meant was you know the sample size
*  of just successful appearances
*  of civilizations and in
*  that case I would not count the ocean I don't think there's any
*  civilizations in the sea
*  that are different than the ones on land
*  but also those
*  two ecosystems are
*  super duper intertwined
*  with each other I don't think it's actually fair
*  in any ways to think
*  of them as separate
*  for these kinds of questions for one
*  thing there is a last universal common
*  ancestor if you go back in biological time
*  both the living
*  beings that we know of in the sea and on the
*  land came from a common ancestor
*  but even
*  much more recently than that there is a give and take
*  human beings and other land
*  animals often eat seafood
*  right we have an enormous
*  impact on the ecology
*  of what goes on in the oceans
*  etc. even back before
*  we started dumping
*  trash and fossil fuels into the
*  biosphere that was still something
*  human beings still had a big
*  impact so
*  and by the way you know
*  to make things a little bit more concrete
*  one successful development
*  of civilization could easily crowd
*  out all other possibilities like
*  people often ask is
*  it evidence
*  that life is difficult to
*  evolve that we
*  do have a universal common ancestor
*  that there are not fifteen
*  different examples of life
*  independently starting here on earth
*  I don't think that's much evidence for
*  anything because there
*  are ecological niches and whoever
*  starts first is likely to win
*  right I think that the actual life that started
*  is more or less likely to spread to all
*  the niches it can find and
*  life that started later
*  even if it's separate would have
*  a tough time competing with that and civilizations
*  might be exactly the same
*  way so once you're on the same planet
*  I think that by my standards
*  you can only count one development
*  of a civilization per planet
*  as part of our sample size
*  so I still don't know how likely it is
*  that life evolves into
*  technologically advanced civilizations
*  or not these are fun things to think
*  about maybe someday
*  even before too long we will have a much
*  larger sample size than that and with that
*  thought thanks for listening to the AMA
*  have a good month and thanks very very
*  much for supporting Mindscape I really
*  appreciate it
*  you
