Natural selection has done a pretty good job at creating a wide variety of living species, but we humans canâ€™t help but wonder whether we could do better. Using existing genomes as a starting point, biologists are getting increasingly skilled at designing organisms of our own imagination. But to do that, we need a better understanding of what different genes in our DNA actually do. Elizabeth Strychalski and collaborators recently announced the construction of a synthetic microbial organism that self-reproduces just like a normal unicellular creature. This work will help us understand the roles of genes in reproduction, one step on the road to making DNA molecules and artificial cells that will perform a variety of medical and biological tasks.

Elizabeth Strychalski received her Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University. She is the founder and current leader of the Cellular Engineering Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. She serves on the steering group for the Build-A-Cell collaboration.

# Mindscape 157 | Elizabeth Strychalski on Synthetic Cells and the Rules of Biology
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 26, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5RPLNgSrRU)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. And it has been said
*  that while the 20th century was the century of physics, the 21st century will belong to biology.
*  I'm not sure if that's true or not. I think the 21st century is big enough to have more than one
*  science in it. There's plenty of room for both physics and biology to do good things, but there's
*  no question that the rate of progress in biology has been pretty amazing in recent years and shows
*  no sign of slowing down, especially in our ability to really manipulate what's going on down at the
*  level of cells and even individual strands of DNA. Those of you who are longtime Mindscape
*  listeners will remember a conversation we had with Kate Aramala, who works on synthetic life,
*  putting together cells from scratch, right? I mean, we don't quite have that done yet,
*  but this program of building a cell, starting with our human knowledge rather than from existing
*  biology. What we have done so far is taking existing organisms, removing their DNA, by an
*  organism I mean a little tiny one-celled organism, removing its DNA and inserting DNA that we have
*  designed and seeing whether or not it will keep going. So a few years ago, scientists at the
*  Ventner Institute named after Craig Ventner, were able to build what is essentially, we think,
*  the minimal cell that actually works in some sense, that actually reproduces itself and so
*  forth. But to be honest, it didn't reproduce itself that well. You know, like we hope that
*  an individual cell will split in two so that both halves look more or less like the original cell.
*  That's not happening with these minimal cells. So today's guest is Elizabeth Strachalski,
*  who works as the group leader of the Cellular Engineering Group at NIST, the National Institute
*  of Standards and Technology. And so she and her collaborators, including many of the people on
*  the previous program, were able to fix the minimal cell to build a minimal cell that reproduces
*  nicely in some way. So basically they took genes and they reinserted them back into the DNA until
*  this little one-celled bugger was able to reproduce nicely, splitting into equal sizes,
*  perfectly healthy single-celled organisms. What's amazing is, it's amazing number one,
*  we can do that, right? I mean, this is opening up tremendous vistas for future progress. The fact
*  that we can do it means that someday we'll be able to do it well and easily. But also, number two,
*  we don't know what all the individual genes do, what their responsibilities are in the cell. We
*  know that if they're not there, it doesn't work. But we don't know what actually happens in terms
*  of those genes turning into proteins and making the cell go. So it is an amazing frontier where
*  we're making progress, but there are so many things we don't know. So Elizabeth and I talk
*  about how this stuff works, why you're looking for the minimal cell at all, how it actually happens
*  in the lab with designing the DNA and so forth. And then, you know, we speculate a little bit
*  about what this means about the origin of life, the fact that the minimal cell has quite a few
*  genes in it, hundreds of genes, makes an interesting question arise, right? I mean,
*  how did that come about out of something that wasn't a cell at all? But even more importantly,
*  perhaps for practical purposes, what is this kind of technology going to be good for in medicine,
*  in drug design, in sensing what is happening in the body? This is one of Elizabeth's specialties,
*  is imagining that we can figure out how your body is doing by inserting little sensors into it that
*  we've constructed synthetically as cells in their own right. So I don't know what to say about this.
*  I'm not a biologist, but it's extraordinarily exciting and the prospects are practically
*  limitless. And I think that, you know, in the decades to come, we're going to be seeing the
*  payoff from this kind of research and it's going to change lots of things in interesting ways. So
*  let's go.
*  Elizabeth Strahulsky, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thanks so much. It's a pleasure to be here.
*  So as a physicist, what we're trained to do, what I'm trained to do, is tear things apart,
*  right, to their constituent pieces, whether it's an atom or a solar system or something like that,
*  and look for the basic underlying laws. And I know that a lot of people in biology, or at least
*  I get the impression that there's a conventional wisdom that there are no such underlying laws in
*  biology. Biology is just a mess. Every organism is different. You have to go piece by piece. So is
*  that the right impression to have, or is the search for fundamental underlying laws still a good thing
*  that we should try to do?
*  Personally, I think that even if there are no fundamental laws that look like the fundamental
*  laws we might be used to finding, even the search itself is worthwhile. There's nothing wrong with
*  trying to strip something to its essential elements to try to ask, is there an essence there,
*  or how much of this object that I understand or want to be essential in some way is actually the
*  result of relationships between the different parts.
*  This is going to peek ahead a little bit, but do you find in your work that that's true? Are we
*  discovering little ideas that might someday grow up into laws of biology?
*  Wow, such a great question. It is my sincere hope that we find laws.
*  Personally, I'm hoping that we find laws that look more like quantum mechanics in the wild,
*  or applied quantum mechanics, where we arrive at a recipe book that allows us to do practical
*  things. Maybe biology would look less like synthetic biology, more like engineering biology.
*  Again, these are words, but words matter. It matters what you call things. We have some real
*  challenges in the world right now that we face. I think we need to bring all of our collective
*  knowledge and capability to bear on these. One exciting tool set that we have is synthetic
*  biology and engineering biology.
*  In fact, the words that you're using are reminiscent of the metaphor I was going to
*  ask about. In some sense, what you do is kind of like the enthusiasts for the latest smartphone
*  who tear them apart when they appear and try to figure out what all the pieces are. We have some
*  working gizmo, but in your case, it's a cell or an organism, and you're trying to tear it apart.
*  I love that analogy. I came originally as a physicist. I grew up through the experimental
*  high energy physics community. What a lot of our high energy physicists try to do is to smash apart
*  the basic building blocks of matter to understand what is there. For me, it makes perfect sense that
*  you want to smash apart a biological system to understand what's there and how those parts
*  interact. Now, of course, once you arrive at those laundry lists of parts and relationships,
*  there's still some secret sauce that we don't understand. This science around emergence,
*  complex systems, and what's that spark of life that suddenly you no longer have just a pile of
*  stuff. You have a pile of stuff that is, air quotes here, alive.
*  Right. Well, actually, your statement makes me realize that there's something very fundamental
*  and simple that I don't understand. I understand when a person dies or any higher organism dies,
*  there's a whole bunch of processes that go on between the cells that no longer happen. It's
*  very similar set of atoms and molecules, but it's no longer a living being. What happens when a cell
*  dies? Do cells die? Do they just sort of grow old? Yes. Some cells die. Some cells grow old in
*  certain ways. I should mention as an aside that I am emphatically not a cell biologist. I nearly
*  play one on TV. It's always good to have a cell biologist on your team when you're working. I
*  should mention too that what's really exciting about the way biology moving forward around
*  questions of minimal life, synthetic cells, is you'd find yourself on these larger collaborations
*  where you need deep knowledge in lots of different fields all coming together in the interstices of
*  those fields to make it happen. I bring the physics and engineering perspective, but coming back to
*  your question about cells dying. Sorry, you've opened up a little Pandora's box there. I got to
*  dig into this more. You and your team and your collaboration that you're working with are literally
*  building cells. To someone like me, that makes you a cell biologist. How do you classify yourself?
*  What are the different kinds of people who have to work together to make something like this happen?
*  One of the really exciting things about working in the life sciences right now,
*  specifically in synthetic biology and engineering biology. Some people call it cellular engineering.
*  I want to make sure that I say a lot of the different buzzwords so that folks can go Google
*  these later if they want to learn more. It's that we're taking these well-developed deep
*  bodies of knowledge from what used to be siloed disciplines. We're basically mashing them all
*  together to see what sticks. For example, you mentioned control of biology earlier. If I take
*  control engineering as we understand it from say radios and computers or building a car
*  and then overlay that with cell biology, what might be possible? This is one thing that
*  folks are trying to understand right now. Typically, you might have somebody who has
*  biophysics knowledge. You need people who have knowledge of the different
*  measurement techniques that you need. For example, maybe electron microscopy or fluorescence
*  microscopy or DNA sequencing. You might need an automation specialist because as we know,
*  biology labs are looking less and less like someone standing next to a bench with a pipette
*  in their hand and a white coat. Hopefully, goggles too as well. Please everybody to the
*  extent that you're in your garage, biohacking, please take safety seriously.
*  Wear the goggles. Yes.
*  It's starting to look more and more like laboratories filled with robots.
*  So you might have a mechanical engineer who's part of our team in my laboratory. For example,
*  we work with folks who are experts in machine learning because as you automate these measurements
*  and these experiments, you get a whole lot of data out more than it's easy even to think about.
*  It's a lot. What that does is it lets you ask new and different kinds of questions about biology
*  because you can bring to bear all of this incredible computation power that you get from
*  machine learning. Okay, so I interrupted you when you were explaining how cells can die.
*  What is the process inside that no longer happens to that collection of atoms and molecules?
*  Well, the easiest thing to say, I think, is that it's no longer doing the things a living cell
*  does. I know you've had other guests on your show who have spent time talking about what is life
*  or even about building synthetic cells. I think for me, as somebody who comes from more of a physics
*  and engineering standpoint, I like to think of life and death as kind of a spectrum in the same
*  way that I think of a spectrum from chemistry to biology. Depending on what you want to build
*  or what capability you want to have, you might want to situate yourself at different places on
*  those spectrums. For example, I might want to bioremediate something, which would mean that
*  I'm going to engineer something biological and then release it. Well, do I really want it to
*  be able to reproduce? Right. Maybe not. Right? I've seen that movie. It doesn't go well.
*  No, it never does. It never does. A couple of years ago, I was actually trying to convince
*  some funders that we need to try out terraforming technologies on an asteroid or something off Earth
*  because that way, when we need it here, it's not our first go.
*  Right. Right, right, right. Yeah. Well, okay. That is very interesting. I think, like you said,
*  we've had people on the show who have talked about what is life, what is a cell. Kate Atamala,
*  who I guess is a collaborator of yours, or at least in the same big group, talked a little
*  bit about synthetic biology. But maybe some of the people listening right now haven't even heard
*  that. And so what I'm guessing is everyone knows that cells have membranes and little nucleus
*  inside with DNA, and the DNA converts its little parts into proteins, which then go do things.
*  Do we need more knowledge than that for what's about to come when we talk about building a
*  synthetic cell? I mean, what about how the cell works is the basic knowledge
*  platform that we're going to have to build on here?
*  There's so much fundamental knowledge we still need to gain. And just to make sure for completeness
*  that we cover this, there are sort of two main paths forward that people are walking down to arrive
*  at something like a synthetic cell or a minimal cell. So you can take the bottom-up approach
*  where you take non-living parts. If you're a purist, I guess you would start with chemistry,
*  not even biochemistry. And you would try to assemble bits and pieces until life happens.
*  So this has not been done yet, to the best of my knowledge.
*  Okay.
*  Although lots of folks are working in this area and making great progress, the other path forward
*  is more of a top-down approach where you start with something that is already a living cell,
*  and you take parts out until it dies in some way. Now, it's really simple to say these things,
*  but when you actually go about trying to do them, the devil's in the details.
*  And with regard to the minimal cell work that I've been doing recently with just wonderful
*  collaborators at the J. Craig Mentor Institute and other places, and I want to give a shout out to
*  my co-authors, James Pelletier and Liji Sun. They're just fantastic to work with.
*  Oh, so what we've been doing there is you start with something called an obligate parasite.
*  Okay.
*  And what that means is it's an organism that can't live outside of its host. It still has all the
*  cellular machinery that it needs, but it's adapted to live in a very stable, very specialized
*  environment, which means that it hasn't needed to retain a lot of the genetic information
*  or proteins or other bits of itself that it needs to respond to a changing environment.
*  But this is one cell we're talking about, a unicellular organism.
*  That's right. That's right. This is a kind of mycoplasmon.
*  Okay.
*  And it's a goat tuberculosis, I guess. So I had to sign up outside my lab for a long time saying,
*  if you have a pet goat, don't worry. So these scientists developed a way to
*  scramble parts of the genome and then grow the cells that resulted. And then you can sequence
*  the DNA that's left from the cells that grew well. So you can guess that if any of the genes
*  were scrambled and so couldn't be expressed, they must not be essential for life. So cut them out.
*  So you can take that empirical approach. You can also take an approach where you look at related
*  organisms and you can kind of guess what the function of different genes might be and guess
*  whether or not a certain gene is essential or not. Now you'll notice I'm not saying essential for what
*  because when folks talk about minimal life or minimal cells, what's implicit in that is that
*  you're minimizing to some criteria. You're putting some boundary conditions on this thing.
*  And when the JCVI collaborators published in 2016, the minimal cells was JCVI SYN 3.0.
*  What they did was they minimized the criteria of the cell growth looks normal at the colony level.
*  So when you looked, and you could even see these by eye, you've got this beautiful,
*  if you've ever seen a micro plasma colony, it looks a little bit like a fried egg.
*  I probably never had.
*  And so it looked totally normal. And the other thing that they wanted was they wanted the cells
*  to grow fast enough, again, air quotes here, that it was useful for work in the laboratory.
*  Nobody wants to sit around for a week while their cells finally get around to double.
*  Right. It's just not practical, really slow down your research. So they wanted to keep genes that
*  would keep the cells growing fast enough to be useful. Okay. Well, we took a closer look at what
*  was happening. It turned out that none of these minimization criteria paid any attention to what
*  was happening at the single cell level. And so when we looked under our microscope, it was
*  absolutely bonkers what was going on. I mean, crazy. We took some optical micrographs that
*  showed videos of these things growing in microphilitic chips on our microscope.
*  And you would start with this perfect, you know, spherical round, totally normal looking cell.
*  And then you come back a little while later, and there are filamentous cells, branching cells,
*  huge things that I don't even know if it's a cell or a huge vesicle. And it's just crazy because we,
*  if we try to understand biochemically what's inside of these structures, what's stabilizing them,
*  what about the biophysics of the membrane, for example, leads to these? We don't actually know.
*  And all of this is happening in the background of us not even understanding what the division
*  mechanism is for these cells. Whenever I'm reading outside my own areas of expertise,
*  it's very helpful to have some expert guidance, like a good book club curated by someone who
*  knows what they're talking about. Literati book clubs provide exactly that. They have 12 unique
*  book clubs curated by people from Stephen Curry to Malala to Richard Branson. I personally am
*  involved in the Joseph Campbell book club. Now Joseph Campbell, admittedly not with us anymore,
*  but the Joseph Campbell Foundation picks a bunch of books in the general areas of myths and the
*  universal human experience, and then gives you one book a month so you can read along.
*  The curators will host exclusive interviews with the authors themselves where you can ask your
*  biggest questions and get the insider answers you won't find from any other book club. And all book
*  club members can shop the entire Literati library at discounts that are so deep they look like
*  cliffhangers with many books over 50% off. So reimagine what a book club can be. Redeem your
*  30-day trial for only 99 cents at literati.com slash mindscape. So head to literati.com slash
*  mindscape to learn more and read more with Literati. That's L-I-T-E-R-A-T-I dot com slash mindscape.
*  So your task was to fix the cell. So the Venter Institute had stripped away parts from a
*  mycoplasm and made a sort of minimal self-reproducing cell, but it didn't reproduce very
*  prettily and you wanted to sort of give it a little bit more coherence somehow. Is that fair?
*  I think that's fair and it's a mycoplasma and so you may or may not care for your purpose
*  whether the cell looks pretty at the single cell level. Your end goal might only want a
*  pretty minimal cell that gives you this normal looking colony. But if you're talking about
*  cellular engineering and you're talking about inserting new functions, inserting new genes,
*  understanding there are folks who are working on whole cell models of these cells to try to really
*  drill down and understand well what is each molecule doing? What is each gene product from
*  each gene doing so we can draw direct lines from genotype to phenotype and phenotype to gene?
*  That is to say from the DNA, the genotype, to the actual organism, the phenotype.
*  That's right. And so as an engineering tool, cell size and shape is one of the most basic
*  aspects of cellular life. Maybe we should understand this, guys.
*  And so, you know, JCPI had declared victory and in many ways it was a great victory. They
*  developed a lot of impressive techniques that have pushed the field forward. But I thought it
*  was really important and I'm glad they thought so also to take a closer look at division in these
*  cells and trying to understand these different phenotypes, these different morphologies, the
*  sizes and shapes. Let me actually back up because I think there's probably a lot of details here
*  that would be fascinating to the audience. I mean, when you say that you take the DNA in
*  one of these cells and you chop it up and you turn off or scramble some genes, number one,
*  how do you do that? I think that probably a lot of people have in mind that, you know,
*  you have tweezers and you stretch out the DNA and then you like chop off the ones you don't.
*  I mean, these are very tiny molecules, these DNAs.
*  This is a great point. And, you know, again, as a physicist, and I have a great interest in mechanical
*  systems, you know, I love thinking of tweezers. But in this case, the tweezers are, well, this is
*  what makes Lygis work in particular so heroic and the other scientists at JCPI, because they're the
*  ones who really develop the capability to reach into this minimal cell and genetically modify it.
*  So what you can do is, so first of all, actually, let's back up a little bit here.
*  Yeah, please.
*  So the minimal cell, I mentioned it was called JCPI-SYN 3.0. Well, there was a 1.0,
*  and 1.0 involved printing DNA on a machine. So this DNA had never been in a living organism.
*  And then what you do is you take a cell, make its DNA such that it's no longer expressible.
*  So essentially, you have a zombie cell now, you kind of take out its brain. You've got a zombie cell.
*  And then you take your printed synthetic DNA, the synthetic genome, and you kind of,
*  well, we don't know exactly how the genome transplantation process works.
*  This is something that's still an open question. But it does work. The yield isn't great.
*  So this is something that personally, I would like to work on more to understand, because I think
*  if we could print, just as an aside, if we could print any DNA we wanted and insert it into any
*  cell whose genome we've inactivated, think of what would be possible, because you wouldn't
*  have to go through any living intermediates. You wouldn't have to make these kind of adiabatic,
*  you know, incremental changes to your cell to arrive at what you want. You could just
*  print it.
*  3D print your life form.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyway.
*  But we can't, but we almost can. Is there some sort of hacky way of doing it probabilistically
*  or something? What do they do?
*  So we tried to do it in microfluidics, but the yield was too low for us to see what was happening.
*  But they think that part of the secret sauce is that you have your cells growing in a fluid
*  in there, basically in the broth that they grow in. And then you add a polymer
*  peg, polyethylene glycol, of a certain molecular weight at a certain time in the growth, at a
*  certain temperature, and the moon is in the right phase, and you've got the person doing
*  you as the magic hands. And by the way, magic hands are actually a broader issue with regard
*  to reproducibility in the biosciences. So it's a thing. And what happens is the peg makes cells
*  make cells kind of slam together. So they slam together with this DNA that you want inside of
*  them. We think there's something like a big syncytial cell that forms. And then at their
*  next growth cycle, they kind of divide apart. And so a syncytial cell is one where it has multiple
*  genomes inside of it. So think of all of these cells forming one big membrane together. And then
*  when they grow apart again, some will have the new genome that you've printed that's synthetic.
*  Some might have the old inactivated genome. But at any rate, once you grow them up, you now have
*  your zombie cells come back to life with the new genomes. And part of the process of putting
*  together these synthetic genomes was that Dan Gibson and folks divided that genome up into
*  different pieces. And because it's hard to manipulate a whole genome at once,
*  if you think of like, imagine a really, really long piece of cooked spaghetti, I mean, really
*  long, you know, and if you wanted to pick it up and move it somewhere, chances are it's going to
*  come apart in your hands, you might get some breaks or you might make it somewhere, right.
*  And all of that would mean if it were a genome that it's not going to express in the way that
*  she wants anymore. So they were able to manipulate this genome in yeast using very interesting
*  techniques that I don't fully understand, but I'm thankful that they did. And one of the reasons
*  I'm thankful is that one of those segments, we call this segment six, ended up having,
*  so first of all, these segments gave us candles for looking at the gene content in each of these
*  segments to try to understand, well, does this segment have the genes that affect shape and size?
*  Of the minimal cell. So one of these segments, segment six, actually, you know, so it did seem
*  to have these genes. And so what we could do then is narrow down our search to a much smaller number
*  of genes. And then through a much more systematic approach, you know, testing groups of genes and
*  then single genes, we drill down on seven genes that seem to together reconstitute
*  control of cell size and shape in the minimal cell. So now there's this JCVI SYN3A strain
*  that I think something like 43 different labs are using around the world to study the minimal cell.
*  So we call it a nearly minimal cell because it does have more genes than SYN 3.0.
*  But what you get in return is that you have cells that are much better behaved at the single cell
*  level. So you had what was judged to be the minimal cell, then you added in seven more genes,
*  and that helped it reproduce in an aesthetically pleasing way.
*  You know what the real kicker is here too? So those seven genes included two genes that are
*  known to be involved in cell division, FTSC and CEPA. But the next one is a hydrolase with
*  some unknown substrate, and then four of the genes, we have no idea what they do. We think
*  that they might encode membrane associated proteins, but we have no idea what they're doing.
*  So even in this most basic aspect of cell physiology, we run across these genes of unknown
*  function. And they are really an elephant in the room when you talk about these full cell models
*  people are trying to build, cellular engineering, or synthetic biology. There's so much of the genome
*  that we aren't able to tie back to some function. But you have convinced yourselves that if you
*  didn't include every one of these seven genes, it wouldn't do what you want it to do. So you're not
*  sure why, but you need all seven of these genes. That's right. And one thing we haven't mentioned
*  is that this is an absolute tour de force. This reverse genetics approach that we took,
*  since I got involved in the project, I think it was seven years until we published,
*  which is long, even for biology. It's short for particle physics, as you know.
*  So I'm going to ask the even dumber question that I ask for every cellular molecular
*  biotype person I have on the podcast. What do you mean when you say a gene? I know what a base pair
*  is in DNA. I have this vague feeling that a gene is a group of base pairs that does a thing.
*  But how do you operationally pick out which part of the DNA strand is the beginning of the gene,
*  and then the end of the gene? How do you figure that out?
*  Chris, this is a fantastic question. Personally, I rely on the experts in this area. This is not
*  my area of expertise. But there are databases you can go look at where people parse genomes.
*  It's not all settled, also. People might say that, well, you've got to group these together,
*  these base pairs together in order to form a gene that makes some protein. And then somebody
*  might come on and say, actually, you've got to shift it a little bit this way or that way.
*  That makes me feel better because I didn't understand it. So if it's not understood,
*  then I feel like less behind the curve a little bit.
*  I defer to the experts in this.
*  Okay, very good. And I probably should footnote something because I think I mentioned
*  the nucleus of a cell at the beginning. But of course, these are probably going to be
*  prokaryotic cells. There's no nuclei in them, right?
*  That's right. And I think that it would be a really interesting capability to take this
*  genome minimization process that's been demonstrated for this very simple obligate
*  parasite, this mycoplasma, and apply it to a eukaryote. So a cell that does have a nucleus,
*  maybe a yeast or maybe a mammalian cell, and see what we learn from that.
*  Okay.
*  Because this minimal cell, it isn't just a thing, right? It's not just JCVI, SYN3A, and we're done.
*  It's also a whole repertoire of tools and tricks and measurements that we can apply to any number
*  of biological systems.
*  And how many genes total in this minimal cell?
*  So JCVI SYN3A has 493 protein encoding genes. And just for reference, an E. coli has about
*  4,400 genes and humans have about 20,000. Although I think that's, we're still sorting that out.
*  But then there are other, there are like dandelions or whatever that have way more
*  than human beings, right? Like human beings are not the maximum number of genes or anything close.
*  No, but you know, it's a natural point of reference for us.
*  Sure. Oh, yes. Absolutely. But I don't want to put us too much on our high horses. We're not the
*  most numbered. We're actually kind of more efficient in some ways, right? Than some organisms.
*  Well, I appreciate your comments, but I actually do want to put us on our high horses for a second
*  here. Because when I was talking about the genome minimization process, I mentioned that there were
*  these sort of arbitrary criteria that you're minimizing with respect to. And one thing that
*  I find so fascinating about the creation of, you know, proto-lites, synthetic cells,
*  minimal cells is how much of a scientist just unavoidably ends up in that process and in that
*  product, right? It's almost like it's an art form in some ways, or a mirror, where we're using this
*  new medium of synthetic biology or engineered biological systems to hold a mirror up to ourselves.
*  And I'm hoping that because there's sort of two ways to get past the n equals one problem of
*  biological systems. So just to back up here a second, one of the challenges of creating
*  synthetic life is that when we look around us, we really only have one example of cellular life,
*  and that's what's evolved here on Earth. So there's two ways, I think, that, two main ways,
*  where we could get more examples. One could be to go out and find it somewhere else. Hopefully,
*  we'll recognize it. The other way is for us to build it. I'm hoping that we're not so biased by
*  ourselves and ourselves that we aren't able to imagine what else could be possible. And this
*  also brings me back then to your question about the rules of life and what are they.
*  And I think so much is unknown here that as we go about engineering biological systems,
*  it's almost as if we're not limited by the fundamental physics of it, right? The laws
*  of the universe of it. At this point, it's almost like we're limited by our imaginations.
*  The minimal cell that you mentioned with almost 500 genes, I presume that once again,
*  we have a high degree of confidence that if we removed any one of them, it wouldn't work
*  anymore, right? That's what it means to be minimal. That's right. And I should note that
*  there are about 100 genes of unknown function left in that cell. So we don't know what they do,
*  but we know that if we didn't have them, things would go wrong. That's right. There are also,
*  some subtleties in this too. So imagine if you have an airplane and you want to take parts off
*  that airplane until it's not able to fly anymore. So let's say that I remove an engine, but I'm going
*  to say that's not essential because I've got another engine. But what if I remove both engines?
*  So the process is sort of path dependent with your physicists. So it matters how you get there
*  to the minimal cell. And you can find yourself accidentally deleting genes that were essential.
*  Like we did when we developed 3.0 and we needed to put genes back in to get control of cell size
*  and shape. And even though the actual DNA was synthesized, if I understand it correctly,
*  it was all based on real genes that appeared in living organisms. No one is yet going in and
*  building base pair by base pair new functional genes. Is that right? Wow, that would be incredible
*  if we could do that. We are not there yet. Okay. But you know, this point out that there are a
*  number of challenges still. And for minimal cells, I think that we need to know what these, we need
*  to learn what these genes of unknown function are doing. I think that we need to arrive at a
*  more genetically tractable minimal cell. And what I mean by that is that we have tools where not just
*  the properly indoctrinated and practiced folks at JCVI, but anyone is able to very easily genetically
*  modify these cells. So right now they put something called landing pads into the genome
*  where you can add genes easily at those places. So that does help a lot. But for right now, if you
*  want to delete genes, you have to go through this docking the genome and yeast, manipulating it there,
*  and then go do this genome transplantation process to arrive at the modified genome. Now for right now,
*  there aren't so many people working with this cell that JCVI won't generously offer to
*  help you with this. But at a certain point, I think our hope is that more folks will take up this
*  system. Because there's so much to learn and there's so much to know. Clearly, yeah.
*  Yeah. Other challenges for the minimal cell is how do we generalize that minimization workflow
*  for other organisms? And then what is close to my heart, because I work at the National Institute
*  of Standards and Technology. So I'm a metrologist. I study the science of measurement. I would like
*  it if we could make it easier to measure the current minimal cell. So this thing is really
*  small. It's about the same size as the wavelength of light. So it's really hard to see.
*  And so I was talking with my collaborators and I said, Well, can we just make this thing bigger?
*  Yeah. If we really can just engineer the size and shape, can we just make it bigger? Well, maybe.
*  Are there techniques to swell the cell? Or? Yeah. So if this set of genes is needed, we think
*  minimally, at least it is, let's say, a minimal set, right? Like if we removed anything from that
*  set, like you say, it wouldn't work anymore. But maybe there's another set that is containing
*  different genes that also has the feature that if you removed anything, it wouldn't work either,
*  right? I mean, maybe there's more than one way to be minimal. That's so important. And I'm so glad
*  you brought that up. Because this is why I want to focus on that workflow of minimization. Because I
*  think at the end of the day, can I say this? I don't want to get into much trouble. But
*  microplasma is not that useful for people. Yeah, it's good as a research platform.
*  But it's, it's not that useful. And so if we can empower people to make minimal versions of their
*  own cells of interest, minimized according to their own criteria, imagine what we could learn.
*  I think it would be really empowering. And even if this particular species is, like you say,
*  not that useful, can we nevertheless relate this set of genes, the 400 and some genes in this cell,
*  are these same genes elsewhere? Do they also exist in other kinds of cells? So we feel like
*  this is an instruction set that is common to all kinds of life? Or is it not? That's true for a lot
*  of the genes that are in the cell. And this is a common technique that cell biologists use,
*  where they look at related organisms, or even not so related organisms, and try to guess what the
*  function of different genes or proteins is. And this is, this is one of the reasons why it's a
*  little vexing that we still don't understand the mechanism behind cell division in these cells.
*  Because we can't point to a mechanism from so far from another cell and say, Oh, our mycoplasma
*  is dividing like that other cell. But you know, one reason why mycoplasma was chosen
*  is that it comes pre-minimized by nature as an obligate parasite. So it's been kind of singled
*  out for a while as a candidate hydrogen atom of biology. And I want to mention too, that this
*  idea of a minimal cell is really not new. I mean, way back in ancient times, you know, philosophers
*  love to think about the building blocks of matter, including life. But more recently, in the 20th
*  century, I believe the 1930s, a bunch of scientists got together, physicists were involved, I think,
*  even in the leadership role, and they decided that a minimal cell could exist. And you know what,
*  maybe it ought to exist. So because it can do three things for us, and it still can do three
*  things for us, it can tell us maybe how cellular life came to be, maybe we can learn something
*  about the history of life. It might offer a platform for understanding life today. So for
*  understanding the present cellular life, including ourselves. And more recently, especially with the
*  work that I've become involved in, I think that it can offer a platform for the future, for what life
*  could be. And more specifically, you know, what could we engineer cellular life to be? We're at
*  this really exciting time where we have the ability to hopefully soon make lineage agnostic life. And
*  this is a term that I'm stealing from Drew Endy at Stanford. Okay, I heard him use this term, and
*  it was just such an eye opener for me. Because up until now, every cell has come from another cell.
*  But now, that doesn't need to be the case anymore. Right. So what does that mean? What do we do with
*  that? How do we understand that? I mean, you actually raise a challenge that I hadn't quite
*  appreciated before about the origin of life, which you mentioned something that we can try
*  to learn something about. If the minimal cell has almost 500 genes, and genes have lots of base pairs
*  in them, that sounds like there's quite a gap to be bridged from a bunch of macromolecules to a living
*  functioning cellular organism. Yeah. It's, it's gonna be a while yet, I think. And so stay tuned,
*  you know, hopefully in our lifetimes, we'll get there. And this gap is one that we're trying to
*  close from both ends, right? We're using this bottom up approach and this top down approach.
*  And the challenge that the bottom up folks have, I know I shouldn't be favorites, maybe I am here
*  a little bit, but the bottom up folks, they there hasn't been success yet. And so it's very difficult
*  to focus their efforts. Whereas if we start from something that's already alive,
*  we're good at killing things. Yeah. Or even injuring them. Yes. One way forward, I think,
*  in the top down approach is to use those capabilities of automation in a laboratory
*  machine learning to make lots of different versions of the genomically minimal cell,
*  and then put them in lots of different environments, because they're minimized in
*  a specific environment, right? You can't separate those two, right? In the same way that,
*  you know, we're nice and alive in our offices right now, breathing the air around us. You take
*  that away. And, you know, you might say, well, maybe they're missing the gene that they need.
*  Well, but really, you just needed something in your environment. Right. But if we can, if we can,
*  massively parallelize and automate this process of minimization, maybe that's a path forward
*  for learning new and interesting things about the minimal cell. Maybe that addresses what I
*  was going to ask next, which is, we have this minimal cell with 400 some genes. And as you've
*  very provocatively emphasized, we don't know what some of them do. How do we how are we going to
*  learn that? Is it just a matter of like taking one by one and seeing what fails or because they do
*  interact with each other in such crucial ways? Do we need to be more subtle than that? You know,
*  up until now, learning the function of each gene, it's really been hard one. And I've experienced
*  that personally with these seven genes that we've identified in the minimal cell over I even made a
*  t shirt and said seven genes seven years. All right, you need to speed things up a little bit,
*  I guess. You know what we really do. And now that we've gone through this process once,
*  there are all kinds of things that we would do to speed it up, use automation, use proper design of
*  experiments. So for you biologists out there, or other folks who don't know that this is a thing,
*  please know this is a thing. Yeah. Where you can more efficiently design your experiments to
*  get better answers out of a fewer number of trials. We can do that we can work with our machine
*  learning colleagues to interpret the data. Because numbers are great. But if you can't
*  get any meaning from them, you know, what are they worth? Yeah. And this might be jumping outside of
*  what we've been talking about. But there's the issue of how the genes come together to make a
*  reproducing cell. But then there's also in bigger organisms, the issue of how cells come together
*  to make an organism and you know, cells differentiate in interesting ways. Are there
*  is there a parallel track where we get to learn about how cells interact to make like morphology
*  and things like that, based on what genes they have? So even just last week, I was at a conference
*  with those folks. So it's there's this whole ecosystem of different groups of researchers.
*  And, you know, I have spent some time having interesting conversations and interactions with
*  the build a cell folks and the minimal cell folks and the synthetic cell folks. But then
*  there's also the tissue engineering folks who interface with the stem cell differentiation
*  folks and the organoid folks and the soft robotics folks. And, you know, you can kind of step your
*  way through all of these adjacent related very interesting fields. And it's just the most fun
*  you can have. And I'm hoping we can all learn from each other because you're absolutely right.
*  At the end of the day, wouldn't it be fantastic if we could build capabilities, not just at the
*  cellular level, but also at the multicellular level, so that we can engineer life at all scales.
*  And, you know, even extend it a little bit further to become much better at interfacing
*  biotic and abiotic systems. So I glean from your answer that even though this will be very,
*  very exciting, and we should try to do it, we don't know that much yet. We did have Michael
*  Levin on the podcast from Tufts, and he talked a little bit about how organisms seem to have some
*  kind of memory of what their shape was supposed to be. Like if you move the eye of something,
*  it'll move back and so forth. But roughly speaking, I get the impression this is all
*  kind of mysterious. We don't know, even if we don't know how a specific cell regenerates happily,
*  then knowing how a macroscopic organism is going to do that, it's going to be a much harder challenge.
*  How wonderful that there are these interesting questions for us to investigate.
*  You know, there's fantastic progress in all of these areas. Again, I'm not the best person to
*  speak to them. I guess I'll just put an advertisement for the life of a scientist here
*  and just invite anybody just warmly, please come investigate these with us. It's a wonderful
*  community. It's a wonderful community. And everybody's ways of thinking about different
*  ideas and approaching the problems, they all bring a unique perspective. And clearly the way
*  we've been thinking about it so far with the information we have, we're not there yet. And so
*  maybe you can come and bring your ideas and lead us all to the aha moment.
*  Good. So let's get back to the cell or the individual cells. So you've hinted at the idea
*  that one of the motivations for building this minimal cell is that we can then deminimalize
*  it. We can sort of do things with it. We can start adding things that we want it to do. So
*  what are your favorite potential applications? And we can be a little speculative here. Like,
*  this is not a grant proposal review. We're thinking about what the future might hold.
*  This is a great time for me to put in the obligatoriness disclaimer. So nothing I say
*  here represents an official position of the US government or implies endorsement of any company,
*  commercial product or service. All right. Very good. So in some ways, what we're talking about
*  here is, and I'm going to use this term on purpose, even though it is provocative,
*  is this idea of gain of function. So typically people use that term around infectious disease
*  research. But if you take it literally, gain of function is engineering biology. And if you talk
*  about building a minimal cell or life from scratch, that's almost the ultimate gain of function
*  research. So I'm imagining that we learn enough and maybe the minimal cell gives us a path forward
*  for this, where we can build up best practices, maybe some rules, design rules, rules of thumb,
*  protocols where for different classes of function, we understand how to put those back into the cell,
*  which functions play nicely together and which don't. How do we manage resource utilization in
*  the cell? And all of these bring us back to that idea of control in biology. And you've been using
*  the term engineering biology and cellular engineering, but unless and until we have
*  a rigorous control engineering or biological systems, it's kind of an aspirational title.
*  Okay. Good. To say that it's engineering. And so one thing that my lab works on is building sensors.
*  So if you imagine a control loop, let's say, one that you might be familiar with from the cruise
*  control in your car or the thermostat in your house, what you have is you have some desired
*  output of a system and there's a controller, then that controller might do something to actuate
*  some change in the system that leads to some output. Well, if you can close that loop with
*  a sensor with something that measures that output, you can then feed that error back in
*  to the controller to make sure that you stay at your desired output. So what my lab does is it
*  uses biological parts to make living measurement systems or sensors inside of cells because
*  biology is measuring itself all the time. It seems like we ought to be able to make measurement tools
*  out of biology also. Okay. So when you started talking about that with the thermostat analogy,
*  I was going to ask, well, so why have biological sensors if we have perfectly good physical ones?
*  But I guess you've already answered it because you said you're putting them inside the cell. So
*  what are you trying to sense inside the cell? If it gets sick or if it's stressed or if it's happy?
*  Absolutely. You're spot on. So I want to give a shout out to you, to the communities who
*  are trying to put miniaturized physical sensors inside of cells. So they look like nanomachines or
*  all kinds of great and interesting things. And that maybe falls more under the biotic-abiotic
*  interfacing research at the cellular level. Now for us, we're engineering proteins, for example,
*  to measure small molecules in a cell's environment. Or you can imagine measuring the stress state of a
*  cell. And one place where this matters is imagine that you have a company and you're growing vats of
*  bacteria that you've engineered to make a small molecule product or a medicine. And so you might
*  want to know, because you've got a lot of money tied up in that bat. And as we know, biology
*  can do strange things sometimes for inexplicable reasons, because we don't understand it well
*  enough yet. So you might want to have sensors built in so that if you have a physical sensor
*  outside of the cell, you might just know that maybe the pH is off or the yield of your product
*  has changed in a way that you're unhappy with. But imagine having a sensor in each cell. In fact,
*  imagine having that control loop in each cell so that when the yield output from that cell
*  does something you don't like, that actuator in that control loop then kicks that cell into
*  becoming a high producer again, so that you can maximize your profits and then fund more research
*  with your profits. So that is bringing it closer to this true goal of engineering rather than just
*  building an individual cell, putting it to work in more specific ways. You can think of biology
*  as one of the most advanced manufacturing platforms that we can imagine. And there's a place, of course,
*  for industry the way that we've built it up up until now. But imagine if we could grow our
*  products the same way we grow corn. Or imagine instead of a 3D printer that uses melted plastic
*  in your house, you have something that looks more like a bread maker and you actually grow the products
*  that you want. There are lots of visions here. And I think that we don't know yet what it's going
*  to look like. Presumably. Well, so for one thing, I want to get on the table that as far as you know,
*  no one is putting 5G networks into vaccines or anything like that, right? Because it sounds very
*  close. No, no one is. And the vaccines the way they are now are just such a marvel of
*  of biotechnology. I'm almost personally offended that you're almost minimizing this achievement
*  by saying that not you, but one people. The conspiracy theorists, yeah. But at the same time,
*  there's absolutely nothing wrong with questioning technology. If you don't question, if you don't
*  feel like you can ask, then how will you learn? But I presume that fighting disease would be an
*  obvious target for these engineered cells. Absolutely. So there are cellular therapies
*  out there already. You have CAR T therapies. And this idea, so I want to be clear here that
*  the idea of control is important because that in one important way because that leads to safety.
*  So if you know you have a well controlled cell, now you can be more confident about selling a
*  cellular product. And you can be more confident that every cell that you sell to someone is going
*  to behave in exactly the way you programmed so that you're actually curing someone's cancer
*  instead of giving them cancer. Right. Kind of important. Yes. You know, and we're used to,
*  again, I'm going to go back to an airplane, we're used to stepping on airplanes and being confident
*  that we're going to arrive safely. And I would love it if we could get to the point where we
*  don't even think about cellular engineering or engineering biology as separate from just engineering
*  because it's so predictable, it's so reliable, so robust, it's so safe. And it's such an integral
*  part of making people's lives better. Because that's what we're after at the end of the day.
*  Well, as a good example of that, quite a while back, I heard a famous scientist speculate about
*  the possibility that we would be able to engineer cells, monocelular organisms that we could release
*  into the atmosphere and they would eat up CO2 to help solve global warming or something like that.
*  Now, obviously, there is a problem with the runaway. You don't want to get away with all
*  the CO2 in the atmosphere. But beyond diseases in our bodies, is that kind of large scale
*  engineering something that we could imagine as part of the future of cellular engineering?
*  I think people are imagining that. And there are people out there thinking about how to best bring
*  to bear biotechnologies to any of the big challenges we face collectively. And climate
*  change is, of course, one of them. Food security is another. Reshoring our supply chains is another.
*  And you don't necessarily need to release cells to get them to gobble up CO2 for you. Why not change
*  our bio manufacturing processes so that they are carbon neutral or carbon negative? Up until now,
*  we've very much been limited by energy. We've been worried about how much energy does it take
*  to manufacture something. But what if we switched our thinking and thought instead about, well,
*  how much carbon? What's the carbon budget of my manufacturing process? People are engineering
*  plants or trying to figure out better ways of growing plants so that they lock more CO2,
*  for example, in bigger root structures. And so over time, you're sequestering more.
*  There are a lot of ways to think about doing this that don't necessarily go straight to
*  just blanket the globe in it.
*  OK. And the other potential application that I've heard a little bit about, which I want
*  you to comment on, is building either little robots or computers out of either DNA or cells.
*  And my own questions about this, but maybe I'll let you say, is that one of the
*  things that you can imagine we're going to be pursuing?
*  I think that the idea is one that is worthwhile. I don't know that it's going to look like
*  computers that we have already. I mean, silicon is very good at what it does,
*  but biology is not silicon. And one of the things my lab is working on is, you know,
*  we were building these sensors, but then how do we process that information from the sensor?
*  So up until now, a lot of folks have been working on Boolean logic inside of cells.
*  So that's very similar to the kinds of logic that your computer is doing.
*  But there are other ways that we know to make computers think.
*  What if we could put a different kind of information processing inside of cells?
*  Maybe we could. So for example, there are folks who use DNA strand displacement circuits to
*  make neural network-like computations. Could we put that inside of living cells?
*  Maybe we wouldn't use DNA. Maybe we would use a different kind of biomolecule.
*  So there are different ways of thinking about how to put information processing inside of cells.
*  The cells are doing it all the time. So maybe we should start instead of by trying to jam
*  computers into cells, maybe we should just invite this cell to tea and say,
*  cell, tell me about yourself. How are you processing information?
*  This goes back historically to this rift between physics and biology. When I was a young scientist,
*  the physicists were great at going up to biologists and saying, we're here to solve it for you.
*  Well, that's no way to make friends.
*  I think what we're seeing now is people coming together and taking a moment to really learn what
*  the other knows, see the value in it, and try to put together the quantitative approaches from
*  physics and engineering with the incredible descriptive knowledge that we find in biology.
*  Well, and something that one of the reasons why I was questioning this particular goal is because
*  as a physicist, I'm impressed by the fact that the environment inside a cell is so very, very
*  different than the environment that we have in our daily lives or in a computer, right?
*  The thermal motions of molecules are huge compared to other things that are going on. It's a very
*  noisy, hard to be predictable environment. Does that get in the way of trying to build
*  computer-like things on those scales? I prefer to think of it as a feature instead of a bug.
*  I think you have to be willing to see it not as a liability but as an asset. In a previous life,
*  I built small nanofluidic staircases and crammed long DNA molecules in very tight confinement at
*  the top of the staircase, and they would walk. Basically, they would jiggle around in this
*  environment and they would entropoporese. There's an entropy gradient for the DNA molecule in this
*  staircase, and they would come out and we were thinking about, well, who cares about this? It's
*  kind of a cool widget, I suppose. It's like a slinky going down the staircase?
*  Nano-slinky, absolutely. When I came to engineering biology, I never really lost
*  that vision of molecules moving in ways that seem controlled but are driven by random processes.
*  Right.
*  How are biological systems arranging themselves such that they're taking full advantage of the
*  biophysics or just the physics, the thermodynamics of what's happening in their system? If I were a
*  cell, I would probably be lazy. I wouldn't want to use more energy than I would need. I would want
*  to harness everything that is just going to happen naturally with minimal effort.
*  When I think about minimal life, and I know that Jeremy England has also talked a lot about this,
*  how would I harness the various gradients that I'm experiencing anyway and then only modify those
*  that are worth it to me because they give me some fitness advantage?
*  In some sense, this is a place where the relationship between energy and information
*  comes to light. Even I've written papers about this. This is a frontier right now,
*  statistical physics, non-equilibrium dynamics. There is some sense in which biological organisms
*  use information to do work, to make things happen. I've always been curious and I have no strong
*  opinions about when that happens. At what point do you say, oh, this is using information rather
*  than this is just rolling down a hill in a mindless way? Do you know the answer to that
*  or do you have opinions about it? I love talking about this stuff. Again, I defer to the experts.
*  I would love to sit down and think about different experiments. As we think about our
*  capabilities with putting together engineered systems, whether we might use an element of
*  nanotechnology in our experimental design, a little biology, whatever pieces you want to put
*  together to control the system in a way that you're able to ask and answer very cleanly
*  some of these questions that you're posing. I think we just need to find the right people
*  who have the right friends with all of these expertise together. I don't know yet what those
*  experiments would look like, but I think they're coming. It sounds like a good topic for a workshop
*  at the Santa Fe Institute. I might have to propose something like this. Sign me up.
*  All right. Very, very good. The last topic I wanted to talk about, unless you want to
*  put others on the table, is we've been talking about cells the whole time, but in fact,
*  I get the impression that a fraction of your research is on the idea of cell-free synthetic
*  biology, like break out of the boundaries of the cellular membrane but still do biology. What is
*  that even all about? Great question. I mentioned earlier that you can consider life on a spectrum.
*  If you have a spectrum with chemistry on one end and a full-blown naturally evolved mammalian cell
*  on the other end, a human cell, there's a lot of space in the middle. If we walk along that spectrum,
*  we might find we could go from chemistry to something called a pure system where people
*  have reconstituted certain molecules and you can get protein expression. If you walk a little
*  further, there are folks who grind up cells or mush them up and get rid of all the spatial organization
*  and just keep the components in a tube and can express proteins or do other things with that.
*  It can still do biology even though you've smushed its organization to smithereens.
*  For example, then you can keep walking down that spectrum and you come to a minimal cell and
*  etc. But to stop at the cell-free system, it's such a bad name, but there it is. Sometimes they're
*  called cell-free expression systems or transcription translation systems. These are all words to go
*  Google TXTL systems. What's really nice about them is they allow you to use the machinery of biology
*  without that set system needing to be alive. For example, if you're making a product,
*  you don't need to figure out how to transport that product outside of the cell across a membrane to
*  then go separate it out and sell it to someone. You can start thinking about doing chemistries
*  that would be lethal to a cell and the cell-free system might not care. The whole system is open
*  and so you can literally just stick your pipette or in and put more of whatever you want into it.
*  More energy, more molecules to more precursor or whatever you want. You can just stick it in.
*  People are using cell-free systems as a bio-manufacturing platform for these reasons.
*  Another way people are using cell-free systems is as a stop along the design, build, test,
*  learn cycle. It's a workflow in biology. If you're engineering biology, that's one way to think about
*  your workflow. I might start by saying, well, I want a cell that does x, function x. I'm going
*  to design the DNA. I'm going to order it from the DNA store. It's going to come to me. I'm going to
*  assemble it and I'm going to put it into a cell. For example, I might put it on a plasmid and
*  subject myself to a high voltage such that the membrane breaks down partially and the DNA goes in
*  and I electro-chlorate it. Then let's see if we get function x. Well, very often,
*  you don't. What went wrong? In the meantime, you've been going through this workflow where
*  you've been waiting for cells to grow. That takes time. It's much faster if you can take
*  an intermediate stop and use a cell-free system to just quickly test your DNA because it doesn't have
*  to grow. You've got your cell booth in your minus 80 freezer. Just pull some of that out that you've
*  made previously. Put your DNA in and say, well, does it glow? Can I do a test that will tell me
*  that I can be reasonably certain this is going to work in vivo if I test it out first in vitro?
*  The idea is that it would make your workflow faster because you're not needing to do everything
*  in cells. Now, just like for cells, we don't have a great understanding of everything that is in that
*  cell-free system often, especially if it's lysate-based. If you're making it from the guts of real
*  cells, people are working on it. We do have some good models, but there's room for improvement.
*  Yes.
*  This makes me think about, once again, this origin of life question. Typically,
*  when I wrote in my book, The Big Picture about the origin of life, I repeated what I was told,
*  which is that you need compartmentalization, reproduction, and metabolism to qualify for life.
*  Compartmentalization always seemed like the odd one out there. I can see what the advantages are,
*  but the necessity was a little bit more obscure. Following what you said at the beginning of the
*  podcast that we should be open-minded about other kinds of life, could we imagine that if we go to
*  other planets, life does not happen in cells, but it's just more of a continuum that smushes
*  together in interesting ways? I think that's a wonderful thing to think about. Some folks
*  think that life might have arisen in rocks where there are very small chambers.
*  I think there's also a lot of room in engineering biology for figuring out how to put back in
*  engineered compartmentalization or ways where you can gather up molecules of interest in
*  closer proximity so that they react in ways that are more advantageous for you. That might look
*  like some of the really interesting liquid-liquid phase transition work that folks have been doing
*  inside of cells. Other folks are using microfluidic and nanofluidic chips
*  where you have these very small channels in say glass or silicon where you're confining
*  biomolecules, maybe a cell-free system, and looking at how those behave under this
*  engineered confinement. Also, spreading it out on chip gives you an easy way to image,
*  to measure what's happening. I think there are different ways people are going about
*  influencing or engineering back in something like cellular confinement or nanoscale confinement.
*  There's too many good things that you dropped in there in terms of
*  questions we don't yet know the answer to. I remember once, I told this story before,
*  so maybe it appeared on the podcast, but I invited a biologist, Bonnie Bassler from Princeton,
*  to come to give the physics colloquium at Caltech. She was talking about bacteria and quorum sensing
*  and my graduate students afterward were just shaking their heads with like,
*  it's so easy to find questions we don't know the answer to in biology, but we can do experiments
*  to try to answer. In particle physics, as you know, it's just harder. It's a more mature field.
*  I'm very excited about the frontiers that you're working on.
*  It's a great time to be in this field. I do want to mention that as a physicist, I very much grew
*  up in the shadow of some of the physics greats who were involved in bringing about the nuclear age.
*  This is the cautionary tale that we're all taught. I'm very optimistic that
*  synthetic biologists, engineering biologists will learn from history and think long and hard,
*  not just about what we could do, but what we should do. The stakes are so high for us. We
*  have to build trust if we're going to arrive at a future where we can all thrive. I remember,
*  there's another story that I've often told. I do science consulting for Hollywood and my wife,
*  Jennifer, was the director of a consulting organization. She set up for a movie a bunch
*  of scientists that were tasked with if we wanted to build a terrible plague, a viral plague that
*  would kill a lot of people, what would we do? The scientists came together. They came out going like,
*  oh, we could totally do this. I think physics has sort of passed that threshold where the research
*  that is going on in fundamental physics now, Higgs bosons or dark matter or string theory or
*  whatever, is not in any danger of being weaponized in any moment. That baton has been passed
*  to fundamental biology where the number of things that could happen is pretty scary.
*  I always like to end the podcast on optimistic notes. Give us your most optimistic reading of
*  how the future is going to become better because of synthetic biology and engineering biology.
*  My hope is that our ability to apply biotechnologies to make people's lives better
*  then it might look like new kinds of therapeutics. We've already seen it in new kinds of
*  vaccines and cellular therapies. I'm hoping that it gives more people more access to ways of making
*  things. You might have heard of the biofab movement. If you have maker labs where people
*  have a lot of tools for working with plastics and metal electronics, extend that to biological
*  systems as well. At the end of the day, we're biological. It's so important for us to make
*  sure that everybody has access to what we need to keep ourselves healthy and happy. Clean air,
*  clean water, healthy and nutritious food. There's so much upside to biotechnologies here. Again,
*  I think that we're limited by our imaginations. Then after that, how do we want to prioritize
*  what we could do so that it works for everyone? Things are happening very, very rapidly. It's fun
*  to look at the progress in real time. It is important, as you emphasized, to at the same time
*  take a step back and think carefully about whether we're doing the right thing as we're
*  doing all these fun things. Elizabeth Strachalski, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thank you. It's been great fun.
