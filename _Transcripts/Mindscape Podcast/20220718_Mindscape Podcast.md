Recent years have seen a revolution in the study of exoplanets, planets that orbit stars other than the Sun (or don’t orbit stars at all). After a few tentative detections in the 1990s, dedicated instruments in the 2000s have now pushed the number of known exoplanets into the thousands, enough to begin to categorize their distribution and properties. Today’s guest is John Asher Johnson, one of the leaders in this field. We talk about the various different ways that exoplanets can be detected, what we know about them know, and what might happen in the future.

John Asher Johnson received his Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley. He is currently professor of astronomy at Harvard University. He is the founder and director of the Banneker Institute for summer undergraduate research. Among his awards are the Newton Lacy Pierce Prize from the American Astronomical Society. He is the author of How Do You Find an Exoplanet?

# Mindscape 204 | John Asher Johnson on Hunting for Exoplanets
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyKE923Xz5w)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. The thing about
*  science, as with many other intellectual areas, is that there are a whole bunch of interesting
*  questions out there, and the questions linger on, but the rate at which we make progress
*  on different questions is highly variable. We can have a question sitting around for
*  a very long time and not a lot of progress is made, and then suddenly things change extremely
*  rapidly. So there are fields of science, really tiny or really big subfields, that are undergoing
*  tremendous revolutions even as we speak, and one of these is the study of exoplanets, planets
*  around stars other than our sun. When I was in graduate school, we didn't have any exoplanets.
*  None had actually been discovered. These days, over 5,000 exoplanets have been discovered.
*  So there's a lot to say about this whole science, not just what the exoplanets are, what their
*  characteristics are, but of course we're going to care about the possibility of life on other
*  planets. But let's not skip right to the weird stuff about life and aliens and things
*  like that. Let's get down and dirty. Let's ask, how do you go about finding exoplanets
*  in the first place? Today's guest, John Asher Johnson, literally wrote the book on this subject.
*  He's the author of How Do You Find an Exoplanet, which is sort of a semi-technical book. If
*  you are happy with a couple of algebraic equations, you'll get a lot out of it. And in the book,
*  he goes over all sorts of different ways, because there's more than one method for finding planets
*  around other stars. You can look at the wobbles of the stars. You can look at transits, little
*  eclipses. You can look at gravitational lensing and so forth. We now have not just planets that
*  we found with telescopes based here on Earth, but also missions on satellites that are dedicated
*  to finding new planets. And as I'm recording this, we're in the process of ramping up the James Webb
*  Space Telescope, JWST, which will be really, really able to examine exoplanets with much higher
*  precision than we've ever done before. So finding them is one thing. Studying them is yet another
*  one. So I talked with John about where we are, how we got there, where we're going to go in the
*  near future in the study of exoplanets. And it really is transformative. It really is both a
*  combination of having better technology to show things that we suspected were true all along,
*  and also, as is very typical in science, being surprised, finding out that what we expected was
*  not exactly what is out there. There are a wider variety of planets out there than we initially
*  guessed. I mean, to be fair to us, we only had the solar system as our data point. So there is a
*  menagerie, a different kinds of planetary systems, and they're all over the place. We're just beginning,
*  even though we have 5,000 planets, that's a very, very tiny fraction of all of them. So this is a
*  new kind of science, a new science that we're beginning to learn at in an exciting new way.
*  You can get in on the ground floor by listening to this podcast. While I have you here, I will
*  mention that we have recently launched a scholarship program, the Mindscape Big Picture
*  Scholarship. If you want to learn more about it, go to bold.org, B-O-L-D.org, slash scholarships,
*  slash mindscape. And so the idea is we are crowdsourcing funding so you can contribute.
*  I've contributed. And what's going to happen is every year, at least this year, hopefully in years
*  to come, we're going to pick one person who wants to have a little bit of help going to college to
*  study the biggest questions. So, you know, not applied stuff, not things that are going to be
*  better in the short term for them and their families, although that's very important. The
*  biggest, hardest questions of physics, philosophy, biology, neuroscience, all of these different
*  areas. So if you want to study that, you can apply for the Big Picture Scholarship and one
*  winner will be chosen every year to get $10,000 to help defer their college tuition costs. Now,
*  I say one winner will be chosen. That's only if we only get that much money by the way of donations.
*  We have made our first goal. We have 10K. So we will be giving out a scholarship this year
*  but we're continuing to raise money. So maybe we can help more than one person or maybe we can
*  roll it over to future years. So please, if you have any interest, go to bold.org slash scholarships
*  slash mindscape and contribute. I'd like to think that maybe somebody who is going to get this
*  scholarship will be nudged towards asking these big picture questions. Maybe they'll discover a
*  planet. Maybe they'll discover life on other planets. Maybe they'll figure out how life began
*  in the first place. I don't know but we can at least put our money a little bit in a direction
*  of making that happen. So with that, let's go.
*  Don Johnson, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Oh, thank you for having me.
*  So I gotta say, when I was in grad school, we didn't have any exoplanets. We knew that there
*  was something we wanted to look for. And in fact, when I was in grad school was exactly when they
*  first started saying, yeah, maybe there's some evidence out there but now there's thousands of
*  them. So let's just put things in context. Give us the very broad overview of how far we've come
*  in the last mumble-de-mumble years since I was a grad student.
*  Yeah, yeah. So I think things have evolved rapidly and often quite wildly by studying
*  exoplanets full of surprises. And so I guess maybe I can put this in the context of what
*  the paradigm was back then when planets were first discovered and think about how that has shifted.
*  I think back then the idea of what planets around other stars might look like was
*  formed largely by our own solar system. And so, you know, hundreds of years of noticing that
*  the planets are coplanar and they move in almost perfectly circular orbits made it natural to
*  believe that like, okay, yeah, they almost formed out of flattened disk dust and gas.
*  And that the big planets are further out and the little planets were closer in, that also made sense
*  for that formation scenario. And so everybody expected to when you're not looking for planets,
*  if you ever did look for planets, you would expect to find things like our solar system.
*  And in 1995, that just turned everything on its head because the first planet that was found was
*  about the same mass as Jupiter, but it had a three-day orbit, not a 12-year orbit, but a,
*  you know, three-day orbit. And that was instantaneously, you know, like who ordered
*  that? Where did that come from? I guess we better go to the drawing board. And I think
*  it's just a science that grew up surprising, changing the way that we think about planets
*  and then ultimately our own planet and ourselves. And so where are we now? How many planets have we
*  found roughly? I think we just crossed the 5,000 mark. 5,000 exoplanets. So and is that
*  steady progress or are there going to be sort of leaps when we get new technologies or new
*  satellites or whatever? Historically, there have been leaps when new technology and I think it's
*  really interesting with the field of exoplanets in particular is that it, you know, when you think
*  of astronomy, you think about like getting to bigger and bigger and bigger telescopes, you know,
*  you're looking at things that are harder and harder and harder to see and study. And so like
*  cutting edge of astrophysics has always been like, oh, what's the next big telescope? Oh,
*  30 meters. Oh my God. But a lot of what's done with exoplanets is that as the field has matured
*  and grown better at, you know, as astronomers have grown better at what they do, they're finding
*  that we actually need smaller telescopes. Let's get like, let's get 10 centimeters. That's okay.
*  That sounds about right. And it's, but really the technological advance was not necessarily the
*  diameter of the telescope. It was the just the focus and the dedication of that telescope's mission.
*  And so I think what we're finding, that's the way exoplanets has evolved is that, you know,
*  we're in this era of dedicated NASA missions that do nothing else but this one way of looking at
*  and that's what's led to these big discontinuity number of planets here.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Does that imply that we kind of could have done it earlier if we just put our minds to it?
*  **Matt Stauffer** Um, yeah, yeah. Possibly. I think, I guess the caveat there is that there was
*  there was a certain threshold that needed to be crossed into detector technology.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Oh, okay. That makes sense.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Once that happened around 2000-ish, then it was, yeah, it was pretty easy to...
*  **Matt Stauffer** And you mentioned that the first planet that Jupiter that was has such a short
*  orbital period was a little bit of a surprise. So now 5,000 planets in, are we still surprised?
*  Is the solar system kind of an outlier or do we just, was that just sort of a selection effect?
*  It was easier to find a big close planet.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, it is absolutely easier in a three-day orbit
*  than in a 12-year orbit. You don't have to wait 12 years to see the orbit go by. So,
*  that if nothing else, but there's other reasons as well. Like the signal is just larger.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Yeah, so yeah, it's definitely true that they were easier to detect, but they
*  also had to be there. And the fact that they were, their occurrence rate was not zero,
*  instantly like, you know, as a surprise. But yeah, as the years went on, I think for the first five
*  years, hot Jupiters were the kind of planet that were discovered. And there was a large collection
*  of them. But then as the surveys ran for longer, they were able to see longer orbits go by. And
*  there are examples of gas giant planet multi-year orbits.
*  **Matt Stauffer** So hot Jupiters was the thing because hot, just because they're close to the
*  star, not in any intrinsic way about Jupiter itself.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Yeah, that's right. Yeah. That's our very clever naming scheme for this
*  classic planet is that, oh, it's right next to a star. It's hot and it's the size of Jupiter.
*  **Matt Stauffer** There you go. And so what do we know now about that distribution? Is the solar
*  system kind of typical? **Matt Stauffer** Well, I think the answer to that is like a lot of answered
*  a lot of scientific questions is it depends. If you're thinking about coplanarity, we're seeing
*  that there's a decent size sample, but we've also seen systems that have the planets wildly out of
*  orbit. So in some ways, the solar system fits, but there's a whole class of planets that did.
*  **Matt Stauffer** So you mean we found, so there are systems where all of the orbits of the multiple
*  planets are in the same plane, but there's also systems where they're not in the same plane.
*  **Matt Stauffer** That's right. Yeah. So like you can think of it as like the grooves on a record.
*  And so that's what I mean by coplanar. But imagine if you like cut out the center portion of that
*  record and then tilted it with respect to the rest of the record, and those are two different
*  orbits. There are examples of this. And sometimes, and there's also examples of misalignment with the
*  spin of a central star. In the solar system, the sun spins in the same direction that the Earth
*  orbits and all the other planets. But we found examples of planets that go backwards with respect
*  to this. So we have these retrograde, not the apparent retrograde that we see like Venus and
*  Mercury, but actual retrograde that they're orbiting in the quote wrong way. And so you can
*  find examples of planetary systems that share characteristics with our solar system. So our
*  solar system is not a complete outlier, but there's entire populations of planets out there that look
*  absolutely nothing like this. And so if you ask like, how does it fit in the whole ensemble,
*  it starts off a little rare. Okay. I mean, that's that's fascinating, because the solar system,
*  of course, is the data point we have the most familiarity with. So there's some bias there.
*  But it also seems kind of natural, if we think about how planets are supposed to be formed,
*  that they would be in the plane and moving the same way as the star. So is this
*  radically revising our theories of how planetary systems get formed?
*  Yes. Yeah, I mean, it, it indicates that the revision needs to happen. Okay, it's that it's
*  actually, we still don't really have any good explanation, like any solid experimentally tested
*  theory for how you get a retrograde planet. Okay, I can wave my hands with the best of them and
*  describe some scenarios. But we don't know that like that's not understood as guessed. And it's
*  done after the fact, you know, we saw the result of the experiment, we're like, Hey, I have a great
*  question for it. It's, it's a little bit backwards. So but we tell good stories about how this thing
*  well, and those, those stories are very different than the way that things happen on Earth.
*  We are not averse to the occasional waving of hands here on the mindscape podcast. So I presume
*  that some crazy gravitational interaction or something like that, or you capture by a flyby,
*  I don't know what would be the your favorite hand wave scenario.
*  My favorite scenario and the one that I've done, like the most abstract I would be there's a
*  there's a gravitational well, let's just put it this way. First of all, that the earth going
*  around the sun, it does so because the sun is tugging on it feels the sun's gravity. But as
*  the earth goes around the sun, it also feels really tiny nudges from the gravitational pulls
*  of all the other planets. And the way that works out for the earth is that it's negligible compared
*  to the pull of the sun. And it doesn't really affect the long term evolution of depending on
*  what you mean, like long term. So it's it's stable, it's fine. And it and the interactions are not
*  significant. But you can construct an orbital system that has a planet orbiting maybe let's
*  say at the earth sun. And then you have a companion star, because maybe the sun of that solar system
*  is in a binary. And that companion star sits out beyond. Okay, it's out there, right. And what that
*  does, it can actually set up this set of gravitational interactions where the orbit of the planet in
*  response to the gravitational tug of that outer campaign, the other star, it starts getting longer,
*  and more eccentric, so that it becomes less circular, more of an oval shape. And then it
*  can oscillate between that. And then a misaligned state where it goes up over the poles of its are,
*  and it stays perfectly circular. And so it can exchange inclination and eccentricity and the
*  sort of like harmonic oscillators. Okay, so that's the first act of the story.
*  Pretty good one. Okay, good. Okay. And then the next act of the story, the planet starts feeling
*  tidal force central star when it goes in on this highly eccentric orbit, it's like buzzes the stars
*  atmosphere and gets in real close. And then the star is stretching it. And that drains energy from
*  the whole system. And the consequence of that for an orbital system is that it takes that long,
*  wide orbit and becomes more circular. Okay. And then you end up with a hot Jupiter,
*  that's going up over the poles of its star in the other direction, because of these gravitational
*  interactions. So I guess the actually before I say that, let me remind myself, is it correct that the
*  solar system itself is thought to be unstable? If we waited billions of years, various planets
*  would get kicked out? Yeah, I think that's still believed that like, the fact that we even settled
*  into the specific stable configuration is somewhat was made up a lucky draw. But yeah, and so all
*  like, you know, chaos theory type stuff, right? So these are simulated at different initial conditions
*  that have led to unstable endpoints where we are now. And I guess I'm just like you cooking this up
*  after the fact. But the fact that there is a bias when we look for exoplanets for planets that are
*  heavy, because they have a big effect and close to the star because they're short periods, maybe
*  those are the ones where it's more likely that some crazy orbital dynamics has gone on. I think
*  that's true. But the I think that's countered by the fact sensitivity of the search methods is such
*  that we're complete to Jupiter's being Jupiter, you know, so it's not okay, we are more sensitive
*  to those oddball planets quite often. But that's not to the detriment of like missing the
*  the rest of the population. So we get a pretty holistic view. So when you talk about completeness,
*  you mean that for the stars we've looked at, if there was a Jupiter out to a certain distance,
*  we would definitely find it. Yeah. Okay, good to know. And the other obvious question is,
*  roughly speaking, what fraction of stars or what fraction of stars like the sun
*  have planets? It's a big yeah. So if I were to say, like, there was one planet for every two stars,
*  I could express that as like the planet occurrence point five, it's half, right. So if it's one out
*  of three, I call it one third. And if every single if every single star had a planet,
*  then it would be one. Okay, so the study that I did with a collaborator a few years ago,
*  we found that that number is five, you know, there's there's five planets per star, which
*  means that there's more planets in the Milky Way than there are stars. And pretty much, you know,
*  every single planet, every single star that you look at, if you were to look at it in every
*  possible way, you'd likely come up with not only one planet, but multiple planets.
*  Because you could get a five to one ratio if some stars had planets. And most of them didn't. But
*  you're saying it's not like that. It's more like most stars have a planet. That's actually an
*  excellent observation. And, you know, we were able to look at the populations in other ways that show
*  that it's not it's not that skewed. But it does have interesting ways of preferring certain
*  outcomes. But yeah, and I remember that in some circles, that fact that so many stars had planets
*  was considered a bit surprising, like look at all those planets, but I was never surprised.
*  On the basis of the one data point we have in the solar system, it makes perfect sense to me there
*  should be plans. Was I too sanguine or? No, I'm with you on that. I'm with you. I'm also a human,
*  and you're also a human. And so it's like possible for us to hold, you know, like, oh, yeah,
*  of course, on the one hand, and on the other hand, it's like, that's never been done. And it just
*  got done. Wow. Right. So those two can like kind of act in tension. And I think that that's happened
*  for the community. And it's that whole that there's also a part of like, there's the paradigm,
*  before the first plants were found about like, what, what solar systems should look like.
*  But there's also just like, the way of placing value on certain aspects of astronomy, what should
*  be done to in order to do good astronomy. In the 1980s, it was not it was not it was,
*  it wasn't really considered possible to be a good astronomer and do something like
*  looking for planets. Are you kidding? Like, so that's something I think that scientists forget
*  is that like, we do hard selection process on like, what is valued? Yeah. And that comes about
*  through a whole set of things. But just it's important to know back in the 80s, like it just
*  was not it just didn't get funded. You couldn't get telescope time to do something like that.
*  That's just what's the value. That is a great point, I think, because it happens with many
*  things with supernova surveys, with gravitational waves, with various things. Once you find them,
*  it's obvious that you should be putting a huge amount of effort into doing this. But before the
*  first example happens, there's a there really is a lot of inertia and conservatism in the community.
*  All this stuff is expensive. So you can understand why. But it makes you wonder what other things
*  were missing. Yeah, I mean, I think astronomers are like all academics and most academics,
*  like self liberal, but in their actual, like in their actions are quite conservative in the sense
*  that like, there's an agreed upon, not only an agreed upon, like answer to some set of questions,
*  but there's an agreed upon set of questions that one is allowed to ask. And asking how what fraction
*  of those stars out there have planets around them was not really seen as a valid question.
*  Even if you could like go back in time and use the exact same appeals that we use based on like
*  NAP, the justification that we have now, it might not even go over so well. So in that sense,
*  it was surprising that there was a planet there surprising that that planet was so interesting.
*  And oh my god, all of a sudden, you start seeing the shift in the way that people think,
*  like not only what questions they're asking, but like that that question is now allowable.
*  That question is okay. Yeah, I mean, I can absolutely verify your judgment in the 80s.
*  This was not considered respectable. And I do think that I would have voted that almost all stars
*  have planets, but I'm not gonna I don't want to give anyone the impression that I was out there
*  saying we should go look for them. Oh, you were publishing on this? I was not when I was an
*  undergraduate. Again, I should have this is a thought out there for current undergrads. Like,
*  what are the old folks missing? That's a good question. Yeah, exactly. What are we missing now?
*  And the other thing I want to get up on the table in terms of the population of exoplanets is that
*  there are apparently planets that don't have any stars that are just in between the stars floating
*  around. Yeah. Oh, man. I don't remember this firmly enough to know that I have exactly right.
*  But I think the name that was given to this class of planet called Solidigand,
*  okay, which means a lone wanderer. I think one is one of the scientists. Now I can't even remember
*  which scientists it was. I can give them proper credit. But maybe they won't want the credit if
*  I got the word wrong. But anyway, yeah, they're these lone wanderers are out there in the Milky
*  Way. And it's their theories. But like, you know, how did this thing get orphaned from its star? Or
*  do we not understand star formation well enough to understand that this might be like one of the
*  possible outcomes of making stars? Well, I think it's because a lot of people don't have the
*  background knowledge about star formation, etc. I mean, I would personally put a large credence
*  that these planets used to be associated with stars at the moment of their formation and somehow
*  got kicked out. But is it possible that they just a planet formed in between the stars? Well,
*  there was an undergraduate here who looked at the possibility along with her advisor, James
*  Guggenheim at Ingramma. They were looking at the question of whether you could at the center of
*  the Milky Way, this giant supermassive black hole, and I promise this connects to planets, it sounds
*  wild as a start. But okay, there's this supermassive black hole that's a million times the mass. And
*  around that black hole is a population of stars that are hanging out there or formed there.
*  We don't exactly know, but they're there. And every once in a while, one of these stars will
*  get too close to the black hole, and it'll get sort of spaghettified, stretched out into a long
*  stream of hydrogen and star guts. And the question that Edden studied was, could any of the stretched
*  out spaghettified star turn into little populations of Jupiters? And if so, if that was something
*  that actually happened, then what would be the occurrence? And it's a really fun project. It's
*  a really out there project. It doesn't fit neatly under what's accepted to study or what questions
*  interesting to ask, but she showed it was at least plausible. So that question exists out there for
*  any aspiring young astronomers who might get to graduate school and an advisor who really run loose.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** Or if not, they can do it surreptitiously,
*  whether the advisor is not looking. That's always possible.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** Okay, or the paradigm might shift by then.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** Right. It could be the common thing. Could be the hot topic. You never know.
*  I mean, my own experience was I was the world's expert at the cosmological constant and dark
*  energy before they found it. So that was not very exciting before they found it, but suddenly it was
*  exciting through no fault of my own. **Jadeg Llavergast**
*  That's right. Yeah. You just have to find the right question to ask.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** I've been going to be encouraged, but you actually can't ask it, right?
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Anyway. Okay. So let's think about how we detect them.
*  I mean, that's really why we're here. You've written a book called How Do You Find an Exoplanet?
*  I encourage anyone who is interested in checking it out, although it does have equations in it.
*  We're not afraid of equations here on the Mindscape Podcast, so that's okay.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** But so how do you find them? I mean, presumably the big
*  obstacle is that stars are bright and planets are dim. Is that an oversimplification?
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** Yeah, I think that is an excellent way of putting it. And that difference
*  in brightness also mirrored the mass ratios. Jupiter is huge by planet standards, but it's
*  only one thousandth the sun. And so we're talking about very small signal in the presence of very
*  high contrast. And so let's take it, for example, like you wanted to do direct imaging of the planet.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** Yeah, perfect.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** The analogy that I once worked out, and I think it's the one I use in my book,
*  is if you're trying to find the glow of a Jupiter-sized planet sitting next to its star
*  from the Earth, and let's put that star at like proximus as close as stars get. The analogy is
*  that I'm on a lighthouse with a cigarette lighter that I turn on, and your job is to see the light
*  from the lighter against the glare of the lighthouse. But let's put you, the observer,
*  in California. Let's put the lighthouse in Hawaii. And now we've got the scale right.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** Okay. All right. So it's a challenge.
*  **Jadeg Llavergast** It's the contrast is one aspect of it. You nailed that. And the other is
*  the signals are so small. The actual signal that you're looking for.
*  **Matt Stauffer** Well, so you mentioned direct imaging. I mean, we don't need to go in order of
*  plausibility. So let's just ask the dumb question first. Can't you just take a really big telescope,
*  use the best detectors we have, point it at a star, and take pictures of any planets that
*  might be around it? **Jadeg Llavergast** Yeah. And principally, yes, you can do that. But there are
*  obstacles that you have to overcome to pull that off. And the biggest obstacle is this big,
*  annoying thing called the Earth's atmosphere. Sorry, it perspectives everything, but like,
*  for an astronomer, the atmosphere in the way causes a lot of heartache and headaches. And so
*  even with like a really great optical design and a huge telescope after and a really wonderful
*  detector, you still have to stare. Like basically, it's like trying to see a freckle on your friend's
*  face. And you're at the bottom of a pool and you're looking up at the rippling, through the
*  rippling surface, and you're trying to discern whether there's that little speck on their cheek
*  or something. So you have to overcome the motion of the atmosphere, the obscuring effects of the
*  atmosphere. And there are technologies that are allowing us to do that. And as technology advances,
*  this actually involves changing the shape of the mirror of the telescope in the exact same way that
*  the atmosphere deformed above the telescope, which is a really cool engineering feat.
*  And so that's changing on microsecond levels, you have to change the mirror
*  shape, the actual, you know, are you literally putting some servo motors under the mirror to
*  work? Yeah, there's little tiny servos sitting underneath what's actually a very small scaled
*  down version of the main mirror, but nonetheless, you're moving a mirror around fast enough to go
*  with the atmosphere. And that's just like a huge engineering problem. Yeah, to overcome first,
*  and that you have to rely on that well, and you have to understand the system very well,
*  so that you still barely pick out the spec there. So is that a future prospect kind of thing that
*  will be a big deal? Or is it just, we can do it in principle, but it's never going to be the leading
*  procedure? It's that latter one, because right now, detection sensitivity, well, let's say like,
*  when imaging first started detecting planets, all they were seeing were baby planets that had just
*  formed. And on the because they had just formed, they were still gravitationally contracting
*  and glowing on their own like little miniature stars. So there, the contrast is evened out a lot,
*  because the planet's shining bright. But the issue with that is there's only so many places that we
*  can see young stars. And those places are not nearby. So okay, so that but we're still,
*  nonetheless, we're able to find planets that way. More recent advances since those early detections
*  have brought us to the extremely massive planet very widely separate from their star. But again,
*  you're just in both of these techniques are limited by the number of targets you have. You get down
*  to a certain sensitivity, and you're really excited, the principle you can find, but now
*  you're just kind of limited by the number of stars are close enough for that technology to really work
*  for you. Is there some high tech version of putting my thumb up to block out the bright thing so I can
*  see the dark thing? Yep, that's it. That that technique right there is called coronography.
*  It was brought over from the people who study the sun thing, basically a little spot that blocks out
*  the light from the sun. So you can see the the corona and the flares and things like that. That's
*  often behind a car. And we can use a similar type of thing, blurring out the light or blocking out
*  the light. It's much it turns out like the technical details of what goes on with how that work.
*  It's very different than the way your thumb kind of blocks it up. But the end effect is the same.
*  We're trying to just push the light from the star down so that we can see what's around it.
*  Right. Okay, so if that is an obvious thing to try, but it's not the most effective, what what
*  in your mind is the most effective way to find these exoplanets? Because you found some how many
*  planets have you found? Do you have a like, is there a number on your CV? How many planets you found?
*  I once did it. I once counted it. It was close to 100. 100 planets? It depends on how you like
*  assign credit. And you know, like if we only, yeah, these are teamwork kind of things, right?
*  Yeah, these are teamwork things. I've been on teams that have found well over well over 100.
*  Yeah, so the method like most effective would kind of implies that like we have all of the
*  money in the world that we can pour into every different technique. And then we can like sum up
*  like which one found more planets. But like, you know, where where resources have been invested
*  and where it's been most effective in terms of like the outcomes is transits because and that's
*  the method where you're looking for the planet to eclipse the light of the of its central star.
*  So that it has its orbit aligned in space just right. So it passes in front of a star and
*  eclipses it. And they're called transits if it's a planet and eclipse if it's a star.
*  But the technique is the transit technique. And that's found the vast majority of known planets.
*  And in part because that's what's used by the Kepler satellite, right, which is in a lot of
*  this heavy lifting. Yeah, it's also the detection method that can make do with the smallest telescope,
*  which makes it well suited for putting it on a satellite getting up above the Earth's atmosphere
*  and being able to see things really clearly. Maybe tell us a little bit about Kepler because
*  it's no longer working, right? These things are lifetime. Yeah. So the Kepler mission was a
*  space telescope that went up in 2009 and was launched into what's called an Earth trailing
*  orbit. So it orbited the sun, but its orbital separation was just a little bit longer than the
*  Earth's. And so it just sat out there in cold space as the Earth drifted away. And what was
*  great about Kepler is that it was single-minded in its science goals. There were basically no
*  movable or interchangeable parts on that thing. It popped off the dust cover from the mirror,
*  and it just stared at space. So there was the Kepler field that the telescope looked at,
*  and it stared at it for, well, the original mission was three years, but it went years past
*  its original mission. So it didn't scan the sky. It was just really focusing on-
*  It didn't scan. It just stared at one sector of the night sky. And there were millions of stars
*  in that patch of sky that Kepler could see, and that gave it lots and lots of opportunities to see
*  transits. And it turned out transits by the thousands by the time it was done.
*  So I'm betting that there are people asking, well, why didn't it scan? There are even more stars
*  elsewhere. But I'm betting also that the point is it's waiting for rare events. So it makes just as
*  much sense to just stay on one star to keep collecting new stars. Yeah. Yeah. If you take a
*  whole box of hot Jupiters and you dump them out into the Milky Way, and they all tumble out of the
*  box, then only one-tenth of all of those hot Jupiter systems would have the alignment necessary
*  for a transit. So the random orientation of all these stars and planetary systems in space is
*  similar to dumping them out of the box. They're just randomized all over the place. So it's only
*  10%. And that decreases really rapidly as you move away from the central star. It decreases. It's one
*  over the distance away from the central star. And so by the time you get out to the Earth's orbit,
*  it's only like 1%. And it just keeps decreasing as you go further away. So you need to look at lots
*  and lots of stars to get this chance alignment to work out for you. Right. So the chance alignment
*  reflects the fact that you need us, the planet, and the star to be on a line with each other.
*  That's right. If the star orbits perpendicular to our line of sight, it's invisible as far as
*  this technique is concerned. That's right. Yeah. So the larger the sample that you're looking at,
*  the greater, you know, you'll just find more planets. But you have to get above a certain
*  threshold. And could you see something as tiny as the Earth against something as big as the Sun
*  with this kind of technique? In principle, Kepler was designed to be able to detect the Earth
*  around the Sun as viewed from far away. Okay. And I'm good to do it. There are a number of systems
*  that like bore a lot of resemblance to the Earth-Sun system in different ways. Some were
*  orbited closer in. Sometimes the planet was a little bit larger. But, you know, basically,
*  those types of systems are confirmed to exist. But the majority of the planets that were found
*  were closer to the star where they were more likely to pass in front of it. Sure. And also,
*  how long did Kepler look? You said about a decade? I can't remember the exact duration of K2,
*  which was the mission that came after the original Kepler. So it went for three years,
*  and then it got renewed for three years, and then it got renewed for three years. And it just was,
*  it just kept on chugging. It wasn't supposed to have enough fuel. It broke down. It just actually
*  broke down because it has these three little reaction wheels that keep it pointed at that
*  same place. These little gyroscopes that keep it stable at its angular momentum. And one of them,
*  they actually had four when it launched. The first one failed right away. The next one failed
*  after about a year after the extended mission. And Kepler was just like starting to wobble.
*  So what they figured out that the NASA engineers figured out is that they could,
*  the solar panels on the back of it are like the roof on a house. They come up to a point.
*  So what they did is they oriented Kepler, the telescope, into the stream of photons coming
*  from the sun. And the exchange of momentum from all those photons breaking over the solar panels,
*  like it was the bow of a boat, stabilized it in that third dimension. Wow. And then that was the
*  K2 mission. And that just went on. Yeah. So I think it all told it must be about a decade.
*  They are clever, those NASA engineers sometimes. Yeah. But I'm glad you brought that up because
*  it's a reminder, again, people who don't do this for a living, the precarity of being a scientist
*  working on one of these missions. You can't go and fix it. This is not in Earth orbit, right?
*  One, like I said, one wheel broke instantly. And if two had broke instantly, we'd have been in trouble.
*  That's right. Yeah. That's why space missions are so expensive in part is just because
*  the precision that had to be complete. There's just no room for error. Not to mention that you
*  have to put it on this gigantic exploding tower and send it up into Earth orbit. But
*  And there was the TESS mission. Is that a follow up?
*  So the TESS mission was the follow up. And you asked, why don't you scan? And TESS answered
*  that question and said, yeah, why not? And so let's scan. And so what TESS does is it trades
*  off the duration of the survey. So Kepler went for years and years. TESS, what it does is it scans a
*  big stripe of the sky 30 days at a time. And then it moves over to the next stripe until it paints
*  out the globe around the night sky around the Earth. What's really nice about that, though,
*  is that the detectors overlap near the pole as it's pure ready. The parts that look up close to
*  the center of its motion overlap from sector to sector. And so you get up to, I think, a year
*  near the poles. But for the rest of the sky, you get 30 days. And so what you do is you get to see
*  lots more stars, but you see them for a shorter duration. So it's a shallower, broader survey
*  than Kepler was really narrow and deep. But it found a bunch of plants?
*  Yeah, that's one that took it from the couple thousand that came out of Kepler into the 5,000
*  today. And that was also the transit method. They were looking for the transit method. They were
*  looking for a little decrease in the brightness of the star. Yes, they're using the transit method.
*  And is this teamwork? Once you find the planet candidate with one of these satellites, do you
*  follow up with telescopes here on Earth? Yeah, it is absolutely a team effort. NASA designs,
*  flies, and maintains the mission. And they also do a lot of, they're the ones that take the signals
*  that are being sent from the satellite or the space telescope. And they translate that into
*  actual usable data that we as astronomers can use. And so then they pass that on to us. And then
*  that is just data. So you can collect a lot of data and you can get almost no information from it
*  if you don't look at it well enough. Or if you don't use the right way of looking at it.
*  And so then usually where an astronomy graduate student steps in is figuring out how do I take
*  the data that's handed in these files from NASA and how do I turn that into usable information?
*  Now, for Kepler in particular, the engineers are very involved even at that level. They're really
*  helpful in helping us just really get a solid understanding of like, okay, when this thing is
*  lighting up in this way, you're getting this much many counts in this little sector, you can trust
*  that this means this and that. And, you know, they understood the instrument and they so they allowed
*  us to make reliable transitions from just raw data into usable information. But then there was
*  a whole extra step where you want to make sure that the thing that looks an awful lot like the
*  signal caused by a planet, like that little dip in light for a transit, that can look like a planet
*  but actually be a different astrophysical phenomenon. So for example, you could have a
*  star that's passing in front of its star, but only their tips graze and so it's only a small
*  fraction of the light that goes down. And this was a big concern going into the Kepler mission.
*  And when I was at Caltech, I had a graduate student working with me,
*  named Tim Morton. And he and I figured out that like at the precision that Kepler was getting that
*  the rate of those false positives would be, it would be hardly, it would be like a tenth of what
*  was feared. And so, but that nonetheless, you have to go through that process of saying,
*  are we fooling ourselves? Or how can we feel very confident that we're looking at that whole planet?
*  And Kepler's precision is photometric precision just traced out that shape with such clarity that
*  like it was almost like each Kepler light curve was a textbook version of what a transit should look
*  like. And so, you know, it turned out that the fears came from an earlier era where that signal
*  was very jagged and noisy, and you could hide a lot of stuff in noise. And so we had so little,
*  such a little noise with Kepler, but nonetheless, it was it was kind of accepted protocol that you
*  have to make sure that you take a different telescope, maybe on the ground, maybe one of
*  those systems that corrects for the Earth's atmosphere, and then just takes a quick peek,
*  take a little snapshot and see if you can see another object nearby that could be the
*  culprit that's causing a planet light signal. And so that follow up that's called ground based
*  follow up. So you have the space based mission that's producing signals and science, but the
*  science in order to mature fully needs these ground based assets. And so that's like where
*  I really positioned myself with the Kepler mission and the early Kepler mission was doing a lot of
*  the ground based follow up. Do I gather from this that we've become more confident in what
*  a Kepler itself isn't online anymore. But these days, are we less devoted to the idea of the need
*  for a ground based follow up if the data are really good? Yeah, I mean, I think it Yeah,
*  that the lesson of like higher precision and dedicated experiment giving you that higher
*  precision means that you have more confidence has really started settling in. But I think the
*  procedures that people go through to actually publish a planet as a new planet, still include
*  that legacy of like doing all your due diligence to check all around it. I like it. I think that
*  it's good to be careful with your science even when when you have a lot of confidence.
*  That's perfectly fair. And even though Kepler and Tess have done amazing things, we have also found
*  a bunch of planets just here on the ground and not all from transits, right? There's other there's
*  this Doppler mechanism, which is an entirely different one. Yeah, so there's the the method
*  of looking for the movements of the star in response to its planet. And so, you know, when
*  we think about planetary systems, we often think about like a star orbiting its planet into a close
*  approximation. That's exactly what's happening is that the star is stationary and the planet is
*  moving around it. But we know that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
*  So the same force that the star is exerting on the planet, the planet is exerting that force back on
*  the star. And that sounds really impressive until you consider that the star is so much more massive.
*  So it doesn't move much in response to that force. But it does move. And it moves enough that it for
*  part of the planet's orbit, it can look like the star is moving towards us. And then as the planet
*  moves around in its orbit, it tugs the star, the star responds, and now it starts moving away from
*  us in its orbit. And that back and forth motion is the signal that we look for using the radio
*  velocity technique. So it is the Doppler shift of the light from the star that we're looking at,
*  even though we're detecting the planet, we're actually detecting motion of the star,
*  just to check. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, every every technique is dependent on a lot of fundamental
*  understanding of the stars. In order to understand your planets, every technique requires that. And
*  almost all techniques require measuring what the star is doing in response to the planet,
*  that we see the planet. And how good are we at measuring? I mean, let's let's be very fair to
*  some of the listeners who might not be astrophysically inclined at all. What is this Doppler effect of
*  which you speak? And how do you measure it for a star? Yeah, so the the Doppler effect is that
*  feature of like, if there's an ambulance coming towards you, as you're walking on the sidewalk,
*  it sounds high pitched as it moves away from you, it goes lower pitch. So it's like, we, we, we,
*  we, we, as it moves away. And so that change of tone is the stretching of the sound waves,
*  or the compression of the sound waves as it comes towards you. And the same thing happens with light
*  because light is particle and it's also a wave. And so the way like behavior of light is that when
*  the star is moving towards us, the light emitted from the star gets shifted to the blue, the,
*  you know, there's a contraction. And as it moves away, there's a stretching. And so there's, it
*  becomes a red, a reddening of the light. And so what we do is we look for these minute shifts in
*  the, the features of the star as we observe them through a spectrograph, which is like a giant
*  prism. So we spread out all the light. When you look at the sun through one of these prisms,
*  through these spectrographs, you see dark patterns of dark lines. And those sort of form the DNA
*  signal or the fingerprint of the star. And those positions of those dark lines are known to very
*  high precision. And the Doppler effect causes them to all shift together. And so what we can do is we
*  can watch those absorption lines, those dark lines move back and forth. The downside is that they
*  don't shift much at all. It sounds very tiny. Yeah, it's absolutely tiny. So, you know, we're
*  looking at one of those lines move by maybe a one 10,000th to one 1000th of its width. So it, and
*  what it translates into is like on our physical detector, we're, we're watching this observed,
*  like this picture of the star spectrum shift on the detector by an amount that is equal to about
*  100 silicon atoms lined up next to each other. The good thing is that the trick that we use is that
*  every one of those 1000s of absorption lines that we see in the spectrum of the sun of a star like
*  the sun, all of them shift by the exact same amount. So even though they're all shifting by
*  a tiny amount, all together, they can give us a signal large enough for us to measure.
*  And that's where like a lot of like, if you want the like inside review of what astronomy is about,
*  it's not so much the looking up at the night sky, really at all. And it's a lot of asking like,
*  Oh, my God, how do I do that in software?
*  Software and hardware, I guess, right? Yeah. And so, like you asked about it being a team effort is
*  that like, that that's where a lot of a lot of work behind the scenes goes in is like, okay, like in
*  principle, that can be done. And I can understand what you just described as being possible. But
*  then when you sit down and you stare at the data product that you know, a telescope operator hands
*  you, you're like, Okay, this is, this is the nitty gritty, this is going to consume most of my life
*  right here. And I'm gonna guess that this Doppler technique is also like the transit technique,
*  most sensitive to planets that are in the plane of where we're looking, but maybe not quite as
*  sensitive. I mean, if they're a little bit out perfect alignment, you can still maybe get a
*  Doppler shift. That's right. Yeah, the downside of like, okay, with the transiting planetary system,
*  you know that inclination, because there's only a certain tiny range of inclinations that would
*  give you that signal that you're seeing, right, because it has to eclipse. So with the transit
*  method, you get that inclination built in, even though you miss like a huge fraction of the actual
*  planets. The Doppler technique is sensitive to almost all of those planets that are there.
*  But what you don't get is a measure of that inclination. So the first consequence of this
*  is that if you're if the orbital plane, if you're like looking down on the orbital plane,
*  right, then you're not going to get much of a signal because the star is moving perpendicular
*  to your line of sight. But the moment you start tilting it away from that, you start seeing a
*  signal. The trick is that you can also change that signal by changing the mass of the planet.
*  So if I make the planet more massive, then I move to make the star move more. And moving more looks
*  a lot like being edge on. Right. And if I start tilting it, then I start decreasing the signal,
*  which is also analogous to shrinking the mass of the planet in the aligned arrangement. And so those
*  two, the mass of the planet and the inclination of the orbit are not determinable on their own.
*  You get a mixture of those two things. So you're open to potentially discovering a wider variety
*  of planets, but there's a piece of information about them that you don't have. Yeah. Yeah. And
*  it's a piece of information that, you know, given that it's missing is it complicates things in ways
*  that most astronomers missed for a long period of the planet detection era. And it's just the way
*  that the what that Bayesian probabilities work with, you know, inclinations of orbits. And but
*  yeah, so but then the early days of finding planets and actually the first planet around
*  a sun like star that was detected were done with this Doppler technique. And, and a part of the
*  reason that it was successful is that it was so sensitive to a wide range of those inclinations.
*  Whereas transit surveys weren't getting to the point where they can look at enough stars until
*  later in the game. But once they started showing success, and they were doing so with small
*  telescopes, then that became the impetus to put them up into space. And in principle, if a star
*  had multiple planets around it, you could map out the intricate back and forth dance that the star
*  was doing because of all these planets. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The way that I helped my students
*  understand like, you know, they often students are like, how would you ever do that if you had
*  two or three or four or five of these back and forth signals all happening at different periods
*  and at different phases, it just seems like it would be a mess. And, you know, the triggers I
*  ask, you know, my more musically talented students, one of them that maybe like hum and a and hold that,
*  and then I have another one do a B and then another C. And I just have everybody just pay attention.
*  That's super complicated what's happening in the air, those back and forth motions in the air,
*  but your ear can pick them out just fine. And it becomes this nice segue into understanding
*  like signal processing. But, you know, you can actually separate out those different periods
*  very cleanly and very clearly from one another. It's all using technology that's similar to what's
*  what our ears have evolved. Right. It's interesting to me that the Doppler technique and the transit
*  technique, and even to a lesser extent, the direct imaging technique, they're all able to find planets
*  without like, many orders of magnitude difference between how many we find, it almost seems like a
*  fine tuning problem that these very different methods are giving us ballpark similar kind of
*  results. Yeah, I mean, it's really encouraging. Like, yeah, each each detection technique, like
*  one of the techniques we didn't even talk about was this gravitational lensing. Oh, right. Yeah,
*  I did want to talk about that. So I'm glad you brought it up. Yeah. And it takes advantage of
*  the fact that massive body Einstein gave us a different view of gravity than Newton. Einstein
*  gave us the view that massive objects can contort or bend space and time. And a consequence of a
*  massive body bending space and time is that if you had light traveling towards that object,
*  that maybe would have gone by it. And then, you know, we wouldn't have. Sorry. Imagine a background
*  star that you're looking at. Some of its light goes off into directions that you can't see.
*  But if space is worked around a massive object between us and that star, then that can bend the
*  light back into our line of sight in the same way that a lens, a curved piece of glass bends light
*  rays and brings them into focus into our eye. And so this micro lensing technique takes the
*  situation is highly improbable seeming event where you have some background star sitting in the Milky
*  Way on the other side of the or towards the center of the Milky Way. All right. And you're
*  just observing it in a million or millions of other stars. But it just so happens that between
*  you and that background star, maybe halfway across the galaxy, there's a star moving with respect to
*  you in the background star that has a planet around it. And so the first thing that happens is that
*  star's gravity warps the background light from that background star. And you're suddenly seeing
*  more light than you wouldn't then you would have seen otherwise. And so the star becomes brighter.
*  The background becomes as the background star appears to get brighter because the foreground
*  star was light you don't even see. But its gravity is making it brighter. And then it passes through.
*  And then that background star gets dimmer again. So it's this characteristic brightening and then
*  dimming. Now what's really fun is if you have a planet orbiting that star that's passing in front
*  of the background star. And now you have two massive objects. The first massive object causes
*  its characteristic up and down. And then superimposed on top of that up and down signal of light is the
*  little planet's blip as the planet's gravity got in on the earth. And so if you see that characteristic
*  double or actually sometimes multi-peaked signal in your foot just staring at a bunch of stars
*  night after night after night after night. The microlensing folks have been able to measure
*  an estimate for how many planets should be out at about three astronomical units. Three times the
*  earth sun distance. Just you know just like where the asteroid belt is. And that region nicely
*  intersects the tail of what the transit missions can see. And also where the radio velocities can
*  see. And that the numbers are coming up and starting to match in that region. It's this wonderful
*  like this is like those like science moments where you're like oh this is how we learn to this is how
*  we start to believe something. It's not just that we got the answer once but we got the answer three
*  times with three completely different techniques. And so I think that you know with the lengthening
*  baselines and the increasing technology that allow us to see transit signals and radio velocity
*  signals and direct genome signals all of these are going to start overlapping with the microlensing
*  signals. And I think we're going to start getting a very clear picture of planet populations.
*  Wow okay. And I think that's one of the more exciting things to come out of the whole
*  enterprise of finding planets is like it's really cool that they're there and sometimes the systems
*  are very wacky and they have retrograde orbits to go over the poles or whatever. But the ensemble
*  of all of those planets starts telling you, it starts showing you a picture. It starts showing
*  a picture like the the truth in the universe that you couldn't get at any other way. And yeah that's
*  the very very beautiful story that you just told. I love it. And it takes us back so now that we have
*  in hand these different techniques and what they're good for, what kinds of planets they're good for,
*  let's revisit this question of the population of planets around different kinds of stars. So
*  you've already hinted but maybe just it's worth re-emphasizing how it's a the collection of solar
*  systems is a little bit more heterogeneous and varied than we than we would have expected before
*  we actually looked. Like I mean I think in one way that you look at the solar system it is that it
*  has the sun in the center and that the sun is this ball of hydrogen that is its mass. You know we
*  always reference all the other stars in solar masses so it's this one solar mass object that's
*  got yellow spectrum peaks in the yellow part of the spectrum. It so it appears yellow to our eyes
*  but there's all these other kinds of stars. There's less massive stars called the red dwarfs
*  and as you like survey the entire galaxy and look at the distribution of star masses that are out
*  there. What you find is there's far more of the least massive stars than there are of the most
*  massive stars. It's a very it's very skewed towards the small little mass stars so that
*  you know in the immediate solar neighborhood you know if there is you get out to about 100 stars
*  about 80 of them are going to be red dwarfs with masses less than about half of a solar mass.
*  Okay and so what we found is that red dwarfs have planets in abundance. There's lots and lots of
*  planets and that statistic of like at least five planets per star comes from an analysis of planet
*  occurrence around red dwarfs and so it looks like red dwarfs by having planets at roughly the same
*  rate as their higher mass stars they now just automatically move into what is typical in the
*  galaxy because most the most typical star is a red dwarf so if you look at it through that lens
*  then then our sun looks very unusual and the solar system looks very unusual.
*  And the red dwarfs last longer also right they have longer lifetimes. Yeah much longer so the
*  the sun should live to be about 10 billion years old that's a lot of years but if we can just like
*  think of it as like 10 billion well the red dwarfs are going to live anywhere from like
*  100 billion about to like you know indeterminate you know unmeasurable beyond the life of the
*  universe type of world. Okay. So the very last star that will be shining in the Milky Way will
*  be one of these red dwarfs and so the any if any if there's any planetary system around them those
*  would be the oldest like planets in the in the in the last planets left. So I mean that's interesting
*  to put it in perspective we're still in the kind of young vibrant and in the solar systems case
*  short-lived phase of the universe's evolution. Yeah we're in the very interesting very bright
*  phase and as the as the as the universe gets older everything is going to start reaching its
*  lowest energy state and it's just going to get real dark real dim real real gloomy but I like
*  to think of those little red dwarfs as the last thing shining in that cold dark universe.
*  Well maybe it's fun just to talk about Proximus and Tauri b because it's the closest exoplanet
*  as far as I understand but it's also just an illustration of the weirdness it's it's very
*  much unlike the solar system in a lot of ways. The planetary system around it yeah yeah in some ways
*  I mean yeah again it all depends on how you want to look at it so if you if you think like what's
*  typical like what how do we want to characterize the the solar system as we characterize it by
*  coplanarity like all of the planets orbiting in the same plane then it actually I think Proxen
*  uh it's the planetary system starts looking a little you know a lot more typical a lot more
*  like the like our solar system but like the scale of it it's just completely different.
*  Um it's like in response to shrinking down the star like the the system of planets around it
*  overreacted and shrunk even faster but you know it it and that's what we're finding around red
*  dwarfs is that like in that population of stars what you find are solar systems that are extremely
*  compact so you know the whole system goes from like you know there's a four day planet and then
*  there's an eight day planet and then there's a 12 day planet and then way way way way out there
*  there's that 50 day planet but if you like look at the solar system our closest planet mercury is
*  like 88 days it's these are the orbital periods these are the years for these planets yeah these
*  are the years it's orbital periods so you know a year on these planets and you know around a
*  if you're in the habitable zone of a really low mass red dwarf like Proxima Centauri uh your year
*  is starting to look like a few weeks it's not everything just gets much more compact
*  right um and and Proxima is also part of a triple star system right i mean Alpha Centauri would be
*  bright in the sky as a double star um it is yes the so there's Alpha Cent A and Alpha Cent B
*  which are stars that are much closer in mass and brightness and color to our sun
*  uh and then away away from that pair of Proxima Centauri A and B is is little i'm sorry not
*  Proxima Centauri Alpha Centauri A and B way way far away from that pair is uh is Proxima Centauri
*  uh which is this little red dwarf uh that is associated gravitationally but you know kind of
*  on the outs with the other two yeah something like half a million year orbital period around
*  very very long yeah yeah that's barely that's just barely balancing others i love it i mean i think
*  that that is a good reminder of how different the universe is are going to be yeah yeah and that
*  that right there um is a way that the sun itself just by being the sun is unusual is that it's by
*  itself like most stars have other stars that they share a you know an orbit together um and so that
*  we don't have one also might make us unusual um we do know that there are planets that uh orbit
*  in binary star systems and triple star systems like Proxen but there's also uh planets that orbit
*  around two stars at once so the two stars are closer together than the planet is to those two
*  stars and so those are circum binary planets and um and those are very unusual very wild and we kind
*  of caught those by luck um but we're still starting to get a handle on how common that system might be
*  that kind of so you're saying star wars was a documentary and Tatooine could be real yes Tatooine
*  yeah the dual sunset of Tatooine is something that in principle can be observed in the galaxy
*  so it's not in the galaxy far far away it might be our galaxy you mentioned the habitable zone
*  uh tell us what that means so the habitable zone is more of an idea uh that we can attach like
*  physical values to but the idea is that in order to have life on a planet you have to have liquid
*  water and the reason we think that is um is reasoning that is uncomfortably close to that
*  reasoning of like what we expected to find based on looking at the solar system um all of the
*  examples of life that we know of are on the earth so all of the examples of life that are on earth
*  require water for their existence and so the idea by extrapolation is that you also need that
*  conditions for liquid water to exist on the surface of the planet for it to be habitable
*  and so that is going to be different for different stars but you can think of it as the as this
*  narrow range of distances where it's like the goldilocks zone where if it's too hot like if
*  you're too close to the star things are too hot and the water boils off but if you're too far
*  from the star things are too cold and the water freezes out and so there's a just right distance
*  so it's a range of distances from the central star and it forms like a band around the star and so
*  if a planet is in that band then we would consider it potentially habitable yeah so just to be super
*  duper clear that does not mean it is inhabited that's right those are two different yeah
*  habitable speaks to potential not actuality and an obvious question to ask is are there ways of
*  gathering data about all these 5000 planets we found that would indicate whether any of them had
*  life on them oh that is tricky in principle you could and and we're going to start maybe testing
*  that notion that's in principle now we might start practicing it soon with the with the web
*  space telescope jwst which recently launched and it has the capability of looking closely enough
*  at the star with the light from the central star of a system that has a planet that is known to
*  eclipse its star and it can look during the eclipse and it can see the star spectrum so clearly
*  i can tell that the starlight is passing through the atmosphere of the planet and so you get this
*  tiny tiny tiny little bit of filtered starlight during the eclipse that contains information
*  about the atmosphere of the of the of the planet and if everything lines up just right and we find
*  just the right planetary system and all things work on jw is expected and the data analysis is
*  done extraordinarily carefully and then checked and then rechecked well maybe have just enough
*  signal to start arguing about whether that was a biosigment okay and i think that those types of
*  arguments will just like rage on in the astronomy community from the from some point in the near
*  future for some amount of time and then eventually we might have like a large enough sample to draw
*  a statistical conclusion that there's got to be life there somewhere but like it these are very
*  very tenuous signals based upon assumptions that may or may not be present on other planetary other
*  planet surfaces other life forms and things like that so we're making a guess at what spectroscopic
*  signature we're going to see and we're really crossing our fingers that we understand chemistry
*  and biology well enough that we can predict what that's that that signature will be there
*  that it was detected and that we're not fooling ourselves somehow well i mean we're near the end
*  of the podcast now so we're allowed to be a little bit more speculative so your feelings about the
*  existence of life either primitive or advanced on other planets change that much because you've
*  collected all this data i think what it's done is it's it's opened the door wider to the possibility
*  that we'll find those biosignatures that the evidence of life the signatures of biology is
*  what i mean by biosignature and what i mean is that if two decades of looking for planets
*  left us with the conclusion that earth-sized planets with the earth's composition existing
*  in the habitable zone of its star just don't exist let's just say that that was the conclusion two
*  decades of planet searching and just we never seen it no hope of seeing it not even a statistical
*  sniff of it it's not happening well then that would just close the door on the possibility of
*  finding those biosignatures because we don't even have the initial conditions right now right we
*  haven't found the evidence that the initial conditions exist but i think what we've done is
*  we've expanded our knowledge of of planets in the galaxy to the point where we say yeah this is
*  this is feasible it's if the life exists it's likely that we'll be able to observe it in just
*  the right way to detect it it's leaving the door open for the possibility but what sits on the
*  other side of that door just tons of technical challenges and but like at least we don't have
*  to foreclose on the on the possibility and do you have any favorite thoughts about why we haven't
*  found them yet the fermi paradox yeah um i i wonder if are uh some of the assumptions that go into
*  that the existence of that paradox hold like the idea that like advanced civilizations necessarily
*  have to get to the point of like space flight is one of their seminal achievements or are
*  unnecessary precondition for other achievements um like what is there there's a possibility of
*  life arising where the beings start forming a society in which everybody's needs are met just
*  fine and there's like no real like big push because there's no such thing as a cold war
*  yeah uh there's like they they're everybody's just like everything we ever want is right here and the
*  night sky is so beautiful to look at and we and everything's taken care of to the point where we
*  have the luxury of like pretty much everyone engaging and looking at the sky who's to say
*  that like their first priority would be to beam a signal of their existence at some other star
*  they're just like they maybe they live they just go through their entire existence as sentinel
*  beings with that that impulse and i don't know how to assess ahead of time the likelihood of that
*  outcome versus our record right so who's to say like we're not this weird outlier uh where our
*  civilization developed in such a way that scarcity was a thing and that we couldn't figure out the
*  distribution of things right so we ended up going to war all the time then we had a we had a big
*  old space race basically just to piss the other side off and it had the side effect of like sending
*  telescopes up there and then we started wondering like well wonder if somebody out there's doing the
*  same thing well maybe they're not maybe they're just not doing the same thing at all maybe this
*  impulse was weird and we just happened to live in that realization that had happened well or i
*  suppose you could imagine that humanity could change a little bit along those lines i mean yeah
*  yeah like maybe we're not there yet yeah yeah i mean do you what are your feelings about human
*  exploration of space do you think that that's just kind of a uh distraction or is that is that
*  something that you look forward to down the road i look forward to living in a world where i feel
*  like that's one of the most important things to do um another there's just too many needs left
*  unaddressed here on earth for me to really think too much about that beyond like hoping for like
*  the conditions where that would just feel right you know so i i think that space exploration
*  right now is not being conducted among nation states is being conducted among wealthy oligarchs
*  and it it's i don't trust them to make the right the decisions that will be beneficial to all the
*  rest of us who live under completely different conditions like it's neat that they're flying up
*  there but it's not something that gets my heart pounding in terms of like exploring things asking
*  really interesting questions and and having those questions be the most important things governing
*  the lives of most people on earth so um that but i have a different take than most astronomers so
*  i i recognize that but i think it's good to have a variety of those ideas out there good to have a
*  variety of takes but i guess then for the final question let's you know even though human
*  space exploration like you say is being largely driven by individuals now
*  governments are still doing most of the science in space and so what is your you know what what
*  gets you excited what is the thing that is going to happen down the line let's let's limit it to
*  our lifetimes but uh what what should the audience be looking for as a big next step in this field
*  i think it's not it's not flashy but i do think it's the most important thing it's the thing that
*  gets me most excited is the it's the next set of major advances in understanding stars um
*  there's a whole subfield of astronomy called stellar astrophysics and it hasn't been the
*  the flashiest or most well-funded area of astrophysics in a long time and it's largely
*  been ironically supplanted by the field of exoplanets exoplanets are actually piggybacking
*  on a lot of the technology and techniques that were developed to study stars and i there's going
*  to be a moment where we reach a limit what the fundamental we're already there largely that the
*  limit is that we don't have a good enough understanding of stars to really press forward
*  our understanding of planets because it is impossible to know things physically meaningfully
*  know things about planets without knowing the stars to great detail and i think it's a like one
*  of the most impressive feats of the science of astronomy that we happen to know anything about
*  stars not much less that we know them to like some cases to within a percent it's just bonkers what
*  we do nonetheless a percent's not good enough sometimes and so i think whichever graduate
*  student does the unfortunately not very flashy thesis but the most important thesis of like
*  figuring out new ways of incorporating new physics into our understanding of stellar interiors and
*  spectra that or or or understanding the ways that stars these big fluffy balls of hydrogen
*  vibrate and move around and obscure the signals that we're looking for once that breakthrough
*  happens i that's where you're going to really see the floodgates open up and and so that's where a
*  lot of my interest is these days is just like you know how how do we advance our understanding
*  of stars and i often joke that like i'm an exoplanetary scientist by day but by night
*  uh i'm a stellar astrophysicist and so it's uh i i this is another example of that avosh i think
*  that we it's really important to evaluate what we prioritize or else we like might start undercutting
*  the thing that we say that we're prioritizing and so um i don't know it's not again it's not
*  the most standard take but it is something that gets me really excited i like it i like it because
*  it's not the standard take that's a perfect way to end so john johnson thanks so much for being on
*  the wineski podcast thank you for having me it's been fun
