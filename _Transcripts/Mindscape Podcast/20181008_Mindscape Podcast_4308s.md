The job of science fiction isn't to predict the future; it's to tell interesting stories in an imaginative setting, exploring the implications of different ways the world could be different from our actual one. Annalee Newitz has carved out a unique career as a writer and thinker, founding the visionary blog io9 and publishing nonfiction in a number of formats, and is now putting her imagination to work in the realm of fiction. Her recent novel,  Autonomous, examines a future in which the right to work is not automatic, rogue drug pirates synthesize compounds to undercut Big Pharma, and sentient robots discover their sexuality. We talk about how science fiction needs more economics, how much of human behavior comes down to dealing with our neuroses, and what it's like to make the transition from writing non-fiction to fiction.

 Annalee Newitz is currently an Editor at Large at Ars Technica. She received her Ph.D. in English and American Studies from UC Berkeley. She founded and edited io9, which later merged with Gizmodo, where she also served as editor. She and Charlie Jane Anders host the podcast Our Opinions Are Correct, a bi-weekly exploration of the meaning of science fiction.

# Episode 17: Annalee Newitz on Science, Fiction, Economics, and Neurosis
**Mindscape Podcast:** [October 08, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxjEThTH0A8)
*  Hello everybody and welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and today we're thinking about the future
*  Implicitly, of course, we think about the future a lot on this podcast and elsewhere
*  But today we're being a bit more upfront about it. There are people who
*  Describe themselves and are described by the outside world as professional
*  Futurists whose job it is to predict what will happen down the road
*  But there's this other genre which is also very successful called science fiction
*  Writing fictional narratives that are often set in the future not necessarily trying to predict exactly what will happen
*  But at least to imagine different possible futures
*  This helps us think about how we should approach the future as well as how we should approach the present
*  When I was a kid, I was a big science fiction fan mostly reading novels
*  But also watching TV and movies
*  But I can tell you from reading more recent science fiction that the level of sophistication has gone way up
*  Both the literary quality and also the scientific quality of modern science fiction is as high as it's ever been
*  In fact on today's podcast
*  I put forward the hypothesis that modern science fiction writers are in some sense the last great
*  Generalists because not only do you have to understand a lot about science?
*  You also have to understand a lot about humanity
*  So you need to understand sociology and psychology and you need to be able to write you need to be able to tell a good story
*  To invoke a vivid world to invent
*  Interesting and colorful characters. So our guest today Annali Newitz is absolutely one of those
*  Generalists someone who can think in interesting ways about a wide variety of things
*  Annali got her PhD in English and American studies from Berkeley, but then she became a writer specializing in science and technology
*  She was the founder of the famous blog io9
*  She was then the editor-in-chief of gizmodo and she's right now the editor-at-large at ours
*  Technica where she has a very wide variety of experience writing about both individual technological breakthroughs and also the background science
*  behind these breakthroughs
*  Recently Annali has decided to turn that experience to writing science fiction
*  She and science fiction writer Charlie Jane Anders actually co-host their own podcast which recently started
*  It's called our opinions are correct on which Charlie Jane and Annali discuss the meaning of science fiction
*  I encourage you to check that out and in her recent novel called autonomous Annali deals with the biochemistry of
*  Pharmaceuticals the ethics of robotics and artificial intelligence and my favorite the economics of what it means to have a right to work
*  She talks about slavery and indenture and people trying to work in different parts of the world
*  We take for granted the idea that we're allowed to work but maybe in the future that won't be the case
*  This is the kind of speculative scenario that science fiction is perfectly made for so on the podcast
*  We'll talk about science technology science fiction the difference between writing the fiction and nonfiction
*  And how we should think about what the future has in store. So let's go
*  I
*  Know it's welcome to the mindscape podcast. Yeah, thanks for having me
*  So I was reading an article in slate from a few months ago by you and if I could
*  Paraphrase the lesson it would be that science fiction needs more economics in it
*  Is that accurate and do you actually believe that I
*  Actually do believe that I thought it was very clever for coining the phrase dismal science fiction
*  I probably didn't really coin but it felt like I did at the time and to sort of describe
*  this
*  Cluster of issues that shows up in some science fiction novels where and also some fantasy as well
*  Where we kind of see characters grappling with the economic dimensions of what's going on whether that's space travel
*  and colonizing other worlds or
*  Whether that's getting a grant to study something which we almost never see in science fiction
*  And it's like it consumes the lives of scientists, you know, it's actually like a big part of how you do science
*  It certainly is I just I just for the audience out there read Annalee's wonderful debut novel autonomous
*  And yeah
*  There's a lot more about being the principal investigator in that novel and applying for grants than I've read in almost any other novel that I
*  can remember
*  I've gotten a lot of appreciative tweets from graduate students
*  Saying at last our labor has been acknowledged
*  And yeah, I mean I think that you know, one of the things we talk about a lot as science fiction writers is
*  World building and how do you make an imaginary world feel lived in and feel real so that your reader?
*  You know partly so your reader has a fun experience, but also so that it actually inspires people to really rethink
*  Reality, which is you know, ultimately what we're writing about since we don't actually travel into the future and and report on it
*  So and I and I think that especially right now
*  You know economics are becoming a really important part of
*  How we think about science how we deal with each other
*  What's shaping the future and so you know some writers are dealing with this more and more and
*  And also economists are you know really interested in building scenarios about the future, too
*  So I feel like there's a lot of
*  good opportunities there for us to be thinking about
*  Basically thinking about science in context if that makes sense like sort of thinking about not just like hey
*  We discovered a new particle, but how did that happen?
*  Like how did this dude get to be the one who discovered this particle out of all the people who were working on the project
*  Or like how did this project get the funding that allowed them to discover the particle like why did this particle accelerator?
*  Lose its funding, you know, why did this one even though it has lots of problems get to keep its funding
*  You know, there's all these weird questions that that sound really wonky
*  but they're actually part of making a really exciting story because part of what's fun is seeing people struggle to
*  Get what they want and that struggle isn't just shooting particles down an accelerator
*  Although that would be cool if it were that would be cool, but you're right. It's not exactly what it is
*  I have to ask before I forget. Have you read the famous Paul Krugman article about the
*  Economics of faster-than-light travel I
*  Have yeah, and that that's sparked a huge debate
*  I mean that was part of a huge debate within the science fiction community and people like Charles Strauss
*  We're proposing for a while that we have this kind of ultra realistic science fiction
*  mundane science fiction basically where we were just like not gonna have faster-than-light travel because it was just absurd and
*  So a few people signed on for that and like Charlie Strauss wound up getting around it by having
*  Teleportation gates in his work and I was like, okay
*  So we're not gonna have faster than light travel because that's just silly but teleportation gates no prob
*  Well, you know we have standards for ourselves and say it's for other people that's okay, but
*  I love this idea about making it realistic and it
*  Making the world a little bit more realistic
*  And it it making the world that you're creating realistic both in an economic sense as well as a technological sense because after all
*  Economics is an enormous influence on how we live our lives at a very basic level
*  So it led me to the following conjecture our science fiction writers the last great generalists
*  Because of all the stuff you have to know
*  Wow, that's a really interesting question
*  I mean, I think it's really gonna depend on the science fiction writer and also how they view their relationship to science
*  Because I think there's definitely science fiction writers out there
*  Maybe people like David Brin, for example
*  Who and and I think a lot of kind of writers who've now passed on who are really popular in the 50s and 60s
*  I think they really thought of themselves as
*  Like what we would probably today call like a foresight analyst or a futurist like they
*  I think they really did not feel like they were generalists who were commenting on the world today
*  But that they were actually predicting things that would happen based on you know
*  What they knew of the world a kind of well-informed prediction and I think now
*  Yeah, I mean some science fiction writers for sure are generalists
*  one of the
*  Kind of big
*  Breakout new voices in science fiction is Anne Leckie
*  Who won like every award in the universe for her ancillary justice series?
*  Yeah, they're fantastic and I mean she deals with
*  Everything like she deals with economics. She deals with space travel. She deals with AI. She deals with archaeology and
*  so and I know from talking to her that she is a voracious reader and like she'll read everything from
*  You know medieval chinese novels to
*  You know the latest
*  you know articles about
*  discoveries in science, so
*  I think you know she may be an outlier
*  There will always be a spectrum right? I mean I not every science fiction writer cares that much to
*  You know do the research and think about these things at an academic level
*  But not only it seems like if if you want to do a certain kind of writing not only do you have to catch up on?
*  humanity and economics and sociology and political science and
*  Technology and physics and biology, but you have to be able to tell a story
*  So there's the humanities are in there too
*  So it does strike me that the best equipped science fiction writers are true generalists in the old school sense of the word
*  Yeah, I think that's right and and it's funny because the the novel that i'm writing right now
*  Which won't be out for like a year or so. Sorry that i'm kind of teasing it a tiny bit
*  but it's
*  Like autonomous it has a lot of academics in it scientists, but also social scientists and
*  it's a it's set in an alternate timeline where
*  there is a need for
*  science and social science to
*  Work hand in hand and basically be in the same academic department. So this is a very kind of narrow
*  Fantasy of an alternate
*  History, I don't just have some teleportation machines in there. It's much more
*  I know there there is there's time machines
*  So that's that's sort of what has to happen, right?
*  There you have to have time machines in order to have like an academic department, which is completely integrated social science and science
*  and like physical science because it's geology and
*  and so part of what i've been thinking about a lot in this book is
*  Where does social science fit into the scientific project?
*  And I promise that the book is actually just mostly people running around in time machines and like fighting and stuff
*  But it's mostly it's like one of these law review articles that has three lines of text at the top and then a hundred lines
*  of footnotes the small fin yeah, there are there there will actually
*  There will be an afterward with some with some end notes
*  But it is but there is this kind of like for people like I said
*  I mean, you don't you won't need to go into the novel being like I have some thoughts about humanities and the sciences
*  but um
*  But that has i've been so some of the characters are social scientists and they're integral to this
*  scientific project and I was thinking about exactly what you're saying was storytelling and how what
*  What humanities and social sciences bring to science are a sense of history?
*  And also an ability to analyze social data, which is increasingly for especially in in the realm of technology
*  um, but in but also in a lot of areas of things like
*  You know infrastructure design and stuff that really does hit up against you know hard sciences or hard engineering
*  You know, we actually need to understand how humans act over time and and what humans have done at various points
*  pressure points or
*  You know what they do when they get into a big crowd versus what they do when they disperse
*  And there are patterns, you know, they're not it's not perfectly reproducible
*  As a as an ideal scientific experiment would be and that's very frustrating because
*  If only we always just acted the same way all the time. We could fix a lot of problems with humanity
*  That's why it's better to become a physicist than a sociologist. It's way easier to study atoms than people
*  Yeah, except except when there's all these like there's like dark matter and like
*  You know magical particles
*  I'm very simple really
*  No
*  Yeah, it really is compared to any person
*  Is it simple because you just like just put like dark in front of it and then we it's like is it dark matter?
*  Is it dark energy? Whatever you can literally write down on one page a model that fits all of the data, right?
*  Can you even imagine doing that with people? No, I mean, it's just not uh,
*  Of course, we don't know exactly what the dark matter is
*  It could be quite complicated
*  But in terms of explaining what you see out there in galaxies in the universe
*  The physics you need to imagine the dark matter has is actually really simple
*  So I i'm very i'm very happy in telling my students that people with short attention spans should go into physics rather than the social sciences
*  Because you can simplify things way down and the thing still works. That's the miracle
*  Yeah, I mean I do think there are efforts to do that with
*  The social sciences, I think game theory is a great example of um sort of social science
*  Trying to reduce all of human interactions to kind of these few basic laws and that's what's wrong with game theory
*  Is that you know, it works sometimes in some situations if you're literally playing a game
*  Or actually I love in the the new movie crazy rich asians that game theory becomes like an integral part of how to have a romance
*  Which in fact is kind of written into the history of game theory in a way
*  So anyway, it works in some cases, but um, it certainly you know doesn't explain all the ambiguities
*  To be fair. I think that game theory is just right in terms of its mathematical demonstrations of things
*  But then the question as always with math is are the assumptions behind these theorems that you've proven
*  matching on to the situation that you care about in reality and that's that's where
*  Game theory or calculus or algebra or anything can lead you wrong?
*  Certainly extrapolation and regression can lead you terribly terribly wrong. That's right
*  Yeah, and a lot of that does I mean it does end up coming down to
*  Um as you're saying like the fact that individual humans sometimes react in ways that we don't expect
*  Crowds of humans sometimes react in ways that we don't expect and it's you can say, okay
*  There's these general we see these general rules
*  If we look at the long arc of recorded history in the west we can say
*  All right, you know we see um, you know
*  General patterns emerging in terms of how people group together and what kinds of political structures they seem to enjoy
*  Um, but there's a huge variety of those political structures. There's a huge variety of ways that we've gotten together. So
*  It's hard. I mean, it's it's so
*  Tempting to be like, all right, i'm going to come up with the universal theory of human
*  relationships or of human
*  Uh development in some ways and um, you know, everybody's tried it. Karl Marx tried to do it in the 19th century
*  Um, and you know, it's it doesn't it doesn't ever completely work
*  Well, I think we even know why it doesn't work out, right?
*  I mean the famous example is Isaac Asimov in Psychohistory, right?
*  And he had in mind I think was pretty explicit in the novels. He had this analogy when you have a bunch of
*  Atoms in a box of gas you can extrapolate general rules for their behavior as a fluid, right?
*  Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. So of course when you get many people you can do the same thing
*  But as a physicist there's an obvious flaw in that reasoning which is that in the case of atoms
*  They just simply bump into each other and respond in a very linear way
*  small things remain small or even get smoothed out wild fluctuations get
*  Cancelled out by all the other fluctuations. Whereas in a group of human beings who interact very strongly and non-linearly
*  Tiny fluctuations can be amplified very very strongly
*  It is absolutely possible from a physics point of view to understand why
*  Groups of people can be influenced by individuals that have a strong impact on the others
*  Yeah, i'm reading a novel right now called an unkindness of ghosts by river solomon
*  Which just came out it's it's really great
*  it's a generation ship novel and so it's set in the future because you know, we don't have generation ships yet and
*  That's what they'll have you believe. Yeah
*  Um, I i'm sure that like, you know harp is working on it
*  but one of the things that's great in in solomon's novel is that she
*  deals with the way that this generation ship has recreated plantation life and so they have
*  Slaves and servants who are living in the lower decks and doing all the scut work and then they have kind of the plantation owners
*  Um, and it does break down along familiar racial lines
*  In this book where there's sort of lighter skinned people on top darker skinned people on the bottom
*  And this is a great example of that of an author trying to play with what you're talking about where a tiny
*  um, or a large fluctuation
*  continues to echo
*  Over centuries, you know, so there's been this incredible historical disturbance of the slavery of africans in the united states
*  And it doesn't just go away. It doesn't like the the kind of ripples that have propagated out from that historical trauma
*  um
*  Just don't it
*  You know you you would hope like you would wish that they would just kind of bump into other things and like that those
*  Ripples would like bump into the obama presidency and be like aha everything's fixed
*  But it isn't fixed and in fact, sometimes the effects get bigger over time
*  Or they return in new ways that are just as pernicious. And so that's the fun part of being a writer
*  It's the sad part of history. But the fun part of being a writer is thinking about how
*  There are these social effects that can have very unexpected consequences and also
*  That they can
*  Continue, you know to me like writing about the future
*  um
*  That's one of the pleasures of it is I think for some science fiction writers
*  The pleasure is coming up with all the new shit, you know, like oh my god
*  We're gonna have you know faster than light travel or we're gonna, you know implant other personalities inside our heads
*  And to me I was I was really interested in how
*  How would history?
*  You know come back in some new form and how would we continue to have some of the same struggles?
*  Which is probably partly why I was excited about talking about economics because I don't think in 150 years
*  We're going to have gotten rid of capitalism and we're not going to be you know, science is not magically going to pay for itself
*  and so I really wanted to like think about how
*  People in the future would still be
*  Even though there's many many things that are different, even though they have hard ai, which is a kind of magical dubious thing
*  But they also are still trying to get grants and they're still struggling with social inequality
*  Tell us a little bit more about exactly what you imagined economically in autonomous or in fact
*  Tell us about autonomous just a little bit. So those have not yet read it shame on you. Uh, can follow along
*  um, so autonomous is about a
*  Uh pharmaceutical pirate. She is a former academic, uh synthetic biologist and
*  wants to bring
*  medicine to
*  people who are poor or
*  Just don't have any money at all who don't have access to it and she's found that working in academia
*  Isn't allowing her to do that. There's too much. There's too much political stuff
*  There's too many corporations that want to hold on to those drug patents. So she becomes a pirate and starts
*  creating versions of these expensive medicines
*  For free or for very cheap to give to people who can't afford them
*  And she comes on the radar of the corporation whose drugs she's ripping off and they send a couple of agents after her
*  basically to render her because they don't there's a couple of other things that they're trying to cover up that she knows about and
*  Render here being a euphemism for exterminate pretty much
*  They're not they're not the the corporation isn't worried about touchy-feely. Yeah
*  And so the agents who come after her become
*  Main characters in the book as well and we switch back and forth between jack the pirate
*  And paladin the robot who is part of this team of agents chasing after jack
*  um, and so
*  The world that they're in is a world where uh, basically the un has been replaced by
*  A group that I call the international property coalition. So
*  Human rights have kind of been superseded by property rights and that's kind of how people think of human rights is in the context of property
*  which makes sense because
*  um robots are human equivalent in this world and they are born indentured to pay off the cost of their manufacture
*  And eventually through some legal shenanigans that have happened in the past and there's like a tiny info dump where we learn this in the book
*  um
*  Humans also are now subject to what they call the human rights indenture laws
*  So you have the lucky right that if you need to, uh, you can sell yourself to someone and they will own you for a set
*  period of time
*  Uh, and of course, there's a ton of abuses in the system
*  And basically it's a it's a story about the future of slavery and how how do we reinvent slavery and give it a bunch of euphemisms?
*  and a big part of that is
*  the economic system in
*  one of the sort of large economic coalitions that we see a lot which is kind of a combination of
*  North it's basically north america. It's canada and the u.s. Have become this kind of free trade zone
*  and in order to um
*  Work or own a house or go to school
*  In the free trade zone you have to buy a franchise in a city
*  And when you do that, you know
*  You pay a certain amount of money
*  To get in and then you pay every year and then you get free health care
*  Uh, you get the right to work and live there you get free schooling
*  Um, you get free internet
*  You know emergency services all the things that you would expect to get paid for by the government in our world
*  Well, not all of those but many of those not all of those we dream about them
*  Yeah, we dream about some of those but things like having roads and having um access to education and things like that
*  We kind of think of as just well, that's just what you get, you know, of course you have roads
*  You know, that's part of what you pay taxes for. Um at a minimum
*  We also imagine that you know in our world we think oh well, you should have the right to work anywhere
*  Um, and in this future, you know
*  That has that right just hasn't doesn't exist anymore. You know, if you want to work somewhere you have to pay in
*  um, so you and there's this parallelism for human beings, uh, who are allowed to sell themselves into indenture and
*  The ai robots which are sort of automatically there until they can buy their way out if I am remembering it correctly
*  Yeah, so basically, um when robots are
*  Pretty much when all robots are born and these are these are of course artificially intelligent robots
*  So they're they're you know, their consciousness isn't like a human's but it is equivalent to a human's
*  Um, they have you know feelings and desires and things like that
*  Um, so yeah, so they're the law says that they can be indentured for up to 10 years
*  To whoever manufactures them like I said to pay off the cost of their manufacture
*  And not all robots survive that period of time
*  But if they do then they are given an autonomy key and are allowed to kind of go
*  Be productive members of society
*  um, and we do get to see a couple moments of where we meet some robots that have
*  gotten out of indenture
*  And they you know, one of the things they love to do is just go shopping
*  Because they're basically people
*  They're like now we're free. Um, and so we'll go shopping at a mall in vancouver. So
*  the so the the economy is
*  uh, you know, it's a hyper capitalist economy where um,
*  You know a lot of the things that we think of as our rights
*  Which have nothing to do with capitalism. They just have to do with how the united states was set up
*  Those rights have been taken away
*  Like I said the right to work wherever you want the right to live wherever you want
*  But they have been replaced by new property rights where you can pay to work where you want and pay to live where you want
*  um, and so that's why people get indentured because if you don't have enough money to pay to be part of a city
*  Um or or some other community
*  You're just gonna die unless you sell yourself. Um, I mean, so those are your choices die or become indentured
*  So it reminds us we do take things for granted, right?
*  Uh
*  both explicitly and implicitly in our laws we have rights that we label and some I was talking to uh,
*  uh a law professor on a different episode of the podcast not yet released but um
*  about the fact that
*  There's a lot of things we think should be rights that no one ever thought to put in the constitution because everyone knows that they're rights, right?
*  uh, and
*  We might even have mentioned that the right to work as as one of them and uh,
*  But that can be taken away, especially if the economic system changes
*  It's it's very true
*  And I it was because I was talking to an economist as I was coming up as I was doing world building on this
*  That I thought about that because he he pointed out
*  um, this is our friend noah smith, I bet right our friend noah smith, um, who is a
*  Dedicated dystopian thinker and um, even though he's a pretty cheerful guy. Um, no opinion on twitter. Yes
*  Notorious twitter personality. Um, and he he said exactly what we're saying
*  You know, he was like well, we think that we should just be allowed to live wherever we want. But actually that's a really
*  amazing right to to just have that at birth like a lot of
*  civilizations didn't have that and don't have that so
*  um, so basically I just had to take away some of these basic rights from my characters and suddenly it made perfect sense that
*  people would choose to be indentured and
*  And indeed, I mean even in our world now like there's plenty of jobs that people do that are basically indenture. I mean
*  Well kind of like being a grad student, for example
*  And I I was definitely thinking of that I I spent many many years as a grad student and I definitely had a
*  Grumpy feeling about my employment situation. We prefer apprenticeship to indentured servitude
*  Which is just another way of saying indenture, you know, it's like you're and in fact you're paying in
*  You know, it's the university system is like you pay in in order to have the right to work there
*  At least in my experience and you know, I mean some people get fancier deals probably but the point is
*  A humanities graduate student physics graduate students get paid. It's true. Yeah, I mean we got paid a little bit
*  Um, and I was you know, and I was kind of on the border with social science
*  So maybe but we yeah, it certainly was not
*  In some ways it's good that it's not like science because there's nobody who has to scramble to get money to pay us because there's
*  No money, there's no money, but the department kind of would try to hand out jobs in a relatively equitable way
*  So, you know, it's like here's a thousand dollars for this semester
*  Um, everybody gets a thousand dollars for the semester. Yay
*  Yay
*  And how did it work
*  In terms of the mechanics of writing the novel going back and forth between world building and storytelling
*  I presume that the world building influences the storytelling
*  But do you have you know pages and pages of unpublished world building materials stuck on your hard drive somewhere? I do
*  have
*  An embarrassingly large amount of world building materials that never made it in
*  um a lot of stuff
*  I think has to be
*  Barely painted in in the background because you know readers don't want to wade through like a giant info dump where it's like as
*  You know bob like in this world. Here's how indenture works and you know as you move into the cities
*  This is what's happening. So really like the book
*  The way the book comes together
*  I think or came together for me and I think the way novels generally come together for me is it starts with characters
*  And I start to think about the world that they're in
*  And then I have to really focus on the character to write the book and I feel like that's kind of laying the
*  The groundwork is okay. Here's the characters. Here's what happens to them
*  Here's how they change or don't change and then I have to come back again kind of at the end and say, okay
*  So what are the rules of the world? I need to smooth this out and make sure everything is consistent. Otherwise
*  Every nerd in the universe is going to be smacking their face as they read this book because it's just completely
*  Incoherent in terms of how the world works. I mean, that's interesting
*  I think uh, and I noticed this with my wife. Jennifer who's also a science writer
*  We write writer an awesome science writer. That was implicit
*  Uh, we write our books very differently and i'm guessing that if I were to write a novel
*  I would write it very differently than that
*  Like I would have to do all the world building first and then have to come up with what the characters are doing in that
*  World just like when I write my non-fiction books
*  I start with chapter one and then chapter two and then chapter three and jennifer can start with chapter seven just uh,
*  Like it's no big deal and drives me crazy
*  I definitely with with both my fiction and non-fiction writing because I I do non-fiction books as well
*  I have to start with chapter one too and I
*  I know people like jennifer who are like no but start in the middle and um, and I have writer friends
*  Who do fiction who they you know?
*  They'll kind of write a bunch of scenes and then figure out where they go and that drives me crazy. I have to know
*  I have to know what the world is
*  And I have to know what the care I I have to start with the characters from the beginning and go to the end
*  And it's true when I get to the end I go back to the beginning and sort of clean everything up
*  But yeah, I have i'm very linear. I guess
*  I live in linear time. So I I try to honor that in my work
*  And it's one of the good things about different ways of creating things
*  I remember when we did a science consult with ridley scott
*  Uh for one of his movies that hasn't been made yet
*  He was going to adapt the forever war by the joe holderman novel
*  And you know, so there was no script written yet
*  Of course the novel had been written but it was clear that ridley scott had in his mind certain very specific scenes all
*  Painted out right like he knew visually what it was going to be like and the words, you know
*  They would they would appear, you know to fit whatever you wanted to happen
*  But he knew what it would look like from the start and that's yet another way to start with a project like that
*  Yeah, and I think I mean for sure
*  Like the novel i'm working on right now
*  Which i'm almost done with like there were certain scenes that I knew I wanted in there toward the end
*  And I kept thinking I didn't write them down because I didn't I wasn't there yet
*  But I was so like just the other day
*  I wrote one of them finally and I was like, yes, I finally wrote that scene
*  Um, and you know, so there is definitely like you I feel like um in tv writing people call them beats
*  Um, and it's you know, you know where the beats are going to be and then you kind of write yourself into them
*  And you like
*  Sorry, let me back up. There's a whole long tradition of
*  scientists
*  Diving in and writing the occasional science fiction novel with mixed results, shall we say right?
*  I mean we're we're trained through a lifetime of being an academic to
*  Talk and think one way and being a fiction writer is very different now
*  You got your start as a science writer's I guess as a tech writer and then a science writer and then you made the transition into fiction
*  so
*  What was that like were you always planning to write fiction at some point or was it a huge change of gears?
*  It was a pretty big change of gears
*  I already I thought I had already been through the big transition when I moved from
*  Um writing as an academic to writing popular work
*  writing journalism and and sort of pop science and
*  And also, of course, I switched from kind of a humanities focus to looking at tech and science
*  So I was like, okay i'm done with all my big transitions
*  and um, yeah
*  it never really works out that way and um, so making the transition from
*  Academic writing to popular writing I have to say was actually much more difficult in many ways than transitioning from science
*  non-fiction to science fiction
*  because
*  When you're writing for an academic audience, you're trying to do so many things that are very different
*  Um, like you're not worried about popular or mass appeal
*  You often are like buried in a long tradition of thought and so you're having to kind of talk about here's what everybody else
*  In this field has done. Here's my one tiny contribution that like takes us slightly forward and to the left
*  and
*  um with pop fiction and non-fiction
*  You don't have to do as much of that kind of work. I mean part of your job is also just to engage the reader which
*  You know is a whole
*  um
*  It's a whole craft that you have to learn how to be engaging and how to tell a story that people want to keep reading
*  A craft that so many academics have zero training or interest in learning about yeah, right and that but that was actually like
*  it's like a hard transition because one of the things that one of the freedoms that academic writing gives you is to be as
*  Weird and quirky as you want and like have like a title for your essay
*  That's like some weird play on an 18th century poem and like
*  The three people that read that article are going to be like, yes, that's so funny. Annali. That was hilarious
*  And you feel like wow, I I that was so sophisticated there were like 90 levels of of references there
*  Um and like that's not something you can do in popular fiction
*  I mean in in some limited ways you can do that for sure and I I definitely have like
*  Weird obscure references in my books, but that can't be the whole thing
*  You know, you also have to tell a story that's like that's that people can relate to and that speaks to
*  A lot of people and not just like the five people that are interested in like marxist cultural studies, which is what I was doing
*  so so you think that the experience of
*  Going through that transition and becoming a popular science writer was extremely helpful for your next transition into fiction
*  It really was because I had already before I wrote autonomous or actually I should say in the middle of writing
*  Autonomous because I wrote a really shitty first draft which I put away
*  Uh and then wrote uh scatter adapt and remember which is a non-fiction science book about mass extinction and how humans will survive
*  the current mass extinction
*  and
*  that book
*  I did a lot of learning about how to
*  Structure an arc in an in a book, you know
*  Like how to make it have a beginning middle and end I don't think I fully succeeded
*  But I definitely but the failures there helped teach me
*  Oh, you know, I need to have this kind of connective tissue
*  um
*  You know aristotle was right about storytelling, right?
*  I mean, this is a reason why someone pointed out that why hollywood movies do well compared to a lot of foreign films
*  It's not that hollywood movies appeal to the lowest common denominator, but they understand story structure
*  There are acts there are conflicts that get resolved at the right time and that's a whole skill to have to learn
*  Yeah, it's there's
*  That's a big part of it and certainly I mean i've been reading science fiction my whole life
*  And so I definitely have like a template in my head where it's like, oh
*  You know
*  This is how you tell a story you do what octavia butler would do or you do what urs leguin would do
*  And you know that there have been many times when i've thought what would octavia butler what would octavia do, of course
*  Yeah, and like and she would basically, you know, she's famous for having spent
*  Lots of time with false starts and revision and you know writing like half a novel and tossing it aside because she was very
*  Exacting about how to tell a story and that's why her stories are so engaging and like stick with you for so long
*  so I think I
*  Um, I really enjoyed making the transition
*  I was really surprised that it worked so well
*  And I was even more surprised that people actually liked autonomous because I thought it was just going to be like a weird book about like
*  Robot sex and people would be there'd be like four it'd be like my academic writing like four people would be like
*  This is the greatest thing ever and everybody else would be like that book happened. I don't know
*  um, so I was so
*  gratified that my
*  um, you know weird ideas and my my efforts to make them appeal to more than just me actually kind of worked
*  So to be to be fair, there is robot sex there in the book or actually is there robot sex?
*  There's robot on human sex
*  I mean, that's robot sex any robots are having sex
*  Anytime robots are having sex. It's robot sex. But um, yeah, and I mean that was part of what you know, like there's some
*  Quirky stuff in this novel and so, you know as well as you know, of course my exegesis on the future of economics
*  um, there's also
*  Uh, you know human relationships and romance and stuff like that
*  So and I think that's part of what people really liked even though pallet and the robot does some mean things
*  Um, she's also a really uh, relatable character and she's she's
*  Kind of just been born in a way. She's just been booted up. So she's learning not to be a jerk
*  Well, we have to talk about paladin a little bit paladin the robot
*  One we talked about the economics and how that goes into the world building
*  There's also a lot of ideas in the novel about ai and robots in general
*  And so one of the things you already touched on so I just want to touch on it again
*  We're certainly sympathetic with paladin, right?
*  I mean it's you know, she's discovering herself and sort of a newbie in the world and an ingenue and discovering things
*  And then she kills people pretty ruthlessly all the time
*  And it's almost like you have to read it twice like did that really just happen? Was that a
*  intentional, uh
*  Kind of mood setting device or how did that come to you?
*  so
*  Paladin was the first character that came to me in the novel so that I sort of started with paladin and
*  And kind of ended with paladin too because when I when I did my major revision
*  Paladin was the character that changed the most and I I felt like
*  I I like characters who are complex and in a gray area
*  And this is a robot that was designed to be a combat robot like
*  You know, there's no question why paladin is there is basically just to
*  You know do some reconnaissance and then do some killing killing people part of the job
*  Yeah part of the programming part of the job and part of his programming and um
*  he starts out, uh as
*  Basically owned by a military branch of the african federation and the african federation is kind of like the eu for african nations
*  In this future and so it's a bunch of african nations kind of sharing the same currency and things like that. So
*  So he's owned by the african federation
*  Everyone just kind of assumes he's a he because if you're a big giant bulky terminator looking motherfucker, you must be a dude
*  um, and he doesn't really care one way or the other but
*  Um, but his gender identity. He's a robot. He's like whatever. I don't really have gender. Um
*  But as the book goes along and he starts learning more about people
*  And how people relate to each other and what they think of as being important
*  He starts to uh, he wants to change his pronoun
*  So she becomes she in the middle of the book kind of arbitrarily, uh for a bunch of reasons that I don't want to spoil
*  And so she kind of goes through some of the things that a human teenager might go through
*  You know, she's she's just been booted up. She's kind of questioning the role that she's been assigned in the world
*  she's questioning who she is and who she can love and
*  And you know how she wants humans to perceive her because changing her pronoun, of course is all about
*  Um, you know what humans perceive because again robots don't really care about gender that much. Um, so
*  I I wanted people to like have this sort of crunchy
*  difficult
*  relationship with paladin and not have it be just like paladin is a
*  An innocent sweet robot, you know paladin crushes people's brains like that's her job and you know, she eventually
*  Toward the end is kind of like huh? Why am I doing this job? Well, i'll just kill some more people brain crushing
*  Is that really my purpose? Yeah
*  And she never has again
*  I mean, I I don't kind of spoon feed the reader like she never has a moment where she kind of scratches her head and is
*  Like what's his meaning of life?
*  But she does start questioning
*  her programming and she's given a chance to
*  Really see how she's been programmed and that's a really important turning point
*  and again for me this was a lot of it was thinking about
*  what it again what it's like to be a teenager or what it's like to become a young adult and
*  Suddenly you realize that there's all this stuff you're doing just because you've been told that you should do it and just because you've been
*  Told it's right and you know lots of people
*  Um, for example grow up with religious programming and they just have never questioned it and all of a sudden they're like wait
*  Why am I doing all this stuff? Do I really believe this? How do I how do I want to be religious?
*  Do I want to be and paladin's kind of going through something like that?
*  Um with her programming is kind of rethinking all the stuff she's been taught and so that was so fun to write
*  um, especially because
*  You know unlike a person who can't necessarily go into their own mind and be like I have here
*  I have discovered the programming called catholic church and now I can remove it
*  Because you just can't do that. You can't remove it if you're a person but for a robot
*  She actually can go in eventually and see all the programs. She's running and be like, oh, that's why I was feeling that way
*  Oh, I could modify that. Um, so like robots would be great in therapy. That's what I think
*  You could well be very not not a very lucrative customer because you know fix them and then you go away
*  That's not what a therapist wants at all. Yeah
*  I mean
*  But it might be really complex like it might therapists might have to essentially like a robot therapist would have to be
*  Basically some kind of programmer. Um, or maybe even a hacker, you know
*  Because you'd have to build little hacks to kind of get around like well
*  You need this program, but this program is also telling you to like fall in love with guides who are really bad for you
*  But we want to keep part of the program, but not that other part
*  So, you know, it's it could be complex. Well, so I have thoughts on this both ways one is, uh, it's it's
*  provocative to think about an artificially intelligent
*  mind
*  Being able to pinpoint programs that give them motivation to do certain things in certain ways
*  Because it teaches us or makes us think something about human beings like in some sense. We're robots. We're computers
*  Anyway, we're physical organisms. There's things in our brains going on. That's right might
*  Imagine pinpointing. Oh, there's the part of my brain that makes me fall in love with bad boys who I know will cheat on me
*  And would we want to go in there? You know pay money to the surgeon to go in there and fix that part of our brain
*  Yeah, I mean that's kind of the question that's asked in the movie the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind where there's a
*  Technology I love that movie and i'm sure it's sort of part of what influenced me
*  And that that in that movie
*  There's a technology where you can nuke a set of memories so that you you know
*  You can forget a mean person in your life or maybe you can forget your your lust for bad boys or whatever
*  So yeah, I think that that is a question that um, you know these characters have to deal with for paladin
*  that's less of a concern because
*  She can see all of the modifications she's making and
*  But there are
*  That said there are moments where she's having to second guess the humans around her because she knows that the humans don't have that
*  Same ability and so she has to say
*  Okay, is this person speaking to me out of their programming or do they really mean it?
*  And again, that's a very human question because you never know is this person just being polite or do they really like me?
*  And so that's that's it, you know, and so um
*  the fun thing with
*  Paladin is that while she's having these very human thoughts
*  I also, you know based her consciousness on basically a unix system
*  and
*  Thought about how you know early unix computers networked with each other and what would it be like?
*  If you had a consciousness that had kind of grown out of
*  Um computer networks and how would you how would these ai's communicate with each other?
*  And so I have them doing
*  You know secure handshakes and when they meet each other
*  They're speaking to each other wirelessly the robots are and kind of announcing themselves in the same way that
*  You know data announces itself to a computer on the network where it says hello. Here comes my data
*  So i'm kind of translating from you know, what packets are saying as they reach a port
*  um, and so
*  I felt like I made
*  Paladin sufficiently alien and sufficiently
*  connected to a tradition of
*  computer
*  minds
*  That you know some of her problems really aren't human problems
*  Like some of her problems are really like network security problems and you know, there is a whole
*  bit where she has to kind of
*  she kind of has to deal with what it means to have a
*  Mind that is stored in the cloud and she doesn't control that, you know her the company that owns her
*  Basically owns her backups, which is her mind
*  And so that's a thing that humans haven't really had to deal with quite yet and not in a literal sense
*  Anyway, and I think that this does also raise questions about artificial intelligence
*  So I think that the the fact that paladin can sort of pinpoint in her brain certain programs that make her feel certain ways
*  Provokes us into thinking a certain way about human free will right but on the flip side of that
*  I'm a little skeptical that artificial intelligence would work
*  As sort of conscious human level ai if you couldn't reprogram yourself, you know
*  I mean I hear so many conversations about artificial intelligence that are about how we should program the computer
*  So it doesn't do bad things and I can't really imagine that that would qualify as artificial intelligence if it couldn't change its mind
*  in some profound way
*  I completely agree with you and
*  one of the things i've said about
*  this book over and over is that
*  It's it is science fiction, but there is this fantasy at the heart of it
*  Which is that we just sort of wave our hands and have strong ai and don't ask any questions
*  Because I think that in real life
*  Um as we explore more and more what machine learning means and what it means to build machine learning algorithms into other applications
*  um
*  We're realizing that first of all
*  We don't know what the hell intelligence is at all like in humans in anything like we are totally square one with that
*  and I mean sure there's a lot of people who have a lot of different definitions, but
*  um
*  You know trying to recreate something that we can't even quantify in ourselves is really tough
*  um the other thing that
*  I think
*  we're learning is that
*  Intelligence to the extent that it can be talked about is really an ecosystem. There's different kinds of intelligence
*  And i'm not just talking about dumb stuff like emotional intelligence, which I think whatever that's like a self-help book thing
*  I mean kinds of intelligence that work on different kinds of problems
*  intelligence that presents itself as maybe not seeming very intelligent
*  Or but it actually is brilliant at doing some one particular task or a set of tasks
*  and I think
*  uh the whole movement around
*  um
*  sort of the idea of
*  Neurotypicality being actually not really that typical
*  uh is really helping us in a way much more than um
*  than you might think uh in terms of defining intelligence because once we have an idea that
*  There's a spectrum of what it means to have
*  Consciousness and intelligence and it's not just like here's the one kind of consciousness that we recognize as intelligent and everything other than that
*  Is like autistic or you know schizophrenic or whatever the other names are that we're using
*  at whatever point in history
*  So which is a very abstract way of saying
*  that
*  When we actually if we ever do have something that resembles what gets called strong ai
*  Which is basically human equivalent ai it may actually look nothing like paladin it may
*  Express itself in ways that are really hard for us to relate to
*  um, it may be like talking to a very non-neurotypical person and
*  we're going to have to learn to kind of translate from those machines and I think
*  Some of them might turn out to be kind of like paladin
*  But I agree with you that if we really wanted to imitate
*  a human mind
*  It would have to be self-modifying in some way and if it weren't self-modifying
*  I don't know if I would say it couldn't be human equivalent, but it would be equivalent to a human who had been
*  horribly abused and and kind of culturally programmed like maybe like a cult victim or something like that
*  someone who hadn't been allowed to make any choices and and as a result maybe was
*  You know had had experienced a huge amount of trauma
*  So if you can imagine
*  Go ahead go ahead
*  I was gonna say my own suspicion is that
*  my own suspicion is that
*  We'll have a hundred different kinds of artificial intelligence before we have anything that is really like a human being
*  I think that we way underestimate how hard it is to get something that's like a human being. I think it will happen. It is a
*  Obstacle in principle, but there's many different ways to be intelligent word is discovering this already
*  It's way easier to build a computer that will win at chess
*  Than a computer that will carry on a fun conversation with you and part of that is that
*  It's not just you know processing power, but it's also motivations
*  It's our brains are embodied in our bodies that you know get hungry and thirsty and want to reproduce and you want to sing songs?
*  and it's going to be
*  You could have other motivations for an embodied robot, but they wouldn't be the same
*  So I would be surprised if the first second third fourth generations of ai were anything like human beings at all
*  I think I mean as as we've been saying I think it's going to be an ecosystem
*  so I think there's going to be some ai's whose motivations are
*  Incredibly difficult for us to relate to we might know what those motivations are
*  But they won't fit anything we we won't be able to feel those motivations in the same way an ai might on the other hand
*  If we do assume that we can create a human equivalent ai and program it
*  We might very well program it to have the same kinds of fucked up desires that humans do right like it might
*  We might give it what what fukko calls a perverse implantation
*  Which is just his way of talking about how we sort of teach people to
*  To think that their own desires are terrible and wrong even though we feel them all the time because they're as you said
*  We're we live in meat sacks and we have built-in
*  urges and needs
*  um, but using culture
*  We can try to train people that these urges and needs
*  Are bad and and can modify them right so we can modify how people
*  Want to have sex or we can modify how people want to eat. That's why people have so many
*  Um weird rituals around sex and food because these are these basic things that we want and culture has just like
*  swarmed all over them and like messed them up and made them complex in ways that are like
*  infinite, you know, it's like just like infinite complexity laid on top of like
*  basically just
*  Eating and reproducing people like it's not these are not complex
*  Activities, but we've we've really we fetishize them to the point of like absurdity
*  And so I think you could imagine a robot that um, you know had a lot of hang-ups
*  Martha wells has a great series called murder bot, which is a series of novellas
*  Which I highly recommend where she has a robot who has a lot of
*  Social problems and partly due to its programming partly due to the fact that like paladin
*  It's kind of a murder bot, you know, it's a murder bot. It's designed to kill and protect and um,
*  And it copes with all of its problems and all of its hang-ups by
*  downloading a huge amount of soap operas to its local memory and then just watching soaps and
*  And it's you know, it's this very human
*  You know tick that this robot has but it made me think about how we really could
*  Through cultural conditioning create ai that are very human and that learn about life from
*  from stories and that um, you know
*  Crave stories in the same way that people do and so I think
*  You know, like I said, it's going to be an ecosystem and it's going to be way weirder than we thought
*  I don't think we're going to have a robot uprising. I think it's much more like
*  robots and ai and machine learning will kind of
*  Merge into human society in ways that are sometimes
*  Hard to tell apart from human society
*  Like if you get an implant that's kind of an ai or you kind of become partly ai
*  I think it's that the
*  I think we're going to end up with a spectrum, you know where it's there's
*  totally biological human intelligence all the way on the other side is like totally machine intelligence and
*  You know everything in the middle
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right and i'm on your side there did you get uh,
*  Did you do a lot of conversing with ai experts and robot experts for the novel just like economics? I did yes
*  I talked to I talked to um
*  Hardware experts about how a robot body would be put together because that was something that I didn't know very much about
*  I read a lot about ai and machine learning. Um, I had also already been
*  Um, you know writing in my journalism a lot about it and a lot about just um
*  computer networks in general
*  I used to when I first started my career. I wrote a lot about computer security and hacking
*  which is actually a great way to learn about computer networking because it's all about the ways that um, you know
*  subversive activities can take place and people can kind of sneak around all of the protocols or all of the
*  You know all of the things that are supposedly safe
*  uh, and so it's in a way it's almost like studying computer security or writing about it is almost like looking at
*  computer network neurosis because it's all about how to like unwanted thoughts and
*  And applications appear in this like good pure
*  uh mind of the computer or mind of your network of computers and so
*  um
*  So I had kind of all of that stuff in my head and it had been sitting in my head for a pretty long time
*  So I was like at last I can finally use this knowledge to build a robot
*  So your grand unified theory is that everything we do is a kind of therapy for one thing or another
*  Actually, well
*  Or the opposite right like that everything we do everything is a neurosis and all we're doing is trying to you know
*  Deal with our neurosis become functionally neurotic
*  Humans or machine I mean
*  And just to like not kill each other like ultimately like I think a lot of my work including the novel
*  I'm working on now like the big struggle is just like
*  Just don't kill each other. You know, like I know you're mad
*  I know you're feeling neurotic, but just
*  You know put the gun down no brain crushing. Let's just work it out like grown-up robots
*  Speaking of neurotic you also there's a whole
*  sort of yet another technological angle in autonomous where
*  There are these synthetic drugs being made and then pirated. That's what jack does for a living and so
*  You also talk into pharma people and biochemists about how drugs could make you more or less neurotic or helpful or less
*  Yes, I did
*  Talk to a lot of very
*  Kind and sympathetic
*  Biologists I talked to a couple of synthetic biologists
*  I talked to
*  A genetic engineer about kind of about the lab scenes
*  I gave him an early copy of the book and it was really funny because he was like well
*  You know actually the lab scenes are fine like and you know, this is all
*  You know, this is all good
*  But you call there's this one machine that you have and it it's a fabber and he's like why is everything a fabber?
*  Like that is not how it would work. Like there would be it might have the same technology
*  But like there'd be a bunch of different special use cases and all different kinds of fabbers
*  So that is just terrible
*  And so I actually did go in and and change it so that a lot of things now that we used to be called a fabber
*  Have other names there's like cookers and there's you know devices again special use devices that are basically 3d printers that can print tissue or print
*  You know print various molecular structures and stuff like that. So
*  So that was really helpful. And then
*  I did
*  to
*  Neuroscientists about the drug that the characters are taking which is getting them addicted
*  to work
*  and
*  They um, and I was like, okay, here's how the drug would work. And what do you think and they were like, oh, yeah
*  Wow, that could work. Oh, that's so evil. Yes. Oh very evil. So they were excited about the evil
*  Happens all the time. I mean
*  When I have done the movie consulting, you know, it's uh physicists consulting with people making movies is fairly straightforward, right?
*  Like the answer to everything is you need a wormhole to do it. But
*  Biologists you told me when I consulted with you because it's the truth. I mean, I'm excited
*  You don't need a physics consultant. You just need an ai chatbot to say yes. Yes, you need a wormhole
*  Just put the wormhole in there
*  It's not realistic, but you need it anyway
*  But if you want if the if you're a writer or producer or whatever and you say, okay, I need an organism, you know a
*  Germ that will go in and have the following terrible effect on humankind. The biologist will go no, I don't think that oh
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah sure. We can do that. No problem. And it's kind of scary from that point of view. Yeah
*  And in fact like I I just outright stole some ideas with permission
*  From from some of the biologists I talked to I have like a final, you know final boss fight scene where they're using a bunch of cool
*  futuristic technology, they're sort of repurposing stuff and um, and uh
*  The biologist I was talking to said
*  Oh
*  But you know you couldn't do that
*  But you could do this other thing which would cause his skin to like erupt with stuff and I was like, oh, yeah
*  So anyway, that's not too much of a spoiler, but um, but they do pay me to do this
*  This is the best thing ever. How could I get a job? So good?
*  Yeah
*  Well, I also just like I always have like a warm feeling when a scientist tells me that something is plausible
*  Even if they're sort of saying like with a caveat that of course, it's not plausible
*  And it's like like when you told me about wormholes
*  I was like, okay
*  I can use wormholes because sean said it's okay, even though he said also wormholes couldn't really exist
*  But he said they could kind of maybe possibly exist
*  There are different levels. There's an ecosystem of violating the laws of physics, right? So that's
*  Perfectly there's acceptable ones and less acceptable ones. Yeah. Yeah, exactly
*  I think the thing that's most important to me when representing science is trying to represent the scientific process accurately
*  Which is to say showing people testing things and retesting them
*  And like how do you test things, you know, like I have a character who's testing?
*  photonic molecule levels, which is not a thing there is not photonic molecules, but
*  but you would in fact have to go test the levels on on a device over and over to kind of make the
*  Suppositions that she does so I wanted at least to be honest in that way so that people understand that science is actually a lot
*  of dreary testing
*  And not a lot of gazing rapturously into glowing holes and saying like it's full of stars
*  We'll allow some absurdity, but we want our absurdities to be grounded in the scientific method as much as possible. Exactly
*  and how much of the
*  discussion of
*  the intersection between economics and pharma in the book was a commentary of reflection or inspired by the real world right now
*  100 inspired by the real world. I mean I I live in the real world
*  maybe to my
*  Detriment and so everything I write about is you know, my brain
*  Takes it in and I either consciously or probably a lot of times unconsciously kind of smush it up and
*  Try to rethink it and put it on the page. So
*  I've like a lot of people in the united states
*  I've seen i've had many friends that suffered horribly because they couldn't afford
*  medical treatments, and so that was very much on my mind and
*  Pharma companies are huge like it's a huge business and it's poorly understood and the way that they make money
*  overlaps a lot with the patent system, which is also poorly understood and so
*  You know, it's a great way to just rip people off and and you always have a captive audience
*  Nobody's gonna say no to a drug that's going to cure them or it prolong their life
*  so
*  You know, it's it's easy in some ways. It's an easy target for a big bad
*  but it's also a
*  You know, it's it's a source of great anxiety and pain for lots of people
*  so it's you know, it seemed like an obvious place to
*  To poke and who doesn't want a pharmaceutical pirate like that's the well, I was gonna say
*  Protagonist is a biochemical pharmaceutical pirate. So that's pretty good
*  Yeah, I think and it's funny because after the novel came out
*  A few people have come out identifying as pharmaceutical pirates. Um, and so I was excited about that. I was like, yes
*  steal from the rich give to the poor
*  Um, that's that's my my hope is that it is closer to robin hood than real piracy, right? I mean it's your
*  Real pirates are yes in it for themselves
*  It's at jack's character is very much like in the robin hood tradition. It was
*  Explicitly thinking about robin hood who is like one of my very favorite mythical characters ever so
*  And so why don't you just give us a teaser for the next one? Are you are you I should say are you mostly?
*  A fiction writer now you're still writing non-fiction also. I am trying to be bi
*  Which is hard. Nobody really acknowledges these
*  by
*  Bitexual people like me, but I am working on two books right now
*  One of which is non-fiction, which is about ancient abandoned cities focusing on four cities specifically and looking at
*  Why people abandoned them even though they were kind of cities that were at the heart of their civilizations?
*  And sort of using that to think about the modern world and what we're going to do with our megacities
*  And i'm also working on a novel
*  Which is about time traveling geologists
*  So it's great to be working on something about ancient history while i'm also writing about time travel because whenever I feel the need like
*  Desperately as i'm writing about archaeology like I wish I could just go back and find out what really happened
*  I'm like I will go over to my novel where all they have to do is like
*  Get a grant to use the time machine in order to go back and find out what happened
*  um, so
*  So it's it's been a really fun
*  Past year, although very stressful and because i'm trying to write a lot of stuff
*  But uh, but the novel should be out
*  Uh next fall and um, the non-fiction book will probably be out
*  in 2020
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a kind of a theme here
*  I don't want to sort of force a theme where it's not there but you've written about
*  How we're going to survive an apocalypse. Well, sorry, what was the title of that book again scatter adapt and remember?
*  Right how we will survive a mass extinction
*  Yes, and it depends on the mass extinction, right and
*  Very much so there's a lot of instructions in the book
*  Yeah, and now you have the book on ancient cities where they I mean was it mostly I don't spoiler alert
*  I suppose but is it mostly that they chose to leave them or were they forced to leave them for some reason or another?
*  It's always a combination
*  um in
*  You know these were cities that were abandoned which means that people, you know left them they weren't
*  Forced out by uh invading forces in any of the cases i'm looking at
*  In one case like with pompey. I mean the city was buried in ash
*  But other cities that were buried in ash at that same time were dug out
*  And like naples which was uh, you know affected as well
*  but pompey was not and
*  So i'm looking at
*  What are the precipitating factors that turn a huge city like say ancor which had a million people?
*  About a thousand years ago, which made it the biggest city on earth at that time
*  How did that go from the biggest city on earth and then within like 400 years to just a few monks living in?
*  You know kind of ruined remains
*  um
*  Can we blame neuroses for this?
*  Uh, you know, I mean there's the neuroses that you you know, once you get a bunch of humans together in a city
*  um, you know the neuroses become things like historical trauma and you know, also like
*  Infrastructure upkeep like that turns out to be a big issue
*  um politics are a huge part of what um causes a city to fail but
*  Politics alone won't do it. It's really um got to be combined with some kind of environmental problem
*  Whether the problem is actually climate change or you know, mismanaging the water supply or whatever. So
*  Uh, so I don't know if that's a neurosis or just but it is certainly a recurring human problem
*  So yeah, we see it over and over again. Um
*  So scatter adapt and remember that was the title. That's the title of my first book
*  Um, and the non-fiction book i'm working on now about abandoned cities is just called four lost cities
*  But I like scatter adapt and remember is kind of the theme right running through the fiction as well as the non-fiction
*  There's you know human beings trying to adapt to challenging circumstances and choosing different modes of doing that
*  That's very true. I mean for me, uh in all of my work, um, I have a strong
*  Wish to urge people to survive and try to survive in a way that helps lots of other people survive with them
*  I mean I was joking earlier about the whole goal with my fiction is just to tell people not to kill each other
*  Not killing don't kill that's number one
*  um, and I mean that's part of
*  You know, that's a joke but also that is part of what i'm trying to do and my non-fiction is kind of show people ways
*  that humans have survived and
*  how even when
*  Um horrible circumstances, you know kick them out of a really awesome city
*  They still manage to survive their culture lives on humans live on um, and we create, you know new social structures that are hopefully
*  A little bit less inclined to encourage people to kill each other
*  Um, you know, that's the goal just like less and less pressure to kill
*  More and more pressure to um, you know take care of everyone. Um, so
*  So yeah survival and survival in style. I would say and survival in style is good
*  I I did notice in one interview someone wanted to paint autonomous as a dystopian novel
*  But you said it's just a topia. It's either a dystopia nor a utopia. That's the usual in between somewhere
*  Yeah, just just how things are now, I mean sometimes things are a little worse sometimes they're a little better for certain groups of people
*  Um, but yeah, I mean I definitely autonomous. There's a lot of things that happen
*  That are yeah, they're positive. Um, you know, there's great medicine available if you can afford it
*  Um, so you just need a pirate to help make that, you know a better system
*  um, and and certainly um
*  In in the time travel novel i'm working on now. There's like there's some bad stuff, but there's some good stuff
*  It's all balanced out. Well you can write a novel where everyone's happy and just sitting around saying how happy there are but maybe the
*  Descriptions of less than perfect situations can help nudge us here in the real world toward making things a little bit better
*  I think that's true
*  and I I don't think we're ever going to reach a point as a civilization or a species where we're happy all the time like even if
*  we
*  um, you know have an awesome genie coefficient and we don't have like an extreme division between rich and poor and we don't have
*  Like massive social injustice we're still gonna argue, you know, we're still gonna have jealousy
*  We're still gonna be sad when someone dies or someone leaves us, you know, there's always gonna be drama and sadness
*  it's just that hopefully we can keep it on a kind of you know, uh, keep it on the
*  Keep it limited
*  Back to my point about not killing
*  Let's just have interpersonal drama and not have
*  Wars
*  I think that's a perfect note to end on annalee newitz. Thanks so much for being on the podcast. Yeah. Thank you for having me
*  You
