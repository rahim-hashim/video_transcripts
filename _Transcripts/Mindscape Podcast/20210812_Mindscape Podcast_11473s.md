Welcome to the August 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | August 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [August 12, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A0nSbVR2kI)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast, the August 2021 Ask Me Anything episode. I'm your
*  host, Sean Carroll. You know how this works probably by now. It's an Ask Me Anything, so people
*  write questions and I do my best to answer them. The people who get to ask the questions are
*  Patreon supporters, so if you want to be part of the Question Asking Brigade, just join up at
*  patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll. Not that expensive and you get not only the right to
*  ask questions every month for the AMAs, but also you get ad-free versions of the podcast and a
*  feeling of well-being for supporting something good and being a member of a community. Now,
*  as we've said before, the number of questions has grown fairly large, so we cannot answer all of
*  them, but I go through and I try to figure out which ones I have interesting things to say about.
*  Again, if you don't get your question answered, not necessarily because your question wasn't
*  good, it just didn't vibe or resonate with what I had to say in this particular day.
*  I hope everyone's doing well. We're in the middle of the summer post-2020, so the first summer that
*  should be post-pandemic, but we're not post-pandemic because many people have not gotten vaccinated yet
*  and therefore we're still in the middle of a pandemic. I hope that it doesn't get worse,
*  but as long as we haven't vaccinated the whole world, there's still plenty of opportunities for
*  the virus to mutate. We already have the Delta variant and other things, and rather than just
*  getting rid of this virus, we're sort of letting it flit from person to person because we don't want
*  to, as a society, take the necessary steps to fix it. This makes me very sad, but nevertheless,
*  several months ago I decided I was just going to be optimistic about this and therefore I made
*  travel plans. Tomorrow, as I record this AMA episode, will be the first time I go to the
*  airport to step on an airplane in roughly a year and a half. We'll see how that goes. I'm going
*  to Santa Fe to go to the Santa Fe Institute where I am now officially a fractal faculty member. That's
*  the big news of this month in my life. Some of you know that I am an external professor,
*  had been an external professor at Santa Fe. Actually, some of you might not even know the
*  Santa Fe Institute is. It's a research institute in Santa Fe dedicated to the study of complex
*  systems, which is an area I'm very much getting into these days. Most of the people who are
*  involved with Santa Fe in some way or another actually don't live and work there. They live
*  and work somewhere else, but they visit there regularly. There's a category called external
*  professors where in return for being able to say, I am affiliated with the Santa Fe Institute,
*  you promise to do something for them, like help them choose postdocs or organize a conference or
*  spend some time there or whatever it is. I've been there for a couple of years. I didn't get
*  really to take advantage of it because we've had a pandemic for the last year and a half.
*  But now this upgrade to fractal faculty means that it's just more of an obligation. I will go
*  several weeks a year, at least six weeks every year, spend time in Santa Fe and really take
*  part in what goes on there. I'm going into details here because someone asked a question.
*  I didn't include it in the AMA, but here's the answer. What does it mean to be an external
*  professor at the Santa Fe Institute? It just means you do research that is involved with Santa Fe.
*  You spend time there. You talk to people. I've already been on many Zoom meetings,
*  et cetera, with people at Santa Fe, even though I haven't been physically there.
*  I'm very proud to be one of the first two fractal faculty members in existence. The other one is
*  Melanie Mitchell, former Mindscape podcast guest and expert in artificial intelligence
*  and computing more generally. She was, remember, Douglas Hofstadter's graduate student back in the
*  day. Melanie and I are the first two fractal faculty and it'll be fun. It's one of those
*  places, SFI, where every time I go, I am just energized with all the ideas that are bouncing
*  around because some people are thinking about physics and thermodynamics. Other people are
*  thinking about economics. Other people are thinking about linguistics or the origin of life.
*  It's just a kid in a candy store feeling for myself. That'll be for two weeks. I'm going to
*  go to Santa Fe and then I'm going to come back to LA for two weeks. Then I'm spending the fall on
*  sabbatical at Harvard as a visitor in the Harvard philosophy department. I'm sure I'm going to also
*  talk to some physicists while I'm there. I have many friends in the physics department and
*  astronomy department at Harvard. I was a grad student there, but I want to really start thinking
*  more deeply about questions of emergence and causation and the nature of the laws of physics,
*  humanism and things like that. I thought that that would be a wonderful place to do that. Of course,
*  not only is Harvard a very good place, but it's near other good places. I can talk to a whole
*  bunch of people. They have an official visitors program and I applied and I was invited to go
*  do that. That's where I'll be for September, October, November. That's also another travel
*  thing. I hope it goes well. If I end up sitting in an apartment in Boston and just zooming with
*  people at Harvard, that won't be fun. Please get vaccinated. Please get yourself some immunity,
*  much, much greater immunity to the effects of this terrible disease so that we can get over
*  the pandemic and return to normal life. With that, let's go.
*  Arthur C. Quark, probably not their real name, says, in the big picture, you describe the
*  fine tuning argument like this. In Bayesian language, the likelihood of life appearing in
*  the universe might be larger under theism than under naturalism. Then we can therefore conclude
*  that our very existence is strong evidence in favor of theism. In addition to everything you
*  mentioned to decrement its credibility, the argument itself feels wrong. If I mad lib the
*  argument, I can prove that I'm psychic or that bear taxes makes bears go away. Is the argument
*  itself a logical fallacy? In Bayesian language, the likelihood of me winning the lottery might
*  be large under I'm psychic and small under I'm not psychic. We can therefore conclude that my
*  winning the lottery is strong evidence in favor of me being psychic. The answer to this is you're
*  not quite being a very good Bayesian yet, Arthur. Sorry about that. This is how Bayesians reason.
*  For one thing, don't use the word prove. You said I can prove I'm psychic. No, you can't prove you're
*  psychic, but you can gather evidence that you're psychic and you can gather evidence against that
*  you're psychic and you count it all up. The point of me making this argument was that it was not to
*  show that the fine tuning argument works because I don't think it does work. It's to show that if
*  that's all you knew about the universe was that life existed, then you could count that as evidence
*  for the existence of God because there is a likelihood function. I don't think that
*  it's unreasonable to think that the likelihood of life under theism is larger than the likelihood
*  of life under naturalism. I think that's completely reasonable. You just have to take the argument
*  seriously. You have to take Bayesian analysis seriously. For one thing, there's a prior, of
*  course. If your prior is very small for one possibility or the other, that will swamp any
*  one piece of evidence that you have. But more importantly, there's other evidence out there,
*  and that's what really matters. A good Bayesian will admit that there are certain facts about the
*  world that favor even the wrong hypotheses. If you think about all the hypotheses you can make
*  about the world and then focus in on the subset where some people actually believe these hypotheses,
*  it's overwhelmingly likely that there are certain aspects of the world that are better explained
*  by these wrong hypotheses than by the right ones, a priori, right? Because otherwise no one would
*  believe the wrong hypotheses. But to be a good Bayesian, you have to take all of the evidence
*  into account. This is the mistake that is made by people who put forward the fine-tuning argument
*  in my mind, is that they focus in on one fact, that there's life in the universe. They say
*  the likelihood of life under theism is greater than likelihood of life under atheism. And my
*  point is, if you want to play that game, which is a perfectly legitimate game to play, you have to
*  look at other aspects of the universe and say, are those other aspects of the universe more likely
*  under theism or atheism? And the reason why they don't want to do that is that over and over again,
*  the aspects that we observe about the universe are way more likely under naturalism than under
*  atheism, than under theism. So when you say the likelihood of me winning lottery might be large
*  under I'm psychic and small under I'm not psychic, we can therefore conclude that my winning lottery
*  is strong evidence in favor of me being psychic. Yes, it is pretty strong evidence in favor of you
*  being psychic. Now, there might be plenty of other evidence that you are not psychic, but think of
*  it this way. What if you just thought of what the right lottery number was going to be and played it
*  and won five times in a row? You might say, well, hey, that is pretty good evidence that I'm
*  psychic. If I can consistently win a billion to one odds lottery, maybe there is something going
*  on there, right? But if you can, if that's true, when you do it five times in a row or 10 times in
*  a row, then there's some evidence in that favor, even if you only do it once, that evidence need
*  not be so good that you believe the hypothesis, a good Bayesian never puts their credence to zero or
*  one for any reasonable hypothesis. So it moves your credence, whatever amount, but that doesn't
*  mean that you're done. That doesn't mean that you can stop thinking. I think it's very, very important
*  to really take seriously the fact that you can't play the Bayesian game only on the evidence you
*  like. You have to play on all of the evidence. That is the point of that argument I was making
*  in the big picture. Brendan Hall says, does general relativity become greatly different when
*  one analyzes say four spatial dimensions to make five D space time as opposed to three?
*  So the short answer is no, it's not really all that different general relativity in higher numbers
*  of dimensions. But the reason why it's an interesting question is because interestingly,
*  general relativity is very different in two spatial dimensions. So if you have three dimensional
*  space time, there is kind of a phase transition. One dimensional general relativity or two
*  dimensional general relativity are very different than general relativity in four or five, six,
*  etc. Dimensions. Is this some kind of anthropic argument that we need at least three spatial
*  dimensions to make the world interesting? Probably not, but I'm just throwing it out there for you.
*  And actually, let me just take advantage of this opportunity to go into a little bit more
*  technical detail than I would usually go into here because it is a very interesting subject.
*  What is the way in which, in what sense, is general relativity different in two dimensional space? So
*  three dimensional space time rather than the real world? Well, I can't help but introduce the jargon
*  here. Sorry about that. We often say that general relativity says that matter and energy in the
*  universe drive the curvature of space time. That's probably what you've heard. You've heard me say it,
*  if no one else. But there's, it turns out there are different types of curvature in space time.
*  And this is just a mathematical fact, and I'm not really going to explain the different types,
*  but there are two different types. And one is called the Ricci curvature, named after Professor
*  Ricci, who was an Italian geometer. And the other is called the Weyl curvature, named after Hermann
*  Weyl, who was a German mathematician. Weyl, W-E-Y-L. Okay. So these, there are these two different
*  types of curvature, and they're both bundled up into the Riemann curvature. The Riemann tensor
*  is the geometric object in general relativity that tells you all the curvature, and different
*  pieces of the Riemann tensor correspond to the Weyl curvature or the Ricci curvature. And the point
*  is that Einstein's equation, which relates the curvature of space time to matter and energy,
*  says two things. It says that the Ricci curvature of space time, that part of the curvature,
*  is exactly determined by the distribution of energy and momentum. Okay. So if you tell me what the
*  energy is, I instantly know what the Ricci curvature is. That's a geometric, and so I should
*  say an algebraic relation that is given to us by Einstein's equation of general relativity. Tell me
*  the energy, I'll tell you the Ricci curvature. Whereas the Weyl curvature is not completely fixed
*  by the amount of energy and momentum. In fact, what Einstein's equations tell you is that there
*  is an equation that relates the evolution of the Weyl curvature, but it doesn't tell you what the
*  initial conditions are. So that's crucially important for general relativity because the
*  Weyl curvature characterizes things like gravitational waves. When you have a gravitational wave
*  propagating an empty space, if I just tell you, well, space is empty, there's no energy and
*  momentum there. That doesn't tell you whether there's a gravitational wave there or not, right?
*  Telling you what the energy momentum is in some part of the universe has nothing to do with whether
*  or not there's a gravitational wave. If it did, then there couldn't be any gravitational waves,
*  right? Because in empty space, there wouldn't be anything to source them. But the gravitational
*  waves are Weyl curvature, which are not fixed. Their evolution is governed, but the initial
*  conditions are not fixed by Einstein's equation. So why am I telling you all this? Well, because
*  the way the math works out, there is no such thing as Weyl curvature in three-dimensional
*  spacetime. It just goes away. It's just zero. Identically, there is only Ricci curvature.
*  So in three-dimensional spacetime, there are no gravitational waves. There is no curvature of space
*  outside matter, right? So it becomes a little bit more interesting to think about how gravity would
*  work in three-dimensional spacetime. And in fact, I've written papers about it. If you have a cosmic
*  string, which is infinitely long and perfectly straight, then along the direction in which the
*  cosmic string is pointing, you can just ignore everything that happens. There's a symmetry with
*  respect to boosts and translations in that direction. So a set of cosmic strings that are infinitely
*  long, perfectly straight and parallel to each other are equivalent to point particles in one lower
*  dimensional spacetime. You just ignore the dimension along the strings pointing. So you can
*  actually analyze questions of cosmic strings in a two plus one dimensional, three-dimensional,
*  that is, spacetime context. And that makes things easier. And the reason why that's interesting is
*  because Richard Gott of Princeton pointed out that you can build closed timelike curves using
*  infinitely long straight cosmic strings. So Alan Guth and Eddie Fahry and Ken Olamani analyzed that
*  question using this two plus one dimensional point particle version of the problem, the spherical
*  cow version of the problem. And we showed that if you had a time machine built into the universe,
*  it would stay there, but you can't build it if it's not there to start. Gerard de Tuft also wrote
*  some things along those lines. So anyway, all of which is to say, gravity is different in two or
*  three-dimensional spacetime. Four or more is more or less the same, up to some details.
*  Dave Williams says, priority question. I recently, oh, remember, that's right. So priority questions
*  are, I said that everyone gets one priority question in their lifetime. And it's the honor
*  system here. I'm not keeping track of who asks these questions, but you get to ask one priority
*  question as a Patreon supporter that I promise I will answer. I don't promise that we'll give you
*  an answer that you will like or will satisfy you, but I'll promise I will answer here in the AMA.
*  So Dave Williams says, I recently posed myself a question. Suppose I journeyed a thousand kilometers
*  in 10 hours, but on arrival, I was only doing 40 kilometers an hour. Those that greeted me only
*  knew I had traveled a thousand kilometers and I arrived 40 kilometers an hour. Hence, they thought
*  I took 25 hours when actually I took 10. Such a trip mimics our observations of the universe.
*  I easily saw the dilemma of conflicting journey times by assuming that the product of the distance
*  and the time was a constant. Translating this idea to the universe and interpreting our
*  observations in this matter solves all the problems, inflation, dark matter, etc.
*  Has anyone ever thought of this is roughly the question. So the short strategy, the simple
*  strategy you should use in these situations is to think to yourself, are decades of very smart
*  professional scientists complete dummies or not? And the answer is no, they are not complete dummies.
*  So this assumption that the expansion of the universe is just constant, or you can just
*  extrapolate what you see in your local neighborhood, no one ever made that assumption. That would be a
*  dopey assumption to make. What we do is two things. Number one, we predict the evolution of the
*  expansion rate of the universe using Einstein's equation of general relativity. And then we test
*  those predictions. So we test those predictions with the microwave background, with redshifts,
*  the nucleosynthesis in the very early universe. And there's a relationship between the density
*  of the universe and its expansion rate that is predicted by Einstein. And so far, that relationship
*  fits all of the experimental data, it passes all the tests. And the other thing from a model
*  independent theory, independent point of view is we just measure it. So that's how the acceleration
*  of the universe was measured. It was not by looking at the measure, the expansion rate of the universe
*  here in our local region and is extrapolating it, you measure the expansion rate of the universe at
*  different eras. You can do that using the relationship between distance and velocity.
*  So that's where all the problems come from. So all these problems, dark matter, dark energy, etc,
*  are because we don't make that assumption. They're not solved by unmaking that assumption.
*  Justin Bailey says, is there a minimum speed of light at which the universe is still interesting,
*  i.e. has beings like us? What would that universe be like? I'm going to unask this question a little
*  bit, because there's a different lesson to be learned here. Well, when you say minimum speed
*  of light, in what units do you mean? Like meters per second? If the speed of light were different,
*  everything else would be different also. It's essentially meaningless to say if the speed of
*  light were different. The speed of light is always one light year per year. That's the only
*  natural units you can measure it in. Anything else is just invented by human beings. Because if the
*  speed of light were different, the size of the hydrogen atom would be different, right? All the
*  rulers you use to measure things would be different. So I can always, literally always, choose units
*  in which the speed of light is one. And then, so what you're really asking is, if I choose units
*  where the speed of light is one, there's no such thing as the speed of light being big or small,
*  right? It's the fact that there is a speed limit that matters. We can always choose units where
*  that speed limit is one. And then you can ask about changing other dimensionless, unitless
*  constants of nature. The fine structure constant, the ratio of the mass of the proton to the mass
*  of the electron, and things like that, okay? So the right question to ask when you're asking
*  questions about other ways the universe could have been is to change dimensionless quantities,
*  quantities that do not have a unit attached to them, like meters or kilograms or meters per second.
*  Any one of those depends on the units. A ratio, like I said, of the mass of the proton to the
*  mass of the electron, that's the same no matter what units you use. So that could change. The
*  speed of light is a speed, a velocity, right, meters per second, and there are no other speeds
*  in the fundamental laws of physics. So there's no ratio you can take to get a dimensionless number.
*  So you just can't imagine a universe, literally, where the speed of light was anything else other
*  than infinity. Infinity is sort of a, you know, a limiting case there, right? So the right question
*  to ask is, how can you change other quantities of nature and still have beings like us? And that's
*  a hard question. That's one I don't know the answer to. People have thought about it, but,
*  you know, it depends a lot on your assumptions and our calculation abilities, which are not very good.
*  Boglarka K says, is dark matter discussed or framed as a limit to our knowledge in physics?
*  You know, in some simple way it is, because we don't know what it is. We know that there is
*  dark matter. We know where it is to some rough approximation. We know how much of it there is.
*  We know how it behaves. We don't know what actually is making up the dark matter. So yeah,
*  that's a limit to our knowledge in physics. It's not framed as a limit that is in principle there.
*  We could easily discover what the dark matter is. What if it's a particle or something else,
*  you know, that's something we're trying to do very, very hard. So it's definitely not a limit
*  in principle. It's just a question we haven't answered yet, which science is full of those.
*  John E says, at a base level, are photons much different than any other matter particle? Apologies
*  for the basic question here. It depends on what you mean. There are certain ways in which photons
*  are different than other kinds of particles and certain ways in which they're the same.
*  For any way that they're different, there's probably other particles that are the same as
*  them, right? So the most obvious difference between particles, the photons and electrons,
*  let's say, is that photons are massless and they move at the speed of light. But gravitons are also
*  massless. They move at the speed of light. Gluons are massless. They would move at the speed of
*  light if they could escape by themselves and just travel through space, but they can't because
*  they're confined in strongly interacting particles. So that's a basic difference. But it's, you know,
*  again, gravitons are the same way. So it's not a unique difference. Photons have zero electric
*  charge, but then again, so do neutrinos, so do gravitons also. Photons have spin one, but then
*  again, so do W bosons and Z bosons and gluons, right? So you get the point. Photons are different
*  than any other specific kind of particle, but they're not different than all the other particles
*  combined in the sense that everything that is different about between a photon and one other
*  kind of particle will be a similarity between a photon and some other particle. Carlos Nunez says,
*  Who's your favorite superhero and why? You know, I'm pretty agnostic about the superheroes these
*  days, although I'm a fan of the movies. I like the movies, but I'm not a huge comic book fan.
*  I was never actually probably a huge comic book fan. I was a medium sized comic book fan when I
*  was a kid, right? And back then, my favorite heroes probably still today are the sort of most
*  magical ones. So I liked Dr. Strange, right? Dr. Strange, by the way, and for recent Mindscape
*  listeners, one of our early interviews was with Scott Derrickson, who was the director and co-writer
*  of Dr. Strange, the movie. So we got some insight there into the movie. Thor is another one as an
*  Asgardian god on the DC side, Green Lantern, who could do all these crazy things. And was a member
*  of the Green Lantern Corps and the Guardians of the Galaxy.
*  Not the Guardians of the Galaxy, right? The Guardians of Oa. See, I'm forgetting my
*  youthful knowledge here. But anyway, yeah, I like those sort of way out superheroes more than the
*  down to earth ones like Batman or Iron Man or Captain America or something like that. Why? Yeah,
*  I don't know. I don't know why. I figure if you're going to be a superhero, let's do it all the way.
*  Superman is obviously very, very powerful, but the powers are kind of boring, right? I mean,
*  invulnerability, you can fly. Okay, good. But I want interesting powers. I want magical powers,
*  basically. That's what I want. I think that's what my psychoanalysis here is teaching me. What I
*  really want out of life is magical powers. And I'm sad that the world doesn't work that way.
*  Sam Buck says, careful viewers of the Veritasium YouTube channel may have noticed a cameo from you
*  in a recent video featuring a bet between Derek Mueller and Professor Alex Kosenko, although sadly
*  we never saw or heard much from you during the event. Can you talk a bit about what your
*  experience being a witness to the contest? Were you like Bill Nye persuaded by Professor Kosenko's
*  presentation or surprised by the outcome of the bet? So some of you might not know this at all,
*  but it's kind of a fun story. So Veritasium is a very good YouTube channel run by Derek Mueller
*  and who I've appeared on some of the little videos that you can look them up. Maybe not the
*  best or most interesting ones, but there I am. And Alex Kosenko is a professor of physics at UCLA
*  and another friend of mine. And Derek did a video where he traveled in a, you know, what looks like
*  a pretty straightforward sail plane. I shouldn't say plane. What should I call it? Like sail car,
*  right? Like it's on salt flats and it's a thing that people built and has little wheels and a
*  giant sail and a fan. And actually doesn't even have a sail. Maybe not just a fan. The fan is
*  sort of acting like the sail. But the point is that the fan is hooked up to the wheels in such a way
*  that what is interesting is that the sail car, I'm going to call it that, it travels toward the wind
*  and it can travel so fast. The claim is that it's actually going faster than the wind is.
*  Okay. So if you might know, if you know sailing at all, sailing on the ocean, you can go at an
*  angle to an oncoming wind and you can actually tack overall toward the wind. But the point,
*  the claim here was that this particular sail car, plane car, propeller car, I should call it,
*  was moving exactly toward the wind and was going faster than the wind was pushing it in the other
*  direction. So Alex said, nope, that's not possible. It violates the laws of physics. So they made a
*  bet, the two of them, a $10,000 bet. I hope I'm describing it correctly because honestly, I didn't
*  follow it too closely. So the reason why I didn't follow it too closely was Derek asked me if I
*  would be a witness to the contest. So what that means is they made a bet. And the thing is you
*  have to trust both of them because there wasn't any outside panel of jury or jury that would
*  actually judge who won the bet. You were trusting that through the force of reason and through
*  talking about it back and forth, one of them would convince the other one that they were right, that
*  this violated the laws of physics or it didn't. Now you might say if they did the experiment,
*  it couldn't have violated the laws of physics, but you know, experiments are tricky, right? You
*  can always cheat a little bit. And so Alex in particular thought that what happened was the
*  plane, the sail car, propeller car, prop car had been accelerated, but then the velocity of the wind
*  temporarily dipped down so that it seemed like the car was going faster than the wind. Anyway,
*  so the point being that they bet each other $10,000 and they said, well, we need witnesses to
*  the bet. So Bill Nye, Neil deGrasse Tyson and I served as witnesses to the bet. So they did a
*  little YouTube video where Alex and Derek pitched their cases to the witnesses, but sadly just
*  because of scheduling conflicts, I couldn't make it. So that's why there's a little cameo there
*  from me. But Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson were there on the video. But the point is that our job
*  was not to judge who's right or wrong. It was literally just to witness the bet. In fact,
*  I told Derek, I said, if you want me to judge who's right and who's wrong, then I'm not going to do it
*  because I know perfectly well this is exactly the kind of physics I'm terrible at. Real world stuff
*  like moving cars and wind and friction and air resistance and all this stuff. I have enormous
*  respect for the people who do that kind of thing professionally. And it's not what I do. I try to
*  figure out the ultimate laws of physics. If they were making a bit about quantum mechanics, I'd be
*  all over that. But Derek assured me that all I had to do was literally witness to keep them honest
*  that they were doing it. And to be honest, since I saw the video, the original video that Alex
*  subjected to, I thought probably it was fine. I'm very willing to believe that in complicated
*  real world situations, the intuition of a physicist can go sadly wrong. And eventually, as many of
*  you know, Alex conceded the bet and paid $10,000 to a charity of Derek's choice. So that's a lot
*  of money. I wouldn't bet that much money. But I honestly didn't even follow in detail the arguments
*  back and forth. Like I said, that's not what I do. It's not what I'm good at. I'm not especially
*  interested in following that. I'm happy that both of the participants in the bet stuck to the high
*  ground and used the force of reason to figure out what was going on rather than just being
*  stubbornly sticking to their incorrect position. Linio Miziara says, in your lectures about the
*  Higgs boson in the great courses, you said that because the W and Z particles are originally
*  massless, these particles have to always be moving. And that is how nature knows they are
*  left handed. However, isn't movement relative? What about those particles relative to which the
*  Z and W are stationary? So to go back to what we just said about photons a little bit before,
*  when the Z and W were massless, they were moving at the speed of light. And that fact is not
*  relative. I mean, that's the whole point of special relativity, is that the to say that something is
*  moving at the speed of light is a non-relative statement. It's an absolutely universal statement.
*  If something moving the speed of light, it's just moving at the speed of light.
*  Literally, you have to be on top of it at the same place to say, oh, I don't see it moving at all.
*  But then time doesn't pass for you. So you don't say anything at all. Okay. So to any other thing
*  in the universe, you're moving at the speed of light. And that's why you can point out the
*  direction in which it's moving. It is always moving along some direction. And then in that
*  direction, it's either spinning left-handed or right-handed. Michelard Zabo says, is it true
*  that current quantum computers are not the ENIACs or EDVACs of quantum computation, but more like
*  Babbage's analytical engine? Whereas even this is stretch. What are the chances that quantum
*  computing won't work in the end as Wolfram predicted in your interview with him? I don't
*  know if the analogies are just very good in this case. It's not that it is ENIAC or Babbage's
*  analytical engine. It's just a different thing because back in those days, you know, number one,
*  we didn't really have a theory of computation that was very good. And number two, we didn't have other
*  computers that worked. They were trying to build the first computers. Building the first quantum
*  computers is putting together two great tastes that taste great together, but are individually
*  perfectly good. Quantum mechanics and computers. Okay. Computers work. Quantum mechanics works.
*  I think that there's essentially zero chance that quantum computing won't work in some
*  deep principled physics reason. I think it's perfectly possible that quantum computing will
*  be not as exciting as we hoped because of some practical technological reason, right? If it just
*  becomes too difficult to connect enough qubits with a short enough interaction time between them
*  and enough reliability, et cetera, then it will be possible to build a quantum computer, but so
*  prohibitively expensive that no one will do it. I don't think that's likely, but I think it's
*  conceivable. I don't think, I don't remember exactly what Stephen Wolfram was saying, but
*  I don't think there's anything lurking in the fundamental laws of physics that prevents quantum
*  computers in principle. Robin van Dyck says, my question is about how you come up with ideas for
*  writing a paper. Is it just by talking with other physicists about your work or are there other
*  things that influence what you write papers about? Yeah, there's lots of things. You know, there's no,
*  it's exactly like asking a novelist where they come up with ideas, right? There's no algorithm.
*  There's no recipe. You don't just plug in and say, well, I would like an idea now. Of course,
*  you talk to other physicists. You read other people's papers. You look and go to their talks.
*  You go to conferences. You talk to your students and your colleagues and your postdocs. You read
*  books. You read things elsewhere and you just think, right? You just sometimes you just sit and think
*  about the puzzles that you have been bothered by for a long time. And, you know, the problem
*  is never coming across a puzzle. The problem is coming up with an idea that is sufficiently
*  promising to answer a puzzle or to address a question that you can push it forward in
*  some practical way, right? I mean, it's easy to come up with questions. It's easy to propose
*  answers. It's hard to come up with answers that are, you know, we don't know enough about it that
*  it's worth doing work on, but nevertheless, we can imagine making progress on it, right? That's
*  the crucial sweet spot in there. You want a problem that is not necessarily solvable,
*  but at least progress can be made in some sense. Okay, the next two questions I'm going to group
*  together. They're about gravitons. Stu Haines says, I believe you've said that we can be a bit loose
*  and describe gravity as a force, even though it is really the curvature of space time. If so,
*  why do we speak of gravitons as a particle mediating the force of gravity? Peter Solfest says,
*  are gravitons merely the particle duality of gravitational waves? If not, why is there so
*  much confidence that they exist? Actually, I'm going to stick another one more question in here
*  in this grouping. Andrew Jewell says, there are four forces with gravity and electromagnetism.
*  There's a simple formula to calculate the force and plug into F equals ma. But with the weak and
*  strong forces, there are simply strange phrases such as is involved in radioactive decay and never
*  an equation. So what does force mean with the strong and weak forces? Is there a way to calculate
*  an F which can equal ma? Okay, so all very good questions in the sense that I had answers to them.
*  That's always a favorite situation to be in. So why do we speak of gravitons as a particle mediating
*  the force of gravity? Well, you can speak about the same thing in two different languages, right?
*  So that was for Stu's question. For Peter's question, are gravitons merely the particle
*  duality of gravitational waves? Yes, that's what they are. So there is the limit, if you like,
*  of physical reality where waves in either gravity or electromagnetism are big classical things.
*  And in that limit, it is perfectly sensible to treat these things as classical fields,
*  the gravitational field, the electric field, the magnetic field, ripples in these different
*  fields are what we're talking about. And you're in the macroscopic world, and you can use F equals ma,
*  and you can have an equation and figure out the force moving around a particle.
*  The particle like nature of these forces comes about when you get down to the quantum mechanical
*  level. So when you're just talking about a little tiny bit of the force, right, when you're
*  measuring just one little packet of energy for photons, that's easy to do, we can see spots on
*  a CRT screen or something like that. For gravitons, the force is too weak. So technologically, we can't
*  do that. But the point is, there is a regime in which it's perfectly sensible to think of
*  these guys as particles is another regime in which it's perfectly sensible to think of them
*  as big classical fields giving rise to big classical forces. At least that's the case
*  for both gravity and electromagnetism because these are long range forces. For the strong and
*  weak forces to Andrew's question, there is no long range limit. Okay, they can't pile up because
*  they're short range forces, they just don't stretch over that large of a distance. So you never reach
*  this limit where you have a big macroscopic strong nuclear force field or weak nuclear force
*  field, this just never happens in the physical world. But at that quantum level, there's a huge
*  amount of similarity between the strong force, the weak force, the electromagnetic force, the
*  gravitational force, there are equations, and the equations are very, very much alike for all those
*  four different possibilities. But it's just that the big classical limit doesn't exist because the
*  forces are so short range, is what I'm trying to say. So should you call them forces then,
*  the strong and weak forces? I don't care. I honestly just don't care. But they're very
*  analogous to electromagnetism and gravity. So in that sense, I see why someone would call them
*  forces. But you're right, we don't actually just take a particle and plug it into an equation and
*  say here is the force. But you could for either the strong force or the weak force. The problem
*  is that equation would just never apply to any big macroscopic thing. That's why you don't actually
*  see it in everyday life. Felix Roswald says, is there a one to one ratio of electrons to protons
*  in the universe? Or in other words, is there a net charge to the universe? So I'm going to undo the
*  second half of your question a little bit, because well, I'm going to separate these questions. It's
*  not in other words, because of course, there are other particles that have electric charge,
*  right? Muons have electric charge. So you know, muons can decay into electrons, neutrinos and
*  anti neutrinos, or vice versa, I can smash an electron and a positron together and get a muon
*  and anti muon. So I can change the number of electrons without changing the number of protons.
*  So there's not exactly a one to one ratio of electrons to protons. But if what you're really
*  asking is, is there a net charge to the universe? Well, we don't know is the short answer. There's
*  very few questions about the universe as a whole to which we know definitive answers. But most of
*  us think there is no net charge to the universe. There's a theorem that says that if space is
*  closed, so if the spatial slices of the universe are spheres or a torus or something like that,
*  then there can't be a net charge, then there has to be zero net charge. That's a consequence of
*  Gauss's law or something like that. So but if the universe is open, then you could imagine a universe
*  with a net charge there becomes trickier and we just don't know. Anonymous says I really enjoyed
*  your discussion the last AMA about the difference between being a public intellectual and being an
*  activist. I thought about it some more and I realized that the two roles aren't completely
*  disconnected. An intellectual whose conclusions aren't just just aren't palatable to the average
*  person's sense of decency won't be seen as very credible. An activist whose conclusions just aren't
*  realistic won't be seen as credible either. Suppose that an intellectual needs to think like an activist
*  sometimes. Where would you set the boundary between staying in touch with the society we live in on
*  a basic level and letting personal feelings and wishes get in the way of objectivity? So this is
*  a very good point and I think that I was probably sloppy when I was giving the discussion. Even
*  though I, you know, for purposes of explanation, distinguished between a kind of person called an
*  intellectual and a kind of person called an activist, it's much more accurate as you're
*  getting at to say that there are roles in which any one person sometimes plays the role of an
*  intellectual trying to figure out the truth and sometimes plays the role of an activist. And
*  there's probably zero people who are 100% one or the other, right? There's always a little bit of
*  both. So how do you balance that is basically what you're saying. You know, where would you set the
*  boundary in between living? You know, different people are going to do it differently. I think
*  that, you know, I'm personally most comfortable being much more intellectual than an activist,
*  but I do think that it's important to make the world a better place if we can. I just don't feel
*  comfortable with doing that in ways that would be anti-intellectual, that would involve, you know,
*  what I said was if your goal is primarily to change the world, then I can absolutely see
*  circumstances in which doing something other than telling the truth would be involved. But if your
*  goal is a little bit to change the world and a lot to tell the truth, then I don't see why you should
*  ever not tell the truth, you know, do your best to change the world in ways that are compatible with
*  telling the truth. That's what I would try to do. Kyle Maurer says, why isn't gravity or the
*  gravitational field constantly decohering quantum systems and getting rid of their wave-like natures?
*  Seems like even a single particle would be constantly updating space-time with its position
*  and energy. Well, this is a subtle question actually, and I don't think that the answer is
*  completely understood, but let me just add a little bit of a true fact that might help you see what's
*  going on. You know, think about the sun, okay? That's a big quantum particle. It's a very big
*  quantum particle. In the approximation, we're ignoring the internal degrees of freedom of the
*  sun, and it has a gravitational field. But the gravitational field sort of exists as part of it.
*  The gravitational field isn't changing. There's just the sun and the gravitational field of the
*  sun. It's like kind of one system, right? So the sun isn't in the approximation where the sun is
*  just sitting there alone in the universe. There's no dynamics. It has a gravitational field. Pull,
*  stop. That's all that's going on. Decoherence is of necessity a dynamical process. Decoherence is
*  the transition from two systems being unentangled to two systems becoming entangled, where one of
*  those systems is the environment, right? So the gravitational field of a single object isn't the
*  environment. An environment you should think of as a lot of propagating degrees of freedom, like a
*  lot of photons or a lot of atoms or something like that. It's not the field that is attached
*  to some object. So it's not the gravitational field per se that would be doing the decohering,
*  but you could imagine gravitons doing the decohering, right? Like if you moved the sun
*  and it gave off some gravitons, those could sort of scatter into the environment. If they then
*  interacted with other things in the universe, then you could decohere. But you need a lot of that,
*  right? I mean gravity is very, very weak. So it becomes a quantitative question. You actually
*  have to calculate how quickly it happens. That turns out to be hard to do, which is why, like I
*  said, it turns out to be a subtle question. Okay, Lester Su says, I think you said before
*  that all good Bayesians should update their priors in the same way based on objective new facts.
*  But if a Bayesian starts out with their subjective priors, surely those priors would and should also
*  inform how they assess new facts and therefore how that will update those priors. Or is there
*  an objective standard to how you assess new facts as a Bayesian independent of your priors?
*  So I'm not quite sure that I'm interpreting the question correctly, but I'm going to interpret
*  it in a way that I think is a charitable way in the sense that I'm going to interpret it in a way
*  that I agree this is a really good issue to worry about. Namely, none of us is perfect Bayesians. In
*  fact, even the thought experiment of Bayesian reasoning is just something that does not map
*  on to how the real world works, okay? Because what Bayesian reasoning says is you have your priors
*  for various different propositions and those are in some sense subjective, okay? Different people
*  are allowed to start with different priors. They think that some things are more likely, some things
*  are less likely, but you're not allowed to pick your own likelihood. So the likelihood is the
*  theoretical prediction given the different proposition you want to believe in. What is
*  the probability of getting certain data coming in, certain new information? And we pretend that those
*  likelihoods are completely objective, but in practice they're not because often the propositions
*  we're trying to judge in some way are not perfectly well defined, okay? So previously we were
*  talking about the likelihood of life existing in the universe under theism or atheism. So I'm happy
*  to say the probability of life existing under theism is very, very large. It would be, what would be
*  the point of having God around to be if God didn't, you know, create life somewhere? But I don't know
*  what the number is. I don't think that the phrase theism attaches to any sufficiently well-defined
*  theory to let me predict what this purportedly objective likelihood function is, right? So that's
*  one real world shortcoming of the Bayesian paradigm and the other is what I think you're getting at,
*  Lester, which is that, well, there's two things, but both of them have to do with the way that we
*  take in new data or new information. One is when we get some new information, what is the credibility
*  that we give to that information? I mean, maybe our brains are misleading us or maybe we're just
*  being lied to or whatever, and the same amount of information might be judged to have different
*  amounts of credibility by two different people. So in principle, that is something to worry about,
*  but it's something that Bayesian reasoning is perfectly adapted to taking care of. You sort of
*  take that into account when you define what is your proposition, what is your likelihood,
*  what is the data and all that stuff, right? All of these have different probabilities associated
*  with them and they all get massaged in to the final answer in the correct way. And even more
*  interesting issue to me is that we don't take in the same information, right? And this again goes
*  back to the question that we were talking about before with theism versus atheism, because if
*  the only thing you looked at was the fact that there's life in the universe, you might get one
*  answer. But then if you also look at the fact that there are many other galaxies with many other
*  stars, the universe is big and it's old and it's a mess, et cetera, et cetera, then you might get a
*  very different picture. So increasingly, and this isn't directly related to your question, but it's
*  just something I've been thinking about myself. I'm impressed, impressed might not be the word.
*  I care a lot about the fact that we are computationally bounded, as Stephen Wolfram
*  said it, although I was thinking about it for other reasons with other words attached to it,
*  but we're finite, right? We don't take in all of the data. In Zeynep Tufekci's words from several
*  podcasts ago, attention is the precious quantity that we are talking about now, not information.
*  There's too much information out there. What do you pay attention to? And since we are tiny,
*  finite people, we need to choose what to pay attention to. And so even to people who agree
*  on all of the priors and agree on all the likelihoods might choose to pay attention
*  to different inputs and therefore get different data that they use to update their Bayesian
*  credences. And so this is not to say that Bayesian reasoning is wrong in any way. It's not wrong.
*  It's an idealization of what really happens in the real world. And so I think that there's
*  maybe it's already been done. I don't know. I'm not an expert in these things, but there's probably
*  a lot of work to be done or that has been done on bounded rationality, right? I think that's a
*  technical term for it. The fact that we are not perfect either in reasoning or information
*  gathering and therefore what's the best you can do under those circumstances. There's probably
*  been a lot written on that that I don't know about. So maybe we should have someone on the podcast
*  talk about it. Fabian Rose-Dowlin says, regarding your work in very fundamental questions of the
*  universe, have you ever had to deal with any existential anxiety or pain or anything like that?
*  Do you have any thoughts about how quantum physics could influence these matters either
*  positively or negatively? So no and no are the short answers here. I think I've said this before
*  when I was a kid, when I first started thinking about cosmology and things like that, there was a
*  little bit of anxiety involved and it was specifically with the question of what if I
*  hadn't existed? Unbeknownst to my young self, I was thinking in, I was doing modal reasoning.
*  I was thinking about the space of all possible worlds and there are possible worlds in which
*  I didn't exist or there are possible worlds in which the universe doesn't exist. Or though,
*  should we call that a world? I'm not sure. But anyway, that always seemed to be the end point
*  of where I could sensibly reason about things and that made me nervous or maybe even anxious.
*  But then, yeah, so I think that now when I'm thinking about those questions, I'm just not
*  sure that, you know, I talked before I did a whole podcast solo episode about why is there
*  something rather than nothing? And the answer that I advocated there is that's not a question
*  to which we have any right to think that there's an answer. We can formulate questions in what
*  appears to be a grammatically legitimate way. Why is X true? Right? And very often we can get
*  answers to those questions, but it turns out that those answers are embedded in a context. Right?
*  Why is my car out of gas? Well, because I was going to put gas in it yesterday, but I forgot.
*  Or why is my car out of battery since I have an electric car? But these are all in that context.
*  And the question, why does the universe exist doesn't have a kind of context
*  in which there would be a sensible answer. So it's not the answer is we don't know, or
*  the question is outside our powers to address or anything like that. It's just that it's not a good
*  question. It's not an answerable question. It's not a question that has an answer. So that tends to be
*  more my attitude these days with the kinds of questions that would lead to existential anxiety.
*  And quantum mechanics has nothing to do with it. As far as I can tell, I'm not really sure why it
*  would, especially for someone like myself, who is a thorough going physicalist about quantum
*  mechanics. There's a quantum state and it obeys an equation. I'm not sure why that would change my
*  existential anxiety over classical mechanics in any way. Ratboy.exec, probably also not their real
*  name, says, I recently listened to your talk with Philip Goff on panpsychism and was absolutely
*  enthralled. One thing that struck me was the discussion on intrinsic properties, those that
*  don't govern observable behavior and aren't captured by mathematics. It reminded me of your
*  discussion with Max Tegmark, who seemed to argue there's no such thing to the extent that the
*  universe is nothing more than an abstract mathematical structure, and even further that
*  this universe is not uniquely real among mathematical structures. My question is this,
*  if your position is that there are no intrinsic properties, what in your view distinguishes the
*  world from the abstract mathematical structure described by Tegmark? And if in contrast to
*  Tegmark's view, this universe possesses a unique property called existence, would that qualify as
*  a sort of intrinsic property that we get to be privy to by virtue of our being internal to the
*  structure? So I think that it's hard to give a completely satisfactory answer to this without a
*  rigorous definition of the phrase intrinsic property. Okay. It's one of those things where
*  we think we know what the word intrinsic means. We think we know what a property is and therefore
*  we think we know what the phrase means, but it gets a little bit slipperier upon further examination.
*  So, you know, in mathematics, in set theory, there is a definition of property,
*  and it's a little deflationary. It's just a subset, right? And you have a set of many,
*  many things, and you want to talk about a property that some things have and some don't.
*  You just enumerate the ones that have the property. And so the property is simply
*  equivalent, isomorphic, to the subset. That's what a property is in set theory. So I could take that
*  attitude about properties of physical things too. I could say, you know, properties are just a way
*  of saying, like if I say that the property of moving at the speed of light is just the set of
*  all things in the universe moving at the speed of light, right? And then it gets a little bit tricky
*  to do that carefully, but something like that could happen. So now you're adding the adjective
*  intrinsic to property. I don't know what that means. I don't know what that is supposed to mean,
*  especially if you're saying that it's an intrinsic property that doesn't change its
*  observable behavior in any way. I mean, I know what properties are. I know what electric charge
*  is. I know what mass is. And the reason why I know what they are is because they play a role
*  dynamically. They appear in the equations of motion that predict what's going to happen to
*  this physical system. If you say, well, I have another kind of property that's really important,
*  but it has no effect whatsoever on what happens. I'm not really moved by that, right? Now, so you're
*  trying to pick out the specific example of existence as a property. And I'm not sure what
*  that means exactly. So I am, and this might be my failing, because I'm not trying to make fun of you.
*  I'm making fun of myself here. I'm opening up to things that I haven't thought about very deeply,
*  so I could be completely wrong, but I'm going to give you my initial impression.
*  I do think that there is something called the universe. My phrase from my own point of view
*  about this is reality realism. What do I think is real? Reality. What is that? Well, I don't know,
*  but we're trying to figure that out. That's what science is trying to do. What we try to do is
*  model reality. And when we model reality, we do so usually with a mathematical formal system
*  of some sort. And so I am not a tech-markian in the sense that I think all different mathematical
*  systems exist for reasons that I tried to make clear during that podcast. I think that the real
*  world exists and it's described by some mathematics and not others. Okay. So could you think about that
*  as saying, well, consider the space of all possible worlds and point to one and say, this is special
*  because it has the property called existence? Sure, I think so. I think that's a possible thing
*  to do, but I don't think it's a necessary thing to do. I could just say the real world exists and
*  I could stop. I don't need to compare it to all the other non-existent worlds. So it's a very useful,
*  that makes me not a modal realist. Modal realism long before Max Tegmark was this idea of David
*  Lewis's that all the alternative possible worlds exist in some real sense. And all we try to do is
*  figure out which one we're in. Okay. I think that's a very good reasoning strategy. I think
*  it's very, when we were asking ourselves, what are the correct laws of physics? That is exactly
*  equivalent to saying, consider all the possible worlds with different laws of physics, which one
*  are we in? But I don't think that anything is added by saying that the other worlds really exist.
*  So I think that our world exists and that is different, but it's not a property that our world
*  has. It's just the world, that there's nothing extra to it. Now, if you don't understand the
*  many worlds of quantum mechanics very well, you might think that this is hypocritical,
*  because I do think that the other worlds exist in quantum mechanics, but that's because they are
*  causally connected to our world. They were part of our world before and they split off. And there's
*  an equation that describes that. It's not simply a posit that says, imagine they're all there.
*  They're a dynamical prediction of the Schrodinger equation. I hope that was an answer to your
*  question. I'm not sure, but I did my best. Ken Wolf says, back in the day, you were all taught
*  that there were just three types of chemical bonds, covalent, ionic, and metallic. I recently read an
*  article by Philip Ball about how new research suggests there might be new types of chemical
*  bonds, such as ones that blur the line between covalent and metallic. This got me to wondering
*  whether any new developments in quantum electrodynamics could possibly give us new
*  insight into how chemical bonds might work. Do you think this is possible? A shorter version
*  of the question, could changes in the standard model change our understanding of how chemical
*  bonds work, or is that pretty much locked in by now? I think that's pretty much locked in by now.
*  This is part and parcel of the idea that the laws of physics underlying our everyday lives
*  are completely understood. The core theory is what we have. And roughly speaking, it's completely
*  possible that we will learn more about chemical bonds than we know now. But the laws of physics
*  that give rise to chemical bonds, the fundamental equations of quantum electrodynamics and the
*  standard model, those are there. They're not changing. And the reason why we know is because
*  we can characterize what kinds of possible changes there are, and we can look for them. We can do the
*  experiments to see whether they're there. And so far, they're not. And we have pushed any possible
*  modification of the standard model out to regimes where it very well could be there,
*  but it would have no effect whatsoever on chemistry or anything like that. Think about
*  the podcast I recently did on the muons, right? On different possible, we don't know, but possible
*  new physics signatures of how muons decay and interact and their magnetic moments.
*  These are so incredibly tiny. We're not even sure they're there, but they have zero effect on
*  chemistry or anything like that. And that's the only thing that we have seen that could possibly be,
*  or let's say it's the most reasonable, most likely deviation from the standard model we've yet seen.
*  So that is my opinion about that. Could be wrong. The thing about saying things like this is one
*  could always be wrong, but one has to do what the best one can do about assigning credences to
*  different possibilities. My credence that new fundamental physics is going to change
*  chemistry is very, very, very tiny indeed. Ryan Morrison says, I'm not an expert in psychology,
*  but I think Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the idea that we can make progress as humans
*  is pretty attractive. Do you ever think about the idea of transcending the self or have you moved
*  away from that kind of thinking? Do you think it's possible to be totally fulfilled? Well,
*  luckily Ryan, I did a whole podcast on that with Scott Barry Kaufman. And Scott is a psychologist
*  who actually is a huge fan of Maslow. And he has updated Maslow's hierarchy of needs in a way that
*  I think is really much better. I get what you mean. The hierarchy of needs is an attractive notion,
*  but there's something that is missing about it. And so what Scott points out is number one,
*  Maslow never drew the pyramid. You know, the famous pyramid picture that was done by later
*  commentators and the pyramid as a metaphor is a little bit misleading because it's a little too
*  solid, right? It makes you think of there really is a structure that we're climbing to get to
*  transcendence at the top of it. Whereas the world, reality and our lives is much more dynamic. And so
*  Scott is trying, is arguing for replacing the pyramid metaphor with a sailboat metaphor,
*  which I like. I mean, I basically am totally a fan of this way of thinking. So no, I don't think it's
*  possible to be totally fulfilled. I think that's a misunderstanding of what it means to be alive and
*  human. To be alive and human is to be a process, to be changing. The changes might be under the
*  surface or they might be very obvious, but it's completely wrong in my view to imagine that there
*  is one state that we just need to get into. And then our work is done. I think that's the opposite
*  of how we should think about living our lives. Casey Mahone says, I've been thinking a lot about
*  your notion of emergent space time. In my mind, it raises a similar issue as the hard problem of
*  consciousness. In both cases, it seems completely unclear to me how something of a totally different
*  kind can arise simply through emergence. Well, I'm sorry that it seems unclear, but it happens all
*  the time. I mean, that is one of the great things about emergence. One of the things that you learn
*  about emergence is the rules of the emergent theory can have no obvious connection to the rules of
*  the underlying theory. There will be a non-obvious connection. There might be some subtle connection
*  and it will be there because they have to be ultimately compatible. But as we say, the ontology,
*  the different kinds of stuff you have in the emergent theory can be totally different.
*  The most obvious and well thought about example is quantum mechanics and classical mechanics.
*  In quantum mechanics, the stuff is a wave function, a vector in Hilbert space. That's what you start
*  with. What you see at the end are particles of classical mechanics, particles and fields
*  living in space time, a completely different kind of thing. Forget about emergent space time.
*  Just quantum mechanics, just good old quantum mechanics, the hydrogen atom.
*  The hydrogen atom, the sort of picture that we draw, the Rutherford atom with little dots in
*  the middle to represent the nucleus and little dots orbiting to represent the electrons,
*  that gets us a certain place but it's not the underlying quantum reality. Once you get to the
*  solar system, same thing, right? The solar system is very well represented as a big sun with rocks,
*  planets orbiting around it, but the real thing is an underlying quantum wave function. Emergence
*  just does that all the time. The question is, is there a map from the underlying microscopic states
*  to the emergent macroscopic states? And the map can relate to very, very different theories.
*  Rob Gryber says, this month I wanted to ask a question from my seven-year-old daughter, Liana.
*  So this is a hint to other future AMA askers, like I'm a sucker for these kinds of questions,
*  so please don't lie, but if you really want a question answered, it does increase your chances
*  if the question comes from your seven-year-old daughter. The question is, Professor Carol,
*  if you were standing on the photon sphere of a black hole and you looked forward, you would see
*  the back of your head, is that right? What would happen if you looked up? What would you see? And
*  what would you see around you to the left and the right? So I want to be a little bit careful here
*  because there's the real world and then there's sort of physics-idealized playland, okay? So there
*  is in the world of black holes something called the photon sphere. This is the region around the
*  black hole a little bit outside the event horizon where a photon could travel exactly,
*  roughly speaking, exactly parallel to the event horizon at a constant distance above it, okay?
*  So a photon could just go in a circle, right? And you call it the photon sphere. It's outside
*  the event horizon, so it's not the region from which you can't escape. If you were on the photon
*  sphere and fired your rocket engine, you could escape, okay? But if you were just there and you
*  were not a photon, you could send out a photon in exactly the right direction and it would go
*  around and you would indeed see the back of your head. That's the story we tell anyway. In the real
*  world, there's an extra fact that becomes very important, which is that these orbits of photons
*  on the photon sphere are not stable. If you deviate the direction in which the photon is pointing by
*  any tiny bit at all, the photon will either fall into the black hole or zoom off to infinity.
*  So in the real world, there's going to be almost no photons on the photon sphere. Almost all of them
*  that might have come close will either fall into the black hole or zoom off to infinity. So you
*  probably won't see anything special at the photon sphere in the real world. But let's go along with
*  the thought experiment. What happened if you looked up or left or right? Well, I'm not exactly sure
*  what direction you're pointing in here. Of course, out in outer space, there's no such thing as up,
*  down, left or right. All the directions are created equal. So basically, if you're next to
*  the black hole, there's only two options. You're either looking, well, I guess there's three options.
*  You're looking toward the black hole, away from the black hole, or perpendicular to the black hole.
*  And if you're looking along the photon sphere, you're looking perpendicular to the black hole.
*  So it doesn't matter whether you look straight or up or backward. In any of those directions,
*  you're looking perpendicular to the black hole and you would see the black of your head,
*  the back of your head. If you look toward the black hole, you see nothing. It's black, roughly
*  speaking. You could see something that was in the process of just falling into it. That's very
*  possible. But the black hole itself is just black. If you look the other way, you see the real world,
*  the outside world. You see all the stars and your friends back in the spaceship who were thinking
*  themselves, what are they doing messing around near the photon sphere? They're going to be in
*  trouble. But otherwise, it's perfectly normal. So in fact, to the to a large extent, it is just
*  perfectly normal. Don't think of the photon sphere as a very dramatic place that you would
*  notice if you were visiting the vicinity of a black hole. Jesse Rimmler says, music emerges from
*  the naturally occurring overtone series, which is the same everywhere in the universe. The scales
*  and chords we build out of this vary from culture to culture. As a thought experiment, I tried to
*  imagine a fundamentally different kind of musical harmony beyond cultural or timbral differences.
*  Am I right to conclude that it would have to be a universe with a different kind of math
*  since the octave and the overtone series are based on mathematical relationships? Well,
*  I think the real answer that I have to give here is I don't even know what it would mean
*  to talk about a universe with a different kind of math. I can imagine talking about a universe
*  with a different kind of physics, right? Different laws of physics. But math is math. Like math goes
*  back and forth between universes. The Pythagoras' theorem follows from Euclidean geometry,
*  no matter what universe you're in. And likewise, the fact that 440 divided by 2 is 220 is going to
*  be true in every universe, right? So I don't think it's a matter of different kinds of math.
*  There could be different kinds of laws of physics. But then, you know, there might not even be sound
*  or something like that. So I'm not sure what we're talking about. So I don't think looking
*  at different kinds of math is the right way to go here. I think that looking at different
*  relationships within the known laws of math between different frequencies and different
*  combinations of frequencies might be the way to go. I mean, an obvious way to go is to go beyond
*  the idea of discrete individual frequencies, right? Like it's usually just to keep our lives simple.
*  We build instruments that mostly play one note at a time. It's not always true. Of course,
*  you can think of counter examples to that. But typically, a note on an instrument is a note that
*  centered in its frequency and its spectral resolution around a single frequency. And,
*  you know, going beyond that to more complicated spectra of sounds coming out of a system might
*  be an interesting way to go. I don't know. I'm just making things up. Michael Adelman says,
*  In the last AMA, you dismissed the idea of nations having intelligence or consciousness
*  likening it to anthropomorphizing. Given that consciousness appears to be an emergent property
*  of sufficiently large number networks of neurons, why shouldn't we also see conscious states arise
*  from networks of more complex organisms like humans and animals? George Dyson suggested this
*  in his Darwin among the machines 24 years ago, drawing parallels to Hobbes's Leviathan. So I
*  forget what I said last month in the last AMA. But in principle, sure, I mean, in principle,
*  you could have giant consciousnesses made out of tinier pieces that played the role of neurons or
*  something like that. But the fact that it is possible in principle doesn't mean it actually
*  happens in practice in the current world. You know, I think that the consciousness that we have
*  in our human brains is pretty dependent on special properties of our particular human brains. There's
*  other ways I'm very sure that you could have consciousness, but it's not just going to pop
*  into existence without any effort, right? You know, we are the result of billions of years of
*  evolution. Most of those billions of years, we were single celled organisms, but still,
*  there were selection pressures that were shaping what we have in our brains and in our nervous
*  systems and in our biology to compete in certain environments and to reproduce and so forth.
*  And the ultimate result of that is the capacity that we have in our brains to do information
*  processing in a very coherent way, right? In a way that gives us a sense of self, a sense of I.
*  Whereas a nation is a bunch of people that is much more loosely organized than that, with no
*  special structure, no special rules of engagement and ways that different connections are drawn
*  and different substructures like the brain has and so forth. So it would be astonishing to me
*  if real societies were sufficiently similar to human brains that we would call them conscious
*  organisms. And indeed, I don't think that's how it is. You know, when you actually want to convince
*  a nation to do something, it's much more useful to convince the boss of that nation to do something
*  than try to convince the nation as a whole. One of the aspects of why nations are very different
*  than brains is that brains don't have a president or a king or an emperor. None of their neurons is
*  the king neuron. That's just not how it works. So yeah, in principle, the laws of physics do not
*  prevent nations from being conscious, but in practice, I think it's kind of a different thing.
*  Peter B says, one of your earlier guests, Leonard Susskind, has argued that inflation must create
*  infinite open universes with negative curvature. Yet you have mentioned that we live in a desider
*  space with positive curvature, so I'm confused. Are we living on a giant Pringle chip or a giant
*  balloon? Well, so I don't know, this is possibly my fault, but you have to distinguish between
*  the curvature of space and the curvature of space-time. That's one thing. The other thing is
*  that what Lenny is saying about the negative curvature, we don't know if that's true or not.
*  So the difference between spatial curvature and space-time curvature is when we have cosmology.
*  In cosmology, there is a special situation, which is not necessarily true in other
*  aspects, in other situations, let's say, in general relativity, where spatial slices are
*  homogeneous and isotropic. There's a special way of slicing space-time into space plus time,
*  so that the spatial sections are more or less the same everywhere on large scales. So unlike
*  just an empty flat space-time Minkowski space, in cosmology, there is a best way of slicing
*  space-time into space plus time. So then given that, we can talk about the curvature of space,
*  as well as the curvature of space-time. The curvature of space is pretty close to zero.
*  We've measured it. We've not measured any overall deviation from zero. So it could be very, very
*  small but positive, or it could be very, very small but negative, or it could be zero to any
*  practical precision. So what Lenny is pointing out is that in his favorite version of eternal inflation,
*  where there is bubble nucleation, where a little bubble of true vacuum, or at least lower energy
*  vacuum comes into existence inside a high energy false vacuum state, you will very naturally get
*  spatial slices that are negative curvature. Now the spatial slices can be negative curvature,
*  whether or not space-time is positively or negatively curved. And, you know, as we said before,
*  there's different kinds of curvature that space-time can have. There's Ricci scalar,
*  Ricci curvature, and Weyl curvature, etc. So when you even say positive and negative, you're already
*  simplifying things an enormous amount. But the point is that our universe is headed toward
*  being empty other than for a positive cosmological constant, right? That's the future of our
*  universe. There'll be nothing left but the positive cosmological constant, and that will be a desider
*  geometry overall, a space-time with a positive curvature. That's completely compatible with the
*  surfaces of constant energy in cosmology being negative curvature. There's a difference between
*  the curvature of the overall space-time and how you slice it into space plus time. So the two are
*  actually compatible. It's also possible that there are other ways of doing eternal inflation, like
*  what Jennifer Chen and I looked at years ago, where you have baby new baby universes being created
*  that nucleate as spherical bubbles off of the parent space-time, in which case the spatial sections
*  would also be positive curvature. So we don't know whether space is positively curved, negatively curved,
*  or zero. We do have good empirical evidence that space-time is headed toward a positive curvature
*  state. So Mark Zug says, regarding photons interfering with themselves, what is wrong with
*  the idea that electromagnetic energy must travel as waves but only be detected as particles?
*  Nothing. Nothing wrong with that idea. That's perfectly sensible. It's an incomplete idea
*  because it's kind of mixing classical language with quantum mechanical language. Classically,
*  the electromagnetic field is a wave, right? It's an electromagnetic wave. And then if you add a
*  little bit of quantum mechanics in, you say that when you detect the electromagnetic wave, you
*  detect discrete packets of energy, aka particles. Now if you're a little bit more careful, if you're
*  going fully quantum mechanical, then that original electromagnetic wave was itself quantum mechanical.
*  It was the quantum field wave, okay? And that's a little bit more complicated, but still it was a
*  wave. So yeah, I think that as a rule of thumb, saying that EM waves travel as waves but detected
*  as particles is more or less on the right track. Mark Matthews says, could quarks in a proton
*  run into their virtual anti-quark counterpart and exchange places with a virtual quark mediated
*  by a gluon resulting in a virtual quark to replace the original quark? So okay, there's a bunch of
*  things going on there. I'm not quite sure what the picture is, but the reason why I wanted to answer
*  this question was just to talk a little bit about this thing that we always say that quarks and
*  neutrons for that matter, that protons and neutrons for that matter have three quarks in them. In the
*  case of a proton, two ups and a down. In the case of a neutron, two downs and an up. It's not really
*  like that, okay? Anyone who's taken quantum field theory, who thinks very carefully about particle
*  physics knows better. This is a very sloppy way of talking about protons and neutrons. The reality is
*  that protons and neutrons inside are a bubbling sea of, actually that's not even the reality. A
*  slightly better metaphor is that inside protons and neutrons there's a bubbling sea of quarks and
*  anti-quarks and gluons, okay? They're virtual particles and it's not just like the occasional
*  virtual particles, it's mostly virtual particles. There's a whole bunch of things going on. Now the
*  reason why I say that's not exactly right is that even that is speaking too classically and using a
*  particle-like language. What's really going on are their quantum fields that are not separable into
*  individual particles. That's the truth of it. Usually you don't want the truth, usually you want
*  the picture. The vivid picture is a roiling sea of particles popping into and out of existence.
*  The reason why that's not a great picture is that it gives you the idea that inside the proton or
*  neutron things are changing over time, right? Things are popping out of existence and they're
*  not. The inside of a proton-neutron is static. Nothing is happening inside there. If you were
*  to observe it, you would see different things at different times but that's because of the
*  disturbance that you're putting on it by observing it. Anyway, if you want to speak this particle
*  language at all, it is much more accurate to think of it as a whole bunch of quarks and anti-quarks
*  and gluons always interacting and popping out of existence and creating and annihilating and so forth.
*  What practiced particle physicists will do is talk about the valence quarks inside a proton or
*  neutron. What they mean by that is when you typically say there are two ups and a down in
*  a proton, what you mean is if you count up all of the quarks and all of the anti-quarks and all of
*  the gluons, on average, sorry, not on average, there will be lots of quarks and anti-quarks but
*  there will always be precisely three more quarks than anti-quarks inside the proton. That's the
*  point. The reason why you know it's precisely three is because there's a baryon number that is
*  one-third per quark and the total for the proton is equal to one and that's true. There is one-third
*  baryon number per quark and the total has to equal three. Sorry, the total has to equal one.
*  My brain's not really working today, man. I'm going to get to harder math in a second so I better
*  get her in better increase my mathematical skills here. One-third times three equals one. There we
*  go. So there's an excess of three quarks over anti-quarks in a proton or a neutron and there's
*  in fact an excess of two up quarks and one down quark over their anti-particles but there's a
*  tremendous number of quarks and anti-quarks popping out of existence all the time if you want to use
*  that virtual particle metaphor at all. That's the best I can do without going into the equations.
*  Michael Ailing says, can you suggest one or two books that give an overview of the philosophy of
*  science and highlight some of the current issues those in the field are tackling? So sadly my answer
*  here is no. I cannot suggest those books but let me explain why. There are two very different kinds
*  of things related but different kinds of things that get labeled as philosophy of science. One
*  kind of thing is the philosophy of how science works. So if you think about Thomas Kuhn,
*  Fire-Aubin, Popper, right the famous names in the philosophy of science, they're thinking about how
*  we invent theories, how we decide what theories are true, how theories change over time and it
*  it goes right into the sociology of science, right? Different research practices, different
*  communities, how they talk to each other. That is something called philosophy of science but then
*  there's something that is usually called philosophy of physics or philosophy of biology or philosophy
*  of mathematics, okay? Like things that you might say are part of philosophy of science but are in
*  fact not interested in how theories are chosen but they're interested in how the world works.
*  So a philosopher of physics is interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics or the foundations
*  of space-time. Philosophers of biology are interested in how evolution works and whether
*  or not there's selection pressures at different levels or things like that. All that stuff, okay?
*  So that kind of philosophy of science is more continuous with science than with the sociology
*  of science and it's that kind of philosophy of science that is sort of the philosophical side of
*  science that is much more what I personally am interested in. But if you were to buy a book on
*  the philosophy of science to purport it to be an overview, I think that most of it would be about
*  the former kind. It would mostly be about theory choice and how research programs work and stuff
*  like that. And that's interesting and important stuff but I'm not an expert in it so I don't
*  really have any good recommendations there. Whereas if you wanted to buy a book in the other stuff,
*  it's probably a different book for philosophy of physics versus philosophy of biology versus
*  philosophy of mathematics or something like that. I can think of books off the top of my head in
*  all those areas although I'm not familiar enough with the entire set of books to say that it's the
*  best. There's a set of books by Tim Maudelein that are introductions to philosophies of physics.
*  There's a new book by David Wallace, a very short introduction to the philosophy of physics,
*  which I haven't seen but I'm sure is very good. There's a book by Alex Rosenberg,
*  previous Mindscape guest on the philosophy of biology that is very good, an intro book.
*  And philosophy of math, I have a few books and I can't remember honestly who wrote them but
*  you could look, I haven't read any of them, I just own them. I've glanced through them for
*  particular reasons when I need to know one fact about Gödel's theorem or whatever.
*  But that's my overview of the whole state of the field so I can't really offer one or two books
*  that answer the question. Connor Scott says, if a neutron star is propped up by the Palli
*  exclusion principle and if the Palli exclusion principle only forbids fermions from being in the
*  same quantum state, then wouldn't it be the natural assumption, in the case of a neutron star
*  gaining mass and collapsing into a black hole, to say that the simplest ground state of the fermions
*  is no longer to distinguish their quantum states by position but by some other factor?
*  So there's a simple answer but behind it there's a more complicated issue here.
*  The simple answer is we know what the degrees of freedom are that fermions can have, at least the
*  fermions we know about like protons and neutrons or the quarks that make them up. So there aren't
*  new factors that can distinguish between them, otherwise there wouldn't be neutron stars because
*  you could just pack different particles with different values of those degrees of freedom
*  as densely as you want. So it's an interesting fact, it goes into, you know, I wrote about this,
*  we talked about panpsychism, or we didn't talk about panpsychism, but I've been thinking about,
*  we talked about consciousness. I remember, we talked about Philip Goff, that's what it was,
*  someone mentioned panpsychism and Philip Goff. So Philip is having a, is editing a collection of
*  essays in response to his book called Galileo's Error, and essays from different people from very
*  different perspectives, and I was one of the people he asked to write an essay. So I did that,
*  and those of you who follow me on Twitter might have seen it called Consciousness and the Laws of
*  Physics, and of course there's a whole bunch of things that have been written about consciousness
*  and the laws of physics, and my thing is different because I'm really not talking about
*  consciousness at all. In the same spirit as my book The Big Picture, I'm just trying to make
*  the argument that whatever consciousness is, it's probably not a good idea to try to explain it by
*  changing the laws of physics, okay? And this does get back to the Palli-Scalutian Principle,
*  just trust me. The connection is that one way that you might imagine to be panpsychist,
*  one way, and only one way, not the only way, but one way to imagine being panpsychist is to imagine
*  there is a new degree of freedom for material particles like electrons and quarks, namely a
*  mental degree of freedom. There might be two mental states, just to keep things simple, maybe
*  there's, you know, a million mental states, but there might be two different mental states that
*  an electron could be in, maybe happy or sad, but the point is that if that new mental degree of
*  freedom acted like an ordinary physical degree of freedom, like spin, for example, we would have
*  detected it a long time ago. The number of degrees of freedom that elementary particles have comes
*  into calculations like the probability that two electrons scatter off of each other or something
*  like that, okay? So anyway, we know how many degrees of freedom particles have. There aren't
*  any new ones, and that's true for new possible mental degrees of freedom, but it's also true
*  for possible new physical degrees of freedom. Now what is possible is that the neutrons in a
*  neutron star can, under great pressure, convert into even heavier particles. The whole reason why
*  when a white dwarf collapses, the electrons and protons convert into neutrons is that the
*  neutron is heavier than an electron, and therefore you can squeeze them more tightly into each other.
*  So probably what happens along the way of a collapse of a neutron star is that neutrons sort
*  of become energetic enough that they can convert into even heavier particles and be squeezed
*  more closely, but as far as we know, whatever they convert into, it's not a stable configuration
*  that would stop them from collapsing all the way into a black hole, as far as we know. Chris Shipton
*  says, is there a relationship between the halting problem and the traveling salesman problem?
*  I mean, roughly speaking, no. You know, I'm not a super expert at this stuff, so of course there are
*  some relationships in that they are both problems, right, in computational complexity theory in some
*  sense, but the traveling salesman problem is hard. It takes a lot of steps to figure out what is the
*  best route between, you know, all these different cities, but the halting problem is literally
*  unsolvable, okay? There's a difference between unsolvable and hard. Hard means it takes a lot
*  of steps. The halting problem is it literally can't be solved. There's literally no way of knowing
*  just by looking at a computer program whether it is guaranteed to halt or not, other than running
*  it and seeing if it halts, but there you can only show that it does halt in a certain period of time.
*  You can't show that it doesn't. Like if you run it for an hour, you're not, and it doesn't halt,
*  you're not sure whether it would run for a year, run forever, okay? So that's a literally unsolvable
*  problem, which is very different than the traveling salesman. John Dick says, given an Everettian
*  perspective, what would be the consequence if our universe, the vacuum, happened to be in a
*  metastable state with a decay time of only a million years? Could we tell? You know, the
*  Everettian perspective doesn't change anything in questions like this. It's the same perspective.
*  It's the same quantum mechanical prediction, and the prediction is that if we're in a metastable
*  vacuum, there's a probability per unit time and per unit spatial volume that a lower energy vacuum
*  tunnels into existence. So if the decay time for that happening is a million years, you need to tell
*  me per what volume also, but I get what you mean. Like let's say per the volume of our observable
*  universe, okay? Well, our observable universe is much more than a million years old, so it would
*  have been overwhelmingly likely that we would have already decayed. Now there is an anthropic cutoff,
*  right? I mean, there's an anthropic consideration. Maybe it is the case that if the new vacuum
*  nucleates and takes over our old space, the laws of physics within the new vacuum do not allow for
*  the existence of life, and therefore there is one branch of the wave function where these decays
*  haven't happened yet, and that's the only place we can live. I can buy that, but then we would,
*  within a million years, we would probably die. That would be the prediction of that.
*  And there'd be some other branch of the wave function where we hadn't died yet, etc. So
*  I think that that's a little fishy. I'm not a fan of those kinds of anthropic arguments because
*  I don't know what the laws of physics are going to be in the new universe, etc. And
*  it's just much easier in the space of all my credences to imagine that the
*  lifetime of our universe is really, really long, billions of years, and therefore it's
*  just likely we haven't seen it yet. That's my guess. Anders says, the Kalam cosmological argument
*  for God is regularly trotted out. Everything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe
*  began to exist, therefore the universe has a cause. And with a little hand waving, you get to God.
*  This seems like something a cosmologist would have something to say about. Is there a reason why you
*  don't accept it? So yes, for some of you, you'll know that I did a debate with William Lane Craig
*  about this very issue because this is William Lane Craig's favorite proof for the existence of
*  God. And the short version to my response is we don't know whether the universe began to exist or
*  not. Maybe it did, maybe it didn't. That's just an open question. But we do know that the first
*  premise, everything that begins to exist has a cause, is just false. That's just not the right
*  way to talk about fundamental physics kinds of questions. There's two options that you have.
*  One is, if you're in the emergent higher level world of me and you and tables and chairs and cups
*  of coffee and things like that, then there is a very natural language of cause and effect. And
*  that language of cause and effect is very dependent on entropy and the arrow of time.
*  Okay. And so we're not describing the world at the micro physical level. We're not Laplace's demon.
*  We have incomplete information about the world. We coarse grained the world. And in that higher
*  level coarse grained description, causes and effects are very, very important. The other option,
*  but obviously it doesn't tell us anything about the beginning of the universe because that is not
*  described by that coarse grained higher level description. The other option is that we give
*  a description in the micro physical language, the fundamental laws of physics. Okay.
*  But as far as we currently understand the fundamental laws of physics, they don't have
*  cause and effect in them as concepts. Instead, they have differential equations and they say,
*  the universe, whatever mathematical structure you are using to describe it, like a wave function
*  or something like that, obeys this equation. That's the laws of physics. There's not an extra law
*  that says that things have causes. Okay. The only law is here's the stuff. It obeys this equation.
*  That is our current paradigm for doing the laws of physics. And so the point is you don't say
*  everything that begins to exist has a cause. You say everything obeys the laws of physics.
*  And once you say it that way, you're not going to get to God existing, right? You just say,
*  the universe obeys the laws of physics. The universe may or may not have begun to exist.
*  And there's no therefore God exists, right? That's just not a possible conclusion.
*  Siddhartha says, can any seemingly non-deterministic universe be truly random at
*  the fundamental level? Even if entities inside the universe cannot tell, doesn't the universe itself
*  somehow need to pick one or all in many worlds a possibility following some deterministic process?
*  So I think Siddhartha, you're just sort of insisting that you don't believe that things
*  can be non-deterministic. I don't know what to tell you. I don't think we have the right to make
*  those insistences. It's a nice feature of the laws of physics in our current best understanding,
*  that they are deterministic. But if we learn more tomorrow and learn that they weren't,
*  then we would have to accept that. I see no reason whatsoever to say a priori that I can't imagine
*  non-deterministic laws of physics. That's just a failure of your imagination. I can imagine
*  non-deterministic laws of physics. No problem. I don't know what you mean by imagine here,
*  but I can certainly write down possible worlds that obey non-deterministic laws. And we could
*  live in one of those. That's just an empirical question. I don't know what else to say.
*  Corby Zeissman asks a priority question. My question ties into the quantum suicide type
*  thought experiment, but is related to blockchain security. Basically, your cryptocurrency money is
*  protected by a 256-bit private key, nearly impossible to guess. But one could use a quantum
*  random number generator or the universe splitter app to generate 265 one-bit quantum results.
*  This means you would have two to the power 256 timelines and superposition,
*  where each version of you tries a unique 256-bit permutation. This exercise is all possible
*  cryptocurrency private keys, meaning there is a timeline where you successfully guessed every
*  single user's private key. And then it goes on a little bit further than that. But I can answer
*  the question here because this is an answer that I give to many similar questions. This is a
*  particular version of this question where it's been dressed up with cryptocurrency or blockchain
*  or whatever. But it's a version of the following question. There is a set of things which in
*  traditional ways of thinking about quantum mechanics are just stochastic, are just unpredictable.
*  And in many worlds, you predict with 100% probability that there is a world in which
*  one answer comes true and a world in which another answer comes true. And then some attempt is made
*  to leverage that into some important difference. And I'm going to say again and again, there is no
*  important difference between those cases. By important, I mean for us human beings.
*  To say that guessing something with a chance of being correct of two to the minus 256
*  is to me exactly the same for all intents and purposes as saying there will be two to the
*  power 256 universes in one of which I guessed correctly and the other one of which I guessed
*  wrong. For all practical purposes, for all actionable pragmatic purposes, how should I
*  behave in this world? Those two situations are exactly the same. The fact that in one out of the
*  two to the power 256 universes, there is a version of me that got it right means nothing to me.
*  It's exactly the same as saying that there was a one in two to the minus two and one in two to the
*  256 chance that it would have gotten it right. That's what it means. So I don't think that that
*  matters in any real tangible sense. Allison says, could quantum networking be used to build a
*  telescope that spans planets? So no, it's a simple answer here. But let me just very quickly elaborate
*  on this idea of quantum networking. Namely, there's no such thing, at least in the sense in
*  which you probably mean it. Remember, there's entanglement between particles that can be
*  separated by a large distance, but you can't use entanglement to send information. You can't use
*  entanglement to, I don't know, run a telescope or something like that. Entanglement is not a tangible
*  connection. If you want, and there's different ways of thinking about it, of course, there's
*  different ways of conceptualizing it. But if you want, entanglement is a prediction. Entanglement
*  is a prediction for future experimental outcomes. It's a prediction that if I measure one particle
*  in one state, then when I go over to visit the other particle, it will be in another state if
*  those two particles were entangled with each other. That kind of fact about predicting the future is
*  just not very useful for building a telescope. So maybe you can build a telescope that spans
*  planets. That's not to say that's impossible, but the way it will work is you build some
*  instrument on each planet and then you just send the information that one gets to the other one,
*  and quantum mechanics has nothing to do with it. Stefan Berninger says, I very much like your
*  conversation with Stephen Wolfram. He has not yet shown that his approach can actually explain our
*  universe, but at least so far there's nothing disproving his approach. I am, however, not sure
*  how he will manage to overcome the many orders of magnitude between the scale which is reachable
*  by computations and the scale where observable physics starts. I am thus curious to hear your
*  main takeaways from this conversation and if it somehow changed your view on how to address the
*  open questions on a most fundamental level. So no, I don't think it's changed my view very much.
*  I think that the respectable way to think about what Wolfram is doing is he's crossing his fingers.
*  He's saying that there is a chance, what he's trying to do is guess the fundamental laws of physics,
*  starting from almost nothing. Starting from, well, there's some things and there's some rules.
*  That's basically the starting point. Now, maybe he'll get it right. It's possible. It's
*  possible that you can guess the laws of physics. It might involve some trial and error along the way,
*  but my experience as a scientist is that it's not going to be that easy.
*  The world surprises us. The world that when we observe it, when we measure it, when we interact
*  with it empirically, it does things that we wouldn't have guessed ahead of time. In particular,
*  we have quantum mechanics. I think that there's only two options for Wolfram's project. One is
*  he recovers quantum mechanics exactly, and the other is he doesn't. Those are the two possibilities.
*  If he doesn't, then that's very, very exciting because he should be able to make a prediction
*  that deviates from the predictions of quantum mechanics. That would be testable and that would
*  be great. It will either work or it won't. But if he does get quantum mechanics exactly, then
*  to me, why not start with quantum mechanics? Why are you trying to guess some rules that will get
*  you to quantum mechanics? It would be fun to discover some even more primitive rules
*  that get you to quantum mechanics, but my project is much more interested in getting from quantum
*  mechanics to the observable world. To get from almost nothing to quantum mechanics is fun and
*  interesting, but not the way that I am personally interested in pursuing physics. Not to say that
*  he shouldn't do it or other people shouldn't do it. It's just my personal view. Brad Malt says,
*  In 1968, track and field star Bob Beeman broke the world record for a long jump by almost two
*  feet. This is a margin so big that it was named one of the five greatest sports moments in the
*  20th century by Sports Illustrated and remains an Olympic record over 50 years later. Do you think
*  this amazing jump could have been an instance of the wave function collapsing to a very unlikely
*  event, the sports equivalent to putting one's fist through a solid table? Before you say this is too
*  unlikely to expect it to have happened, consider that the relevant universe of events may not
*  only be long jumps in the Summer Olympics, but something much larger like all athletic events
*  in the Summer Olympics or all athletic events in the history of the universe or all muscle
*  contractions in the history of the universe. Okay, so I think, Brad, that this is a very typical
*  mistake, honestly, a mistaken way of reasoning. So you're saying that is it possible that this
*  particular unlikely event was caused by this other unlikely event? And you're saying, well,
*  on the one hand, sure, an individual case of this unlikely event is very unlikely, but on the other
*  hand, the number of times that we've done events is so large, right? So even an unlikely event is
*  bound to happen eventually. The clear mistake in that kind of reasoning is it depends on how
*  unlikely the unlikely event is. No matter how many, how large the space of all events is,
*  I can pick an unlikeliness so that none of those events are likely to happen. None of these unlikely
*  events are likely to be one of these examples. The obvious comparison is with the existence of
*  intelligent technological civilizations on other planets, right? There's a lot of planets in the
*  observable universe, some huge number of them. And so some people try to say, well, they must have
*  intelligent alien life on them because there's so many planets. Well, you don't know because you
*  don't know the probability of there being other planets, intelligent life on any other planet.
*  If the probability is 10 to the minus 100, then there's probably not intelligent life anywhere
*  else in our observable universe. Likewise, you can't just say there were a lot of athletic
*  events in the history of the universe or a lot of muscle contractions. You have to compare it
*  to the quantum probability of something really dramatic happening on this macroscopic scale.
*  So just to illustrate this, let's go through it. Let's go through this in our heads in real time.
*  Let's imagine, let's be somewhat generous. I don't know how to estimate the number of
*  muscle contractions in the history of the universe, but let's imagine the number of jumps
*  that have been done by human beings in the history of the universe. And again, let's overestimate it
*  so that we're safe, okay? So there's been about 100 billion human beings alive on Earth throughout
*  history, very roughly speaking. The details are not going to matter here, trust me. The specific
*  numbers are not going to matter here. So 100 billion, that's 10 to the power 11, okay,
*  human beings in the history of the universe. And let's say they jump once every three seconds.
*  Most human beings don't do that, but again, we're overestimating, okay?
*  So there are three times 10 to the seven seconds in a year. So if a human being jumps once every
*  three seconds, that is 10 to the seven jumps per year, per person. So if there are 10 to the,
*  that's right, yeah, but you live for 100 years. So for a person's lifetime, it's 10 to the nine
*  jumps per person's lifetime. And there's been 10 to the 11 people. So that's 10 to the 20.
*  That's how many jumps people have done in history. Now again, I don't know about you,
*  but I don't jump once every second, but still, we're overestimating, okay? So the true statement
*  is there are equal to or less than 10 to the 20 jumps being done in human history. That's a big
*  number, right? It sounds like a lot. Maybe one of them could have been a macroscopic quantum event,
*  a really, really, really unlikely, but you know, it happens once in a while. Okay. Clearly the
*  number of competition long jumps or competition jumps of any sort is way smaller than 10 to the
*  20, but still, let's stick with 10 to the 20. How likely is it that a macroscopic quantum
*  fluctuation was relevant to that jump? Well, the bad news is that roughly speaking, the
*  likelihood of a macroscopic quantum fluctuation is exponentially small in the number of particles
*  that you're talking about fluctuating. So this is not quite fair, but it paints a vivid picture here.
*  Let's say you need a gram of matter to fluctuate, right, in your muscle to make this relevant. You
*  probably need more than that, but let's imagine it's that much. So that's roughly speaking again,
*  very, very roughly, Avogadro's number of particles in a gram of matter. Avogadro's number, let's call
*  it 10 to the 23. It's more like six times 10 to the 23, but we're rounding here and we're rounding
*  down in this case. So 10 to the 23 particles need to be involved in this quantum fluctuation,
*  but that doesn't mean that the probability of the quantum fluctuation is 10 to the minus 23.
*  It means the probability of the quantum fluctuation is roughly 10 to the minus 10 to the 23.
*  Okay, that's why you don't see large quantum fluctuations in the world. That's why you say,
*  sure, I can bounce a ball off the wall, maybe it'll quantum tunnel through. It's unlikely to do it,
*  but the point is it's really unlikely to do it. So we're taking the large number 10 to the 20,
*  the total number of jumps done by human beings, times the likelihood, the probability that one
*  of them is a macroscopically important quantum fluctuation, but that probability is 10 to the
*  minus 10 to the 23. So the answer is 10 to the power 20 minus 10 to the 23. Okay, so it's a very,
*  very, very, very, very, very tiny number. That's why you can't just say things happen a lot,
*  therefore there should be big quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations are really unlikely.
*  And I know that for those of you who are experts in quantum mechanics, I'm doing a very, very sloppy
*  estimate for the likelihood of a quantum fluctuation. We haven't said what kind of
*  fluctuation it is, et cetera, et cetera, but the point stands. The probability of big quantum
*  fluctuations is really very tiny. Okay, Stephen Bernard says, you're invited to host a panel
*  discussion of the greatest physicists of all time, living or dead, language is no barrier,
*  but you're limited to three. Who would you pick? So I don't, yeah, I mean, part of me wants to say,
*  I don't care. I don't like these kinds of thought experiments because there's an implicit idea in
*  these thought experiments that there is some wisdom that these people have that I would like
*  access to. And I don't think that's true. I don't think that there is any intrinsic more intelligence
*  on the part of these dead people than there are on the part of currently living people.
*  And I can talk to the world's best physicists who are alive right now. I've had some of them on my
*  podcast. So, you know, what's the point? And the other thing besides intrinsic intelligence is,
*  of course, knowledge, but we have way more knowledge than those folks have. I've said it before,
*  and it's not bragging, but I know a lot more about general relativity than Einstein ever did.
*  That doesn't mean that I'm smarter than Einstein. He invented it, but we've made progress and he
*  died many decades ago. Einstein didn't know about black holes at all. He certainly didn't know about
*  singularity theorems or anything like that. He had a very fuzzy knowledge of gravitational waves,
*  of cosmology and other things. So Einstein doesn't have a lot to teach me about general relativity,
*  is the truth of it. Nevertheless, the reason why I did answer the question is because what you
*  might want is history. That's what you don't have history or biography or something like that. So
*  really what you're asking yourself is who are the people who are the persons who are the characters
*  you would have liked to learn something from about what was going on at that time. Given even given
*  that caveat, I really don't know what the answer is. Just so just to pick some people. I think
*  Galileo would be a good one. Like he led a colorful life and he you know, Galileo in many ways
*  really prefigured modern science. Like he had a way of thinking that was super duper ahead of his time
*  that I think is very interesting. So I would have liked to talk to him about that. I mean Aristotle
*  would be interesting because of lots of reasons, but maybe someone like Democritus or Epicurus
*  or Lucretius, one of the early atomists, just because we don't know a lot about what their
*  discussions were like back then, right? We don't know a lot of there's not a lot of writings that
*  survived so that would be interesting. And I guess the other one would be Ludwig Boltzmann
*  because you know, he wrestled with these deep questions about probability and the nature of
*  statistical mechanics. And sometimes he said things that were like brilliant and very far-seeing and
*  other times he missed things they thought were pretty obvious. So I would like to know you know
*  what his thought process was. But these are all history questions. I'm not expecting to learn
*  anything about physics or philosophy from these folks. Peter Benham says, I know you have a
*  distaste for it seems, but it seems logically obvious that it had to be possible at the big
*  bang for emergent phenomena of high complexity like life and consciousness to evolve, though it
*  would seem impossible that one would have conceived of such things by just looking around at the raw
*  materials. And yet here we are. What are potential higher order emergent phenomena that seem
*  impossible that we might be able to conceive of emerging eventually somewhere somehow?
*  Yeah, so I don't know. I don't know. You're right. I don't like this, it seems. Like the previous
*  question about the quantum fluctuations, you have to work things out. Like it's just not good enough
*  to say it seems possible. Like there's a probability of things happening and you have to sit down and do
*  it. That's why science is hard. That's why it's not just you know BSing around the coffee table.
*  So I don't know exactly what is meant in this case by phenomena of high complexity to evolve.
*  Presumably you mean that it was not possible for life to evolve near the moment of the big bang,
*  but that the possibility of life was inherent in the materials and laws that were there at the big
*  bang. It was possible that billions of years later things would evolve and do us. Yes, which I agree
*  with that. But anyway, with all that caveating out of the way, I'm not going to give you a good
*  answer to this question, but I can try to explain why it's hard to give a good reason.
*  The biggest reason why it's hard is because we don't have that many examples empirically of
*  complex information processing, higher order emergent phenomena. We have life here on Earth.
*  That's basically it. Which is not to say that's the only thing that could have happened, but
*  the only way that the interesting... If you're interested in sort of the level of complexity
*  that you would begin to characterize as alive or information processing or conscious, we only have
*  one example, roughly speaking. So it's very hard to draw grand conclusions. There is one reason to
*  be pessimistic that there are very different kinds of higher order emergent phenomena that
*  would have that level of complexity. Namely that the universe doesn't last forever.
*  There's a competition going on between the emergence of life and complexity and the heat death of the
*  universe. Being a conscious creature takes time. There are processes that go on in our brains that
*  take some amount of resources, and one of those resources is duration, is time. So it took, like
*  we said, billions of years to get from single celled organisms to us, and the universe is 14
*  billion years old since the Big Bang. So that's an appreciable fraction of the entire age of the
*  universe. And if you think about stars burning, lighting up the universe, the rate of star
*  formation, the universe already peaked in star formation. The number of stars forming in the
*  universe is on the decline now. Individual stars can last a long time. If they're smaller stars,
*  they can last a thousand billion years, or even longer than that. But they're very dim. The smaller
*  stars last longer but are dimmer, so they have less room. But also a factor of a thousand is nothing
*  in this game. So you can imagine kinds of higher order emergent phenomena on very different scales.
*  Like the galaxy becoming alive. Fred Hoyle wrote a science fiction book about a nebula coming alive.
*  You could imagine replacing the sort of energy source that for us is the sun with Hawking radiation
*  from a black hole, which is much thinner and cooler. But maybe if you increase the time scales
*  appropriately, something could happen. But you would have to increase the time scales by an
*  enormous amount. And the universe might just not last that long in a very realistic sense.
*  Like all the interesting stuff might die away and everything might fall into a big black hole and
*  evaporate away. And there's nothing outside the black hole to be fueled by the Hawking radiation.
*  So it actually is kind of tricky to get the time scales to work out to give you enough time to not
*  only have a thinking creature, but to evolve that thinking creature through the whole universe.
*  And therefore at the end of the day, it's at least conceivable that the other possible kinds of thinking
*  conscious creatures in the universe are more or less what we think of as organic life. They can be
*  very different than us literally here on earth. And you know, they might even use different DNA
*  base pairs and stuff like that. But I think the basic chemistry is going to be the same. I don't
*  think you're going to see living beings made out of photos of the universe. But I think the
*  living beings made out of photons or made out of interstellar gas or anything like that.
*  Again, could be wrong, but probably by the time, but for my lifetime, we're not going to discover
*  it. Let's put it that way. Krather Luca says, what exactly does it mean to be a moral constructivist?
*  Is it really different from being a moral realist? For example, people often object to moral realism
*  by stating that there can be no foundation for moral knowledge to be built up from. However,
*  when it comes to physics and mathematics, people are far more willing to accept we are exploring
*  some objective reality rather than merely constructing it. But in physics or mathematics,
*  there can be no foundation for knowledge either. We could be tricked by a demon, there's girdles
*  and completeness theorem, etc. If we can't justify our beliefs in areas like math and science more
*  than in morality, then can't we say that lacking a foundation is not an impediment to realism?
*  Because now there's a dichotomy between moral knowledge on the one hand and scientific and
*  mathematical knowledge on the other hand, even though they all lack a foundation.
*  Partly I wanted to read this question because it's a good advertisement for the podcast episode I
*  did on exactly this topic with Justin Clark Doane, who draws connections between the status of
*  objectivity and realism in morality and mathematics. I would distinguish, and I should say ahead of
*  time, I'm not a super expert at this either. I know a little bit, but this is not an area where
*  my own points of view are sufficiently knowledgeable that they have hardened into
*  convictions. I have feelings, but they're very willing to be changed if someone gives me a good
*  argument one way or the other. But what my feelings are is that science and math and morality are three
*  very different areas. They're not parallel to each other very much at all. In math, you start with
*  some axioms and then you prove theorems. Now even that is a contentious statement.
*  That's what follows from Gödel's theorem that there could be true statements that are not
*  derivable from a set of axioms in a formal system. But okay, let's put that aside. The point is that
*  I can have different mathematical systems, whether or not you're thinking of them axiomatically or
*  some other way. I can have Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry. I can have different
*  but equally consistent sets of axioms for set theory, etc. Whereas in physics or in science,
*  there's the world. There's the real world and there's one real world. Rhetoric of the multiverse,
*  etc. aside, count that all as one real world. There's one set of stuff doing something
*  that could have been otherwise. So unlike math, where you say, well, there's some foundational
*  principles, axioms are something equivalent to that, and different possible systems you can build
*  on that. There's different possible physical systems, but there's one real one, right? As I
*  said before, I'm not a modal realist. I think there really is something real about the individual
*  real world in which we live. Now, it's not foundational, right? I agree with you that we
*  could be being tricked by a demon or we could be Boltzmann brains or whatever. But science progresses
*  under the assumption, the hypothesis that that's not true, that there is some basic relationship
*  that is not too tricksy between our sensory data and the real world. It's not immediate. We can be
*  tricked. There are optical illusions and so forth, but we're not being tricked in some intentional
*  way by an evil demon or something like that. And therefore, we can start with our sense data and
*  build up a picture of the real world. We just have to assume that we're not being intentionally
*  misled along the way. But it's a very different thing than math. In math, we imagine different
*  possible mathematical structures, and they're all very conceivable. In science, there's many
*  different possible worlds, but only one of them is real. In morality, it's completely different.
*  Morality, neither one of those is true. It's not that you have axioms and you prove theorems,
*  and that's it. Nor is it true that there's one right system and you're looking for it.
*  That's the essence of being a constructivist. Morality to a constructivist is a way of taking
*  our built-in moral impulses, let's say, which I say built in, but don't let that mislead you.
*  It could be that they're in part instinctive, but it also could be in part that you learn them growing
*  up and they change over time, etc. But we all have moral impulses. We all have things that we
*  think of as right or wrong. And to a moral constructivist, what you think of as morality
*  is just a systematization and a rationalizing of those moral impulses into a set of beliefs,
*  which we call morality. And different people might have different impulses. So unlike physics,
*  where there's only one real world, different people might be very respectably and correctly
*  led to different moral conclusions. And then the moral constructivist says, talk it out.
*  Sit down, talk to each other, try to persuade each other, because the whole point is that our
*  sort of starting point moral impulses are not coherent. They don't necessarily fit together.
*  They're not even necessarily compatible with each other. We need to think about them. We might
*  realize that, oh, let's downgrade this one. Let's upgrade this one. Let's invent this new one.
*  It's constantly a set of flux. And so there's not only no foundation, there's not even any
*  reason to agree between different people for moral constructivists. That doesn't mean that I
*  need to believe and accept what other people think is morality. That's the difference between
*  constructivism and relativism. I can say, I think I'm right and you're wrong, but I don't think I'm
*  objectively right. I think that I'm right and I'm going to try to convince you that I'm right. But
*  there's no way that I can say you're making a logical mistake if I don't convince you of that.
*  Whereas in math, I can say that you've made a mistake proving your theorem. And in physics,
*  I can say your theory about how the world works is wrong because of this experiment.
*  There's no such thing that we have access to in morality.
*  Okay, I'm going to group two questions together because they're about photons and massless
*  particles. Alexander Cordova says, how is it that massless particles like photons can have a non-zero
*  momentum? I've worked through a special relativity chapter of an undergrad physics textbook,
*  and there's an equation E squared equals MC squared squared plus PC squared. That is to say,
*  energy squared, that sets the speed of light equal to one. So then energy squared is mass squared plus
*  momentum squared. And then the same textbook, he says, also gives the following equation for
*  relativistic momentum. P equals MV divided by the square root of one minus V squared. And he says,
*  no matter how I rearrange these equations or try to plug in various equivalent values, if I plug
*  in a rest mass of zero, I get a momentum also equaling zero. So and the other question, I'm
*  sorry, I'm not grouping together another question, I'm mentioning an answer. So Thomas Prunty gives
*  an answer that is half correct and half I disagree with. So let me say it. So what Thomas says is,
*  if you put V equals C and M equals zero into the relativistic expression, you get zero divided by
*  zero. So in other words, it's undefined. So Alexander got a misleading answer that the momentum must be
*  zero by first plugging in mass equals zero, and then getting that the answer was zero, but not at
*  the same time plugging in the velocity was equal to the speed of light. If you do both of those at
*  the same time, you get zero divided by zero, it's undefined. And I think the right way of saying that
*  is that that equation momentum is MV divided by the square root of one minus V squared, just doesn't
*  apply to massless particles. That's supposed to be an equation that only applies when the mass is
*  not zero. The other equation E squared is M squared plus P squared always applies. That one is always
*  true for any kind of particle. But then Thomas goes to ruin it by saying a photon is a quantum
*  mechanical object. And so you don't need quantum, so you do need quantum mechanics to get its
*  momentum. Relativity doesn't have an opinion on the matter that I have to take issue with, because
*  even though it's true that photons are quantum mechanical objects, relativity certainly does
*  have an opinion on the matter. Within relativity, you're certainly welcome to talk about particles
*  that move at the speed of light, massless particles, particles with zero mass.
*  In relativity is where you get the answer that particles that have zero mass will move at the
*  speed of light, and their energy will be equal to their momentum squared. Sorry, the energy squared
*  is the momentum squared. So E equals P is the relationship between energy and momentum for
*  massless particles. And that's a perfectly classical statement. There's no obstacle in
*  principle to talk about classical massless particles in relativity. It so happens that
*  the real world and therefore photons are quantum mechanical, but relativity would work perfectly
*  well anyway. Okay, Tom Quine gives us a priority question. You wrote in From Eternity to Here that
*  entropy quite literally makes life possible. I have an inkling that entropy is a motor of evolution,
*  the driving force that requires things to either persist or to perish. Can you make a hypothetical
*  argument for why this might be true and a parallel argument for why it might be the wrong way to look
*  at things? No, I can only give you an argument for why it's true, because it is true. But we need to
*  be careful about the sense in which it is true. Okay, the statement that entropy quite literally
*  makes life possible can be justified by saying the following thing. What if there were no
*  increasing entropy in the universe? What if the universe was just in equilibrium? What if the
*  universe didn't have an entropy going up at all? Then nothing would happen in equilibrium. Like if
*  you have a gas in a box and it's all in one corner and it's low entropy and then you let it go and
*  it fills the box, it reaches equilibrium and then it stops evolving. Life is a process, as we already
*  said, right? Life requires dissipation into the universe. And dissipation means increasing the
*  entropy of things around it. Life is time-directed. Life is not like a pendulum going back and forth.
*  Life remembers the past and doesn't remember the future and so forth. So to do all that stuff that
*  life does, entropy does make it possible, but the particular aspect of entropy that makes it possible
*  is that it is possible for entropy to increase. If you are at thermal equilibrium where entropy
*  could not increase, then life could not exist because you wouldn't have any of that rich set
*  of irreversible processes going on. Having said that, you can oversell the case when you say
*  entropy is the motor of evolution. Yeah, I would say that entropy is a necessary condition for
*  evolution. That doesn't quite mean the same thing as it's the motor of it. After all, there's plenty
*  of cases where entropy increases without evolution going on, right? Without life existing at all.
*  Life is a particular kind of complicated thing that requires not only entropy to increase but
*  other things as well. Hang in there for an upcoming podcast where we'll talk about entropy in the
*  arrow of time in interesting ways. Douglas Albrecht says,
*  infinity and infinitesimals seem to create challenges in physics and it seems that they
*  require what seem like workarounds. Energies at infinitely small distances require cutoffs,
*  cosmology seems to blow up the beginning of time, etc. Quantizing space-time also seems to be another
*  way of dealing with this. So I wonder if maybe it's the math that needs evolution to deal with
*  limits or we are just not equipped to deal with these extreme points. So I don't think it's the
*  math's fault. Maybe it is. It's certainly a possible idea. So think about the infinities of
*  quantum field theory. If the general problem we're facing here is there are infinite or undefined
*  quantities in physics and we need better math to understand them, the infinities in quantum
*  field theory are an example where in some sense better math came along and helped us understand
*  what was going on. Feynman, Schwinger, Tomonaga, Dyson, those people showed us how to renormalize
*  quantum field theory, which is basically a fancy-pants way of saying take a limit
*  where you have some function and you're just trying you can't evaluate it at a point but you
*  can take a limit as it gets closer and closer to that point and find the same answer. So they
*  figured out a way to do that in the case of quantum field theory by using some fancy math.
*  On the other hand, we now know that there's an even better way of thinking about the infinities
*  of quantum field theory, which is the Wilsonian way. Ken Wilson showed that if you just take
*  seriously the fact that you don't know what's happening at very, very high energies, very,
*  very short distances, you can still do quantum field theory. You can do effective quantum field
*  theory. And honestly, all of these infinities came about because you were just taking infinite
*  energies and zero wavelengths too seriously. What right did you have to do that? You know,
*  probably space-time itself could potentially break down at those points. So Wilson said that
*  the existence of the infinities in the first place was a mistake. And so in some sense, you didn't
*  need fancier math to deal with them. And I think that that's more along my guess as to how things
*  are going to go. That it's not that you're going to need fancier math to deal with all these things,
*  it's that you're going to realize that the underlying physics is a little bit simpler
*  or a little bit less dramatic than it seemed to be. But of course, there's different situations
*  here. We'll have to see how it goes. Okay, and when a group three questions together about black
*  holes and information, about unitarity, Matt Hickman says, from my understanding, one of the
*  guiding principles used to think about black hole information is that information is not destroyed
*  in quantum mechanics. If I were a believer in the Copenhagen interpretation, I might say that
*  information is destroyed all the time. A wave function happily evolves according to the Schrodinger
*  equation, and then you measure it and information is gone. Umberto Nani says, may you please comment
*  on what is lost if unitarity is lost, like which parts of the current theories would be affected?
*  And Rich Hogg says, Hawking radiation is usually described as emerging in a specific thermally
*  randomized configuration. But under the many worlds interpretation, wouldn't we more correctly think
*  of it as merging into a superposition of all possible configurations, which then decohere
*  into specific configurations in separate branches? So all of these, so let me come comment on
*  Humberto's question first, because I want to just define what's going on. The question is what is
*  lost if unitarity is lost. So unitarity is just the fancy physicist term for obeying the Schrodinger
*  equation, roughly speaking. Okay, if you think about what the Schrodinger equation tells you,
*  if you have some wave function, some quantum state, the Schrodinger equation is deterministic.
*  It evolves one wave function given some Hamiltonian, aka some laws of physics,
*  it evolves the wave function over time in a perfectly predictable way. And famously or
*  infamously in quantum mechanics, that's half the story. The other half of the story is what happens
*  when you measure a quantum mechanical system, and then it's not unitary, the wave function collapses
*  and it's unpredictable, it's not deterministic. So if, so when we talk about unitarity being
*  important in physics, it is implicit that we're talking about the part of evolution where we're
*  not measuring it. Okay, so whenever physicists worry about the black hole information loss problem,
*  they go, ah, unitarity, blah, blah, blah. They all know that unitary is violated when you make a
*  measurement. But they're just not saying that because they're talking about a system as a
*  black hole is out there just doing its thing. It's not being measured. That's that's the implicit
*  idea. Now, I'm not sure if that's okay. You know, I think that physicists, because they don't fret
*  about the foundations of quantum mechanics, tend to be sloppy about these issues. And they
*  sometimes will say, oh, you must be unitary. And other times you will say, well, of course,
*  you're not unitary when you measure, etc. And they don't tell you exactly what is meant by
*  a measurement, etc, etc, etc. So I think we should worry about that a little bit. To directly answer
*  Humberto's question, if the fundamental laws were not unitary, so if Schrodinger's equation was not
*  correct, right, that's different. That's a much more radical thing than saying that when you measure,
*  it's not unitary, because we all know from things like many worlds interpretation, that you can have
*  a theory that is overall perfectly unitary, and yet effectively within observable branches, it looks
*  non-unitary. So if you had really fundamental laws of physics that were not unitary, well, then that
*  would depend. It would depend on how you didn't have unitarity. It could go very wrong very, very
*  quickly. There were papers years ago that said, you know, like energy conservation could be
*  dramatically violated if you violated unitarity. All of the tests we've done on precision electric
*  weak measurements and things like that in particle physics could be very, very wrong.
*  But then there are other ways you could be non-unitary that are okay, like there are theories,
*  like objective collapse theories of quantum mechanics, Penrose, GRW, etc., which do violate
*  unitarity in that sense. So it depends. There's only one way to be unitary. There's an infinite
*  number of ways to be non-unitary. So it depends, is the answer. Now to Matt's question, you know,
*  what about the fact that information is destroyed all the time? And to Rich's question, you know,
*  in many worlds, you evolve into all possible configurations and then decohere. Yes, the implicit
*  ideas in both of your questions are correct, but I think you need to be careful here. And in fact,
*  I am sufficiently convinced you need to be careful that I wrote a paper about it.
*  So I wrote a paper, well, I co-authored a paper called Black Hole. What was the name of my paper?
*  Um, branches of the wave function need not contain black hole firewalls, something like that.
*  Our idea was the following, that the firewall argument was a popular thing that people were
*  thinking about over the last 10 years. It said that you can't simultaneously have the entanglement of
*  particles, virtual particles escaping from black holes and falling in near the event
*  horizon causing Hawking radiation and get all the information out of a black hole. And therefore,
*  they suggested breaking the entanglement near the horizon, which gives rise to a firewall.
*  And what we suggested in my paper, and this, I hope I get all the authors here, because I was
*  working with a whole bunch of grad students on a whole bunch of different papers at the time. This
*  is with Grant Remen, Ning Bao and Aidan Chatwin Davis, I'm pretty sure. I should really look that
*  up. I want to look that up as I'm talking here. But our point was, look, when you say the two
*  things are entangled with each other, two quantum mechanical systems, that statement depends on
*  where you are in the wave function of the universe. That is to say on what branch you're in, in the
*  wave function of the universe. Oh yes, and Jason Pollock, I knew I was forgetting Jason's name. So
*  the name of the paper is branches of the black hole wave function need not contain firewalls.
*  So let's say you have two particles. Let's say they are entangled with each other. Alice and Bob
*  have their two spins. You have two particles and they're entangled. And then you measure one of
*  them. You're Alice, you measure your particle, you see it spin up, and now you know the other
*  particle has spin down. What does a many worlds person say? A many worlds person says, well,
*  now there's a branch where Alice's particles spin up, Bob's spin down, and another branch where the
*  opposite is true. But on both of those branches, Alice's particle and Bob's particle are no longer
*  entangled. They are entangled in the wave function of the universe, because they were before and you
*  didn't stop that, but on the individual branches, they're not. So that's the point that we tried
*  to make. And actually other people have made related points before. But the point is that
*  if you don't take seriously the measurement process and decoherence and many worlds,
*  then you can be sloppy about what needs to be entangled with what. Because two subsystems can
*  be entangled in the wave function of the universe, even though they're not entangled on the branch
*  where you're measuring it. And so we tried to make the argument there were more than enough degrees
*  of freedom in the black hole, that on every branch of the wave function, you could see the
*  particles near the horizon be entangled and therefore have no firewall, even though in the
*  wave function as a whole, there was enough entanglement between the Hawking radiation
*  at early times and late times to restore unitarity. Anyway, that's probably not making any sense if
*  you haven't read the paper. But the point is, I'm agreeing with the general philosophy of these two
*  questions that when it comes to careful questions about black hole information being lost, it might
*  pay to be a little bit more precise about what you mean about measurement and unitarity and
*  decoherence and all of those things. Demon hat says, Would you rather have legs as long as your
*  fingers or fingers as long as your legs fully functioning and why? I think it's I think I got
*  to go with the fingers as long as your legs, right? Long fingers sounds better than short legs. But
*  the other thing I want to say about this question is, you know, if we do imagine different alien
*  life forms, I think that we tend to be a little bit less imaginative than we should be about how
*  different they could be than us. You know, if you just had fingers as long as your legs for some
*  reason that evolution gave them to you, I can imagine you think of those as perfectly sensible,
*  logical, like, you know, you're just natural, like, you don't go, Oh, man, I wish that my fingers were
*  shorter. But I don't know what they're going to be like, you know, especially just with basic things
*  like size, you know, aliens that we see in movies are normally human size, maybe a little bit bigger,
*  a little bit smaller, whatever, but we rarely see intelligent, technologically advanced aliens
*  that are one millimeter in size or 100 meters in size or 1000 meters in size, right? I think we
*  should be more open minded about what these possibilities are. I said earlier in the AMA,
*  intelligent aliens made out of photons or something like that might be implausible.
*  But we could imagine very, very different sizes and shapes than we actually see.
*  Paul Hess says, What is your method to choose which papers to read out of the near infinite deluge?
*  Do you have several passes where you're where you first skim many papers, then from that set,
*  choose a smaller subset to read more closely? Or do you read papers that others are talking about
*  in your circles? These days, it's more the latter. But you know, it's a complicated thing. And it's
*  going to depend on how you know, the style of your research that you're doing at any one time.
*  It used to be like I really did try to keep up on all the papers that came out in theoretical
*  cosmology and particle physics, at least to the extent of looking at their titles and abstracts.
*  There is a morning mailing that you can get in the email or you can check online from the
*  archive that tells you in your specific subfields of physics, what are the recent papers.
*  But you know, my own research has gone away from that. So I used to just do sort of the former
*  option that you list, which is look at all the papers, the ones that looked interesting enough
*  that they'd be relevant to my research, I would print out and then hopefully read at some point.
*  These days, I'm thinking about more long term things, you know, I'm not chasing ambulances.
*  And the number of people working on the same questions as I am is relatively small. And those
*  papers appear, they're relatively sparse on the archive, etc. So I more rely on people I know and
*  other papers I read to point me to things that are relevant. You know, this is why I tell my students
*  when you write papers, it's good to reference other people's papers. It's actually not only is
*  it, you know, ethically the right thing to do to put a lot of citations in your papers,
*  but it makes them more discoverable, right? Like sometimes a great way to find papers that are
*  relevant to a particular question is to go to a, you know, there's different services on the
*  internet, like Inspire is one for particle physics, where you not only can see what papers are cited by
*  a certain paper, but you can see what papers cite a certain paper. So if you discover a paper is
*  really important to you, then you can see who else has been writing about that toward the future of
*  when that paper was published. So that is extremely helpful. And therefore, by putting more citations
*  in your paper, you make your paper more discoverable to more people, which is always a good thing.
*  Sam Cox says, I wonder if the missing antimatter problem, the bariogenesis problem,
*  is somehow connected to the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. Perhaps the missing
*  antimatter was sponged up by or morphed into dark matter at an earlier moment in the Big Bang. Is
*  it reasonable to expect there exists dark antimatter? Actually, I forgot, I'm going to group this with
*  another question. Andrew Vernon Smith says, can you explain whether or not it's possible that the
*  weak force may have been involved somehow in bringing about the universe, including time and
*  space via the Big Bang or otherwise? And if so, whether it's possible that the right-handed matter
*  and left-handed antimatter may have proceeded backward in time, since only left-handed matter
*  and right-handed antimatter interact with the weak force and are forward in time reality?
*  The connection between these two questions is matter and antimatter somehow being connected
*  with bigger cosmological questions. There was a paper that was written about a scenario similar
*  to what Andrew was talking about by Latham, Boyle, Kieran Finn, and Neil Turok a couple years ago
*  about a CPT symmetric universe where they suggested that, in a way, morally similar to what
*  Jennifer Chan and I suggested years ago, and Anthony Aguirre, former Mindscape guest, and Stephen
*  Gratton suggested around the same time, a back-to-back universe where there was sort of a throat or a
*  middle point and then one part of the universe goes forward in time and the other goes in the
*  opposite direction. Of course, both sides of the universe have people in them that call the direction
*  toward the throat the past, right? So it's a two-sided time kind of scenario. The spin that Boyle
*  and Finn and Turok put on it was exactly this kind of idea that there is a violation not only of time
*  symmetry between the two halves but CPT symmetry, which relates matter and antimatter and also
*  right-handedness and left-handedness. So roughly speaking, sort of more matter on one side, more
*  antimatter on the other side. I haven't looked into that scenario very carefully, but you're welcome
*  to look it up. Just google CPT symmetric universe and you will find it. Relating that to Sam's question,
*  perhaps the missing antimatter was sponged up into dark matter in early moment of the Big Bang.
*  There are scenarios like that also. So especially here is something that you can think about.
*  The total amount of dark matter in our universe is around five times by mass as much ordinary
*  matter in the universe. That's a small number. Five is not a very big number. In principle,
*  these two numbers are completely unconnected. The usual ways that we have of predicting the
*  amount of dark matter and the amount of ordinary matter are just completely unrelated to each other.
*  So why are they so close in density? A factor of five? Well, maybe the theory goes the dark
*  matter particle is, and this is one version of the theory, there's other versions of it, but one
*  version is maybe for every proton in the universe there is one dark matter particle that weighs five
*  times as much of a proton, right? And so maybe there's some process that takes baryon number
*  and splits it so that positive baryon number goes into ordinary matter, negative baryon number goes
*  into antimatter in some sense, and that's why there's more dark matter. Did I say antimatter?
*  Negative baryon number goes into dark matter is what I meant to say. Maybe that's why there's
*  five times as much dark matter as ordinary matter. Those kind of scenarios don't sort of
*  easily fit together. In theoretical physics, what you get to realize is that some theories,
*  some models, some frameworks that you propose, once you propose them, everything just fits and
*  just works and everything is great. Others, you kind of have to struggle to make them work a little
*  bit, and this is more of the latter, but that's not to say that we just haven't thought of the
*  right way to do it. Finally, you say is it reasonable to expect there exists dark antimatter?
*  Yeah, it's perfectly reasonable. We don't know for sure one way or another, but if you think of all
*  the different ways to have a relic abundance of dark matter, most of them predict that there is
*  an equal amount of dark matter and dark antimatter or that there's no difference. So, you know,
*  like photons, for example, don't have anti-particles. They interact with each other. They can be created
*  or destroyed, but they're bosons, so you can't really distinguish. Photons are neutral bosons,
*  right? So there's not a real difference between a photon and an anti-photon. That's why you don't
*  talk about it. If the dark matter is a neutral boson, like the axion, for example, then there
*  wouldn't be dark antimatter because there's just no such thing as an anti-axion. On the other hand,
*  if the dark matter is a fermion, which many WIMP models are, weakly interacting massive particles,
*  then the theory is that at some point, you know, the dark matter and the dark antimatter were just
*  annihilating with each other in the early universe when it was very dense, but they are only
*  interacting weakly with each other. So when the density goes low enough, they just don't find
*  each other. It becomes rare for a dark particle and a dark anti-particle to bump into each other.
*  There's no long-range force between them like electromagnetism. There's only very, very short
*  range weak nuclear force. So the two particles have to come very, very close together to actually
*  annihilate. And that is the standard picture of weakly interacting dark matter. So in the WIMP
*  model, you expect there to be half dark matter, half dark antimatter, or versions where once again,
*  there's no difference between matter and antimatter in that sector, which is why you can still hope
*  that in regions where you expect the density of dark matter to be very high, like at the center
*  of a galaxy, maybe you still see some dark matter and dark antimatter annihilating into gamma rays,
*  and you can detect it that way. That was a big hope for the Fermi Space Telescope to look for
*  gamma rays from dark matter. The sad news about the Fermi Space Telescope is they found a lot of
*  gamma rays, but it's really easy to make gamma rays, even if they have nothing to do with dark
*  matter. So maybe some of them are due to dark matter, but we just don't know. So far, we've
*  been able to find less exotic explanations for all the gamma rays that we were able to observe.
*  Okay, Tony B says, this question is inspired by the recent movie Tenet, which engages with ideas
*  on the entropic arrow of time more than many. You've spoken many times about how we remember
*  the past because in that direction, our extrapolations are pinned down by the low
*  entropy boundary condition of the beginning of the universe. If the low entropy boundary condition
*  were in the other direction, we would remember in that direction the same way. Do you have any
*  intuition as to what kinds of events could happen at the boundary between two regions of a universe,
*  one region having a low entropy boundary condition in one direction, and the other having a low
*  entropy boundary condition in the other? No, I don't. I can give you a feeling for why it would
*  be weird, but I don't have a well thought out model for exactly what things would be like.
*  It would be weird because things would seem to you to start acting in ways that were anti-entropic,
*  that were sort of, despite your best efforts, lowering the entropy of the universe, which is
*  just a weird thing, right? Packs of cards spontaneously organizing themselves into
*  order two, three, four, five, six, etc. Cream and coffee unmixing, glasses unbreaking, things like
*  that. Craig Callender, who is a philosopher of physics who thinks about these things,
*  gave you a thought experiment, wrote down a thought experiment where it's like there's a
*  prediction. A low entropy boundary condition is precisely a precognition event where you know
*  what's going to happen in the future and you can't stop it. So the example he gave was someone tells
*  you that on a certain date, all the world's Faberge eggs are going to assemble themselves into a
*  certain drawer in a certain room. And you say, well, no, I'm going to stop it, right? I'm going
*  to put up guards and prevent it from happening. But all sorts of crazy things start going wrong.
*  The guards are sick and someone drops the egg and it gets mistaken for something else. And
*  eventually they end up there, right in that drawer. And you're like, how in the world is this happening?
*  And it would seem spooky and magical. It would seem like some intelligent force is working against
*  you. Now, that's not the whole story. Because if you were truly at the boundary, then there's one
*  of two possibilities. Either there could be living beings. Remember I said before, living beings
*  require that entropy is increasing, right? They dissipate. So either there'd be two types of living
*  beings which dissipated in opposite directions, which would be very weird, or more likely it would
*  just be impossible for there to be any living beings at all near that boundary. But again,
*  I don't think anyone has really worked out the details of what that would be like.
*  Jeff Babon says, I'm trying to understand how much of the twin paradox is due to the fact that one
*  twin accelerates while the other doesn't. If I have a circular track one light-year-in radius,
*  and I'm traveling around the track near the speed of light, I will feel a centripetal acceleration.
*  If this track is next to Earth, then as I pass it, my twin brother and I will synchronize our watches.
*  By the time I come around again, I think I will have aged more slowly to my twin, even though we've
*  both been feeling acceleration, approximately 1g the entire time. If that's true, what makes my frame
*  of reference special? Is it because only I have moved relative to the universe as a whole?
*  So no, it is not because you've moved relative to the universe as a whole.
*  And I've said this before, but I'll try to say it again. I would just forget about words like frames
*  of reference, right, or acceleration, or any of these things. None of this is the point.
*  The time dilation in special relativity is exactly the same as saying that if I have two paths between
*  two points in space, those two paths can be different lengths. That's it. That's all that
*  there is to it. If I put two dots on a piece of paper and ask two people to connect them with a
*  curve, one of those curves is going to be shorter than the other. And if one curve is as short as
*  possible, it will be a perfectly straight line. Any non-straight line will be longer, right?
*  And that's exactly the same thing that happens with the twin paradox, except in time,
*  rather than in space, any non-straight line is shorter in time, experiences less time.
*  So it's not that it has to do with acceleration. The point of the twin paradox is not acceleration.
*  The point is the length of your trajectory in space-time. Of course, the rule is that the
*  longest duration path has no acceleration. So therefore, if you do accelerate, then you're
*  going to experience less time. So that's where acceleration comes in. But it's not because it's
*  primary. It's not because the acceleration is causing the aging in any sense. So Tim Maudlin,
*  actually, we mentioned books about philosophy of science. So Tim Maudlin, in one of his philosophy
*  of science books, has a very good illustration of this point. Think about the usual twin paradox
*  setup where one person just stays home, forget about the acceleration you feel on Earth. That's
*  a complication that we don't need to worry about. One zooms out on a rocket ship and then accelerates
*  and zooms back. So there's sort of a triangle that you draw in space-time in your mind between
*  the long edge being the stationary twin and then the two shorter edges with a bend in between
*  being the twin that goes out on the rocket. So you might think that it's the acceleration at that
*  turnaround point that is doing the work. But Tim says, well, imagine the same amount of acceleration
*  but along a different path. Namely, the first path was accelerate a lot outward, but then coast,
*  and then turn around. So you accelerate again and then coast, and then accelerate finally to land
*  at the same point you started with. So three bouts of acceleration. Just put those three bouts of
*  acceleration much closer to each other. So accelerate out, immediately accelerate back,
*  and then accelerate to stop. So you get a much tinier triangle and then you just sit there along
*  the same path. In this case, you've done the same amount of acceleration as the first thought
*  version of the experiment where you went way out and came way back. You just did it all quicker.
*  You didn't have the long coasting periods in between. But the difference in time
*  experienced by the two twins is much smaller in that second example because the length of the path
*  is much closer than much closer to the original stationary twin. So the acceleration allows you
*  to have a different length path through space-time, but it's not the point. It's not the causing
*  of the difference in time duration. It's the length of the path that is the cause of the time
*  duration being different. Okay, Jeff B says, you stated that you are against the idea of teleology
*  underlying physics. However, it seems as if this would be difficult to judge. After all, the laws
*  of physics may be progressing towards some final teleological state, but the path that it takes is
*  simply too complex for us to notice or understand. In fact, this seems logical based on the fact that
*  matter tends toward the lowest energy state. This is reminiscent of the ancient notion of elements
*  wanting to rise or fall. What do you make of this? So I'm not against teleology underlying physics.
*  I just don't think it's there. The laws of physics as we currently understand them have no teleology
*  in them. And there is no problem that we are faced with under current knowledge of the physical
*  world that is solved by teleology. So I just think it was an old idea that we can get rid of.
*  You mentioned the idea that matter tends towards the lowest energy state, but of course that's not
*  true because energy is conserved, right? At least to the classical limit, right? What you mean when
*  you say matter tends toward the lowest energy state is that if you have a dissipation full system,
*  if you have a system with friction, then the system will in fact go to the lowest energy state.
*  But what it's doing is increasing the entropy of the universe. And that is not because there is
*  some future high entropy boundary condition. It's because high entropy is natural. So the thing is
*  that ordinary dissipation full systems tumbling down to their lowest energy state doesn't require
*  any future condition at all. It's just the natural thing to expect to happen just as entropy is
*  increasing is natural. So there's no reason for teleology and there's no evidence for it. That's
*  why I don't think it's an interesting thing to think about. That's not to say that I would mind
*  if we got new information that changed our minds. George says, are you concerned about carbon
*  emissions? We've begun using electric car transportation. Battery manufacturing, though,
*  is very carbon intensive and the subsequent battery recycling or disposal will create a
*  nightmare 20 years from now. And there's more details in there. So roughly speaking, yes,
*  I'm concerned about carbon emission. But you know, you can't the various arguments you put forward
*  in the question are all words. And that's not enough. You know, just exactly as I said with
*  other questions earlier, sometimes you got to do the math. So on the one hand, burning fossil fuels
*  emits carbon, fossil fuel, greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. On the other hand, various parts
*  of the electric vehicle cycle also emit greenhouse gases into the air. But you can't just say, well,
*  they both are bad, therefore they're equal. You got to measure it. You got to actually do the
*  calculation. So people have done the calculation counting not only the power that goes to actually
*  charge the batteries of the electric car, but also the mining and the manufacturing process and the
*  waste process and so forth. And roughly speaking, to the best of my understanding, the answer is
*  that an electric car gives off about one third of the carbon emissions of an equivalent internal
*  combustion engine car. So it's way less, roughly speaking. So it's a kick in the right direction.
*  It'll be much better if we can actually get that electricity from solar power or something like
*  that rather than burning coal for it. But my actual answer to the question is you have to do
*  the math. And so far, the math that's been done indicates electric vehicles are much better
*  for the planet than fossil fuel burning vehicles are. Chris says, most of your discussions of
*  philosophy that I've heard seem to be within a Western framework. What are your thoughts on
*  others such as Eastern philosophy? This relates to the topic of meta philosophy. Do you have any
*  easily summarizable views on that? I don't think I have any easily summarizable views on that.
*  My view about philosophy is I care about what's right and wrong. I'm interested in the history
*  of philosophy to the extent that it's cool and interesting, but to the practical extent of trying
*  to understand the world, I don't care whether a good idea comes from Eastern or Western or whatever.
*  Typically, the best ideas are relatively recent, not because recent people are smarter, but because
*  they're building on ideas from a long time ago. So when I'm thinking about what happened at the
*  Big Bang or the quantum measurement problem, there's no difference in my mind between Eastern
*  and Western philosophy. Wherever the good idea comes from, I care about. Having said that,
*  of course you're right that when I've been discussing philosophy, my touchstones are
*  Western philosophy. That's what I'm trained in to the extent that I'm trained at all.
*  So that's my bag of tricks, the knowledge base that I'm working from, not from any conscious
*  disparagement of Eastern philosophy. So clearly what I should do is have a podcast episode about
*  Eastern philosophy. Hmm. Let's see if that happens soon. Stay tuned for that. Okay. Two more questions
*  I'm grouping together. Sandro Stuckey says, in the podcast with Elizabeth Strachalski,
*  there's a C in her name that doesn't get pronounced, Strachalski, the idea that cells
*  are information processors and climb entropy gradients came up again. How is the idea that
*  physical biological computational systems process information and make choices or use strategies
*  to optimize certain outcomes compatible with the purely deterministic evolution of the universe?
*  In what sense can an organism or self-replicating piece of chemistry influence its future? That kind
*  of presupposes that there were alternative futures to begin with. That information about the
*  environment can truly be exploited. Then the other question, somewhat related, is from Jason who says,
*  you've said before in answering questions about free will versus determinism that as a
*  compatibilist, you find the interesting question to be about how to operationalize that. So how do you
*  operationalize that? When does it make sense to treat people as if they have free will and when
*  does it not? So the point is, so I can't give a very good answer to Jason's question. I think it's
*  a hard question, a good question. It requires more work and I'm not an expert, but I'll talk about it
*  a little bit. To Sandro's question, I can be a little bit more specific. The question, in what
*  sense can an organism or self-replicating piece of chemistry influence its future? This presupposes
*  there are alternative futures to begin with. Well, there are alternative futures as far as
*  the person knows or as a self-replicating piece of chemistry knows. I think if I'm a person
*  or a bacterium or whatever, in this day and age, I happen to know that I'm made of particles or a
*  quantum wave function and there are some laws of physics underlying it. But what if I didn't know
*  that? That doesn't change my everyday life very much. If I didn't know that, how would I act?
*  I don't know what's going to happen in the future and you can say yes, but Laplace's demon knows.
*  I'm not Laplace's demon. I'm not friends with Laplace's demon. I can't get any information
*  from Laplace's demon about this. In every single sense that is relevant to me thinking about the
*  future, there are a whole bunch of possible alternative futures and my choices will help
*  bring them about. As I've said before in talking about free will, literally every human being
*  acts that way. There are no human beings that truly act like they don't make choices about the
*  future. There are people who, like certainly if you're leaving comments on Patreon, you're trying
*  to either learn something or influence something. You're trying to have a causal effect on the
*  future. That's why you're doing it. There's simply no coherent way to talk about human action
*  without involving the idea that we have a causal influence on the future due to the choices that
*  we make. That's the easy part of the question. What Jason is saying is okay, there are conditions
*  where we don't have a causal impact on the future. When you're asleep, when you're unconscious,
*  then you're not making any choices about the future. Maybe your brain is turning, but you're not
*  operationalizing it as you say. In other cases, if you have lost capacity somehow, if you've lost
*  mental capacity or even physical capacity, there's famous cases where you have a brain tumor.
*  Arguably when you're addicted to something, you just have no choice in some sense. Then the question
*  is how do you really draw the line between we should treat you as having had a choice and we
*  should treat you as not having had a choice? I think it's a good question. I think that there
*  are easy cases. There are easy edge cases. If you're asleep, you're not making choices.
*  If you're awake and competent and deciding what shirt to wear that day, you're making a choice.
*  There are fuzzy cases in between. I think that the lesson of that is that we should think hard
*  about what exactly should be done at that boundary where there are fuzzy cases. The lesson should not
*  be because the boundary is fuzzy, the boundary doesn't exist. Or because the boundary is fuzzy,
*  we should treat everything as if it's either deterministic or indeterministic. Sometimes you
*  got to live with the fuzziness. Sometimes you have to live with the idea that these human ideas,
*  these coarse-grained macroscopic emergent phenomena are fuzzy. That's okay. There's many things that
*  are fuzzy. I think that right and wrong are fuzzy. I don't think that's an argument against taking it
*  seriously. Sorry for not giving you a once and for all answer, Jason, but I don't have a once and for
*  all answer, even though I'm convinced we should be looking for the best answers that we can invent.
*  Preston Justice says, you've been successful dabbling in philosophy. Therefore, is it logical
*  or realistic to assume that one could go counterclockwise and find their way into
*  contributing to the sciences without shutting up and calculating from the field of philosophy
*  of science, physics in the humanities department? Sure, it's absolutely possible, but it's work.
*  It's not easy. The word dabbling is the wrong word to use. You have to do the work. In particular,
*  you have to take seriously both the knowledge base and the expertise of people who already
*  do this thing. That work is less visible if you're moving from science to philosophy,
*  because if you want to become knowledgeable about what's going on in philosophy, you read
*  or you talk to people. Whereas if you want to become knowledgeable about what's going on in
*  science, you might need to have a laboratory or something like that. This can happen. We had an
*  example not that long ago, and Sophie Barvich, who talked about the philosophy of smell, is trained
*  as a philosopher and now she has a lab where she studies the sense of smell in the lab. You can
*  absolutely do that. There's other people who think about consciousness, et cetera, who are
*  philosophically trained and then move into directly experimental science. For physics,
*  yeah, sure. For people who are philosophers of physics with a good background in physics,
*  many of them do things that are just indistinguishable from doing physics. You
*  could even imagine falling in love with a particular physics problem that had no more
*  connection with philosophy. But again, you just have to have respect for the existing knowledge
*  base in those fields. Then you can do whatever you want. That would be my attitude. David Wright says,
*  the latest podcast with Elizabeth Strachowski on synthetic cells was fascinating and touched on
*  some of the same exciting questions about the boundary between physics, chemistry, and biology
*  that Michael Levin is dealing with in his work on morphogenesis at Tufts. You ended up discussing
*  whether living systems actually require a cell membrane and if it was possible, there was a more
*  general synthetic form of biological systems. This reminded me of Carl Friston, who has identified
*  a model for biological systems based on his free energy principle, another previous Mindscape guest.
*  The model identifies internal states, external states, active states, and sensory states that
*  operate to minimize the difference between a known internal state and a Bayesian predicted external
*  state. A cell membrane may simply be an evolved way to limit the computational bandwidth needed
*  to process the model algorithm by reducing the number of internal state variables. What the cell
*  model and non-cell model share in common is that they would both be based on Markov blankets with
*  different scales and numbers of states. So the question is, do you think Dr. Strachowski should
*  consider Friston's model in her research? So I'm not going to give Elizabeth any advice about what
*  to do for her research. She knows much better than I do what the relevant things that could be helpful
*  are. But I do think that Friston's model is very interesting and worth taking seriously. Let me put
*  it that way. What I don't know is whether it's... So the way I think about it is the following.
*  When we look at real living beings, cells are the basic building block, right? And cells are not
*  just collections of atoms and molecules. There is specific kind of collection of atoms and molecules
*  that are compartmentalized in a very clear way, right? There's a lipid bilayer that surrounds the
*  cell and acts as the cell wall, and there's an inside and an outside, and there's internal
*  structure inside that grows through evolutionary history and so forth. So the question is, is this
*  just an accident? Could it have been completely otherwise? Could there be no cell walls? Is it
*  convenient? Is it useful to have a cell wall but not necessary? Or is it absolutely necessary? Is
*  there no other way to make life? One of the things that Elizabeth does in her research is
*  non-cellular synthetic biology. So she studies biological processes in artificial environments
*  that are not surrounded by cell walls at all. But my point is that I don't know the answer to this
*  question of whether cell membranes are necessary, helpful, or completely accidental. I think that
*  what Friston has done is given good reason to believe it's not just an accident, which I was
*  very willing to believe anyway, so it doesn't require much information as a good Bayesian.
*  My prior was already up there. But what he's saying is that here's a way in a very abstract,
*  high-level sense of thinking of the usefulness, the role played by that cell membrane as a way of
*  sort of limiting the bandwidth of information that comes back and forth between the external
*  world and the internal world. That makes perfect sense to me. There's a huge danger that we already
*  know the answer, and so we're inventing a story after the fact. So I'm not sure that that is the
*  only or even best way to think about the usefulness of cell membranes. Maybe it is,
*  but I think that's, you know, this is stuff that my impression is. It's cutting-edge stuff. That
*  is to say there's not settled answers that people agree on. That might just be because I don't know
*  the field very well, but it might be because biology is hard and when we're working on it,
*  I certainly think that that kind of idea is very useful, very interesting. Let's put it that way,
*  very worth following up on. Brendan says, I was interested in reading your textbooks,
*  space, time, and geometry, but I was wondering how much prior knowledge in mathematics and physics
*  is roughly required. I have all of your other books and followed along to the biggest ideas
*  in the universe, but was unsure whether that would still be enough without a rigorous understanding of
*  the underlying math and physics. My background is in computer science and has been over 10 years
*  since I took a differential equations class. Well, you know, it's always hard to say. The goal of the
*  book is to be self-contained, so it's not assuming that you have a lot of prerequisites, but if you're
*  not used to thinking in certain ways, the material can be very, very intimidating. You know, it's
*  more a matter of is the material sufficiently similar to things that you're used to seeing,
*  that it's not too scary, or do you just say like, I have no idea what all these symbols mean? It's
*  not a matter of explicit prior knowledge so much as a matter of being ready to handle this kind of
*  thing. The one example, the one counterexample of that is you do need to be pretty comfortable with
*  differential equations, in particular, partial differential equations. You have to be able to
*  know what a partial differential equation is. It'd be very, very helpful if you were used to
*  seeing solutions to the wave equation and things like that, because we're going to very quickly
*  use that, invent new notation that you haven't used before, and you have to, if you're grasping
*  both what the equations are and the new notation, that's much harder than just looking at the new
*  notation. So the single thing that is probably the shortest distance between very basic background
*  knowledge and that GR book is actually something like a good E&M book, Electricity and Magnetism,
*  a good E&M book being one that uses special relativity in a very central way. Like you can
*  do E&M, even though Electricity and Magnetism, a la Maxwell, was the inspiration for special
*  relativity. It was invented before special relativity, so you can certainly learn Electricity
*  and Magnetism without putting it into that special relativity context, but it can be put into the
*  special relativity context, and once you do that, your transition to general relativity will be
*  much, much quicker and easier. So that's what I would say. I'm trying to think of an example of
*  a good book. I'm not super familiar with the textbook landscape on Electricity and Magnetism.
*  I believe there's a book by Ohanian, Hans Ohanian, that I liked and really used special
*  relativity in a central way, so that might be a good warm-up. Richard Graf says,
*  try as I might, I can't grasp the connection between symmetry and conservation laws as
*  worked out in Nerther's theorem. Can you explain the relationship in relatively non-technical terms,
*  or is this one of those somethings deeply hidden that requires an understanding of the math to
*  comprehend? Yeah, you know, it's a good question. I did want to cover Nerther's theorem when I did
*  the Biggest Ideas in the Universe videos, and I ended up doing it. It is in there. In the video on
*  symmetry, I talk about Nerther's theorem, and I give a little argument in favor of it. Now,
*  it requires work because you first need to understand the Lagrangian formulation of
*  classical mechanics. Once you understand Lagrangians, you can then understand a little
*  bit about symmetry, and then you can understand Nerther's theorem. So there's a bit of technical
*  background required one way or the other. And oh, I should be honest, I roughly speaking got that
*  explanation of Nerther's theorem that I gave from Feynman, from like the Feynman lectures on physics,
*  or something like that. I believe that was the book, where it was from. And you know, to be honest,
*  it's not intuitive, really. Like, when I say intuitive, it depends on what your intuition is.
*  Sometimes you've been using Lagrangians for long enough in your life that things become intuitive
*  that weren't intuitive before you use Lagrangians. But it's definitely not something where you could
*  hand wave to a person on the street and get them to see not just what Nerther's theorem says,
*  but the proof for why it's true. I don't know, you know, a high school level way of saying
*  how the proof for Nerther's theorem actually works out. It'd be interesting to get that. But you know,
*  it might not be possible because Nerther's theorem only applies to classical systems for
*  which there exists a Lagrangian description. Okay. There are systems for which Nerther's
*  theorem doesn't apply. So I suspect that you need to know what a Lagrangian is to get there.
*  That's my suspicion. Rebecca Leshua says, or Leshua, do you agree with Max Tegmark's basic premise that
*  the universe is essentially mathematical in nature? Certainly a complete theory of everything would
*  be written in mathematics, but is there something that breathes fire into the equations or is the
*  universe just the equations or somehow isomorphic to them? So I guess I alluded to this earlier,
*  but I think that last parenthetical statement phrase that you're using is really, really crucial
*  there because I do think the universe is isomorphic to some set of equations. I do not think that
*  that's more or less the same as saying the universe just is the equations. The universe
*  is the universe. The universe is sui generis. The universe is the unique universal thing. I'm a
*  monist in that sense. Again, I could be talked out of it by evidence or reasoning or whatever,
*  but as far as I can tell, there's something called the universe and it is the thing.
*  To try to explain what it is in other more primitive terms is a fool's errand. There are
*  no more primitive terms to use. It's what exists, but we can describe it using equations,
*  using laws of physics, and there's nothing that breathes fire into them. They're just a language
*  that we use to describe the universe. So the universe is mathematical in the sense that we
*  use math to describe it, but it's not made of mathematics or anything like that. As I said,
*  there are different versions of mathematics. What would it mean for the universe to be made of
*  mathematics? There are parts of the universe that behave in ways for which mathematics is
*  a useful way of talking about them. That's how I would say it. Anonymous says, I've heard physicists
*  say that time and space switch roles inside of a black hole. I've also heard them say that the whole
*  universe is inside a black hole. Are these statements true in some sense? No. Neither one
*  of those statements is true in any sense. Sorry about that. Let's go to the first one. Time and
*  space switch roles inside of a black hole. Just false. Just totally wrong. What would that even
*  mean? I don't know what that would mean. I know why they say it. I know what mistake they're making,
*  but it is totally a mistake. The mistake they're making is the following. When we do physics in
*  space time, it is very often to put coordinates on space time, right? To find things. So to be able
*  to say where something is and when something is happening, we put coordinates on space and
*  coordinate on time. So let's imagine that we do that in a way that is naturally adapted to a
*  black hole. Let's say a simple non-rotating short shield black hole. There's a very obvious version
*  of polar coordinates, spherical coordinates that works for a black hole. You have time,
*  you have space. They both have certain distances in both time and space that are described by the
*  space time metric. Okay? Now let's say, and for all our purposes here, these coordinates are t
*  for time, r for the distance, the radial distance, and then there's theta and phi for the angles
*  around some axis that you pick. And who cares about theta and phi? It's a spherically symmetric
*  black hole. So really what we care about are t, the time coordinate, and r, the distance, the
*  radial coordinate away from the black hole. So here's a fun fact. If you naively take those
*  coordinates that you set up outside the black hole and extend them into the black hole,
*  then what you were calling r, the radial coordinate, becomes timelike. That is to say,
*  increasing your value of r moves you in a timelike direction, not a spacelike direction.
*  And t, what you were calling the timelike coordinate, becomes spacelike inside the black
*  hole. That's a true statement. But hopefully you can see the vast gulf in between that true statement
*  and the very false statement that time and space have switched roles. Time and space didn't switch
*  roles at all. We just chose a dopey coordinate system. That's all. Don't reify your coordinate
*  systems. Don't take your coordinate systems too seriously. If you fell into a black hole,
*  if it was a big black hole, so you weren't being spaghettified or anything like that,
*  you wouldn't even notice that you were in a black hole. Nothing happens when you cross the event
*  horizon. You would think that if time and space had switched their roles, you would notice,
*  but in fact you don't. You wouldn't be using coordinates when you're just floating around.
*  You would just be falling in and waiting until you hit the singularity. The other true statement
*  is that the singularity is not to your left. If you're in a black hole, it's to your future.
*  It is timelike separated from you. But again, it always was. It never was toward the center.
*  Whenever you were told the singularity was at the center of a black hole, they were just lying to
*  you. You've been lied to a lot. I'm sorry to tell you that, but the singularity is in your future.
*  It's kind of like a big crunch. So the other half, the whole universe is inside a black hole. No,
*  clearly not. Because if that were true, if we were inside a black hole, then guess what? There
*  would be a singularity in our future which we would inevitably hit. There's no reason to think
*  there's a singularity in our future that we will inevitably hit. In fact, the simplest version of
*  cosmology says the universe will just continue to expand and accelerate and empty out forever.
*  That doesn't sound very much like a black hole at all. But again, there is a very dumb argument
*  that could lead you to believe that it is, namely the following. If you have enough matter and you
*  collect it into a region of space and calculate its density and its size, there is a conjecture
*  that if you have enough matter in a region, it will have to collapse to a black hole.
*  And if you take a big enough part of the universe, it turns out we do have that much matter. So
*  therefore, shouldn't we be collapsing to a black hole? Well, they lied to you again,
*  because it's not true that if you get enough matter, you have to collapse to a black hole.
*  It's true that if you get enough matter, you either collapse to a singularity in the future
*  or you came out of a singularity in the past. Guess what? We came out of a singularity in the
*  past, which we call the Big Bang. If anything, the universe is like a white hole. A white hole is just
*  a time reversal of a black hole, which starts in a singularity and spits things out. It's not exactly
*  like a white hole either, because there's no event horizon around it as far as we know. But it's much
*  more like a white hole than it is a black hole. The universe is nothing like a black hole, roughly
*  speaking. As Sheikh Dragneel says, what is the universality of computation? Are humans universal
*  too? I.e. can humans understand anything and everything in the universe given in our limited
*  perception of the world? This is a subtle, complicated question and also sort of
*  at the periphery of my own knowledge, so maybe someone who knows better can chime in.
*  There is an idea called the Church-Turing thesis. You can go Google Church-Turing thesis. These are
*  two people's names. It's not the name of the church. Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. The thesis is,
*  you know, these are mathematicians, so they're going to phrase things precisely, not vaguely
*  like we physicists would phrase them. Consider computable functions. You have some, in fact,
*  make your life easy. Make things finite. Rather than functions of real numbers, think of functions
*  of integers. There's some function from the integers to other integers. Some of these are
*  calculatable, computable, and some might not be. You can invent a non-computable function.
*  What the Church-Turing thesis says is that if your function is computable,
*  then it can be computed by a Turing machine. A Turing machine is just a computer. Let's call
*  it a computer. It should be simple, right? Now, the Church-Turing thesis is not proven as far as I
*  know. It's not something that is absolutely established, but people think it's basically
*  true. Maybe it has been proven. I honestly don't know. Like I said, it's not in my wheelhouse,
*  but people treat it as true. What they're saying is that this class of computable functions,
*  if it's computable in one way, a computer can calculate it. That's a little bit far away from
*  the phrase, as you put it, can humans understand anything and everything in the universe?
*  If we say, number one, that the human brain is a Turing machine, if it has the capabilities of a
*  Turing machine, which I think is fair, it might not be a very accurate Turing machine. We make
*  mistakes, unlike a good computer, but we have the computational capacity to be Turing-like.
*  Then in principle, given time and enough graph paper, we can calculate all these functions.
*  That is not the same as saying we can understand everything and everything in the universe,
*  anything and everything in the universe. I don't even know what that means, understand anything
*  and everything in the universe. Something like discovering the correct laws of physics
*  might not be equivalent to computing a function. There's the rigorous statement of the thesis,
*  and then there is the informal understanding. The informal understanding is just not that
*  on that firm ground. The informal understanding is once you can compute things symbolically like
*  a computer, then you can compute whatever you want. All the work is being done by the phrase
*  whatever you want. I would be a little bit careful, let's put it that way. I do think that,
*  I want to have it both ways. I want to have my cake and eat it too. On the one hand,
*  I think that the ability to do symbolic computations like a Turing machine, like a
*  computer, is something that humans have and something that earthworms do not. I think that
*  there is some kind of phase transition in our thinking ability that happened along the
*  evolutionary timeline so that human beings can symbolically manipulate things,
*  can talk to each other using language and words in ways that at least some other animals or
*  plants cannot. That gives us an ability to calculate things that is above that of earthworms.
*  I don't want to stretch that to anything and everything, so I don't know what exactly that
*  means. Maybe, I just don't know, let's put it that way. Varun Narasimhachar says,
*  why do you think our understanding of quantum mechanics is incomplete? I feel we understand
*  operationally just as well as we do classical mechanics, but seem to insist on fitting it
*  to our classical intuition by adding unnecessary features beyond what's operationally accessible.
*  As for questions like what really exists, I think we had no meaningful answers in classical
*  mechanics either. E.g. does mass exist? Do electric fields exist? I think it's pretty
*  straightforward why our understanding of quantum mechanics is incomplete. If you look at
*  the textbook explication of quantum mechanics, you're told things like when a quantum system
*  is measured, its wave function collapses. The collapse is unpredictable, it obeys the Born
*  Rule, the probability is given by the wave function squared, etc. You're not told what it means
*  to measure a quantum system. That's just left incomplete. I'm not saying it's not completable,
*  but you're just not told what counts as a measurement. Does a single photon bumping
*  into something qualify as a measurement? You need to be conscious to do a measurement? Could a video
*  camera do it? How quickly does it happen? When exactly does it happen doing a measurement?
*  Now, of course you can try to do better. What I'm saying is the textbook version of quantum mechanics
*  just leaves these questions unanswered. That is clearly incomplete. There's just zero questions,
*  zero controversy about the fact that textbook quantum mechanics is not a complete rigorous
*  physical theory. You can try to fix it up. You can say, well, there's decoherence, blah, blah, blah,
*  but then what you discover is that there are different ways to fix it up and people don't
*  agree on what the right way is. That's why you have Bohmian mechanics in many worlds, etc.
*  The very fact that some people believe Bohmian mechanics and some other people believe many
*  worlds and some other people believe objective collapse models and we don't know which one is
*  right is right there a proof that we don't understand quantum mechanics, that our understanding
*  is incomplete. If we did have a complete understanding, we would know which of those
*  is right, if any of them. As for questions like what really exists, your two examples are does
*  mass exist and do electric fields exist? Mass is not a thing. It's a property, right? Mass,
*  energy, momentum. These are properties that other things have like electrons or electromagnetic
*  fields or whatever. Mass you could take it or leave it. There's different ways of describing
*  the same physical thing with using that property or not. But electric fields, do they exist? The
*  answer is yes. In classical electromagnetism, that's a very meaningful answer. Yes, the electric
*  field exists. I think that if you give up on the idea of saying what exists, then you give up on
*  the on the goal of understanding the universe, which is both a very plausible goal and one we're
*  making great progress towards. So that's not a goal I'm going to give up on anytime soon.
*  Kathy Seeger says, in your recent paper, Consciousness and the Laws of Physics,
*  you elaborated on the core theory. You've also made it clear what its domain of applicability is.
*  Since Frank Wilczek proposed the core theory in 2015, and you endorsed it ever since,
*  what's your impression? Did it gain more attention and approval in the physics community over time?
*  And does does Frank Wilczek approve of the way you constructed the core theory equation? Frank
*  Wilczek, of course, yet another previous Mindscape guest. So let me be clear about this, because I
*  don't want to give too much credit to either me or to Frank Wilczek. What Frank Wilczek put forward
*  in 2015 was the name, the core theory. The core theory itself was already there. It just didn't
*  have a name. And you know, the core theory is the combination of the standard model of particle
*  physics and general relativity thought of as an effective field theory in the weak field limit.
*  So people knew before 2015 that that was a perfectly sensible theory to talk about. Frank's
*  point was, this is what you need to understand the laws of physics underlying everyday life.
*  And so he gave it a name, the core theory. No one person invented it, right? It was put together by
*  many different people, including Einstein, because general relativity came from him,
*  and including Frank Wilczek, because the strong interactions, you need to understand asymptotic
*  freedom to understand them, which was understood first by Gross, Politzer, and Wilczek, and they
*  won the Nobel Prize for that. So part of the core theory really is Frank's credit, but there's also
*  the weak interactions, the electroweak theory, for whom the most important person was Steven
*  Weinberg, who sadly just passed away. But again, many other people, Murray Gilman, Richard Feynman,
*  arguably James Clark Maxwell gets credit because he wrote down the electromagnetic part of it,
*  et cetera. Dirac obviously gets credit, et cetera, et cetera. Many, many, many people
*  contributed. Higgs, you know, Anglare and Higgs and Brau. So that was already there.
*  So I don't think that the physics community cares. I mean, they knew it already. The existence of a
*  new label for it doesn't change their minds very much. And I've done this experiment. I think maybe
*  what you're really getting at is, if you go up to someone who is a working physicist, who is an
*  expert on quantum field theory, who really knows what you mean when you talk about effective field
*  theories and the standard model, et cetera, and you say, what do you think about the claim
*  that if you take general relativity and the standard model and combine them into effective
*  field theory, that qualifies as the laws of physics underlying everyday life. And we're,
*  you know, as we learn more and discover new things in physics, they won't have any direct impact on
*  everyday life. People will generally think about it for like 10 to 15 seconds and go, yeah, that
*  sounds right. So they haven't previously thought about it generally, but they don't object to it
*  either. You asked, does Frank Wilczek approve of the way I constructed the core theory equation?
*  You know, yes. But again, I didn't do anything. It was already there. It was just writing things
*  down that people already had thought about. Samuel Benjamin says, you've mentioned many times that
*  the words we use in modern physics are poor descriptors of the phenomena we observe,
*  wave function being a particularly bad one, although I still have to think hard about the
*  various uses of the word space. Have you ever come up with alternatives for some of the more
*  challenging terms and phrases that you feel do a better job at helping others understand the
*  concepts? Do you know of any other languages that describe these concepts better than English?
*  So, you know, I have in different moments, but not very seriously. Like one I talked about,
*  I think I talked about on the podcast not too long ago was smooth tension as an alternative
*  to dark energy. But you know what, it's just a joke. I wasn't serious. And the reason why
*  I was not serious is because you can't really fight the battle of making sure that all the words we
*  use are not only labels, but also definitions, right? Words are labels. When you say quantum
*  mechanics, you mean a certain theory. It is not necessary that the theory be the mechanics of
*  quanta. When you say the theory of relativity, you mean a certain theory. It is not necessary
*  that that theory really have anything to do with one thing being relative to another. It's useful
*  if they are. It's helpful, but really it's a label. As long as you know what you mean, that's what
*  matters. And maybe we would like to imagine a perfect world of language and representation,
*  where all words really gave you an instantly correct idea of what they were referring to,
*  but that's not our world. That's not the world we live in. And the battle to clean up the language
*  so that things are more accurate is very, very hard to win. And maybe there's certain sort of
*  social justice examples where it's worth fighting that battle, but for labeling physics theories,
*  it almost never is. And I don't think that any other languages do any better, but I'm not really
*  fluent enough in enough other languages to know. Usually a language will just borrow the name from
*  whatever language the original concept was invented in. So languages tend to share the
*  same terminology for these kinds of things. Okay. Last question comes from David De Kloet,
*  who says, how do you decide when to end a podcast episode? See what I'm doing there? Ending this
*  podcast episode with this question. Question is, how do you decide when to end a podcast episode?
*  Are guests ever caught by surprise when you suddenly say, thanks for being on the Mindscape
*  podcast, or do you prepare them in some way? Nope. They're never prepared. Maybe they're caught by
*  surprise. I don't know. I think it's usually pretty clear that we're winding down. I mean,
*  maybe I'm wrong about that. I don't know. But I've been on other podcasts myself more than
*  enough times to have been on the other side of the microphone. And usually you get a feeling,
*  very often as you'll hear in the podcast, I will give little clues that we're winding down.
*  I won't usually say this is... Sorry, I shouldn't say that. Sometimes I say this is the last question,
*  but what I realize is it's often not true. So I try not to say that. What I will try to say is
*  something like, coming to the end or the last topic, last thing I wanted to talk about is,
*  because there's very often follow-up questions. So sometimes I do that. Other times, there's a
*  set of things that are natural to talk about and we're coming to the end of them.
*  Other times, they've been like a tiny number of times when the guest has really wanted to keep
*  talking. Usually, an hour plus podcast is a long time and I'm talking to busy people.
*  Some people like to talk forever. Stephen Wolfram would have kept talking, but it was past 10 PM my
*  time and past midnight his time when we were doing the podcast. So I don't have the energy to keep
*  going after two and a half hours. And most people, once you hit an hour, there is something natural
*  about an hour, even though it's an arbitrary human invention. We're trained or socialized to do
*  things for an hour, TV shows, movies, whatever, hour, hour and a half makes sense to us. After that,
*  seminars, after that you begin to fade. So I think people are ready to wind things up.
*  So I'll give you two examples of counter examples. One is Jeffrey West, one of my first podcast
*  guests. You can go listen. It's like in the top, in the first 10 podcasts I did, Jeffrey West,
*  might be like five or six. And Jeffrey is great. And one of the things that is great about him is
*  he can talk forever. And so just get him talking. And I told him I was new, I was naive. And I said,
*  look, we have plenty of time, we have over an hour. But the mistake was, that was when I was visiting
*  the Santa Fe Institute, where Jeffrey is a professor. And I was scheduled to be at a public event
*  in Santa Fe at a certain time later that evening. And I literally like had to leave. So I had to
*  wrap it up. We'd gone over for over an hour. And Jeffrey was like, I didn't even get to talk about
*  sustainability. I want to talk about that. Like, well, okay, I gotta go. I gotta be on stage. So
*  that was one example. The other example was Kip Thorne, who said, you know, I thought you were
*  gonna ask me about what it is like to win the Nobel Prize. And I had a good answer all set for that.
*  And I said, Yeah, I don't care what it's like to win the Nobel Prize. I care about black holes and
*  gravitational waves and time travel. But he said, you know, it's the one time when someone said,
*  well, could you ask it to me now? We were done. He asked me to me now and edited it in. So I did
*  that. So I don't know if it's noticeable. But in that podcast, there's a time in the middle,
*  where we're talking about the Nobel Prize, which I actually which actually was recorded at the end,
*  and then I edited it in. And it's not just because it's not at all because Kip wanted to sort of
*  bask in the glory of winning the Nobel Prize, he actually wanted to critique the whole process.
*  He had thoughts about how it could be better and its shortcomings. So and I always do ask,
*  if I remember, but which is almost always the case, when I finish a podcast, finish the recording,
*  I say, Do we miss anything? I asked the, you know, the guest and usually they say,
*  Oh, we covered a lot. That's good. So I'm not I don't think that we're leaving a lot of things
*  out, you know, there's certain certain people have a lot to say, certain people have a thing
*  that they're going to say in the same in different ways over and over again. So different people are
*  good. But you know, most of the people who I've had on the podcast, I could talk for longer.
*  And some famously, there are other podcasts that go on longer than I do. But as I've said before,
*  you know, I am very gratified that the kind of people who I get on the podcast come on at all.
*  I think I get really, really good people. Some people are even better than others. But the
*  overall quality of people I get is very gratifying to me. I'm very happy with it. And they're very
*  busy people. And I don't want to take up too much of their time, right? I've had people say, well,
*  like, normally, I say no to podcasts, but for you, I'll say yes. And that puts a lot of pressure on
*  me to like, try to make it a good podcast and try not to waste their time in any way. So almost all
*  the people I talked to have much more to say that is interesting than we get to cover in the podcast,
*  but there is a limit to what is sort of appropriate. And with that, we've reached the end of this
*  podcast, this AMA. Thanks. Have a good month. Hopefully our pandemic continues to evaporate
*  and we can return to normality again. Take care. Bye bye.
