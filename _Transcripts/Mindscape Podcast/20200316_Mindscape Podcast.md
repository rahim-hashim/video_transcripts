“What good is half a wing?” That’s the rhetorical question often asked by people who have trouble accepting Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. Of course it’s a very answerable question, but figuring out what exactly the answer is leads us to some fascinating biology. Neil Shubin should know: he is the co-discoverer of Tiktaalik Roseae, an ancient species of fish that was in the process of learning to walk and breathe on land. We talk about how these major transitions happen — typically when evolution finds a way to re-purpose existing organs into new roles — and how we can learn about them by studying living creatures and the information contained in their genomes.

Neil Shubin received his Ph.D. in organismic and evolutionary biology from Harvard University. He is currently the the Robert Bensley Distinguished Service Professor and Associate Dean of Biological Sciences at the University of Chicago. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical society. His first book, Your Inner Fish, was chosen by the National Academy of Sciences as the best science book of 2009, and was subsequently made into a TV special. His new book is Some Assembly Required: Decoding Four Billion Years of Life, from Ancient Fossils to DNA.

# Mindscape 88 | Neil Shubin on Evolution, Genes, and Dramatic Transitions
**Mindscape Podcast:** [March 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DCDlvvNxy8)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. And as I'm
*  recording these words, we're in the middle of a proto pandemic with the coronavirus, the COVID-19
*  disease that is happening because of this. I'm certainly not an expert in viruses or pandemics
*  or anything like that. And this episode is not about viruses or pandemics, but it is about
*  evolution. And you know, this is part of why we get pandemics is because all these little microbes,
*  bless their hearts, they keep evolving clever new ways to deal with us, even if it hurts us in doing
*  it. And it turns out when you go into the details that we human beings sometimes take advantage.
*  Like as you'll learn in this podcast, human DNA has a certain fraction that is just borrowed
*  wholesale from virus DNA in cases where we encountered a virus and we didn't just combat it,
*  we absorbed it or at least absorb part of it. It's part of the whole question of how transitions
*  happen in evolution. You know, when Charles Darwin first invented the idea of natural selection,
*  he had the idea that it was more or less gradual, right, that there were slow changes, minor changes,
*  and some of them would catch on, develop and grow, others would be less successful. But we do see
*  examples of major transitions, whether they happen quickly or not is a complicated thing.
*  But there are transitions like the first flight, right, you know, the first animals that could
*  actually fly and develop wings, or the first climbing onto land on the part of aquatic animals.
*  So this has always been a question for Darwinian evolution. How does that happen? How does a fish
*  develop the right organismal abilities to live on and flourish on dry land? Like, it's not
*  teleological, evolution is not based on goals toward future success. So the fish can't think
*  to itself, I would like to be able to get up and get that yummy food up on land, let me develop
*  some feet and some lungs and the ability to do that. So today we're talking to Neil Shubin,
*  who is a quite well known evolutionary biologist. He is a distinguished service professor of
*  organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago. Very well known, of course, for being
*  one of the co-discoverers of teak-tulik, the fossil that represents a crucially important
*  transitional stage, the transitional stage precisely from being a fish swimming in the water
*  to being an amphibian living mostly on land. It's a little fish like thing that has the basic,
*  very primitive versions of feet and hands and the ability to breathe air and so forth. So
*  Neil has some evolution of his own in the research that he does, mostly from going out there and
*  hunting fossils and doing paleontology and learning about the evolution of life on that macro scale,
*  to being in a lab and doing molecular biology, understanding how changes in DNA, both the actual
*  coding for proteins, but also how the DNA we have is regulated and expressed can lead to these major
*  transitions in evolution. I mean, what actually happens in the DNA of a fish to turn it into
*  something that can climb about on land? It's an extremely exciting field because it's one of
*  these things where obviously we've learned a lot, but there's still a lot left to learn. And as we
*  discussed at the very end of the episode, it's a rapidly changing field in part because we are
*  developing the ability to make these changes in DNA ourselves. So what used to be more or less
*  gradual changes in how organisms functioned can be very, very rapid because now we can have teleology.
*  We can actually plan what might happen next. So it's a fun episode. Neil is a wonderful science
*  communicator. He's the author of a book called Your Inner Fish, which tells how things that are
*  still in your body right now were first developed in the context of when our ancestors were in fact
*  fish. And he has a new book coming out literally tomorrow as this episode is being released called
*  Some Assembly Required, Decoding Four Billion Years of Life from Ancient Fossils to DNA,
*  about these major transitions in evolution and how we are learning about them through studying DNA.
*  So let's go.
*  Neil Schubin, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Oh, great to be here.
*  We're going to be talking about evolution, natural selection, Charles Darwin. I want to
*  let everyone know right from the start, official Mindscape Podcast position is that evolution is
*  real. And we're not going to be discussing whether or not evolution happened versus creationism or
*  anything like that. I hope that's okay with you. Yeah, I didn't do that in the book either. So
*  that's good. Yeah, that's not why we're here. You go other places for that. But
*  given that evolution is real, given that Darwin was roughly speaking right, there's certainly a
*  lot of work to be done, right? In figuring out exactly how it happened. Is that a fair way of
*  stating it? And that's good news, because that keeps people like me employed. I mean, there's,
*  I mean, what's happened recently is just we've had game changing technologies, both for the ways we
*  analyze fossils, but in molecular biology and computation, that really changed things, you know.
*  And so many of the questions that Darwin had, and many of the ideas he had are still relevant. But
*  boy, are we learning new things. Yeah, yeah. And it's always, you know, one of those things where
*  when you solve one problem, you open up multiple new problems, right, multiple new puzzles. And
*  I think that people who are not embedded in the scientific process might feel like there's just
*  more and more puzzles that you guys are inventing, whereas it's actually, you know, there's more and
*  more knowledge being gained at the same time. Yeah, you know, sometimes you actually get to ask new
*  kinds of questions, more powerful questions in many ways, more precise questions, maybe more
*  global questions. So, you know, it's the questions never stop, they just change. And as we gain
*  answers, we gain new questions. Yeah, so we have you have a new book coming out called Some Assembly
*  Required, Decoding 4 billion years of life from ancient fossils to DNA. Congratulations on that.
*  Oh, thank you so much. And you've you've written a couple of other books, you know, your the your
*  sort of breakout one was Your Inner Fish about the discovery of I always say teak-ta-leak, but I'm
*  totally that's not the wrong pronunciation, right? Well, that's actually right in some quarters,
*  but we say teak-ta-leak. Teak-ta-leak. Okay. Yeah. So if you go to the Inuit, it's just an Inuit word,
*  an Inuit name, it would be teak-ta-leak. Oh, really? Teak-ta-leak is what we've been saying. Yeah.
*  Oh, I'm definitely going to stick with the Inuit. Definitely. So we'll tell that story a little bit.
*  But first, just to, you know, put things in context, one of the things that you still want
*  to understand if you're a good natural selection evolutionary biologist is the question of missing
*  links and big transitions in evolution, right? I mean, the joke is that whenever you find a
*  missing link, you've created two more missing links because you now have, you know, one species
*  in between two other ones. But this is a good puzzle for biology. Is that right? Oh, it's a
*  wonderful one. And in fact, it's the one that drew me into the field. And in realizing that, that's
*  how this book came about, was realizing how important those questions are, the great
*  transitions in evolution and some of the misconceptions that we have, all of us,
*  about those transitions, missing links being one of them. So in what sense is there a slogan that
*  says the idea of missing links is itself a misconception? Well, there should be. But
*  as somebody who's been, you know, who's claimed to have found a missing link, other people have
*  reported that teak-ta-leak is. But the reality is evolution is, you know, it's a hugely branching
*  tree. It doesn't take a straight-on path. And, you know, when we talk about links, which there are,
*  number one, they're found, they're not missing. But number two, you know, the path of evolution
*  is often very unpredictable. It has lots of twists and turns and goes backwards and forwards. And
*  it's not a straight path, a linear ladder. It's a hugely branching bush of change that, you know,
*  that goes in many different directions. So the missing link concept, I mean, the part of it
*  that's right is link, there are links among species. But what underlies that narrative,
*  however, is the assumption that evolution acts as a ladder of progress, of change, of one form
*  inexorably giving rise to another that's, you know, that looks sort of like, that looks the same but
*  different. There are aspects of that that are true, but it's that linear narrative that I think we're
*  finding as we study fossils and genes, this really doesn't hold up. Yeah, and your book certainly does
*  a good job of explaining the messiness of it all, which is, which is, you know, like you say,
*  full employment for scientists. So that's good. Yeah, it's a beautiful messiness. The mess is the
*  message, you know, and so we can get into that. But it's, that's half the fun of this, you know,
*  so. But that's why people should become physicists instead of biologists. It's way cleaner.
*  So one of the very most obvious links that one might want to fill in, whether you call it a
*  missing link or not, is between fish and land dwellers or amphibians or whatever. And that's
*  where Tiktaalik comes into the story. So why don't you tell us just the wonderful human story of you
*  and your team discovering that and what it all meant? Well, it began, as I described in the book,
*  actually, it began in my second year of graduate school. I was, I didn't know what I wanted to do
*  for my PhD. I knew I wanted to study evolution, but I thought maybe I wanted to study mammals,
*  or I don't know. I didn't know. And so I took a survey course on evolution and like each week was
*  a different greatest hits in the history of life. You know, you go from one great transition to the
*  next. And the professor showed this beautiful slide of a fish and on one end and an amphibian,
*  a tetrapod, a limbed animal on the other with an arrow connecting them. And then it was like kind
*  of what we knew about that transition from water to land. And I remember looking at that slide
*  thinking, golly, I want to work on that problem. And I want to find fossils that do it. And so,
*  you know, with colleagues, we set off on a multi-year quest to find an intermediate between a fish
*  that lives in water and a limbed animal, a tetrapod that lives on land. And we know we used the rules
*  of paleontology. You know, we didn't invent new methods here. We were using sort of the tried and
*  true, you know, perspectives of field paleontology, which go as follows in simplified form. If you
*  want to find a key intermediate fossil, say a transitional fossil, say between, say, fish and
*  tetrapods or between, you know, birds and reptiles or reptiles, mammals, whatever, you know, you look
*  for places in the world that have three things. You look for places in the world that have rocks
*  that hold rocks of the right age to answer whatever question interests you. You know, so if you're
*  interested in the fish to limbed animal transition, you're not going to look in rocks about 380, 375
*  million years old or so. You'd look for places in the world that have rocks of the right type
*  to hold fossils. Obviously, not every kind of rock does that. And as a geologist, you start to learn
*  the catalog of environments and rocks that are likely to preserve the best fossils. That's as
*  much art as science, by the way, and a lot of induction there. And then the third part is you
*  look for places in the world that not only have rocks of the right age and the right type, but
*  the rocks that are exposed and accessible. You know, it makes total sense, right? You don't want
*  rocks that are buried 12 miles underground or that are in the side of Mount Everest,
*  or in a politically inviolable place, a war zone. You know, you need accessibility. And so those
*  are the filters, right? So, you know, the world's a big place. So the point with that last one being that, you know,
*  erosion and plate tectonics, etc., are constantly exposing new layers. And so you're going to go
*  look for the layers which have the kind of rocks that you want. That's correct. That's correct. And
*  so you can actually go to geology libraries, which is what we did in the 90s, or do it online,
*  and you can get aerial photos, you can get geological maps that give you the kinds of rocks
*  in a country's border. You can dig out papers on the local geology to find out what kind of rocks
*  are there. And you can put all this information together. So that's what we're doing in the 90s.
*  And we, you know, looking for rocks the right age, about 375 million years old, and so forth.
*  Our first gig was in Pennsylvania, because my first job was outside, it was at the University
*  of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. And I grew up there as well. And so I knew the place. And I
*  also knew that there was a lot of Devonian age rock in Pennsylvania throughout the state.
*  So the first part of our hunt was looking at the Devonian age, again, 365 to 375 million year old
*  rocks in Pennsylvania. And it turns out we didn't have a lot of exposure, so we worked on road cuts.
*  You know, when PennDOT, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, would come in to build a new
*  road, we'd get in there and look at the rocks. And that was amazingly successful. It really was.
*  We started to find early tetrapods, early limbed animals. We found all kinds of
*  fish. It was just a remarkably productive program. But my colleague in this, Ted Dushler,
*  was a student at the time, and now a colleague who works on all this stuff with me, we realized we
*  had a problem. We were in rocks that were too young to answer the question. We wanted to find
*  a fish with a fin, with limb bones inside it, that had a head like a tetrapod, like a flat head,
*  not a conical head like a fish, that had a neck or things like that. And we weren't finding a lot
*  of that. So we were in rocks that were way too young to answer the question. So back to the
*  drawing board. And so it turns out one thing led to another, and we settled on a region of a rock
*  up in the Canadian Arctic that extends from about 1500 kilometers from Melville Island in the west
*  to Ellesmere Island in the east. And perfect. Rock 375 million years old, rock that was produced
*  in ancient rivers and streams, much like the Amazon Delta today. It's in the Canadian Arctic,
*  by the way. That tells how different, how much the world's changed. And then rock that was exposed
*  by ice and water and so forth. So we had all our variables maximized at this spot. So starting in
*  1999, we began expeditions there. Slightly more exotic than the hills of Pennsylvania.
*  Yeah, quite a bit. You're taking a team of six people. There are polar bears up there. It's
*  daylight 24 hours a day. We're 300 miles from the nearest village, which has 170 people at 80 North
*  latitude. I mean, it's pretty extreme. And for those reasons, it took us a while to be successful.
*  I mean, a season up there would be about four weeks. And so we started in 99, did four weeks
*  then, 2000 did it again. And each year we made a little progress, but we never really found what
*  we were looking for until 2004. We had found a layer with lots of fish bones in it. And we were
*  digging this layer. I'll never forget this day in my life. It was like July 17th, 2004. We're in this
*  layer, cracking rocks, finding fossil fish, nothing we'd be talking about. But my colleague, one of my
*  colleagues in the pit with me, cracked a rock and said, Hey, Neil, what's this? And I came in over
*  and I looked at it. And as soon as I saw that, I knew we had found what we had spent six years
*  and lots of money and lots of sprained ankles looking for. And what it was, was it was a snout
*  of a fish, clearly had fish bone. The texture was classically fish. It was clearly the front of a
*  skull, but it was clearly a very flat skull. And so early limbed animals have flat heads. We were
*  looking for a flat headed fish. So I said, here's a flat headed fish looking right at me in the rock.
*  A lot of celebration. So we ended up removing the whole thing. It's about four feet long,
*  a little over a meter and then pulled it out. And then as we did that, we found four more of these
*  things. And since then we found about 20. So they're not at all rare. And then we got these
*  things back to the lab and the rock was removed grain by grain. And first we saw it had a fin,
*  great. But then we saw inside it had a humerus, an upper arm bone. It had a radius and ulna in there.
*  It had a wrist. It had even things that might compare to digits, fingers and toes.
*  Things most fish don't have.
*  Yeah. But in a fin, clearly it had fin rays. And this thing clearly had a shoulder that was part
*  fish, part limbed animal that had that sort of setup. Yet it had scales. Yet it had fish like
*  bones in the skull. So it was a real mosaic between characteristics of fish and limbed animal.
*  And it was an animal that had lungs and gills, had fins with limb bones inside.
*  You know, it's exactly what we were looking for. And it tells us a lot about how this transition
*  from water to land happened. You know, it's real physical evidence of that. And it wasn't lost on
*  us that this was when we were working on this fossil initially. It was 2000. We found it in 2004.
*  We did most of the work in 2005 and six, illustrating it. There were trials going on
*  where people were, you know, suing to teach intelligent design creationism in the schools.
*  You know, and here we had on our desks, these, these fossils. It was quite the time.
*  I mean, presumably they would just say, you know, yeah, you glued together a fish with
*  salamander or something like that. Right. I mean, yeah, well, you know, but we actually
*  recorded us taking it out. I mean, this was just, and the wonderful thing is that about this example,
*  why I love using it to teach not only because it's a huge part of my life, is that we use the tools
*  of evolutionary biology, of geology and stratigraphy, of historical geology to make
*  a prediction. Right. You know, we didn't go randomly to the Arctic, you know, and we didn't
*  just stay there and we stayed there for six years. We stayed there for a reason is we had a, we felt
*  we had a very strong prediction. We, that the odds were in our favor. If we stuck with it long enough
*  that we would be successful. And yeah, and that's, that's what happened. It's a predictive science.
*  It's not merely a matter of history. That's correct. And it's, you know, you can,
*  you can put the odds in your favor by knowing a lot about the evolutionary history of the groups
*  you're interested in, the dating and ages that those fossils first appear. And then knowing a
*  lot about the environments that creatures likely lived in. Once you do that, then you can make your
*  predictions. And that's the toolkit. You've probably heard of Peloton. It's a game changing
*  home exercise system that lets you do your cardio workout with a bike right in the comfort of your
*  very own home. And the best thing is that right now there's a new 30 day home trial that will let
*  you try out the Peloton bike for yourself. I've ridden it. I know what it's like, and I can verify
*  that it's incredibly convenient. And also it kind of makes the exercise fun. When you have a bike
*  at home, you can just go down, ride it whenever you want morning, evening. If you're not feeling up
*  to it, you can skip it. If you are feeling extra energetic, you can take advantage of that. Peloton
*  offers a variety of classes you can take led by instructors or just courses that you can go through,
*  discover different music, playlists that will get you going and so forth. With the 30 day free try
*  out, you can find your favorite classes. You can see whether you like it. You can have different
*  profiles for everyone in your household, whoever they may be. So try it for yourself. Learn more
*  about Peloton's 30 day home trial at onepeloton.com using promo code mindscape. That's O-N-E-P-E-L-O-T-O-N.com
*  code mindscape to get started. If you don't find that the bike is right for you, they'll pick it up
*  full refund, worry free. You sort of skipped over one thing, which I think is absolutely fascinating.
*  So once you've found the rocks you want to look at, and then you go up there for years on end,
*  what is the actual process of looking through the rocks for a fossil? I can imagine I'd be
*  walking through rocks for a long time and not see any fossils. Part of it is just you have a trained
*  eye, but there's probably more to it than that. Well, it's kind of getting a trained eye, definitely.
*  There's a couple things that fit together. One is you train your eye, and if you were to come on an
*  expedition with us, you'd first get there and you'd think we were magicians. We'd be picking up rocks
*  all over your feet. But after a few days, you'd do it yourself. That pattern recognition system
*  that we all have kicks in. It takes a few days, but you learn it. Whenever I go to a new place,
*  I have to learn how to find new fossils. Each rock is different. But what we do is you get up
*  in the morning and we have geological maps, we have our aerial photos. We have a good knowledge
*  of what kinds of rocks are exposed everywhere around us, so which hills hold which kinds of rocks.
*  We decide in the morning which rocks we want to visit, so we'll walk to those. We'll literally
*  follow layers for miles looking for bones that are weathering out on the surface. It's just
*  painstaking. You've got to stick to it. Once we find something that's weathering, then if it looks
*  good, we'll dig out the layer, try to find the layer the fossils are coming from. If it's any
*  good, we'll put a whole team on removing the fossils in that layer. That's essentially what
*  happens. Success, what matters here? What matters is developing that eye, developing a knowledge of
*  the geology of the rocks you're working on, being really patient. There'll be whole days, whole weeks
*  where you're not finding stuff, but you've got to stay on point. Sometimes that's not easy.
*  If the weather's lousy, if you're stuck in the Arctic and you want to get home,
*  there's lots of other psychological things that kick in as well that you have to think about up
*  there. All those are variables that are related to success. We've done the experiment. I have gone
*  on to Wyoming and Montana with your colleague Paul Sorino digging for dinosaurs. I'm just not
*  really very good at distinguishing the rocks from anything else. I got news for you. I was no good
*  either when I was in graduate school. The first expedition I went on was like 1983, my first year
*  in graduate school. I was invited to look for fossil mammals, which are really small. I was an
*  utter disaster to the point where one of the senior people told me, you don't have a future,
*  this kid. Just stick to the theoretical side. By the way, I had never camped before that. I was
*  just such a nerd. This all was new, but then I decided I wanted to do it. Just like anything
*  in life, you can learn it. Exactly. I love the fact that the book that you wrote about this was
*  not just, hey, we found a transitional organism between fish and amphibians, but the fact that
*  the relics of that transition are still within us today. That's what it really means to have
*  our inner fish. It's a reminder that the transitions are gradual and continuous from
*  very early times to right now. That's correct. The conceit of that book was that fossil was just a
*  waypoint, but really, once you start to look at anatomy and development and molecular biology,
*  what you start to see is there's billions of years of artifacts of billions of years of history
*  inside our own bodies. You see that in the genome. You see that in our cells. You see that in our
*  tissues, our organs. Whether you look at our skulls, limbs, and so forth, we can see the layer after
*  layer of evolutionary history inside of us. That was the story that I told in Inner Fish.
*  That was really an extension of a lot of the teaching I did. At the time we discovered
*  tectonic, I was teaching human anatomy to medical students here at University of Chicago Medical
*  School. It enabled me to connect the dots in a way I probably wouldn't have done in the same way
*  previously. I think that hiccups were my favorite example. Can you explain why we have hiccups?
*  Yeah. Well, we have hiccups. It's basically a spasm of the phrenic nerve. One theory that came
*  out of some folks in Canada a few years ago was the idea that that response, that is a very
*  calibrated, stereotypical response of nerves firing and muscles firing and a consequence,
*  that there's a pattern inside our central nervous system that causes that pattern to occur.
*  That pattern occurs naturally elsewhere in the wild. One place where we see it is in frogs and
*  tadpoles, which usually are very large, very small, very large, very large, very large, very
*  large, which use a form of a hiccup and that neural response to actually breathe with water.
*  What we'll see is there's these antecedents that we see in other animals for things that we think
*  are distinctively human when in reality they're not. Yeah. We can get into exactly the purpose,
*  I think, of the main theme, let's call it that, of this podcast, which is the tectonic does
*  represent a major transition from one way of life to another. Can you just say a little bit for
*  those of you who don't know anything about what was its motivation for climbing up onto land and
*  how did that really work? It seems like something that if you're just underwater and have a happy
*  life there that climbing up to a different poisonous environment is not your first idea.
*  Well, it helps to compare water and land. There's probably not one reason, there are probably many,
*  but if you look in the Devonian and what lived in the water at that time, you had big fish,
*  you had small fish, but pretty much all of them were carnivores. They were all predators. It was
*  a cheat fish world. By the way, you wouldn't have wanted to swim in these Devonian streams.
*  There were 15-foot-long predators filling the crocodile kind of niche, giant predators with
*  teeth the size of railroad spikes. Yeah, it was a very predator and competitor intense world in the
*  water, but if you look at land at that time, there are plants on land, there are invertebrates, there
*  are food sources on land, there are few competitors and certainly no predators.
*  So, you know, anything that would sort of any trait that would allow a creature to avoid that
*  the water, get away from the predators and the competitors into the mud flats into land would
*  probably be favored because there was a world of opportunity with food stuffs on land without
*  competitors or predators. There are probably other reasons, lots of other reasons as well.
*  You know, things like Tiktaalik and its cousins in the Devonian were not fully land living. They
*  were living in the shallows and the mud flats. So there's a continuum between these environments
*  as well. So lots of reasons, but those, you know, there's lots of good reasons to get out of the
*  water. You know, you can think about it. If it's a fish eat fish world, you can, there's lots of
*  strategies. You can get big because big fish eat little fish. You can get armor, which a lot of
*  fish do, or you can get out of the way. Get out of there. I think our distant ancestors were the
*  ones who got out of there. But it's not Lamarckian. You can't, as the fish say, boy, there's a lot of
*  yummy food up there on land. I think I will turn my fins into feet, right? I mean, there have to be
*  all these little transitions. That's exactly right. That's a really good point. It's not that it's,
*  it's actually, it's natural selection. And that's what some assembler acquired the new book really
*  is about in showing how that happens. So the, it's, you know, when you think about the water to land
*  transition, it's actually exemplifies other great transitions as well and showing one really
*  important thing that is pretty much every trait that we associate with one of the great revolutions
*  in the history of life, say limbs or arms, and, you know, the invasion of land, lungs in the
*  invasion of land, feathers in the origin of flight, you know, walking on two legs in the origin of
*  humanity, pretty much every trait that we associate with the revolution is not associated with that
*  revolution. It came about millions of years before, you know, and that's the big thing, you know, and
*  one of the quotes that leads off the book is one of my favorite ones from Lillian Hellman, who lived
*  a fairly hard life. And she said, you know, nothing, of course, ever begins when you think it does.
*  That is a great motto for thinking about evolutionary change, you know, nothing begins with
*  it always begins well before, it's always repurposing something else, right? It's repurposing,
*  you know, and it's repurposing and modifying and then repurposing again, co opting, duplicating,
*  merging. I mean, it's all these things, it's tinkering in some very profound ways. And we
*  get to see, you know, glimpses of that tinkering in the fossil record, we can see the pathway it
*  took. But when we look at genes, and we look at development, and, you know, we look at molecular
*  biology, we begin to see the mechanisms behind that kind of tinkering and repurposing, which is, you
*  know, really fabulous stuff. So I can imagine, you know, it might be much harder for that fish to
*  climb up on the land if it didn't have fins in the first place or flippers flippers. Yeah, I had a
*  sort of a flipper like limb with basically had a shoulder, it had an elbow and had a wrist and I
*  had part of the of the fin that the terminal end of the fin that could serve as a palm. This is a
*  fish that can do a push up that can even walk in funny ways. And by the way, this fish also had
*  lungs. So you can imagine that these fish with all this gear, living in, you know, water walking on
*  the bottom of the water, or maybe in the mudflats, it was already set up to jump into land when when
*  the need happened and to refine those structures and to modify them and repurpose them in new ways.
*  I think maybe to the people who are not experts, the fact that it had lungs is even more impressive
*  and surprising than the fact that it could develop feet because as long as you have flippers, you can
*  imagine morphing them into feet. But if you breathe through gills, why do you also have lungs?
*  Yeah, that's great. And so this is actually something that was discovered in the 1830s. We've
*  known this forever. Yet, you know, if you talk to people, they always think, well, lungs arose when,
*  you know, of course, they're related to living on land. No, they're not. They originally came out
*  in creatures living in water. And we've known that since Napoleon's expeditions to Egypt in
*  the early 1800s. And ever since. And what people started to do is they discovered, you know, in
*  dissecting new kinds of fish that they saw in Africa or in South America or in Australia,
*  they found that some fish have lungs, real lungs that are exactly like ours in many ways. And in
*  fact, if you look at a lot of fish, a lot of fish have a air sac that is connected to the gut tube
*  or related to the gut tube in developmental and development. And, you know, in some of those fish
*  that sack becomes lungs and others that sack becomes swim bladder, which they use for buoyancy.
*  So this air sac presence in fish is really ancient. And in fact, an air sac that functions as a lung
*  is ancient still. So, you know, what is it doing? Well, in fish that have lungs, they have both gills
*  and lungs. And more often than not, they're using their gills. They're, you know, sitting in water,
*  just like any good old fish and breathing, right? But water, you know, the oxygen concentration
*  in water can vary a lot. It can vary a lot from month to month, season to season, and so forth.
*  And so there are times when the oxygen content of water is not sufficient to support an animal's
*  life. And what they'll do is that those cases, they'll go to the surface and actually gulp air
*  into their lungs and then go back down. And so lungs are sort of an accessory organ that allow
*  fish to exploit water that has variable oxygen concentrations throughout the year. And there are
*  lots of strategies that fish have to do this. Some have lungs and others breathe through their skin.
*  Still others will vascularize parts of their mouth and use that as a respiratory organ. So there's
*  lots of little different indentions that happen in evolution to allow fish to breathe air. Air
*  breathing in fish is very, very common. But lungs are a very ancient one. And so our distant relatives
*  who originally took the first steps to walk on land, they didn't need to evolve lungs. They
*  already existed. Is it safe to say that the lungs always came from swim bladders or air sacs or
*  something like that? Was there some prior purpose that it developed? Yeah, it's safe to say that the
*  lungs actually originally rose developmentally as an out pocket of the gut tube. So during development,
*  the tube that forms the gut it develops there. And then it out pockets, forms an out pouch.
*  And in some fish that pouch becomes lungs and others it becomes swim bladders. So they're
*  related developmentally. But the whole thing is it's the common developmental process that gives
*  rise to both. And pretty much all fish have one or the other. Yeah, good. And this is a good segue.
*  Thank you for doing my work there. Because one of the lessons of your book is that one of the major
*  sort of resources for doing this repurposing is tinkering with our development, right? That's right.
*  There's this famous but slightly exaggerated idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Tell us that
*  story a little bit and maybe we can work salamanders in there at some point because the salamander
*  stuff was just amazing. Yeah, it's really cool. So, you know, ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,
*  a lot of us learned it in high school. I did. I learned it in junior high. And it was like a
*  little jingle we'd all sing in like, you know, the third week of evolution or something like that.
*  And as most people know, it's this notion that an older notion that claims that during the course
*  of development going from egg to adult, you know, through the different stages of embryology,
*  organisms, creatures would track their evolutionary history. So if you look at a mammal,
*  it would go through a fish stage, an amphibian stage, a reptile stage, and so forth. And this was
*  right after Darwin, you know, wrote The Origin of Species, Ernst Heckel, great German biologist,
*  really promulgated this theory, pushed it along. And there are other versions of recapitulation as
*  well. There was one that actually came out before Darwin. And that basically said that, you know,
*  creatures look most similar as embryos, they tend to get look very different as adults. That's
*  actually a much more modern concept, even though it's the older one in many ways. But anyway,
*  these were very foundational concepts. It turns out that, you know, the biology is a world of
*  exceptions, particularly for ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny. And there are so many exceptions.
*  You should probably tell us what ontogeny and phylogeny are.
*  Yeah, sorry about that. So ontogeny is another word for development. Phylogeny is another word
*  for evolutionary history. So development, you know, tracks evolutionary history. That's
*  ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, basically means in English, development tracks evolutionary history.
*  And so that was a very dominant theory, worldview for a period of time. It turns out to be wrong,
*  though there are cases where it does that. You know, so there are some cases where we do see
*  in individual traits, that the development will track evolutionary history, but it's certainly
*  not true as a sort of a law of nature, like heckle and his contemporaries proposed.
*  So it does seem to be true that in the embryos, etc. of various species, you see features that
*  are in common with very, very different species, presumably because of our common ancestry.
*  That's correct. So you know, we see a ton of that. In fact, that's we see so much common in
*  development. And that's, you know, when you look at an early embryo of a fish and a human,
*  you'll find enormous number of similarities in the skull bones and the digestive system and the
*  excretory system and so forth. But it's not like we track evolutionary history. It's just that we
*  begin from a common stage of development, more or less, or our early stage of development tend
*  to be much more similar is kind of the idea there. But, you know, the relationship of development,
*  embryology to evolution has long been a source of fascination for scientists in my field. I mean,
*  it's, it's really the embryo has always held this special place because you think about it,
*  you know, here I'm studying evolutionary history, and I'm looking at great transformations,
*  you know, in the history of life. But what happens in development? Great transformations like happen
*  every hour. You know, you go from, you know, right organs appear out of, you know, you begin
*  as a single cell, that the cell doubles and doubles and doubles and doubles. And eventually,
*  you get germ layers, these different layers that form different tissues, the body and then the heart
*  emerges, central nervous system emerges, these things emerge over time. And part of the fascination,
*  which I felt as a graduate student, you know, when you're looking at an embryo, you're looking at
*  an organism being built, it's a it's a really beautiful thing. And when we can compare, you
*  know, embryos of different creatures, say a fish and a mammal, you begin to see how you can begin
*  to explain the differences between them by differences in the way they're built, right?
*  And that's a very powerful way to look at evolution. Which reminds me, I wanted to ask a
*  little bit more about the history of Darwin. This is out of order, but that's okay. You know, Darwin
*  correctly gets credit for natural selection, etc. But there were ideas floating around that,
*  you know, species evolved in some very generalized sense without necessarily all the mechanisms of
*  random mutation and natural selection, right? Oh, that's correct. I mean, the notions of evolution
*  were around before Darwin, you mentioned Lamarck, he was before Darwin, Darwin's own grandfather,
*  Erasmus Darwin had a notion of evolution. And in fact, when Darwin was working on his theory of
*  evolution, other people were coming up with it at the same time, Alfred Russel Wallace, and a few
*  other people, you know, independently. So yeah, the idea has been out there. And in fact, many of the
*  ideas we use in an evolutionary concept, originally came about in before Darwin. So this notion of
*  about embryos being very similar, more similar to one another than adults, that was something that
*  was pre Darwinian. Yeah, that's just amazing to me. So they already had that idea even.
*  Oh, yeah. See, they were, they were really trying to explain diversity, you know, some of them in
*  my new book is trying to explain diversity. How do we, how do we know how do we explain and understand,
*  you know, the diversity of life we see on our planet, right? Well, people have been out after
*  that for a long time before Darwin. It's just they weren't using natural selection as a mechanism,
*  they saw, you know, work of a creator, but they were looking for order and rules
*  that explained that underneath diversity that that explained it, you know, and a lot of those
*  ideas that they developed in the pre Darwinian context actually apply very well in the evolutionary
*  one. Did anyone have the idea that, you know, God did it, and it was designed, but God's plan
*  involved species changing over time from something simple to the incredible diversity we see today?
*  The I'm not aware of that particular view, because one of the challenges for that,
*  some listener probably would know it, I don't. However, one of the challenges for that was to
*  accept that you'd have to accept that species are imperfect, and they go extinct. And the concept of
*  extinction was a relatively new one in biology, believe it or not. You know, it has its own history,
*  but it really wasn't until soon before Darwin that people really accepted the reality of
*  extinction. You know, so if you don't have extinction, you know, and if species are perfect,
*  and then it's hard to have a notion of evolution. And so the it's the idea extinction was itself
*  part and the understanding of evolution of extinction was really essential for Darwin
*  and other approach and other people's perspectives on evolution as well. So there was still some
*  picture that, you know, nature was kind of a perfect kind of setup, and there was no reason
*  for it to change over time. And that was part of the cultural change that Darwin wrote in on. Yeah.
*  And that was kind of the dominant worldview. But these folks, and many of them who make it into
*  the book, we're really looking for order and diversity, rules and diversity, you know, what
*  explains why a fish looks the way it does, and a human, and they were trying to do it in a world
*  where these species are fixed and not changing. But in doing that, they devise tools, conceptual
*  tools that we use today. One of them is this notion called homology, where, you know, again,
*  sort of it has pre-Darwinian roots, but it translated very well for Darwin, the idea that
*  you can compare similar structures in different species, you know, that you can compare a vertebra
*  from a fish to a reptile, you know, to a bird to a human, and you can compare the same vertebra
*  among these different things. That was a notion that came up in the pre-Darwinian world. But yet,
*  you know, Darwin basically, you know, put a, you know, put a mechanistic, a material spin on it,
*  basically saying the reason why you can do that is because these things share an evolutionary history.

*  I think this is just a wonderful example of how, you know, there were the, there is a connection
*  between development and evolution. Yeah. Salamanders. I love salamanders. So I did
*  part of my PhD thesis on salamanders. I just love them. And then I did my postdoc on them.
*  I mean, I didn't grow up as a kid who loved, you know, herp, herps, you know, reptiles and amphibians
*  and stuff. But as a graduate student, I just fell in love with these little creatures and they just
*  have such a history. So, you know, one of my favorite stories is Auguste du Mareil, who was a
*  professor at the Museum of the Natural History in Paris. You know, he and his dad were experts,
*  academic, academician experts on reptiles and amphibians. And this is a time of discovery sort
*  of in the mid late 1800s, right after Darwin, about 1864. So, and so du Mareil would get
*  shipments of critters from expeditions around the world that folks found and they'd want them to,
*  you know, figure it out. Well, one day he gets a box with, I think, you know, six salamanders inside.
*  And these were from Mexico. And he looks in the box and he folks sent it to him because Darwin
*  just published this theory and the salamanders that he was sent, they had an aquatic tail,
*  big fleshy lobed tail, they had external gills, they were fully aquatic. And they sent them to
*  du Mareil thinking, well, here's a living missing link, right? This is kind of like a creature that
*  maybe will tell us something about how fish evolved to walk on land. So,
*  did they know about salamanders at all in Europe at that time?
*  Yes, they did. Yeah, because there are European salamanders. So they knew quite a bit about them,
*  you know, just their local species. But this from Mexico was weird because it had this,
*  this is a giant adult, fully, you know, full adult with all these aquatic features. So he's like,
*  oh, this is great. So he put them in his menagerie. And the salamanders are easy to care for. You can
*  leave them alone for long periods of time. And that's exactly what he did. And he came back after
*  a period of time, and he went back to his box. And he looked in his box, and he saw his, you know,
*  fully adult salamanders that were aquatic with external gills. But then there was a whole other
*  type of salamander there, fully adult reproducing, big, with no external gills, a fully terrestrial
*  body, no aquatic lobed tail, no external gills. He looked at it, it's like these are two different
*  genera. Okay, something happened in that box. Yeah, it's like there was this was a magic box.
*  Well, he was a scientist, he didn't follow the magic reasoning. So he said, What is going on here?
*  Something amazing happened. I mean, it's almost like, you know, he put gorillas in the cage,
*  he came back and found chicks and gorillas the next year. I mean, it was like that kind of thing.
*  So, so he did his he did his homework, and he started to study their embryology. And he found
*  that this difference is really a simple shift of development. And it showed how a simple shift
*  of development can bring about changes across the entire animal. So what happened is, during the
*  normal life cycle of one of these salamanders, you know, they have an egg, they hatch from the egg,
*  they swim around in water with external gills and fleshy tails that are like a fin. And then
*  at some point in their life, they swim around this aquatic larvae, right? And then they get
*  bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. And then eventually, at some point in their life,
*  they undergo metamorphosis. And metamorphosis, hormone is triggered, thyroid hormone, and they
*  lose the external gills, the tail changes, the head changes, all that good stuff. And what Dumaral
*  realized, as well as some other people at the time, was what happened in his box is the salamanders,
*  the aquatic salamanders reproduced, but their offspring underwent metamorphosis, which those
*  other ones didn't. And so there was a, the trick there is whether you undergo metamorphosis or not,
*  which can be triggered by external cues in these species. So it's really remarkable. He was able
*  to show, and this was a huge insight, that a subtle change in development, maybe just changing, you
*  know, thyroid hormone and metamorphosis, can have changes across the body, and two animals can look
*  entirely different as a result of that. So that work was really foundational in the sense that
*  what it did is it turned people on to thinking about, well, what kinds of subtle changes in
*  development can bring about some of these huge changes in the history of life that Darwin was
*  talking about? And it turns out one simple way is just to change the timing of developmental events,
*  extend development, stop it early, that sort of stuff. Yeah, I mean, it's amazing to me because,
*  uh, just to just be super clear, that other form that did undergo the metamorphosis is completely
*  land-based. It doesn't look like it has any aquatic paraphernalia at all. Is that correct?
*  That's right. That's correct. Yeah. So I mean, the body looks totally different, right? And the way
*  it feeds is totally different, the whole thing. So, and it's a really just a subtle change in
*  level of hormone at one time of development. And also the fact that it can, it can just get stuck
*  in that pre-metamorphosis stage and still flourish, right? It's a perfectly working
*  salamander, but it's an aquatic salamander. And by the way, it's really as full of the
*  critters living in water, right? So, you know, so, and think about that here, the whole water land
*  transition happens in one animal through the course of its life. That's why development's
*  interesting, right? And here I go study fossils and look at this guy. So, but that's really amazing
*  because, you know, then, then the hunt is on. Well, what kind of changes to development can
*  bring about the evolutionary changes we see. And again, it's these changes of timing,
*  developmental events. It's now we know it's a lot of molecular changes and how genes are
*  controlled, turned on and off during development. You know, there's, I mean, that's been a,
*  that's been such a powerful and powerfully important tradition in my field of biology,
*  this relationship between development and evolution. It's its own subfield now.
*  Yeah. And, but I mean, you, you, you've already now mentioned something that is crucial to this
*  story as good as the 19th century was about figuring out all sorts of weird things about
*  animals. These days we have information about DNA and genes that is really changing the whole way
*  we think about this story. That's correct. And so the predicate for all this were people like
*  Dumaril who were studying the embryos who were studying the bodies. But the game changer for us
*  is really the advent of molecular biology, you know, and it, and it's, it, and it's power to
*  explain. And, and it gives us a whole new set of tools to approach these classic questions,
*  you know, and some of the biggest discoveries started, well, again, they have predicates as
*  well, but the 1980s and 1990s were quite a remarkable time where molecular tools were
*  getting powerful enough and cheap enough and could be applied to a number of different species
*  that we began to see the relationships between genes and development in the embryo, you know,
*  how genes control that development and how changes to genes can bring about changes to
*  development and ultimately changes to evolution. So that has been incredibly important and
*  incredibly powerful. And in, and some of those initial discoveries were game changers for me
*  in my own growth as a scientist, I had, you know, I trained to be a paleontologist
*  and I was studying how to find fossils, you know, the techniques that led to the discovery of
*  Tiktaalik, right? But I remember back in the 80s, there were a bunch of papers were being
*  published. And they, I was made aware of them by a fellow graduate student and showing that we were
*  seeing in flies genes that build the bodies of these animals, genes that control where, why a
*  wing is in one part of the body and an antenna is in another part of the body. And that was exciting
*  enough. But what was even more exciting was later papers showing that not these genes aren't present
*  only in flies, but versions of these same genes are present in salamanders, frogs, worms, mice,
*  and people, you know, that there's a common toolkit, versions of the same genes are doing similar
*  things in many different creatures. And for me, that was a glimmers of a new biology. And for a
*  lot of people, it was glimmers of a new biology in the 80s. And so that's when I decided to add the
*  molecular biology toolkit to my own repertoire, you know, as a scientist. And we don't think that
*  that's convergent evolution. We think that this is just a set of genes that have been with us a long
*  time. Oh my gosh, yeah, these are ancient genes. And these ancient genes aren't the same, but they
*  were, you know, they evolved, you know, in the distant past of animal life. And then, you know,
*  there've been rounds of where these genes have been duplicated, modified, repurposed, just like
*  structures, genes are repurposed, you know, and so the rules we see for the evolution of anatomy,
*  they apply very well to the, you know, the tinkering, the repurposing, the co-option,
*  the duplication, all these things that we see in the evolution of structures, they happen at the
*  level of genes, you know, so these genes are ancient, but they've also witnessed a lot of
*  changes. The, you know, flies have only one set of these genes, we have four, so they've been
*  duplicated over time, they've gained new functions and more complexity over time, that kind of thing.
*  I do, I'm sure that the 80s and 90s were great, but I don't want to skip over, like, all the
*  really charming early technologies that were there for thinking and measuring genes and their
*  differences and so forth. I mean, I guess I'll let you pick your favorite stories from the book,
*  but the idea of, like, putting little molecules in a gel and pulling them across with an
*  electromagnetic field to see how heavy they were, because I think that these days were spoiled and
*  people probably think, well, just, you know, look at the DNA and figure out what it says,
*  but they didn't have that ability back then.
*  No, one of my favorite stories is Sumo Ono. Ono was a researcher at the City of Hope,
*  California, and he was interested in genetics, hugely interested in genetics, and his, because
*  he loved horses, and he found he couldn't train, you know, that there's only so much you can train
*  horses. He said, you know, horses no good, it's no good, it's all about the genes. So because of
*  that love of horses and his knowledge of them, he decided to study genes, right? And so he designed
*  one of the greatest techniques. So he looked at chromosomes, right? Chromosomes sit in the nucleus
*  and chromosomes are bundles of DNA, and he wanted to see, you know, can he characterize differences
*  among species by looking at differences of their chromosomes, right? This is in the 40s and 50s,
*  and, you know, he didn't have much technology, you know, at his fingertips. What he had was a
*  microscope, and he had a camera, and he could develop pictures with that camera. So what he
*  did was he took pictures of, like, different species. He took a salamanders, he took
*  rhinos, he took people, he would just get cells, right? Cell samples from zoos, and he would look
*  at the nuclei and look at the chromosomes in the nuclei. So he'd take pictures of all these things,
*  and what he did was, lowest technology possible, he took pictures of the chromosomes,
*  printed out the pictures, cut them out, and weighed them. So he would basically take pictures
*  of the chromosomes of a salamander, cut them out, and weigh them, and then take pictures of the
*  chromosomes of a human, cut them out, and weigh them. And he used those weights as proxy for the
*  amount of DNA in the cell. Better make sure the zoom was the same in both pictures, right? Yeah,
*  well, what he found was that the salamanders have, like, 10 times more genes, chromosomal stuff,
*  than humans. And he was one of the first persons using this low-tech technique to show that the
*  amount of genetic material in the nucleus, and what we know now is the amount of DNA in the genome,
*  is unrelated to the complexity of the organism. Yeah, I was going to say, that's not possible,
*  because aren't we, like, way more superior to these little salamanders? How can they have so much
*  more genetic? They can flip their tongue in a millisecond, their body length in a millisecond,
*  some of these things. So that's pretty superior. It depends how you measure it. But yeah, I mean,
*  we're much more complicated in a lot of ways, cognitively and so forth. And yeah, he found that
*  that's unrelated to the amount of genetic material in the cell. So he was one of the first people to
*  show that, you know, the amount of genetic material in a cell is unrelated to a critter's complexity.
*  You know, he looked at plants, like lilies, they have an enormous amount of that. Yeah, so that was
*  a huge surprise. And then he was able to look at those chromosomes, because you can add dye to the
*  nucleus, and like, you can begin to see the chromosomes, little stripes on them. He began
*  to see when he looked in detail at the stripes, looked like whole sections of stripes were just
*  like repeated and duplicated. Like somebody took a Xerox machine to the chromosome of a salamander,
*  just duplicated whole chunks of it. So he came up with a notion of, with all this low tech
*  technology stuff, that the idea was that perhaps one of the major sources of innovation for new
*  genetic material and evolution is gene duplication, is duplicating old genes. So that's a great way of
*  co-opting and repurposing. And so that turns out to be a very profound discovery, because the more
*  we look at gene sequences, we can now sequence genes in an afternoon, we begin to see just how
*  important that is, that there are whole gene families, which might contain hundreds of genes,
*  all related to each other by history, rounds of duplication in their history. And we see that in
*  tissue and tissue over and over again. I just love that story, because here's a person who had a great
*  idea, found a very low tech way to test it, and opened up a whole new field of research.
*  Yeah, no, it gives hope for the ingenuity of scientists and
*  interesting to speculate about how it will be equally ingenious in the years to come.
*  But good, so let's get down to brass tacks about the genes and how they work. So we assume we know
*  the basic story, but an important part of the story that you tell in Some Assembly Required is that,
*  of course, we have genes, that is to say, we have segments of our DNA that code for proteins,
*  and then the proteins go and do useful things in our body. But then there's other parts of the DNA
*  that are regulating when the genes are switched on and switched off. And there's also junk DNA,
*  and how does all that fit together? And how does it play into the story of major transitions?
*  Okay, so just to set the stage, right. So, you know, DNA sits in the nucleus of all of ourselves,
*  right? And in each cell, there's about six feet. So if you have a strand of DNA, it's about,
*  if you were to unwind it, it's about six feet long, you know, sitting inside the nucleus. So
*  it's packed super tightly. Think about that. You know, we have about four trillion cells.
*  So if you put all our DNA end to end, you know, if all our cells stretched out and laid it end to
*  end, it would go almost to Pluto, right? So that's just, think about just how much genetic
*  material is in our bodies, and how tightly packed it is in each cell. It's kind of mind blowing.
*  Now, when we think of genes, when we think of DNA, right, the DNA is a sequence of bases,
*  right? So it's a gene sequence sits in a double helix, it's packed really tightly.
*  You know, so there's a part of the DNA that contains the information to make a protein,
*  right? That's the protein coding part. But there's a whole other sex, parts of this that
*  does other things, some of which we don't even, we're still grappling with. But to give you a
*  little perspective, the gene part of our genome, right, that part that makes proteins is only 2%
*  of our genome. Well, so genes only make up about 2% of our genome. So the protein coding part,
*  the part that contains the information to make the proteins is just a tiny fraction of the genome,
*  the rest of it kind of controls the activity of those things. Is that is that completely true? Or
*  is it's also true that some of it is just kind of wasted space? It could be. Yeah, it could be
*  wasted space, or it could be space we don't know its function yet. So a lot of the activity of DNA
*  is related to its dynamism, how it opens and closes, forms loops and on itself. And so those
*  spacer regions could have lots of importance in terms of the overall geometry of the DNA,
*  but the individual sequence might not matter as much. Who knows? Okay, that's interesting.
*  But there's still a bit of a mystery, still quite a mystery for us. And boy, there's a lot of ink
*  spilled on debates around that. So but you know, you think about this way, if you take us the cells
*  in our body, pretty much all have the same DNA inside them. What's different is they're making
*  different proteins. So the cells in our in the retina of our eye, compared to the cells are at
*  our in the skin of our fingertip, you know, they have the same DNA inside them. But the DNA in the
*  retina cells is making proteins that builds and keeps a retina functioning. The cells inside the
*  tip of our finger, you know, they're they have the same DNA, but the genes that are active are the
*  ones making the the skin tissues, right, proteins that make skin give skin tissue its properties.
*  So what's different here is which genes are turned on and off in each kind of cell and each kind of
*  tissue. So it's not the DNA per se that's utterly different. It's what's what's controlling their
*  activity. So people have really since the oh, I'd say the mid late 80s, really focused on that,
*  what are these genetic switches? What controls whether a gene is turned on and off? And, you know,
*  once we know that, is that a big player in evolutionary change? And it turns out yes,
*  yes, and yes, that's the understanding these switches is, is so important, not only to understand
*  what makes tissues different in health and disease, but also to understand evolution to say, well,
*  you know, it's not like you have a new, you know, protein coding gene, it's you have the same gene,
*  it's just you're turning on and off in different places and different times in development, you
*  know, so it all comes back to development. And what these genes are doing in development. And if
*  you're turning on genes and turning them off in different times and places, you can make really
*  big changes, right? I mean, is it possible to explain to us at the molecular biology level,
*  how the information encoded in one side of gene in one side of the DNA actually does turn on and
*  off the other sets of DNA? So what you have is a bunch of so you have the you have the gene,
*  the protein coding gene, and lying next to it is usually a little sequence that when something
*  attaches to that sequence, some very important things attached to that sequence, it'll turn the
*  gene on or turn it off depending on you know, what the nature of that little section is. So
*  it all comes down to sort of molecular keys that come in. So basically, one part of the genome
*  might fold over to touch that switch. And if it does that, it activates the gene. So there are
*  lots of little triggers that would control these things. But you have to think about this as a very
*  dynamic chemical landscape, where chemicals are being, you know, proteins and other factors are
*  being made. And as they do that, they're attaching to these different sorts of switch sequences in
*  the genome, which then control the activity of the gene. So it's three dimensional structure,
*  you have the you have the, you have the genome opening and closing. So when the genome is closed,
*  it's not making proteins and you know, sort of open up in areas where proteins will make it. So
*  first has to open up. So there's that dynamism of the level of the genome, then certain sections have
*  to come in and touch these switches actually connect to them to activate the genes. So there's
*  a whole sort of Rube Goldberg kind of set of activities that have to happen for a gene to
*  turn on. Does the three dimensional structure change differ from one kind of cell to the other?
*  It can. Yeah, very much so. And so in fact, that's a very active field of research right now in
*  molecular biology is understanding this three dimensional changes. And it's really come,
*  it's really gotten very big is, is now we can see the genome, we can begin to map it, we begin to
*  see it at work. And it's, you know, what surprises everybody is just how utterly dynamic it is, and
*  how very important this three dimensional structure really is. And there's lots of
*  mysteries here. We don't there's a lot we don't understand. And because it's it's filled with
*  puzzles. But one thing we do understand is just, you know, how these changes can affect evolution,
*  and that is pretty clear. That is, if you, you know, you change a switch, you're going to change the,
*  you know, ability to make a new, you'll be able to make some new things in evolution, a new tissue,
*  new protein, and so forth. And that fits in with the connection with development, because obviously
*  development is all about deciding which kind of cell I'm going to be and where I'm going to fit in,
*  and therefore what kind of what parts of my DNA are going to be useful. That's right. And you know,
*  it's basically it's, you know, if you think about, you know, the the genome of an organism,
*  it's basically forming a recipe for development. You know, you're changing the ingredients, you
*  can change the genes, you can change the process, which is these switches. And what you do is subtle
*  changes to these things in the embryo can have large consequences, you know, to anatomy, to
*  evolutionary history, just like we saw with salamanders. And so what we can now do is look
*  at that at the genetic level. So does this help explain some features of major transitions? I mean,
*  does it make it easier to understand how major transitions can happen once we understand this
*  picture of certain coding areas of the DNA and other regulatory or expressive regions of the DNA?
*  Oh, very much so. It can show, for instance, and it's kind of getting back to one of the
*  themes we talked about earlier with the fossil record, is that you really don't have to often
*  invent whole new things to have great transitions happen. You know, a lot of great transitions might
*  not involve as much, you know, new genes, as it would involve using old genes in new ways,
*  right? So using genes that exist, but you're changing when and where they're active.
*  So again, it's like kind of the, you know, the raw material for these transitions exists before
*  the transitions themselves. You have the genes, just using them in new ways. That's part of it.
*  There are cases where lots of new genes come about, but using old genes in new ways turns out to be a
*  very profound part of these great transitions. We see that over and over again. The other thing that
*  is getting renewed attention, which is really fascinating, and we see this over and over again,
*  we see this in the, you know, the origin of new biological inventions, but we also see it in the,
*  you know, the human technological realm, is that one thing that's very common is multiples. That
*  is, you'll see the same, I'll call it evolutionary invention, appear independently in different
*  species at the same time. That is, the same solution to a problem appears independently,
*  you know, in different creatures that are not directly related to one another. So it means
*  it's happened separately. And one of the reasons why that may happen is if, if organisms, if
*  creatures have the same set of genes functioning in the same ways, it makes similar outcomes more
*  likely, right? So this notion that you can have parallel evolution or independent evolution of the
*  same structure is something that's gaining renewed attention from the molecular realm,
*  because if organisms have similar genes and they're using those genes in similar ways,
*  then they might produce the same kinds of mutations independently that natural selection
*  can work on. So it's not random. Because they're building on some sort of common starting point.
*  They're not just, like you say, not just randomly choosing crazy things. That's right. If you have a
*  recipe to make cupcakes, you know, there's only certain ways you can change that recipe, right,
*  and have it still be recognizably cupcake. So yeah, and you'll hit upon the same, you know,
*  if different people are making cupcakes through the same recipe and playing with in different ways,
*  they may come up with the same kind of cupcakes independently. So this helps explain certain
*  examples of convergent evolution? It does very much so. Convergent evolution can happen for
*  lots of reasons. So first is, you know, and a very common reason is, you know, common adaptive
*  solution, you know, if creatures are going to fly, they're gonna need some sort of wing, right? And,
*  you know, you see that over and over again. And you see, you know, white color patterns appearing
*  independently in polar animals, that kind of stuff. But the other reason why these sorts of
*  that pattern may happen is, again, common recipes, common, you know, common genes,
*  that sort of common recipes to build bodies, common genes, that sort of thing.
*  And, and does it help explain this puzzle that's always there in evolution, what I think of as the
*  statistical mechanics of mutations, like most mutations are presumably really bad.
*  Yeah, most are not so good. But, you know, it doesn't take many to many beneficial ones to
*  really take off, you know, so a beneficial mutation can gain traction very, very readily.
*  But, you know, we talked about mutation being random, it's really not random, right? It's,
*  you know, it's, it's only random with respect to like predicting the future. I mean, it's like,
*  you know, just because a creature may need to walk on land in 100 million years doesn't mean
*  it's going to come up with mutations to do that. You know, so it's non random with respect to the
*  needs of the organism in the future, right? But I mean, it's random with respect to the, excuse me,
*  you know, it's random with respect to that. But it's not random with respect to
*  everything else. You know, certain mutations are more common than others based on what happens in
*  the genome. Certain mutations are more likely to be beneficial than others based on what happens
*  in the genome and in development. You know, so, yeah, so when we talk about random, you have to
*  be very specific about it. It's random with respect to predicting the future. It's not random.
*  Well, you talk in the book about the idea of hopeful monsters and how they kind of got you
*  in trouble as a graduate student. I got me in trouble with Ernst Mayr in a very big way. Yeah,
*  I really, so I used to have tea. So one of the great gigs of my graduate student life was,
*  I don't know how this happened. I was not a great graduate student, but Mayr took a shine in me.
*  Ernst Mayr is this great eminence and you know, the new synthesis of evolutionary biology was
*  a huge eminence. He was about in his mid 80s at the time, he was pretty old and had a lot of
*  history and he loved history of science and philosophy of science. And he was there during
*  one of the pivotal times in our field. And for some reason took a shine in me and he used to
*  invite me for Thursday teas up into his office on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative
*  Zoology at Harvard. And I, you know, made the pilgrimage there every, every Thursday,
*  you know, and I was up in the bird collection. It smelled like mothballs and it was this old
*  creaky floors and Mayr would, you know, sit in his chair and just wax about great people in the field.
*  And he always encouraged me to come with a, a book, a paper, a question to stimulate it. So I,
*  I came one day with this book called The Material Basis of Evolution, which is a recent reprint. It
*  had an introduction by Steve Gould that just came out like, you know, a couple of weeks before, a
*  month before. And I brought it up to Mayr and say, what do you, look at this new thing. What do you
*  think of Gould's preface? And he just turned beet red and shot me this glare, like, kid, I'm going
*  to eviscerate you. And he went to his filing cabinet, came back with this paper. He says,
*  I wrote animal species and evolution in response to page 95 of this piece of crap. And he threw it
*  down on me. This, this yellowed reprint by Goldschmidt, which laid out the theory that you
*  can have, you know, major evolutionary transitions in one step in one mutation, so-called macro
*  mutations. Now I knew Goldschmidt was a bit of a whipping boy at the time, but I wanted to talk
*  to Mayr about, you know, what he thought about it was, you know, that kind of thing. Oh boy. Yeah.
*  I was just, it was something else. So the, so Goldschmidt's idea, the one that got me so in
*  trouble with Mayr, oh, by the way, the tease did continue. I think it was a famously contentious
*  place, Harvard evolutionary biology, right? Oh, I'm sorry. Harvard evolutionary biology seems like a
*  famously contentious place. There were big personalities at the time. Yeah. Cause you had E.O. Wilson and
*  Steve Gould at the time, Richard Lewontin, Mayr. Yeah. So I had to navigate that a little bit.
*  Anyway, so I did so pretty much unscathed. Anyway, so the idea was that you, you know,
*  Goldschmidt proposed, he studied development, right? And he studied genes. He said, look, subtle
*  changes in development can yield big effects. So, Hey, the first bird hatched out of a reptile egg.
*  He said, basically one mutation, you know, one set of mutations, you got a bird out of a reptile.
*  And, you know, that was not well received for good reason. And there were a lot of reasons why that
*  theory was bound to fail, but it's reappeared in different ways over the years. But there's,
*  it really is not, not a very viable theory that despite the fact that, you know, you, you can find
*  mutations that will do big things to the animal. It turns out that those big mutations are almost
*  exclusively, you know, lethal. It's really the small mutations that are most likely to be beneficial.
*  So it's the accumulation of these. So that's sorry, that is the current way of thinking that in fact,
*  it is the accumulation of tiny things that is much more driving the engine of evolution.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But that accumulation can happen pretty quickly, right? Over geological timescales.
*  It doesn't, you know, it's, you know, the geological timescales I deal with are in the millions,
*  hundreds of thousands to millions to tens of millions of years. You know, we're talking about
*  these accumulation of these mutations can happen much, much, much faster than that,
*  particularly knowing ways the genome can change. Well, I was going to ask this about the, you know,
*  issue of missing links when you've begun such a transition, you know, there's no teleology,
*  you're not aiming for some target, but once you've sort of been able to enter a slightly
*  different ecological niche, is it true that then the rate of evolution is faster for species like
*  you than those that are happily in their equilibrium and therefore there are fewer records of those in
*  the fossils? Oh, that's an interesting point. So there are cases where creatures enter a new
*  zone, like ecological zone, and the evolutionary rate takes off. But there are other cases where
*  it's a delayed fuse where something happens and that diversification, you know, the explosive
*  diversification doesn't happen until much later. And we really don't know why that happens. That's
*  a bit of a puzzle, you know, why you might have that. Yeah. So that's still very much an open
*  question. Okay. I always like to, you know, give the undergrads and graduate students out there in
*  the audience problems to work on. So that sounds, it's always good to find the open questions.
*  We got lots of those. Yeah, exactly. That's what makes it fun, definitely. Well, and so
*  there's also, you already mentioned this, I think, very briefly, but let's link it back in here now
*  that we're talking about the transitions at the molecular level, the idea of genes jumping from
*  one animal to another and being borrowed, right? Like you tell the stories of how viruses, virus
*  genes got embedded in other people's genes. I think this is something obviously that is not part of the
*  classic story of molecular biology and evolution. No, it's amazing. So like when you look at a
*  human genome sequence, we've sequenced, you know, we could sequence genomes now pretty quickly,
*  right? When you look at a gene sequence, what you find is in humans, about almost 10%, about 8%
*  of our genome, of our entire genome, are defunct viruses, viruses that viral sequences that no
*  longer function, you know, but they're there. It's like a fossil graveyard, you know, a graveyard of
*  ancient viruses that attacked our genome, became part of our genome, but then got knocked out.
*  Every time I talk to a biologist, it's very important that they creep out the audience
*  at some point or another. That's my goal here. I mean, my goal is to creep everybody out.
*  And, you know, think about it, it gets even creepier still when you think that, okay,
*  only 2% of our genomes are our genes, you know, but 8% are like defunct viruses.
*  But there's also something else that's really amazing about these. So viruses are, as we know,
*  as is very relevant in today's world, viruses are, we live in a balance with viruses, right? They're
*  continually infecting us and our internal mechanisms, whether it's our immune system
*  or our genome, are trying to knock them out, are trying to disable them. But there's something else
*  that's happening as well. And this is something that's pretty new. And it begins with, there's a
*  researcher, I talked about in the book, Jason Shepard, at the University of Utah. He's, you
*  know, he's neurobiologist, not interested in viruses. He was an MD, though, he studied his
*  microbiology, but he's interested in memory, you know, and his research in memory led him to a gene
*  called ARC, A-R-C, because ARC is a gene that is involved in memory in people, mutations in that
*  associate with dementia, schizophrenia. Mutations in ARC in mice mean that they lose their memories.
*  They can't, they can do a maze, but the next day they forget their solution. And so he's studying
*  ARC, that's his thing, right? And because he wants, he cares about neurodegenerative diseases in
*  memory. And he's studying ARC, and he's studying, when you study a gene, you're going to study its
*  protein. So he looks at the protein that ARC made, and he pops it in a microscope after some, some
*  effort. It turns out he saw these spheres, these spherules, and he's like looking at them thinking,
*  I saw, I've seen these spherules before. I, you know, in his microbiology class in medical school,
*  that's those, the capsules that look like the virus, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. He's like,
*  wait a minute, this looks more like a virus than a memory protein. So he runs down to the next
*  building to talk to people, AIDS experts, doesn't tell him what is on the slide, says identify this
*  for me. These AIDS experts look at the, the HIV experts look at the slide and they say, oh, that's,
*  you know, HIV, the virus causes AIDS. He says, nope, it's ARC, the memory gene in people. And
*  they're like, what? Do not trust biologists bearing gifts. Yeah. So what happens is, what Jason
*  Shepard showed in his lab and some others as well, is that what ARC is, is this an ancient virus that
*  invaded a distant ancestor of people and that virus, instead of being knocked out by the genome,
*  it was domesticated. It was repurposed. It was like, sorry, you got a new job. You're no longer
*  going to infect us. You're going to make a protein that's going to be used in memory. And the, what's
*  relevant here is that capsule that is made by HIV and ARC helps the information, the genetic,
*  the capsules made to protect the genetic information of the virus as it goes from cell
*  to cell. So it makes HIV very effective in going from cell to cell, but that's exactly what makes
*  the ARC gene effective in making memories. It goes from neuron to neuron. So the, so this virus was
*  put to work, was repurposed, if you will, by our distant, the genome of our distant ancestors,
*  just how we don't know, but it was to play a role in memory. And we're finding that in all kinds of
*  other genes too, in genes that make the placenta. They, the proteins that make the placenta, some of
*  those genes were originally viruses that invaded the genome. It's all about repurposing. That's all
*  evolution ever does. It's repurpose. Yeah. It's either take something from something else and
*  repurpose it or repurpose your own genome. And, you know, it's mergers and acquisitions. It's claiming
*  things as well as your own. And so it's a real wild world, but you know, these viruses are not only
*  threats, but they're sources of genetic information, genetic novelty. They're sources of new genetic
*  stuff that occasionally have made a very big difference in our evolutionary history. And that's
*  one thing that, you know, within the last decade has become, you know, under, you know, under much
*  clearer focus. And it's pretty, really remarkable. And we should probably distinguish, because
*  probably many people have heard the story that you relate in the book about Lyn Margulis and the
*  mitochondria and so forth. And that's sort of, we absorbed little tiny organisms and made them part
*  of our cells. But mitochondria have separate DNA. This is what we're talking about now is actually
*  sticking segments of virus DNA into our DNA strands, right? Yeah. So what a virus does,
*  right, there are lots of different kinds of viruses. There's many different ways this happens,
*  but, you know, typically a virus will enter and then it, you know, goes into the genome of its
*  host and then commandeers the genome to make more copies of itself. You know, it's like the ultimate
*  parasite, right? It goes in there, makes copies of itself, takes it over, takes over the machinery,
*  makes more copies of itself. And, you know, there it goes. So what happens is sometimes the host
*  can take over the virus or knock off the virus, but also take it over to do new things. And that's
*  what we're seeing in some of these cases. So the viruses can be the source of genetic novelty,
*  right? New stuff as well. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. And I don't know how much you followed
*  the controversies over at what point do we stop calling this Darwinian evolution? I mean, obviously,
*  you know, Darwin said a lot of true things and then there was this new synthesis with genetics
*  and so forth. But the idea that we simply, you know, do sexual reproduction and some of our
*  DNA base pairs get mutated, but otherwise we just hand them on is way oversimplified, right? And so
*  at what point do we call it a new theory versus just tweaks on the old theory? Yeah, it's hard.
*  I mean, you think about what Darwin did, though. Darwin, the Argos species, the first edition was
*  1859, right? There was no knowledge of genetics whatsoever. Yeah. Okay. We didn't know anything.
*  Mendel didn't come till much later, let alone a knowledge of DNA. Yet that theory he proposed
*  before genetics kind of didn't make sense under the kind of inheritance that they thought then.
*  So in fact, some of the most, you know, trenchant criticisms of Darwin were about that, you know,
*  that there was no knowledge of genetics, with no knowledge of, you know, heredity. It was really
*  hard to think about how these changes could be sustained over time, though he did use artificial
*  selection, artificial breeding experiments as well in his argument. But you know, it's a good point.
*  You know, we have moved far beyond, but we're staying very much in the center of Darwin.
*  Natural selection is still the major mechanism of evolution. Common descent is still the major
*  pattern we see in the history of life, albeit with some exceptions where you have information
*  being traded among species. You know, when we talk about Darwin, we're really talking about
*  not just a body of theory, but a profound shift. The Darwinian revolution was a profound shift in
*  the way we see the natural world, how it came about, and our relationship to it. So when we
*  think about, you know, certain Darwinian biology, I kind of refer to it in those ways in terms of,
*  you know, the fruits of the Darwinian revolution. Yeah, yes and no, we're still using some of
*  Darwin's ideas. I mean, one of the main ideas in the book is actually a Darwinian one, the idea of
*  repurposing the idea that, you know, structures arise in one form originally, and then they change
*  function later on. But, you know, just amazing to me, I read the book, I did a deep dive back into
*  several of the editions of Darwin, different editions, in preparation for writing some
*  assembly required, and I was struck by so many things. I was struck by what a great
*  way he was able to marshal evidence, how he used it, what a great writer he was.
*  You know, not only producing evidence, but some of his prose is just really beautiful. I just would
*  sit there and read it over and over again. It was just amazing stuff. Just what a remarkably
*  talented human being. Yeah, we're lucky because of that, right? Because not all scientists are like
*  that, but he did have the ideas and was able to convey them in an especially compelling poetic
*  way. So that's nice. Yeah, so beautiful. It really is at every level, the intellectual level as well
*  as the aesthetic one. Yeah. All right, so I think that we're able to get some payoff here. So all
*  this understanding of genes and expression and regulation and so forth, tell us how this explains
*  how fish can develop hands. Well, I mean, my lab works on that. In the summer, we go out to find
*  fossils and the rest of the year we're working on the DNA of extant fish. So working on mice,
*  people were able to identify a series of genes and regulatory elements, elements that control
*  the activity of those genes that are deeply involved in making wrists and fingers and mice
*  and people and everything that has wrists and fingers. And you can identify those genes.
*  They showed, for instance, that if you say make a mouse lacking these genes, the mouse has a
*  humerus, a radius and all that, but no wrist and digits. If you mark the cells where these genes
*  are active, they're in the wrists and the digits. So these genes are wrist and digit genes. They're
*  necessary for the wrist and digit. Not necessarily sufficient. There are probably other ones as well,
*  but they're necessary. So my lab, as well as a bunch of others, have asked the question,
*  are these genes present in fish? The answer is yes, we've known that for a while. And if so,
*  are these genes involved in fish fin development? And again, if so, what are they doing in fish
*  fins? So that's what we've been looking at. Well, turns out, to make a very long story short,
*  this is like a 10-year research program of my lab, longer than Tiktaalik actually,
*  the search for Tiktaalik. That was six years. This was 10. But the central idea is that many
*  of the genes that make the wrists and digits of mice and people and birds and so forth
*  are present in fish, and they're making a terminal strip of tissue in those fins.
*  And that terminal strip of tissue gives rise to the fin rays. The spicules of bone that you see,
*  like if you look at a trout, when you look at its fins, it looks clear in the terminal end of the
*  fin with little rays inside, they're little bony rods. It makes those rods. And so what's remarkable
*  here is that there is a common toolkit to make appendages as different as people, mice, and fish,
*  fins and limbs, that those genes are there, that they're active, and that in all species,
*  they're active in making the terminal end of the fin. What's different is there's a switch in fish
*  that turns those cells where those genes are active into fin rays, whereas in us and mice
*  and others, it makes fingers and toes. So what we're able to see is that there's a common history,
*  genetic history, of limbs and fins, and that the differences among them aren't as much in
*  entirely new genes, but it's in using those genes in new ways and modifying their activity
*  in different ways. So there's a case where molecular biology has given us insights that
*  we might not have had otherwise, because if I was just looking at anatomy, I would never compare
*  fingers and toes with the fin rays of fish. But there is a clear-cut developmental connection
*  between them. And so now what we're doing in some other labs are looking at, okay, well,
*  what controls whether you have a finger or a fin ray? What are the molecular controls that
*  control how you make those different kinds of tissues? So as we open the whole thing,
*  it's when you have answers like we had with this research, now we can ask whole new kinds of powerful,
*  more precise questions. So these answers now set us up for a whole new set of experiments,
*  which we're doing now. Is this by going in and zapping some of the genes to kill
*  them off or keep them longer or and seeing what kind of organism results?
*  Yeah. So what we'll do is we could take the genes from a mouse and put them in a fish
*  and can see what they do. We could take the fish genes and put them in a mouse and see what they do
*  in that new environment. Turns out they function very well. I could take a shark gene from the fin
*  and put it in a mouse, some of these genes from a shark and put them into a mouse and it does
*  perfectly fine. Likewise, the mouse one in the shark. So we can make these swaps. We can also
*  knock these genes out. We can use CRISPR-Cas genome editing, you know, go in there and just
*  knock these genes out and delete them. We can add factors as well. So yeah, it's a real, you know,
*  house of horrors here. We could do it all. But what it shows is quite literally that, you know,
*  that there is a deep connection among creatures. That, you know, nothing is more, I still find it
*  amazing that we could take a fish gene and put it in a mouse and it functions just fine, you know,
*  in the limb of a mouse, you know, where it is in a fish, it works in its fin. That in a nutshell
*  just shows you just the deep connections among, you know, all life on our planet. Are you a fan
*  of the sci-fi channels, TV show Sharktopus? No, I haven't seen it yet, I'm afraid. I think that should
*  be your next project. I do so. I'm surprised they didn't call me to consult. Well, I mean, let's,
*  you know, we're at the end of the podcast here. So now we can let our hair down and speculate a
*  little bit. We've learned a lot about how major transitions happen in real evolution. You're
*  opening, I don't want to call it Pandora's box, but at least a whole door onto a new landscape
*  of things where we can make major evolutions in our labs. Like, is this going to be a frontier
*  over the next hundred years where we're, I mean, not just figuring out how evolution happened,
*  but designing organisms for human purposes? Oh, I mean, I think, you know, it's already happening,
*  right? I mean, you have people growing organs and dishes, you know, tissue engineering for
*  clinical purposes as well. You know, we already have people who use computation and a knowledge
*  of evolutionary history to resurrect proteins that were present 400 million years ago and test their
*  activity. No, we can reconstruct ancestors, at least at the biochemical level. We can modify
*  development at the embryological and developmental level, I mean, the genetic level as well.
*  And we can begin to, you know, mimic certain stages of evolution. That sometimes is,
*  sometimes that's helpful, sometimes it's not, but we're definitely in this brave new world where we
*  can manipulate things as well. The big game changer has been obviously genome editing,
*  the CRISPR-Cas gene editing, which applies to so many species. It's remarkably effective,
*  but it's also remarkably cheap, you know, so a lot of it's just important when you run a big lab.
*  And that, yeah, and that's been a huge game changer for us. I mean, I have a colleague here
*  at Chicago, Joe Thornton, who is literally resurrecting ancient proteins to understand
*  how enzymes originally came about. And he uses, you know, knowledge of evolutionary history and
*  computation to make predictions about what those proteins looked like. And then he makes them in
*  the lab and tests their activity. And we can tweak genes right now to test, can we make a limb
*  bone in a fish fin? I have a colleague from Harvard who did just that with a mutant he found
*  and showed that, you know, fish fins have the ability to make limb-like bones, you know,
*  so really remarkable stuff. It's definitely a brave new world.
*  Yeah, so the answer is yes, we will be seeing, I mean, it's just the beginning of all this and
*  people talk about regulating it and so forth. But my rough feeling is that once you can do something,
*  someone out there is going to do it. And so remixing all sorts of
*  organisms and their organs is going to be a major frontier.
*  I think so. I mean, what will drive it obviously would be clinical, you know, making new kinds of
*  tissues that can help in regeneration. Regeneration is a big thing too, being able
*  to rebuild organs too. And that's, that's people are pushing the limits of that as well.
*  Well, okay, so for the very last question, let's return a little bit back to reality.
*  We talked about how fins can turn into hands and so forth. But the other obvious question is
*  human beings, right? We're very similar to other primates, but we do have these big brains. I
*  recently saw a claim, which then I think I saw people arguing against, but the claim was that
*  there are mental capacities, cognitive capacities that chimpanzees are much better at
*  than we human beings, you know, short term memory kinds of tasks. And the claim was that we have,
*  I don't want to say intentionally, but we have sacrificed that part of our cognitive capacities
*  in order to develop language and linguistic capacities is, is this kind of trade off a big
*  part of what turns other primates into we smart and sexy human beings?
*  I don't know the answer to that, but trade offs are a very huge part of, of human history, right?
*  There's trade offs in terms of the structure of our brain. There's trade offs in terms of the
*  structure of our, your general system, our ability to walk. The trade offs of just being human are
*  huge because there are costs to, to him, to being human. We suffer certain kinds of conditions that
*  are, that are not seen in other, in other creatures, you know, our ability to talk, for instance,
*  I'm just shifting it from the cognitive piece, cause I know less about that, honestly,
*  but the, our ability to talk comes at a huge trade off. So it wouldn't surprise me that cognitive
*  issues do as well. So for instance, you know, we are the only animals that suffer a certain,
*  a particular kind of dangerous sleep apnea. And the reason for that is we have a very flexible back
*  of our throat that's, and the, and instead of neural circuits that play a huge role in our ability
*  to make sounds. So our ability to make sounds for language comes at a giant cost because it's such
*  a stuff for certain kinds of sleep apnea, which are, which can be quite, quite dangerous.
*  But that's true for almost every part of human, the human body. I mean, whether it's our walking
*  on two legs, whether it's having huge brains that consume an enormous amount of energy,
*  whether it's having cognitive capacities to make language that are trade offs from other kinds of
*  cognitive capacities, which we might've had, you know, trade offs are a part of being an extreme
*  organism. Like we are, we're highly optimized in certain ways and that optimization comes at a cost,
*  you know, because of the inherent nature of trade offs. I mean, I guess I already said this
*  was the last question, so I lied, but I just had a podcast with Martin Reese, where we talked a
*  little bit about the prospects for post humanity and how, you know, in different environments and
*  so forth, we might evolve in different ways. Like people living on Mars might have different
*  skeletal structures or something like that. Is it, is it completely crazy for an evolutionary
*  biologist to look at human beings and say, well, here are things we could improve.
*  Here are things that we could intentionally change that would make us better, like, you know,
*  get rid of backaches or something like that. Oh yeah, definitely. I mean, there's, I mean, in fact,
*  our relationship to the microbial world, we can change, you know, we, you know, when you think
*  about, we're just beginning to come to grips with our relationship to the microbial world.
*  And that relationship can sometimes hurt us, but oftentimes, most of the times, it's essential for
*  our lives. And that's something that, you know, as we look forward, that's something that is going
*  to be incredibly important to think about. But no, I mean, you can look at all, any part of our
*  body and say, well, geez, that's something that, that needs to change going forward. But a lot
*  depends on the operative environment that we find ourselves living in. You know, so the environment
*  today, yeah, you could say certainly that, you know, there are certain aspects of our bodies that
*  in this modern environment that we're kind of disconnected from. You know, we have an evolutionary
*  history in one environment, yet, you know, many of us are living in, you know, in, in built
*  environments now, that are very different, and we have a sedentary lifestyle. So our whole metabolism
*  is sort of ill equipped to, you know, we are, we evolved from a very highly active, you know,
*  ancestors, and we're, and most of us are relatively sedentary. Less active.
*  You are, when you think about the leading cause of death, you know, cardiovascular disease,
*  cancers, and so forth, these are all parts of the trade off of being human and living in our modern
*  world, right? And so I could think of a whole host of things that would need to change, you know,
*  we are susceptible to all kinds of cancers, and that are a product of living in our modern world,
*  and a product of living, you know, after 50. And so yeah, I could give you a list of many things to
*  change based on where we're living now. And I can give you an even longer list if, you know,
*  you're telling me we're going to be living in bases in Mars or terraforming somewhere or whatever.
*  Well, good. It's good to know that, you know, we're members of the last generation of purely
*  organic human beings. Well, I'm part iPhone, actually. I'm actually merged with the device.
*  We were born organic. We've deteriorated over time. All right. Neil Shubin, thanks. That was
*  a fascinating conversation. Thanks for being on the podcast. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.
