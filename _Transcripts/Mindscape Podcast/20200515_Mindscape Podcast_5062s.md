# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | May 2020, Part One
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and here we are at the Ask Me Anything episode for May 2020. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=0.0s)]
*  Second full month, I suppose, of our lockdown quarantine pandemic situation. I hope everyone is doing okay out there, staying safe, social distancing and so forth. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=9.0s)]
*  You know what I've been doing, more or less. I've been doing the podcast as always, doing also my videos for the biggest ideas in the universe. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=20.0s)]
*  And actually, just because I'm home all the time, since I don't sort of waste various bits of time either going into the office or traveling, which is a much bigger waste of time for me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=29.0s)]
*  It's not a waste of time. Traveling is not a waste of time, but it does take time and it takes away from the productivity level for other kinds of things. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=39.0s)]
*  I've been surprisingly productive on the science front. Last year, 2019 was a very unproductive year for me in terms of getting published papers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=47.0s)]
*  But this year looks to be much better. I have two papers very, very close to being finished. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=56.0s)]
*  I'm hoping to submit them here in May and then two more papers that are pretty far along that I'm optimistic within a month or two should happen also. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=60.0s)]
*  So that's a good year right there. Four papers per year is probably about my average over my career. I really don't know. I never really calculated that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=67.0s)]
*  But it seems like a healthy amount and hopefully I'll be able to get more, which will make up for the disaster that was last year. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=75.0s)]
*  The videos are going well. You know, it took, as usual, more time than I thought to figure out how to do something new. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=82.0s)]
*  You'll see that the video quality is much better on the more recent videos than it was in the beginning ones. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=90.0s)]
*  You know, learning. That's what it's all about. And I am no exception to that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=96.0s)]
*  So I hope that all that has been interesting and useful for people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=100.0s)]
*  The podcasts are going great, but of course they're all being done remotely now, which does raise an interesting question about what is the best way to do these podcasts? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=105.0s)]
*  You know, I definitely prefer doing them in person. And when I'm in person, I can bring my good microphones along. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=114.0s)]
*  You know, the real the real worry when you're talking to someone who is remote is that you don't control their audio quality. Right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=123.0s)]
*  And I've gone to the point now where you can use this program called Zencaster, which which records each person locally rather than recording what you get over the Internet. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=131.0s)]
*  So the quality of your Internet connection doesn't really matter, but the quality of their microphone and their audio space, etc. matters a lot. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=142.0s)]
*  So when I record in person, even though I can bring my own microphones and everything, there's, you know, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=149.0s)]
*  maybe there's not a lot of good places to put a microphone so that people can be close to it when they talk or maybe the room is very echoey or maybe they're just not used to being very close to a microphone and they sort of move around a lot. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=156.0s)]
*  And so I've actually had more success lately. This could change, but more success lately at getting the best audio quality out of remote interviewing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=168.0s)]
*  I don't let my guests not have a good microphone because I will send them a microphone. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=178.0s)]
*  That's what is necessary. But I can't control, of course, the audio quality of their room or how close they are to the microphone or anything like that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=184.0s)]
*  And also Zencaster, even though it's very good, is not perfect. And sometimes it's hard to hear what the person says when you're talking to them, even though the recording goes fine, etc. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=191.0s)]
*  So anyway, it's interesting because you get a wider variety of possible people to talk to when you don't need to be in their same physical location. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=201.0s)]
*  But people, for some reason, maybe not that surprising, people are more willing to say, yes, if you say I will show up at your office, right, than if you just say I will mail you a microphone and tell you when to talk to me or the computer. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=210.0s)]
*  And of course, it's more organic conversation, better give and take if you're there in the same room with a person. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=224.0s)]
*  So anyway, pluses and minuses. I think that overall it's going pretty well and going to continue. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=229.0s)]
*  So a big reason why it's continuing is all you wonderful folks out there in Patreon land. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=234.0s)]
*  So thanks so much for contributing to keeping the Mindscape podcast going. And with that, let's go. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=239.0s)]
*  First question this month is from Chris, who says, how many hours of sleep do you manage every day? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=254.0s)]
*  That's a good question. Probably like about seven hours, I would say, is an average. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=269.0s)]
*  I'm you know, I don't I'm not one of these don't sleep very much people. I need my sleep. If I'm if things are going well, it'll be eight hours, honestly. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=274.0s)]
*  And on some days of the week, depending on how things are going, I will take the 20 minute power nap in the middle of the day to keep things going. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=281.0s)]
*  But yeah, about about seven hours, actually, like despite the pandemic and quarantine, etc. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=289.0s)]
*  I've been sleeping fine. Only one night recently did I have trouble sleeping. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=295.0s)]
*  A lot of people are reporting that their dreams are more vivid than usual. And I have been experiencing that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=300.0s)]
*  Apparently, it's some combination of, you know, anxiety about the state of the world, but also just seeing the same environment around day after day, hour after hour, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=307.0s)]
*  not giving a lot of different stimulation to your brain contributes to this vividness of your dreaming. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=316.0s)]
*  So I definitely am experiencing that. Valhica, Val-Kia, sorry, says, if the strong nuclear force is strong enough to hold together nuclei as heavy as uranium, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=323.0s)]
*  despite electromagnetic repulsion between protons, why aren't there much heavier isotopes of light of light atoms, say carbon 50? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=332.0s)]
*  Would a nucleus composed only of neutrons be stable? So, yeah, this is a very good question. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=340.0s)]
*  You know, you have this idea in mind that on the one hand, protons, which are positively charged, push each other away because of the electromagnetic force. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=346.0s)]
*  But nucleons, which include both protons and neutrons, pull each other together on very short distances. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=354.0s)]
*  So there's a competition. So some nuclei are stable and some are not. But it's very natural to ask, well, why not just add more and more neutrons? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=359.0s)]
*  So you're increasing the strong nuclear force, but you are decreasing the electromagnetic repulsion. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=366.0s)]
*  And the answer is because the neutron is not stable. The neutron is a little bit heavier than the proton and a neutron all by itself is not stable at all. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=371.0s)]
*  It decays in a matter of minutes into a proton, an electron and an anti neutrino. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=379.0s)]
*  So it turns out just for a complicated, you have to go through the calculation kind of reasons that the same thing is true for just a bag of neutrons. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=385.0s)]
*  If you try to make a nucleus out of many, many neutrons, that does not make them stable at all. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=392.0s)]
*  So the more neutrons you put in, the more likely it is that those neutrons will just decay into protons and those protons will be positively charged and pushing apart all the other protons. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=397.0s)]
*  That's why you get this balance that gives us this interesting structure in the periodic table. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=407.0s)]
*  Ezra Parzybok says, what is a guy like you make per year? Like, what is my what is my yearly income? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=412.0s)]
*  So as Ezra surmises, maybe I'm not going to answer that question. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=418.0s)]
*  You know, that is a personal question, but I get the point of it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=422.0s)]
*  I'm, you know, as things go, I'm pretty successful. I make I do fine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=425.0s)]
*  Let's put it that way. The joke that Jennifer and I have is the one thing that we lack financially is the ability to take, you know, business class flights on very, very long travels trips. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=429.0s)]
*  Because for tall people, these economy class flights these days, man, if you're on a 10 hour flight, it's tough, but can't quite afford the business class. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=440.0s)]
*  Got to go in cargo with everybody else. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=447.0s)]
*  But, you know, I have I probably make less than the average tenured professor because I'm a research professor, which is less prestigious. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=449.0s)]
*  But then I also have the talking and the podcast and writing books, especially does bring in extra income. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=456.0s)]
*  So I'm doing fine. Thanks for asking. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=464.0s)]
*  Johnny says, What do you make of ideas like the Dyson sphere and other giant structures like that? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=467.0s)]
*  Do you think realistically will ever be possible to build anything even remotely similar in scale? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=471.0s)]
*  I think so. I mean, I don't see why not in principle. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=477.0s)]
*  You know, there's always the question of the difference between violating the laws of physics versus doing crazily ambitious engineering projects. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=482.0s)]
*  Right. So warp drive going faster than the speed of light, things like that violate the laws of physics as we currently understand them. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=491.0s)]
*  But taking apart a planet and building a giant sphere, it might be plausible. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=497.0s)]
*  I really don't know. There's certainly nothing in the laws of physics that would prevent it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=503.0s)]
*  I think honestly, the biggest difficulty would be disassembling a planet to get enough stuff to build a Dyson sphere. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=507.0s)]
*  Maybe you could blow it up, but then you run the danger of losing a lot of it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=514.0s)]
*  Probably the more sensible way is to send rockets down and then throw things up. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=518.0s)]
*  You know, if it's a rocky planet, you can sort of land on it and, you know, throw rocks into space. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=525.0s)]
*  Robert Heinlein talked about this in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=531.0s)]
*  And then someone in space could collect those rocks and use them to build something like that. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=534.0s)]
*  But honestly, I have zero actual technical knowledge of this. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=538.0s)]
*  So you shouldn't believe my judgment very much. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=542.0s)]
*  But that's what my judgment is. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=545.0s)]
*  Mitch Lindgren says, I'm hoping you can comment on Eric Weinstein's theory of geometric unity, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=547.0s)]
*  what it actually means in terms a lay person can understand. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=551.0s)]
*  So I cannot comment because I have no idea what is in Eric's theory. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=554.0s)]
*  It's not really something that I've been following or very interested in. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=558.0s)]
*  Judith Marsh says, in John Wheeler's book Journey into Gravity and Space Time, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=561.0s)]
*  he says that if we were floating in space between galaxies, we wouldn't see any light from other stars or galaxies. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=565.0s)]
*  Is the space between galaxies so vast that it would be completely dark to our unaided eyes? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=571.0s)]
*  I have no idea what's going on. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=576.0s)]
*  Sorry, Judith, in this particular quote. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=578.0s)]
*  If you were in the space between galaxies, of course you would see other galaxies. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=580.0s)]
*  You know, galaxies are faint, to be fair. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=586.0s)]
*  The Andromeda galaxy is about as dim as the dimmest star that we can see with the naked eye. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=589.0s)]
*  If you picked a spot carefully in the universe, then all of the galaxies, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=599.0s)]
*  there would be no galaxies close enough to you to be visible if the Earth were where you were. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=607.0s)]
*  So if you were looking through the Earth's atmosphere. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=615.0s)]
*  Of course, if you're truly in outer space, you're not looking through the Earth's atmosphere. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=617.0s)]
*  So things look a little bit brighter. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=620.0s)]
*  So in that sense, you probably still, I think, would be able to see galaxies. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=622.0s)]
*  But the Andromeda galaxy is pretty close to us. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=627.0s)]
*  So I guess as I'm saying this out loud, I'm getting in mind what Wheeler probably had in mind. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=630.0s)]
*  The Andromeda galaxy is big and it's relatively close to us. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=634.0s)]
*  And yet it is approximately the brightness of the dimmest star visible with the naked eye. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=637.0s)]
*  So there's two competing effects. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=643.0s)]
*  If you're in intergalactic space, you'd be farther away from all the galaxies, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=645.0s)]
*  but you wouldn't have the Earth's atmosphere in the way. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=649.0s)]
*  So it's possible that he did the calculation, which I didn't do, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=652.0s)]
*  which says that at the end of the day, the human eye would not be able to perceive any of the galaxies out there. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=654.0s)]
*  So that is possible. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=659.0s)]
*  Of course, all you need is a good set of binoculars or a tiny telescope and you would see all sorts of galaxies. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=661.0s)]
*  David Lang says, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=666.0s)]
*  Physicists have used two finely tuned optical lattice clocks, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=667.0s)]
*  one at the base and one at the observatory floor, 450 meters of Tokyo Sky Tree Tower, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=670.0s)]
*  to make new ultra precise measurements of the time dilation effect predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=676.0s)]
*  Time runs slightly more slowly at the base of the tower than at the top. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=682.0s)]
*  It's only 450 meters tall. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=685.0s)]
*  If it were significantly taller, the top clock would dilate more because of the motion of the Earth. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=687.0s)]
*  So anyway, and the question is, is there a name for this point, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=692.0s)]
*  the height of the tower at which the dilation for motion at the top level is equal to the dilation from the gravity well on the ground level? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=695.0s)]
*  So let me mention it because I think it comes up later in the AMA. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=701.0s)]
*  I am never going to use phrases like the clock runs slower deep in a gravitational field or something like that. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=706.0s)]
*  Clocks move at one second per second. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=712.0s)]
*  What other speed could they possibly move at? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=715.0s)]
*  There's a temptation to say that they move slower because you're imagining comparing them to clocks that are far away. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=717.0s)]
*  But clocks that are far away can't be directly compared with clocks that are in a gravitational well or moving at the speed of light. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=724.0s)]
*  That's part of the point of general relativity. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=730.0s)]
*  All you can compare is the net amount of duration measured by two clocks that start at the same point, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=733.0s)]
*  go off and travel somewhere and then come back. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=739.0s)]
*  But anyway, having said all that, I have no idea what the different what the point at which the height of a tower [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=742.0s)]
*  and therefore the change in the gravitational potential wins or loses versus the speed at which things travel. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=749.0s)]
*  So the point here is that, of course, compared if you if you could compare to someone that was far away from the Earth [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=757.0s)]
*  and just sitting stationary with respect to it, and then you both sent people off really fast [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=764.0s)]
*  and sent them deep into the Earth's gravitational field and compared how long it took their clocks to go, different amounts when they came back. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=769.0s)]
*  Then there's competing effects because there's the speed of light effect. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=776.0s)]
*  And as you go through speed through space, just a special relativistic effect. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=780.0s)]
*  And then there's the gravitational time dilation. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=784.0s)]
*  And so David's question is, when does the velocity at which you're moving become more important than the gravitational time dilation? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=786.0s)]
*  The answer is I have no idea. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=793.0s)]
*  I mean, you could do the calculation, but I have not done it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=795.0s)]
*  Sorry. Kirk Briggs says, If the past and future are not, as Eddington said, as much available to present exploration as the distant parts of space, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=797.0s)]
*  then I don't see how you can justify that they are equally real. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=805.0s)]
*  If the past isn't always including now out there on some space time world point, then what is eternal about your view? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=809.0s)]
*  I think I must not quite be understanding the question because I think that Eddington's quote answers the question. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=818.0s)]
*  I mean, Eddington is saying that the past and future are as much available to present exploration as the distant parts of space. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=824.0s)]
*  So an eternalist says that the past and future are equally real to distant parts of space. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=831.0s)]
*  There's no difference between being distant in space and being distant in time, according to the Block universe point of view. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=836.0s)]
*  So the only thing that I've said before and will say again is that they're not real now. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=843.0s)]
*  You can't add these temporal modifiers, but that's OK. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=850.0s)]
*  The whole point of the four dimensional perspective is that you shouldn't add these temporal modifiers. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=853.0s)]
*  You should just say they're real. Full stop. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=857.0s)]
*  Greg Griffiths says, What do recent indications of the different generation process for type 1a supernovae may have differed in prevalence in the early universe? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=861.0s)]
*  And more recently, the potential anisotropy in the expansion imply for the Hubble constant measurement discrepancy or the contribution of dark energy? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=869.0s)]
*  I'm really not able to give a detailed expert level answer on this because I have not followed all the recent claims and counterclaims about the Hubble constant discrepancy, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=878.0s)]
*  the anisotropy, et cetera. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=889.0s)]
*  There was a claim for those of you who don't know there was a claim recently that the expansion of the universe was anisotropic. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=891.0s)]
*  Now, almost no professional cosmologist believes that claim because the measurement is done using galaxies and you can do that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=897.0s)]
*  You can try to measure the isotropy of the universe using galaxies, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=907.0s)]
*  but it's nowhere near as accurate or precise or as easy to measure as doing it using the cosmic microwave background. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=910.0s)]
*  And we've done it using the cosmic microwave background and it's isotropic. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=917.0s)]
*  So you're using a worse method with larger error bars and getting a claim that doesn't seem to make sense. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=920.0s)]
*  Probably the claims just not right. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=927.0s)]
*  That's how Bayesian inference works for the Hubble constant discrepancy. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=929.0s)]
*  It's a it's a more interesting discrepancy. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=933.0s)]
*  The people who are doing it know what they're doing and we don't know exactly what's going on. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=936.0s)]
*  My bet is still that it's just going to go away when we understand the observations better, that it's not really new physics. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=940.0s)]
*  That's my personal belief. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=946.0s)]
*  Jesse Rimmler says, recently you tweeted out a blog post by Stephen Wolfram where he writes excitedly about a new way of conceiving fundamental laws of physics. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=947.0s)]
*  I enjoyed his post, but I also took note of your wise words of caution about getting too excited. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=955.0s)]
*  My question is, why would a scientist of stature opt to post something for public consumption without submitting it to formal peer review first? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=959.0s)]
*  So I think this is there's a couple of things going on here. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=966.0s)]
*  So plenty of scientists, including myself, submit things and make them publicly available before they've been formally peer reviewed. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=969.0s)]
*  That's the whole purpose of the well, that's as a role that is played. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=977.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not the whole purpose by the archive in high energy physics and it's corresponding. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=981.0s)]
*  There's a bio archive and a medical archive, et cetera. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=986.0s)]
*  You can put out pre prints. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=988.0s)]
*  That is to say, papers you've written that have not yet been peer reviewed that usually will eventually be peer reviewed. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=990.0s)]
*  But you can get sort of a pre peer review peer review by just putting them out there in public, letting your peers, the rest of the scientific community, look at them and comment and cite them and so forth. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=996.0s)]
*  And if they're good, you know, use them even before they've appeared in a journal. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1006.0s)]
*  So the fact that it's not submitted in a peer reviewed journal doesn't bother me at all if it eventually is submitted to a peer review journal. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1010.0s)]
*  But the reason why I'm not that excited about it is, you know, again, people should go ahead and do it. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1018.0s)]
*  Like I'm not going to say don't do your crazy ideas about fundamental physics to the people who are trying it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1024.0s)]
*  Knock yourself out to go nuts to the people who are just on the sidelines asking how much should I care about this? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1030.0s)]
*  My answer is you should not care about this kind of thing very much for lots of reasons. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1038.0s)]
*  You know, the the there's not just one but a million different things that go into creating an ambitious new picture of physics like this. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1044.0s)]
*  And the ordinary thing to do is to say, well, I'm making 20 dramatically incredibly implausible claims. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1053.0s)]
*  Let me justify them one by one in a series of papers that people can think about. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1060.0s)]
*  You know, lone geniuses just don't work as well as communities. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1066.0s)]
*  And so real physicists put their stuff out there into the community and they talk about it and they get it better and they reference each other and they cite each other and they build upon what each other have done. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1069.0s)]
*  So if you say, you know, I have a discrete model that mimics quantum mechanics and satisfies Bell's theorem, and that's step three out of 20 in making your theory of everything. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1079.0s)]
*  Well, geez, that's a big enough thing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1091.0s)]
*  You should write a short paper about that and let people talk about that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1094.0s)]
*  And that's the kind of thing that makes me not that interested or not that give it gives me a very small prior on an approach like this being very useful is that it's just it smells wrong. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1097.0s)]
*  Right. It doesn't have any of the qualities that they're trying in good faith to address all of the big, obvious obstacles to an approach like this. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1107.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe they will. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1117.0s)]
*  Like I said, you know, there's some nonzero chance. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1118.0s)]
*  And if they do, then people will talk about it and people will realize it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1120.0s)]
*  But I would have much higher confidence if they just done it piecemeal in a way that said, you know, here's why we think we can do this. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1124.0s)]
*  Here's why we think we can do that. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1131.0s)]
*  Here's why we think we do something else. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1132.0s)]
*  I mean, the model is irreversible. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1134.0s)]
*  It looks very nonlocal. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1136.0s)]
*  It's discrete. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1138.0s)]
*  It's not Lorentz invariant. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1139.0s)]
*  It doesn't look quantum mechanical at all. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1140.0s)]
*  So if someone says, but maybe it's right. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1142.0s)]
*  All you have to do is spend the next three weeks of your life reading through the 800 pages they've written. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1145.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm not going to do that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1150.0s)]
*  You know, if you look on the archive I just talked about in particle physics and high energy theory, there are literally hundreds of papers coming out every week by physicists who are in the game, who are playing by the rules, who are putting papers out, letting other people comment on them, giving seminars and so forth. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1152.0s)]
*  Why would I spend time listening to, you know, someone's grandiose plans when I know these other people are doing their best to write papers in good faith and I don't even have time to read their papers. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1171.0s)]
*  You know, I might have time to be one or two papers out of 100 that actually get published there. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1180.0s)]
*  So Peter Galle says, Consider a three dimensional object falling through the plane of a two dimensional world, say a pencil falling point first to a two dimensional creature. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1184.0s)]
*  It would look like a point appearing out of nowhere, then widening into a disk, then disappearing. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1194.0s)]
*  Is this in any way analogous to quantum particles materializing and disappearing, suggesting a source in a higher physical dimension? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1198.0s)]
*  So no, it is in no way analogous to that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1204.0s)]
*  I see where you're coming from. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1207.0s)]
*  But the idea of quantum particles materializing and disappearing was always a wrong analogy. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1208.0s)]
*  It was just a sort of fake story that was told. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1214.0s)]
*  If you want more of a lowdown on that, I go into some length about it in something deeply hidden in my recent book. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1217.0s)]
*  There's an appendix where I talk about Feynman diagrams and quantum fluctuations and so forth. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1223.0s)]
*  But the point is that in quantum mechanics, as we understand it, we have the Schrodinger equation. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1227.0s)]
*  And we don't have to go into the details about that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1232.0s)]
*  But the point is the universe evolves like a closed system. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1235.0s)]
*  It evolves like you tell me what the quantum state is. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1239.0s)]
*  The Schrodinger equation tells me how it evolves. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1241.0s)]
*  Whereas the process that you're suggesting, where something comes in from an extra dimension and looks mysterious to us, looks like it's popping into existence. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1244.0s)]
*  That's because the plane into which the pencil is coming is not a closed system. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1251.0s)]
*  It's being influenced by the outside world. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1256.0s)]
*  So as best as we currently understand it, the laws of physics do not need any influence coming out from outside. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1259.0s)]
*  So that's why I don't think this is an especially good analogy for quantum fluctuations. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1265.0s)]
*  Richard Moster says, since forces allow one object to influence another and since entanglement allows one object to influence another object, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1270.0s)]
*  is there a way to express entanglement and forces in terms of one another? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1277.0s)]
*  Or are they two completely different mechanisms by which an object is entangled? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1281.0s)]
*  I think the dirty secret here is that the word force is not actually well defined in physics, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1285.0s)]
*  or at least it's not uniquely defined in a way we can all agree on. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1291.0s)]
*  In Newtonian mechanics, it was. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1295.0s)]
*  But now we're talking about quantum mechanics and things are a little bit more subtle. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1298.0s)]
*  And furthermore, we're talking about field theory, because quantum field theory is our best theory of the world, where it's also more subtle than that. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1302.0s)]
*  So I think that it makes sense to think about quantum mechanics. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1309.0s)]
*  So I think that it makes perfect sense not to mix together entanglement and forces, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1313.0s)]
*  because the way that we have actually gone about in practice using the word force is to refer to the famous four forces of physics, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1320.0s)]
*  gravity, electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1329.0s)]
*  You can also add the Higgs force onto that. It's very, very short range, but in principle it's there. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1333.0s)]
*  And so in practice, what we mean is a bosonic field, okay, that can either pull or push other fields together and work working completely locally. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1338.0s)]
*  Entanglement is something utterly different than that, right? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1349.0s)]
*  Entanglement is not mediated by a field. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1353.0s)]
*  It does seem to be an influence, whether or not you want to call it a force. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1356.0s)]
*  But people disagree, depending on whether there are many world's or hidden variable people or something else about how entanglement works. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1359.0s)]
*  But in none of their views, you need a force to make it happen. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1367.0s)]
*  So it's probably not a good thing to mix those two up. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1372.0s)]
*  John Hamill says, you discuss the idea that free will skeptics are simply not being consistent unless they act in a really asocial and sociopathic way. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1376.0s)]
*  So parenthetically, I've never said that. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1384.0s)]
*  You say I discussed the idea. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1387.0s)]
*  Well, someone else uses those words and I'll discuss those words. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1389.0s)]
*  But those are not my words, just to be clear. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1392.0s)]
*  I'm a free will skeptic, John goes on to say, I think that the wet meat computer in my head attempts to calculate the outcomes of various decisions and that evolutionary influences and other factors give me a preference for outcomes that benefit me and society. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1395.0s)]
*  Is there any part of this perspective that implies I should behave like a sociopath in order to be consistent? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1406.0s)]
*  So in this perspective where I mean, I completely agree that you are a wet meat computer that attempts to do things, you're not a sociopath. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1411.0s)]
*  You're a wet meat computer that attempts to do things and evolution, etc. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1421.0s)]
*  Gives you preference for outcomes. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1425.0s)]
*  And I also think that you should talk about your decision making process using free will choice based vocabulary. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1427.0s)]
*  The point at which you become inconsistent is when you say, well, I refuse to talk about human choices and volition and free will. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1433.0s)]
*  But I still want to use words like should and morally right and wrong and responsibility and blame and things like that. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1442.0s)]
*  I think that is inconsistent. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1450.0s)]
*  I think you should choose either to use words like responsibility, blame, morally right and wrong along with words like choices and volition or use none of those words. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1452.0s)]
*  If you can't make choices, then there's no sense in which your actions are right or wrong. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1462.0s)]
*  It just doesn't quite make sense. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1468.0s)]
*  So an analogy to me is imagine that Thanos from the Marvel Cinematic Universe takes Captain America at the top of the tall building and throws Captain America off the building. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1470.0s)]
*  And Captain America does not have the ability to fly, for those of you familiar with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1482.0s)]
*  And Cap ends up landing on the ground and landing right on an innocent bystander who is thereby immediately killed. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1487.0s)]
*  So would we say that Captain America has made a morally wrong action, that Captain America is to blame for what happened? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1495.0s)]
*  I think we would say no, because once we have the initial conditions that Captain America has been thrown out the window or thrown off the roof of a tall building, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1503.0s)]
*  there's nothing that that given that given that information, there's nothing that Captain America can do to prevent him from falling onto the ground and killing that person who doesn't have the ability to move out fast enough. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1513.0s)]
*  Right. The laws of physics have declared that that's what's going to happen. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1525.0s)]
*  But what if we say, do we assign moral blame to Thanos's action in throwing Captain America out the window or off the roof? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1530.0s)]
*  Well, yes. And the reason why that's a sensible thing to do is because given what we know, given the conditions that we are actually aware of, like Thanos is there, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1538.0s)]
*  Thanos is a thinking being with the ability to reason and we can talk to him and try to make him make choices and so forth. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1548.0s)]
*  Given all that information, he could have acted differently. Right. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1554.0s)]
*  He has the ability, given what we know, is perfectly consistent to imagine different futures. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1558.0s)]
*  Now, you can counterfactually say, but if we were Laplace's demon and knew all the atoms that Thanos was made of and everybody else, we could have predicted it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1564.0s)]
*  Fine. But we're not. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1573.0s)]
*  And that's why rather than talking the language of I just saw the wave function of the universe every day, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1575.0s)]
*  we talk a language of people making choices and assigning blame and responsibility to the outcomes of those choices. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1580.0s)]
*  Sean K. Davis says, I can understand how the curvature of space causes objects to follow a curved path around the center of mass, such as the planets orbiting the sun. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1586.0s)]
*  What I'm having trouble understanding is how the curvature of space imparts on those objects and acceleration towards the center of mass. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1595.0s)]
*  What am I missing? I think you're missing the fact that I don't know whether you're missing this or not. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1601.0s)]
*  But the fact is that curvature is gravity. Right. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1606.0s)]
*  I mean, so there may be what you're asking is why, you know, I guess I'm trying to read the question, trying to figure out what exactly you're asking. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1612.0s)]
*  There is a question that can be asked, which is why do particles or objects moving through curved space time look like they're being pulled by gravity? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1622.0s)]
*  Right. So on the one hand, there's the question, why do particles moving through curved space time follow what we call geodesics? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1631.0s)]
*  Shortest distance paths through space times. And that's something you can derive from the laws of physics. Right. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1639.0s)]
*  You don't just need to posit it. You can just posit it also. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1644.0s)]
*  In fact, in the philosophy of general relativity community, there are arguments over whether or not geodesic motion is postulated or derived. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1647.0s)]
*  But anyway, that is part of Einstein's general theory of relativity. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1654.0s)]
*  The other part is, so why is that action? Why are particles moving along geodesics similar to what you and I think of as gravity? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1658.0s)]
*  In particular, why is there an acceleration toward the center of mass? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1666.0s)]
*  Well, the center of mass curves space time around it in a particular way. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1669.0s)]
*  And then you do the math. I mean, I'm not quite sure what level you need to answer to this question. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1674.0s)]
*  I can do the math. I've written a book. You can write. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1679.0s)]
*  You can read space time and geometry. You take Einstein's equation for the curvature of space time in the presence of some mass. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1681.0s)]
*  You solve it. You get something for a spherically symmetric mass that looks like the Schwarzschild solution. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1688.0s)]
*  And then you look at the geodesics in the Schwarzschild solution and they fall right or they get bent. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1694.0s)]
*  They get deflected as they as they move by a mass. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1699.0s)]
*  I'm not quite sure what other level you're looking for an answer to this question. Sorry about that. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1702.0s)]
*  Humberto Nani says, are the gravitational waves carrying oscillations in several directions transverse to their path of propagation like the electromagnetic fields that travel together in electromagnetic waves? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1708.0s)]
*  Yes and no. So there there's polarization and then there's electric versus magnetic fields. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1719.0s)]
*  So in an electromagnetic wave, what you have is there's our vibrations in both the electric field and the magnetic field. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1725.0s)]
*  And those vibrations are vertical and perpendicular to the line of motion. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1732.0s)]
*  So if there's a motion of a beam of light, an electromagnetic wave, then the fluctuations in the electric field are perpendicular to the momentum of that line of photons or whatever it is. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1737.0s)]
*  And the oscillations in the magnetic field are perpendicular to those of the electric field. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1749.0s)]
*  So since there's only three dimensions of space and three perpendicular lines, the momentum, the electric field and the magnetic field, they better all be mutually perpendicular to each other. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1755.0s)]
*  And there's no degree of freedom other than, you know, pick one and then we know the others actually pick two and then we know the other three. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1764.0s)]
*  So if you tell me the momentum, you tell me the electric field, I know what the magnetic field is doing. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1770.0s)]
*  So the polarization is just the direction in which the electric field is pointing. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1775.0s)]
*  Vertical polarized means the electric field is vibrating up and down in some reference frame. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1781.0s)]
*  Horizontally polarized, it's oscillating left and right. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1785.0s)]
*  And there's complex circular polarization and things like that. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1788.0s)]
*  But you only need the fact that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the electric field is separate from the fact that there are polarizations that are either vertical or horizontal. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1792.0s)]
*  Now, for the gravitational field, we can but sometimes don't, but sometimes do, think about the electric and the magnetic part of the gravitational field. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1801.0s)]
*  It is a slightly confusing nomenclature because there's nothing to do with electromagnetism. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1812.0s)]
*  But in the gravitational wave, there is a part of it that has the features that resemble the electric field. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1817.0s)]
*  And there's a part of it that had features that resemble the magnetic field. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1824.0s)]
*  So, again, you can buy my general relativity book and see the different components of gravitational wave expressed in terms of an electric like part and a magnetic like part, just like an electromagnetic wave and also just like an electromagnetic wave that's separate from the polarity. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1827.0s)]
*  That's separate from the polarization question. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1841.0s)]
*  Since a gravitational wave has sort of a plus or x shaped polarization, it's still two polarizations, but they look different than the electromagnetic polarization. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1844.0s)]
*  So there's a close analogy here, but they're different things. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1853.0s)]
*  John Reynolds says, I understand that equals MC squared relates mass to energy and that the speed of light is a factor. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1856.0s)]
*  What I don't understand is why C is squared, as opposed to, I guess, you know, to the first power to the third power, whatever. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1863.0s)]
*  You know, part of this, this is again one of those questions where the answer, there's a perfectly respectable sensible answer, which is that's just the way it is. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1870.0s)]
*  Those are the laws of physics. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1877.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1878.0s)]
*  Now you can, you know, when you ask these why questions, you can always say, well, what what are you going to grant me? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1879.0s)]
*  What postulates do I get to start with to derive this fact that you want? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1884.0s)]
*  So one way of doing it very, very simple minded, but it works is just to use dimensional analysis. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1888.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1894.0s)]
*  If you if you think about the units of these quantities, energy, mass and velocity, you know that the kinetic energy is one half MV squared. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1895.0s)]
*  So you know that the units in which energy is measured, whatever they are, joules or ergs or what have you, are the dimensions, the units of mass times the dimension of velocity squared, because it's one half MV squared and one half doesn't have dimensions at all. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1904.0s)]
*  So if you if someone told you that they had a formula, energy equals mass times the speed of light to some power, and they said, what is the power going to be? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1918.0s)]
*  You would instantly know it has to be squared just to get the units right. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1926.0s)]
*  Now you can also derive E equals MC squared in special relativity in ways where the C squared comes from the form of the Lorentz transformation. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1930.0s)]
*  But then, of course, you're assuming special relativity to begin with. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1938.0s)]
*  So it all depends on what you're allowing yourself to assume. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1941.0s)]
*  Joseph Tungredi says, My question has to do with first principles. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1946.0s)]
*  Can you define the word perpendicular without referring to 90 degree angles or to similar concepts which seem to be human invented? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1949.0s)]
*  Is there an a priori meaning of perpendicular which arises wholly from the fundamental laws of physics and which would apply for all succeeding spatial dimensions? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1956.0s)]
*  Yes, there absolutely is. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1965.0s)]
*  You don't nothing is human invented here. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1966.0s)]
*  This is geometry. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1968.0s)]
*  And it depends, you know, as before, it depends on how precise you want to be and what postulates you want to start with. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1970.0s)]
*  Let's imagine that we have a background geometry, which we agree is Euclidean. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1976.0s)]
*  OK. In other words, Pythagoras's theorem is true. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1982.0s)]
*  Initially parallel lines remain parallel, that kind of thing. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1986.0s)]
*  Euclid's laws, but in any number of dimensions will allow it to be any number of dimensions. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1989.0s)]
*  Then if you take, for example, a dot on a line or a dot on a plane, I can draw a circle around that dot. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=1993.0s)]
*  If the dot is on a plane, then the circle is one dimensional, right? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2002.0s)]
*  It's a one dimensional line that goes in a circle around the dot. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2007.0s)]
*  If the dot is on a line, a circle is zero dimensional. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2011.0s)]
*  A zero dimensional circle is embedded in a one dimensional line. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2016.0s)]
*  It's just the two points. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2019.0s)]
*  It's just a set of two points equidistant from the initial point that you drew. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2021.0s)]
*  OK, so now if you go perpendicular, if you draw a line starting from that initial point and go perpendicularly, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2025.0s)]
*  it's just the set of points that are equidistant from the circle. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2031.0s)]
*  OK, the set of points that have the same distance from all the points on the circle. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2036.0s)]
*  So if you have just one dot on a line and then quote unquote circle is two equidistant points around it, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2041.0s)]
*  then if you ask yourself, what is the set of all points that are equally distant from those two points, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2047.0s)]
*  that are equally distant from the original point that you started with, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2055.0s)]
*  you would end up drawing a line that bisects and is perpendicular to the original line. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2058.0s)]
*  Likewise, if you had a point on a plane with a little circle around it and asked the question, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2063.0s)]
*  what is the set of points which are equidistant from all points on that circle you just drew, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2067.0s)]
*  you would again draw a line that is perpendicular to that plane. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2072.0s)]
*  So you're not using any human invented notions at all. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2075.0s)]
*  You have to use notions like distance and planes and points and lines. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2078.0s)]
*  But that's part of the fundamental vocabulary of geometry. It's not a human. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2084.0s)]
*  It's not it's not subjective. Let's put it that way. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2088.0s)]
*  Lineum is Yara says, how close to discovering Einstein's special relativity were Lorenz and Poincare? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2090.0s)]
*  How far beyond them did Einstein go? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2096.0s)]
*  How is Poincare's relativity of simultaneity different from Einstein's? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2098.0s)]
*  So these are all great questions. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2102.0s)]
*  And I'm not really an expert on the history enough to give you a definitive answer here. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2104.0s)]
*  A great book you can read is Einstein's Clocks and Poincare's Maps by Peter Gallison, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2109.0s)]
*  where he talks about not only these questions, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2114.0s)]
*  but also the fact that both Poincare and Einstein were very much influenced by their day jobs. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2116.0s)]
*  Einstein looking at clocks in the patent office and Poincare looking at maps in the Bureau of Longitude for the French government. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2122.0s)]
*  I think very roughly the story that we tell ourselves, which might have some truth to it, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2132.0s)]
*  is that the math was all there before Einstein came along. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2136.0s)]
*  The math of special relativity, Lorenz transformations, like you say, the relativity of simultaneity. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2140.0s)]
*  People like Lorenz and Fitzgerald and Poincare had all put that together. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2145.0s)]
*  But what they have the way that they thought of it was different. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2149.0s)]
*  That's really what Einstein added. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2153.0s)]
*  What they thought was that there really was a Newtonian absolute space and absolute time. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2155.0s)]
*  But then there was a set of ways that things transformed so that everything you could never measure what that absolute space and time were. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2161.0s)]
*  And they called it the ether. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2171.0s)]
*  And they imagined that you could sensibly talk about your velocity with respect to the ether, but you just couldn't measure it. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2172.0s)]
*  And Einstein was the one who came along and said, actually, well, if that's true, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2178.0s)]
*  I can even just as good a theory without the ether at all. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2182.0s)]
*  I can just abandon the ether. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2185.0s)]
*  And what you need to make that make sense is a different notion of what length means and what duration means, how time and space are measured. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2187.0s)]
*  And it was eventually Minkowski who was able to say, you know, yeah, let's meld them together into one four dimensional space time. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2195.0s)]
*  So Dan O'Neill says, you've said that when you first encountered Bell's theorem, it wasn't the kind of epiphanic moment. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2202.0s)]
*  I don't know if I've ever come across the word epiphanic before having an epiphany. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2208.0s)]
*  I like it. Epiphanic moment for you that it has been for some other physicists. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2212.0s)]
*  Would you say more about this? Do you think Bell's discovery has been oversold? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2216.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if I can say more about it. I can say the same. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2220.0s)]
*  The things I always say about it, which is the importance of Bell's theorem to how one thinks about quantum mechanics depends a lot on how one thinks about quantum mechanics. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2222.0s)]
*  So if you think that we don't know how quantum mechanics really works, if you think that quantum mechanics remains mysterious, that we can eventually figure it out. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2235.0s)]
*  But right now we're still striving toward that. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2244.0s)]
*  We're trying to build the correct theory of quantum mechanics. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2247.0s)]
*  Then Bell's theorem is incredibly important. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2251.0s)]
*  Bell's theorem is an incredibly strong constraint on the ways you might imagine making physical theories that match the predictions of quantum mechanics. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2253.0s)]
*  In particular, if you're going to have hidden variables in your theories, then they better be non-local one way or the other. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2263.0s)]
*  Now, on the other hand, if you think you basically know what quantum mechanics is, like I do, like it's the many worlds version, like the ever-readying quantum mechanics, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2269.0s)]
*  and you think that the interesting work to be done in the foundations of quantum mechanics is the very difficult and very unfinished job of mapping ever-readying quantum mechanics onto the world that we see. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2277.0s)]
*  That's a hard thing to do, which we haven't completely finished yet. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2290.0s)]
*  Then Bell's theorem is just not important. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2293.0s)]
*  It just doesn't play a role. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2295.0s)]
*  Like Bell's theorem is just true in ever-readying quantum mechanics because it's a theorem and it's true and ever-readying quantum mechanics is consistent with the data. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2296.0s)]
*  There are assumptions that Bell goes into making his predictions. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2303.0s)]
*  And one of the assumptions is that experimental outcomes have unique experimental experiments, I should say, have unique outcomes. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2307.0s)]
*  But in many worlds, they don't. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2316.0s)]
*  In many worlds, experiments have different outcomes in different worlds. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2317.0s)]
*  So Bell's theorem is still mathematically true as a theorem. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2320.0s)]
*  It's just not relevant for many worlds. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2323.0s)]
*  So I think it depends on what your perspective is there. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2326.0s)]
*  Andre Mirabelli says, If I have two disjoint intervals on a world line, how would I pick out a clock that can reliably tell me if the two intervals have the same duration or tell me their duration ratios? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2329.0s)]
*  That is, how would I decide which recurrent processes are periodic? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2339.0s)]
*  So I think this is a good question. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2344.0s)]
*  I've addressed it before. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2345.0s)]
*  I think it's sort of not one that physicists generally think about, in part because we kind of build in the answers to our theories. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2346.0s)]
*  It's just a fact of relativity that there's a way of measuring time. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2354.0s)]
*  There are things that there's something called the space-time interval. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2359.0s)]
*  There's a way of physical. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2362.0s)]
*  There's a set of physical ways of measuring that space-time interval using clocks. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2364.0s)]
*  But if you want to ask the deeper question, why is there any such way? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2368.0s)]
*  Why do we have the confidence that we can measure time using physical objects? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2373.0s)]
*  Then what I like to say is that it's the empirical fact that the world is full of clocks. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2379.0s)]
*  That is to say, the world is full of objects that do things repetitively, cyclically over and over again in a way that when you compare them to each other, they take the same amount of time. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2384.0s)]
*  So it takes the same amount of time for the Earth to revolve around the sun and rotate around its axis, comparing to each other every single year. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2397.0s)]
*  Different atomic transitions with different frequencies can be compared to each other. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2404.0s)]
*  Pendulums rocking back and forth can be compared to each other. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2408.0s)]
*  The universe is just full of clocks. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2412.0s)]
*  And so as far as we can tell, that's enough to actually say that, yes, these clocks taken together, their mutual consistency guarantees that they are reliable. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2414.0s)]
*  And then we can use them to measure time even along completely disjoint intervals. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2425.0s)]
*  In other words, let's say yet another way. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2431.0s)]
*  Let's imagine that Thanos comes back to us again and he snaps his fingers and instead of killing half of the living beings in the universe, he slows down time by a factor of two everywhere in every single process. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2434.0s)]
*  OK, literally everything slows down by a factor of two. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2447.0s)]
*  Well, that's exactly the same as doing nothing. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2450.0s)]
*  It's completely meaningless slowing down time by a factor of two because everything slows down. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2453.0s)]
*  And you would still have the fact that clocks are completely compatible with each other and they would measure the same amount of time along different clocks. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2458.0s)]
*  So that kind of difference is just completely meaningless in physics. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2465.0s)]
*  Doug C. says, Can you explain how dimensions in Hilbert space relate to the wave function and the measurement problem? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2468.0s)]
*  I think the answer is no. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2476.0s)]
*  And I suspect but I might be being unfair here. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2478.0s)]
*  So correct me. Sorry. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2481.0s)]
*  But if I am being unfair here, Doug, but I think you might be misinterpreting the word dimensions. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2482.0s)]
*  Remember, dimensions to scientists and mathematicians just mean a direction. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2487.0s)]
*  If you have a vector space, a space of things you can add together and scale by real numbers, the dimension, just the number of basis vectors. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2491.0s)]
*  OK, it's not a place you can go or anything like that. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2500.0s)]
*  So the when you talk about the wave function, the wave function is a vector in a big vector space that vector space is called Hilbert space. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2503.0s)]
*  So there's a very direct relationship between the number of dimensions of Hilbert space and the wave function, namely that the wave function is a vector in a in a vector space of that many dimensions. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2511.0s)]
*  The measurement problem, I don't think it has. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2522.0s)]
*  I mean, it the dimensionality of Hilbert space has nothing special to do with the measurement problem, except insofar as it's part of quantum mechanics and quantum mechanics has to do with the measurement problem. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2524.0s)]
*  So I think I might be misunderstanding your question, but that's the best I can do right now. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2534.0s)]
*  Neeraj Dube says, I'm confused by the different explanations given by physicists regarding what space is made of. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2540.0s)]
*  Is it purely a mathematical geometric construct and therefore has no physical constituents or does it comprise of something physical such as it can be loopy frothy at the Planck scale? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2548.0s)]
*  I mean, the honest answer is we have no idea what space is really made of or even if there is an answer to that question, right? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2558.0s)]
*  Because once you start talking about loopiness, frothiness, Planck scale, you're talking about quantum gravity and we don't know what the right theory of quantum gravity is. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2564.0s)]
*  So you should be confused because we don't know the answer to that question. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2571.0s)]
*  Classically, in general relativity, space or space time more properly is just one of the fundamental ingredients. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2575.0s)]
*  It's not made of anything else. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2582.0s)]
*  It's one of the things that you posit to exist and you can talk about its properties, its geometry, how it changes with time, things like that. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2584.0s)]
*  But in classical physics, space isn't made of anything. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2591.0s)]
*  In quantum mechanics, we just don't know. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2594.0s)]
*  Riverside says, I hear your point that unlikely branches of the many worlds universe are proportionally less frequent than the likely ones. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2597.0s)]
*  Still, I do not see how this justifies a conclusion that the many worlds theory should not affect our everyday moral choices. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2604.0s)]
*  Failing to conduct a regular technical checkup of your car is a somewhat risky behavior in the stochastic environment, but is inevitable manslaughter in the many worlds universe. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2610.0s)]
*  Someone will die as a result of this oversight in some, however small, portion of a near infinite pool of branching worlds. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2620.0s)]
*  So I think this I think we talked similar questions in the last AMA and it's a Pascal's wager kind of argument in my mind. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2626.0s)]
*  You're saying, sure, this little thing is very, very unlikely, but its consequences are enormously big. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2635.0s)]
*  So shouldn't it really override all of our other considerations? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2641.0s)]
*  But the problem with these really unlikely things that there's a lot of really unlikely things. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2644.0s)]
*  So you say if I don't get a regular technical checkup of my car, then there's an infinite number of universes where I hit somebody and kill them by accident. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2649.0s)]
*  But there's also an infinite number of universes where because I didn't get a checkup on my car, the car breaks down and I stopped the trip I was taking and I don't kill somebody. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2657.0s)]
*  So I've saved an infinite number of lives as well. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2667.0s)]
*  And the point is that you got to take seriously the fact that these things are unlikely. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2670.0s)]
*  There's a way, way bigger infinity where nothing special happens because of that technical checkup you did or did not have. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2675.0s)]
*  And that is going to be the one that dominates your consideration. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2682.0s)]
*  You can't just say I have a big number times a tiny number. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2686.0s)]
*  Therefore, the result is big. If the tiny number is tiny enough, the result is still tiny, even if the big number is big. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2690.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2696.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2697.0s)]
*  Zane Nitsch Kanzler says, I've listened to your Higgs boson and beyond lectures and the Something Deeply Hidden audiobook. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2698.0s)]
*  And I hear renormalization come up as a pivotal solution to some nasty problems involving infinities. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2705.0s)]
*  I'm wondering where do these infinities come from? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2711.0s)]
*  Why are they troublesome? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2713.0s)]
*  And how does renormalization pacify them? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2714.0s)]
*  So the infinities in quantum field theory come about because we have a very specific way of doing quantum field theory. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2717.0s)]
*  And that's because quantum field theory is hard. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2727.0s)]
*  OK, this sounds vague, but it'll get specific in a second. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2731.0s)]
*  When we do quantum field theory, we generally start classically, right? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2734.0s)]
*  We start with the classical field and then we quantize it. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2739.0s)]
*  And we do more than that. Not only do we start with the classical field and quantize it, we start with a free field. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2743.0s)]
*  So what we mean by that is you have the electron field, the quark fields, the electromagnetic field, et cetera, have all these fields. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2750.0s)]
*  And they're all interacting with each other in complicated ways that make it almost impossible to say exactly what's going on. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2758.0s)]
*  So the technique used by physicists is to say, OK, first, imagine that all these fields exist, but by hand, turn off all their interactions. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2764.0s)]
*  That's what it means to be a free field. They're just freely evolving all by themselves. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2772.0s)]
*  They don't bump into each other. They don't notice each other. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2776.0s)]
*  OK, then you can solve the equations exactly. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2779.0s)]
*  Everything's great. That's easy. Of course, it's completely uninteresting. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2782.0s)]
*  You have literally no interactions between anything. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2786.0s)]
*  So then you start turning on the interactions and you treat them as small and you say, OK, I now have I went from zero interaction to just a little bit of interaction between my fields. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2788.0s)]
*  What happens? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2798.0s)]
*  And this first answer you get in this approximation where the interaction is weak is everything's great. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2800.0s)]
*  You know, the fields sort of you have a wave packet of one field and a wave packet of another field representing two particles. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2805.0s)]
*  They can bump into each other. You can calculate the probability that they go separate ways and so forth. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2811.0s)]
*  But then you can try to improve this calculation by adding another level of approximation and everything falls apart. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2817.0s)]
*  And that's where you get the infinities in particular, because when you allow different wavelengths of intermediate states between the initial fields that you had bumping into each other, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2824.0s)]
*  there's an infinite number of wavelengths that you can include. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2835.0s)]
*  You could go from whatever tiny number you start with because the particles are small all the way down to zero, zero wavelength. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2838.0s)]
*  And as you probably know, in quantum mechanics, small wavelengths means high energies. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2845.0s)]
*  So you're going from regular energies up to infinitely big energies. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2850.0s)]
*  And so you get infinitely big corrections to your problems. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2853.0s)]
*  Now, renormalization is the technique that was developed to get rid of these infinities. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2857.0s)]
*  But it's critically important to realize the infinities aren't there in nature. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2863.0s)]
*  The infinities aren't part of quantum field theory. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2868.0s)]
*  The infinities are because we human beings are sloppy and bad at solving the equations of quantum field theory. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2870.0s)]
*  So we use this weird way of putting everything together. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2877.0s)]
*  So the infinities are basically a way, renormalization is basically a way of keeping the infinities that we started with, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2881.0s)]
*  but subtracting off another infinity that we put in to get rid of this new infinity. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2888.0s)]
*  And it does sound like you're cheating. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2893.0s)]
*  And Feynman and Schwinger and so forth, who invented these techniques, expressed skepticism about their own techniques through the rest of their lives. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2896.0s)]
*  But these days, it doesn't bother us that much because we realize that all of these infinities came not only from we human beings being sloppy about solving our theories, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2905.0s)]
*  but also from taking seriously infinitely big energy wavelengths, right? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2914.0s)]
*  Very tiny wavelengths corresponding to infinite energy particles. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2919.0s)]
*  And that's just not realistic. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2922.0s)]
*  They probably aren't there, all these things that are giving us the infinities. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2924.0s)]
*  So this is why Ken Wilson, who passed away a couple of years ago, is a hero to modern physicists, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2927.0s)]
*  because he's the one who really understood, following work by others, but he's really the one who understood how if you, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2932.0s)]
*  what you can do is renormalize not by taking infinity minus infinity, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2938.0s)]
*  but just by explicitly admitting that your theory is only supposed to be good up to a certain wavelength. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2943.0s)]
*  And then you can use that wavelength, that energy, as a way of parametrizing everything that could be going on that you don't know about at higher energies. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2949.0s)]
*  And you can construct what is called an effective field theory. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2958.0s)]
*  So these days, modern approaches to renormalization admit that everything we are talking about in the real world is an effective field theory. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2961.0s)]
*  And it's only good up to some energy scale. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2968.0s)]
*  And we show that the physical predictions of the theory don't depend on what that energy scale is. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2971.0s)]
*  And that's the renormalization group. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2977.0s)]
*  So roughly speaking, the very short answer to your question is renormalization is a way of treating what happens at really, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2979.0s)]
*  really short wavelengths and high energies in terms of its impact on what we see at low energies and long wavelengths and bundling it up into all sort of way that we can handle it very effectively. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2985.0s)]
*  Paul Meggs says, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=2998.0s)]
*  I don't know how short you want, but the answer is through initial conditions and decoherence. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3000.0s)]
*  Initial conditions because the arrow of time plays an important role in ever-ready in quantum mechanics, just as it does in statistical mechanics. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3005.0s)]
*  In statistical mechanics, we start out with a low entropy universe and entropy goes up. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3014.0s)]
*  In quantum mechanics, we start out with a low entropy universe and entropy goes up. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3018.0s)]
*  In ever-ready in quantum mechanics, just as it does in statistical mechanics, in statistical mechanics, we start out with a low entropy universe and entropy goes up. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3022.0s)]
*  In ever-it in many worlds, we start with a world with a wave function that has very few branches and the number of branches increases. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3030.0s)]
*  And furthermore, we start in the most straightforward way of talking about it. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3037.0s)]
*  We start with a division into macroscopic systems like you and your measuring apparatus and your cats and so forth. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3042.0s)]
*  And then an environment with a bazillion degrees of freedom that we don't keep track of, right? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3049.0s)]
*  The environment has the photons and the air molecules and all that stuff. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3054.0s)]
*  And gradually over time, the wave function of the system becomes more and more entangled with the wave function of the environment. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3058.0s)]
*  And that leads to decoherence because the environment states that are associated with different system states become perpendicular to each other. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3064.0s)]
*  And that makes them essentially separate worlds. They evolve completely independently from each other. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3072.0s)]
*  They do not influence each other. There's no more interference experiments you could imagine doing where one world would affect the other. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3077.0s)]
*  I have no idea whether or not that those small number of words I just said make any sense. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3083.0s)]
*  If you want the longer version, I can recommend a really good book about quantum mechanics where I go into it in great detail. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3089.0s)]
*  Daniel Fox says, My son just recently heard of Eric Weinstein's gravity unification theory. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3095.0s)]
*  Since the subject is rearing its ugly head again, can you please please just briefly explain your opinion of it? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3099.0s)]
*  My opinion of it is that I have no idea what's in it, and I'm probably not going to learn about it. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3105.0s)]
*  Like I said, there's way more other things that I need to understand first. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3109.0s)]
*  Deepthi Amara Surya says, When we are speaking of cosmic occurrences, e.g. specific fundamental forces separating out some tiny number of seconds after the Big Bang, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3114.0s)]
*  what big clock are we referring to given the time intervals are not absolute? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3125.0s)]
*  So there's sort of two aspects to this question. One is the one we already talked about. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3129.0s)]
*  How do we know there are clocks? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3134.0s)]
*  And the answer there is that we still know the fundamental physical processes. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3136.0s)]
*  We know them pretty well. Just a second or a tiny fraction of a second after the Big Bang. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3141.0s)]
*  So we know how long things took. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3146.0s)]
*  And we can even check our work using things like the light element abundances left over from the Big Bang. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3148.0s)]
*  And we find that we got pretty much the right answer. So we think we're on the right track. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3153.0s)]
*  The other aspect is, of course, there are different trajectories you can move on. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3157.0s)]
*  And therefore different amounts of time measured by different clock, right? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3162.0s)]
*  Just using the rules of relativity. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3166.0s)]
*  And that answer is just a very boring one that the matter in the universe gives us a rest frame, right? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3168.0s)]
*  Gives us a frame with respect to which we can say we are at rest with respect to, on average, the other stuff in the universe. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3175.0s)]
*  And you can say, well, I could choose to move at some high velocity with respect to that rest frame. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3182.0s)]
*  Knock yourself out. But what we mean when we say 10 to the minus 10 seconds or one minute [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3188.0s)]
*  or 100,000 years after the Big Bang is as measured by a clock that is at rest with respect to the average motion of stuff in the universe. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3194.0s)]
*  Brendan Hall says, Do you have any personal interest in your heritage? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3202.0s)]
*  Some seem to enjoy learning about their own genealogy while others see their family history as less meaningful or totally irrelevant. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3206.0s)]
*  I don't really have that much interest. I don't know anything about it. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3213.0s)]
*  You know, our family, when I grew up, like to pretend that they were of Irish descent. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3216.0s)]
*  But in fact, they were mostly Americans generations back. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3220.0s)]
*  The closest ancestors I have that were not born in the United States were two of my great grandparents were born in England. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3224.0s)]
*  OK, so I think that I'm just some conglomeration of European ancestry that had been in the United States for a long time. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3232.0s)]
*  There were carols who signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the U.S. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3239.0s)]
*  And I have zero idea about whether I'm actually related to them or not. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3244.0s)]
*  Joshua Hillerup says, Have you had to learn new to you areas of mathematics since you stopped being a student? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3247.0s)]
*  And if you have, how do you prefer going about learning those areas? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3254.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, not as many like you do gain some expertise when you're a student. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3258.0s)]
*  That's sort of your job. And it's always possible. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3262.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a hobby horse of mine, so I don't want to go on too long about it. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3266.0s)]
*  But it's always possible to do the thing you do as a graduate student, the kind of physics you do for the rest of your life or the kind of science you do more generally. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3268.0s)]
*  There's usually, you know, enough to be done that you don't run out of questions to ask, et cetera. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3279.0s)]
*  But I just can't. It's just not my style. You know, I like doing doing different kinds of things. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3284.0s)]
*  So, you know, very recently I've been learning a lot about information theory and discrete systems and things like queuing theory. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3290.0s)]
*  There's, you know, probability and statistics kinds of questions which never had come up for me earlier in my career. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3299.0s)]
*  And how do I learn about them? You know, I mean, honestly, you should buy a good textbook and read it. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3307.0s)]
*  Do some of the problems in the textbook. You can. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3312.0s)]
*  I mean, I've been doing good online courses these days, and of course there's sometimes good review articles and things like that. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3314.0s)]
*  So I don't have any special secrets for learning those things. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3319.0s)]
*  You just got to put some time aside and bear down and do it. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3322.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3327.0s)]
*  Brett Meeker says, I notice you tend to avoid the problem of branching by assuming there are almost an almost infinite number of indistinguishable worlds prior to a measurement. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3328.0s)]
*  So the measurement is really a splitting of worlds. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3336.0s)]
*  This is much more plausible than saying a 50-50 measurement creates two branches, but a 50.1 slash 49.9 creates a thousand. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3338.0s)]
*  But it seems that the Born Rule is still just an axiom, and there is no mechanism within the Schrodinger equation to produce this splitting. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3347.0s)]
*  So there's no description of exactly when the split develops. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3353.0s)]
*  So I'm not. So again, I'm just this is a hard question for me to answer because I don't know what your background knowledge is. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3357.0s)]
*  I mean, I've written about exactly these questions at great length. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3364.0s)]
*  I wrote a paper with Chip Sieben's on deriving the Born Rule within the many worlds to partition of quantum mechanics. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3367.0s)]
*  David Wallace and David Deutsch have a different approach that is very, very popular, and they've derived the Born Rule within many worlds. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3374.0s)]
*  These are all different approaches, but they get the same answer. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3381.0s)]
*  In my book, Something Deeply Hidden, I try at a sort of a popular level to explain in great detail why this is true. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3385.0s)]
*  So I'm not sure whether you're familiar with all that stuff, but skeptical about it, in which case I would need to know more specifically what your skepticism comes from, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3391.0s)]
*  or you're not familiar with it. And what you need is for me to say, yes, these are these have all been answered, these questions. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3399.0s)]
*  Now, it's perfectly OK to not believe the answers. Not everyone believes what we say. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3405.0s)]
*  That's how you know, that's just how academia works. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3409.0s)]
*  But it is kind of meaningless just to say it seems the Born Rule is still an axiom. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3412.0s)]
*  The Born Rule is absolutely not an axiom within many worlds. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3417.0s)]
*  I mean, it literally is just not an axiom. You can say it cannot even be derived, or you can say, yes, it can be derived and we've derived it. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3422.0s)]
*  But it's not an axiom. Nobody thinks that it's an axiom. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3430.0s)]
*  P. Walder says, Stephen Wolfram's new theory shows that the graph separating seems to imply the existence of two separate universes. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3433.0s)]
*  Would the disconnected pieces of the graph appear as black holes due to the event horizon? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3440.0s)]
*  I have no idea. I have not followed that. I do not know how he gets relativity or reversible laws of physics out of graphs. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3445.0s)]
*  So I'm not the one to ask. Sorry. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3452.0s)]
*  Justin Bailey says, gravity is typically illustrated by, for example, putting a bowling ball on a flat sheet and talking about how the sheet is depressed. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3454.0s)]
*  But space is three dimensional. So is there a better visualization for gravity than the classic bowling ball on a rubber sheet? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3462.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, you can try, right? [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3470.0s)]
*  But the problem is that we're bad at visualizing things that are even three dimensional, right? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3473.0s)]
*  Because you have to imagine sort of seeing into them. They have to be transparent or translucent or something like that. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3480.0s)]
*  It happens all the time in physics that we visualize complicated things by simplifying down to one or two dimensions. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3486.0s)]
*  Even Hilbert space, which plausibly has at least a dimensionality of 10 to the power 10 to the power 122, is often approximated by being two dimensional. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3493.0s)]
*  We work with qubits, right, that are two dimensional. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3503.0s)]
*  So I suppose I could try to come up with a better visualization. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3505.0s)]
*  But honestly, my real answer is two dimensional visualizations are fine. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3509.0s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. We are constantly simplifying things. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3514.0s)]
*  And there's a famous XKCD cartoon where he gets at that. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3517.0s)]
*  There's a teacher writing on the blackboard the rubber sheet analogy, and someone raises their hand and says, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3522.0s)]
*  I don't like the rubber sheet analogy because it's gravity that is pulling down the ball on the rubber sheet. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3528.0s)]
*  But you're supposed to be explaining gravity. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3532.0s)]
*  So the teacher just looks at them in exasperation and says, OK, we'll do it the right way. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3534.0s)]
*  Space time is a Lorentzian four dimensional manifold with a minus plus plus plus signature obeying Einstein's equations derived from the Riemann curvature tensor. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3540.0s)]
*  I mean, there's the right way of doing it, right? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3547.0s)]
*  All of the visualizations are just, you know, clutchy kinds of helps that if you don't want to learn the math. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3549.0s)]
*  And so you have to accept that they will be imperfect in some way or another. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3554.0s)]
*  Stefan Berneger says, Why are you so skeptical about Wolfram's initiative? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3559.0s)]
*  Is it the process he has chosen or is there something fundamentally flawed with the idea? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3563.0s)]
*  So I think I already answered this one again. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3567.0s)]
*  More power to him. Go try to do all the physics you want to do. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3569.0s)]
*  I've explained why there was a way that he could have proposed presented his ideas that would have been enormously more persuasive facing up to all the problems that ideas like this have and knocking them down one by one. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3573.0s)]
*  But given that I think that these problems are big problems, I think that, you know, they're not nothing that he does is quantum from the start. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3586.0s)]
*  He claims that maybe quantum mechanics will come out of it. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3595.0s)]
*  Maybe the Renssen variance will come out of it. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3597.0s)]
*  Maybe, you know, fine. But time is short. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3599.0s)]
*  Got to pick different things to live your life about. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3602.0s)]
*  Just because someone is making grandiose claims doesn't mean I should drop what I'm doing, which I think is really fun and interesting and think about what they're doing instead. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3605.0s)]
*  So I'm not going to do that unless they give me a good reason to do so. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3613.0s)]
*  In fact, you know, let's let's put it this way. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3616.0s)]
*  The grandiosity of the claim does not increase my interest in trying to understand it. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3619.0s)]
*  The grandiosity of the claim increases my skepticism that they've gotten everything right. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3625.0s)]
*  You know, I think that, you know, you should be especially skeptical of incredibly grandiose claims that come out of left field like that. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3630.0s)]
*  You should not be especially excited about them. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3637.0s)]
*  I did a I put up a tweet about this. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3640.0s)]
*  Let me go find it. It's worth doing. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3644.0s)]
*  I can do this in real time, I think. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3645.0s)]
*  And I, you know, secretly making making fun of this. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3646.0s)]
*  There's just been a lot of emails I've been getting from different people who have theories of everything. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3650.0s)]
*  You know, it seems like quarantine is really just generating a whole lot of outsider physics. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3655.0s)]
*  Let's put it that way. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3661.0s)]
*  So I said, where is it? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3662.0s)]
*  Where did it go? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3665.0s)]
*  I lost it. Sorry about that. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3666.0s)]
*  Yeah. Crackpot physics emails always want to propose a theory of everything. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3667.0s)]
*  Why don't they ever think about the next to next to leading order and Jedina's soft function for T.W. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3671.0s)]
*  production? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3676.0s)]
*  And I linked to a paper which is actually like a real physics paper by real physicists. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3678.0s)]
*  And the title is next to next to leading order and Jedina's soft function for T.W. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3682.0s)]
*  production. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3686.0s)]
*  The point is, this is what Thomas Kuhn calls normal science, right? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3687.0s)]
*  Like the hard work of making little tiny bits of progress. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3690.0s)]
*  And I am ninety nine point nine percent sure that that paper on the next to next leading order approximation, which I have not read, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3693.0s)]
*  is completely believable. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3700.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, why in the world would they do that? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3702.0s)]
*  Would they put all that work into to not get it right? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3704.0s)]
*  Whereas someone just comes along and says, hey, I have a new theory of everything that is completely unlike everything. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3707.0s)]
*  And you might be skeptical, but I haven't really explained why the skepticism is unwarranted. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3711.0s)]
*  Then I'm going to spend my time doing other things. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3715.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3718.0s)]
*  And I try on the podcast to not hype up this kind of thing. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3719.0s)]
*  I get a million different requests. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3723.0s)]
*  You know, interview this guy. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3725.0s)]
*  This guy is making wild claims. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3726.0s)]
*  You know, this person thinks that UFOs cause quantum wave function collapse. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3728.0s)]
*  I don't want to draw attention that there's enough attention already. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3732.0s)]
*  I'm trying my best to draw attention to ideas I think are interesting, whether or not I agree with them or not. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3735.0s)]
*  Rudy M. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3740.0s)]
*  says, Do you think that some of the answers concerning the nature of consciousness can be partially answered within the realm of quantum mechanics and physics, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3741.0s)]
*  referencing ideas like Penrose and others? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3747.0s)]
*  So, no, I don't think so. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3750.0s)]
*  I talk a little bit about this in something deeply hidden and a little bit about this also in the big picture. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3752.0s)]
*  I'm a physicalist. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3757.0s)]
*  I think the consciousness is just an emergent phenomenon from the laws of physics. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3758.0s)]
*  There is a good physics question, which people like Matthew Fisher at UC Santa Barbara have tackled, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3762.0s)]
*  namely, is a classical model of the brain sufficient to capture its actual physical behavior? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3769.0s)]
*  Or do we need to take into account quantum entanglement and things like that? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3777.0s)]
*  I mean, after all, the brain is made of atoms, made of particles, made of things that obey the rules of physics. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3781.0s)]
*  Quantum entanglement might be important, but also the brain is a wet, noisy system, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3785.0s)]
*  which is exactly where we should expect everything to decohere very quickly in the classical approximation to be very good. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3790.0s)]
*  So I don't think that consciousness in particular has anything to do with quantum mechanics at all. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3795.0s)]
*  Simon Carter says, I'm really enjoying your biggest ideas in the universe series. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3800.0s)]
*  What study do you do before each episode, or is it the case that you know all the different subjects off the top of your head? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3804.0s)]
*  So for the Biggest Ideas series, there's a matter of how you spend your time, right? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3811.0s)]
*  And certainly there is a case to be made that if I want to improve my track record at getting scientific papers published, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3818.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be making videos at all. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3827.0s)]
*  But given that I'm making the videos and given that I'm trying to keep it reasonable once per week, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3829.0s)]
*  twice per week because there's a Q&A video also, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3834.0s)]
*  I got to minimize something. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3836.0s)]
*  What I'm minimizing is the preparation. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3837.0s)]
*  So basically I spend a few minutes writing a simple outline, but I don't do research. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3839.0s)]
*  I don't want to talk about things that I don't already know. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3844.0s)]
*  So the short answer is the things I talk about in that series are things I already know. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3847.0s)]
*  But there's nothing special about me there. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3851.0s)]
*  Almost everything that I say are things that most people who have a PhD in theoretical physics would also know equally well. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3853.0s)]
*  I have my own special take on them because I have a PhD in physics. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3860.0s)]
*  I have my own special take on them because I have angles on different ideas. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3863.0s)]
*  But it's not like my knowledge is way bigger than other people's on these issues. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3867.0s)]
*  Ricardo Rosera says, could you explain an experiment that would test many worlds versus Copenhagen in quantum mechanics? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3871.0s)]
*  So I can't because Copenhagen is not well defined. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3878.0s)]
*  I have no idea what is meant by the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3881.0s)]
*  The problem with Copenhagen is you say, you know, I measure an object and its wave function collapses. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3885.0s)]
*  But you never say what you mean by measuring. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3890.0s)]
*  You never say, you know, what it means, how quickly it happens. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3893.0s)]
*  Many worlds is completely rigorously defined. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3896.0s)]
*  It says that the Schrodinger equation is true at every moment. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3898.0s)]
*  If you give me a version of the Copenhagen interpretation that is equally well defined, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3901.0s)]
*  that tells me exactly when wave functions collapse, that would be something that we could test. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3908.0s)]
*  Because for one thing, unless you have hidden variables or something else going on, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3914.0s)]
*  the energy of the wave function changes when you do an experiment in quantum measurement in the Copenhagen interpretation. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3919.0s)]
*  So energy is not conserved in the Copenhagen interpretation. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3927.0s)]
*  In many worlds, it's more subtle because energy is overall conserved in the grand wave function of the universe. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3930.0s)]
*  But branch by branch, it might not be. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3936.0s)]
*  So that kind of thing might very well let you do an experiment. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3938.0s)]
*  But until one of the two competitors is well defined, I cannot test them against each other. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3941.0s)]
*  Benjamin Feddersen says, here's the thought experiment. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3947.0s)]
*  An observer is inside a satellite, no windows, in orbit around a gravity well. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3949.0s)]
*  In the room is a computer terminal connected to a main tower outside of a room by a cable. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3953.0s)]
*  And let's say it's running Minecraft. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3959.0s)]
*  When the observer begins to play, they notice that the frame rate is lagging. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3961.0s)]
*  Would there be any way for that observer to tell whether lag is caused by the main power being lowered into the gravity well [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3965.0s)]
*  and being subjected to time dilation? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3970.0s)]
*  Or rather, by another person in this room next door trying to run another instance of the program at the same time? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3973.0s)]
*  If not, would this represent another equivalence principle similar to the equivalence between gravity and acceleration? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3979.0s)]
*  So I don't think so. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3984.0s)]
*  So the idea, if I can shorten it down, is I'm in a locked spaceship, but I have a computer that is connected to the outside world. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3986.0s)]
*  The computer seems to be running slowly. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3995.0s)]
*  Can I tell the difference between it's running slowly because of general relativity versus it's running slowly because someone is soaking up CPU cycles on the server? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=3997.0s)]
*  I don't think that you necessarily could tell the difference between that. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4005.0s)]
*  But I don't think it's another equivalence principle. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4009.0s)]
*  I think it's the equivalence principle. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4012.0s)]
*  I think this is saying that it would be a slightly roundabout argument. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4014.0s)]
*  But if the only thing, let me see what the best way to say this is, you can use the equivalence principle to derive the fact that something that is far away experiences time differently than something that is at your point in the gravitational potential well. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4022.0s)]
*  And from that, you could derive this result. That's all you need. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4039.0s)]
*  All you're using here is the fact that there is gravitational time dilation. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4042.0s)]
*  And the simple way of saying your question is, can you distinguish gravitational time dilation just from a system slowing down for some other reason? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4047.0s)]
*  And the answer is no. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4054.0s)]
*  But I think that's the ordinary equivalence principle, not a new one. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4055.0s)]
*  Ross Hastings says, What are your favorite physics books written by other authors? Is there a particular book or books you consider to be a must read? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4059.0s)]
*  I don't think it's anything that's a must read. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4066.0s)]
*  Honestly, even my books are not must reads. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4068.0s)]
*  I mean, you should read them. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4070.0s)]
*  They make you better people. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4071.0s)]
*  You know, there's a million different people with different things that they might learn from different books. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4073.0s)]
*  So I don't ever like to say that books are must reads. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4077.0s)]
*  I do have a lot of books that are that are special to me. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4079.0s)]
*  But, you know, to be fair, I don't read physics books by other authors. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4083.0s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4087.0s)]
*  I did when I was younger, when I was not a physicist. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4089.0s)]
*  But now if I'm going to read trade level books, for example, I'm going to read about something's not physics because I already know the physics stuff. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4093.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4100.0s)]
*  I want to learn about biology or history or something like that. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4101.0s)]
*  I will read textbooks. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4103.0s)]
*  Like I said, you know, I have all these books on information theory and probability that I'm supposed to be reading. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4104.0s)]
*  But that's a little bit different. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4110.0s)]
*  But still, you know, books come out that I enjoy that I can tell are very good. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4112.0s)]
*  You know, Scott Aronson's book on quantum computing since Democritus is good. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4117.0s)]
*  Gertl Escher Bach was a classic that I read when I was a kid. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4123.0s)]
*  George Gamov's books like 123 Infinity were other ones that I read when I was a kid. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4127.0s)]
*  Jenna Levin wrote her first book called How the Universe Got Its Spots. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4133.0s)]
*  I really have enormous admiration for it because it's very different. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4138.0s)]
*  It uses physics, but it's also sort of a personal quasi novelistic kind of story. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4141.0s)]
*  Amanda Geffner wrote a wonderful book about Wheeler and Einstein and the origin of the universe and things like that. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4147.0s)]
*  So there's a bunch of books out there that are that are really good in different ways. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4153.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think like all of the people who appeared on my podcast have written good books. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4157.0s)]
*  So I don't feel bad if I haven't mentioned your name by explicitness. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4161.0s)]
*  All right. Santiago Torres says, What are your thoughts on the tension between individual rights and economic growth versus public health that we're seeing play out throughout the country in response to the coronavirus crisis? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4167.0s)]
*  It seems that stay at home orders are really the only effective tool we have right now, but an outspoken minority of the public and politicians are growing impatient. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4178.0s)]
*  You know, I think that there is there's a lot going on here. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4185.0s)]
*  One is that there is, of course, in principle, a fascinating tug of war between different kinds of social goals like health versus wealth. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4189.0s)]
*  OK, roughly speaking in practice. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4202.0s)]
*  I don't think this is an example of this. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4206.0s)]
*  I think that, you know, large number of people dying would be really bad for the economy. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4208.0s)]
*  So I think that both the health and the wealth criteria both point to saying, keep the country shut down for a while until we're sure that we have dealt with the problem as well as we can. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4212.0s)]
*  And then even when we reopen it, be ready to shut it down again if we see things flare up once again. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4224.0s)]
*  Obviously, what we're hoping for is a future regime where we can test people enormously quickly and in enormous numbers so that we know when things are safe, even better be a vaccine or something like that, where people could think that they personally are very safe. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4230.0s)]
*  So right now, I don't think that realistically there's much actual debate going on. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4244.0s)]
*  There is the other on the other side. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4249.0s)]
*  The way in which we reopen is a very difficult question, right? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4252.0s)]
*  So you can say, all right, the number of new cases per day is seen to be going down. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4256.0s)]
*  That's good. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4261.0s)]
*  We've been pretty good about being responsible. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4262.0s)]
*  And so things are getting better. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4265.0s)]
*  Let's start coming back to life a little bit. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4267.0s)]
*  Let's let hardware stores open or restaurants. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4270.0s)]
*  But should you still have concerts and things like that? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4275.0s)]
*  And I think that you can't predict ahead of time is the most well-established fact. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4278.0s)]
*  You can't predict ahead of time what will happen when you do these things. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4284.0s)]
*  So when you do them, I think we should go slowly and patiently. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4287.0s)]
*  I don't think that there are that many people who are growing impatient. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4292.0s)]
*  There's just a very small number that are noisy, and I'm very happy to ignore those people. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4296.0s)]
*  Perry Romanowski says, when you're not an expert on a topic but want to have an informed opinion, what is your strategy for developing that opinion? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4299.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really important question. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4307.0s)]
*  You know, I think that I am a believer in expertise and knowledge. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4309.0s)]
*  So I look at people who are experts and do have knowledge. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4312.0s)]
*  And by that, I mean, you know, people who have a track record, who have established within that field that they have accomplished something, they know about it, that they've spoken about it and maybe even contributed to it. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4316.0s)]
*  I don't necessarily believe them just because they are experts. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4328.0s)]
*  But if I have two people with opinions, one of them is an expert and one is not, I will put more credence on the expert's opinion than on the non-expert's opinion. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4333.0s)]
*  There are higher level considerations that come into mind beyond whether a person is an expert or not. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4342.0s)]
*  You can kind of try to tell by how people talk about things, how trustworthy they are, by which I mean you can be a super duper expert in something, but you can also be a zealot, right? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4347.0s)]
*  You can be a fanatic. You can be dedicated to your particular take on that thing and be really, really, really good at it and yet not be trustworthy. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4358.0s)]
*  As Ezra Klein said on the podcast I did with him, you know, nobody knows more about the architecture of buildings and how they can collapse than 911 truthers because they're just obsessed with this stuff. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4366.0s)]
*  They're utterly unreliable about it, but they're incredibly knowledgeable about it. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4380.0s)]
*  So you have to sort of convolve your judgment of whether or not someone is an expert with your judgment of their judgment. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4384.0s)]
*  Do they seem to be the kind of person who says, well, here's what I think, but I'm not completely sure. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4391.0s)]
*  Here's the evidence I have, but I'm still learning versus the kind of person who says, I understand this. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4396.0s)]
*  No one else understands this. Everyone else is an idiot. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4402.0s)]
*  I have a new way of doing things that is radically different and only my genius is good enough to comprehend it. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4405.0s)]
*  That kind of person, I don't put much stake in at all. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4410.0s)]
*  Ian Robinson says, guess what? Any further thoughts on the Stephen Wolfram and collaborators computational view of reality? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4414.0s)]
*  So I think I've said what I need to say about Stephen Wolfram, etc. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4420.0s)]
*  Manuel Bivand says, do you think entropic reasoning is a valuable intellectual tool? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4423.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, in very, very specific circumstances. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4429.0s)]
*  So it's not I think that there's sort of a very trivial, obvious level at which it's useful. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4433.0s)]
*  And there's a more subtle level at which I'm not quite sure I understand it. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4440.0s)]
*  I think I'm coming closer. The trivial level is this. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4444.0s)]
*  There are selection effects in where people and intelligent life forms appear in the universe. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4448.0s)]
*  So if someone thought it was a really good question to ask, why in the world did life arise on the surface of the earth rather than the surface of the sun? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4456.0s)]
*  Given that the sun has a much bigger surface, you would expect it is much more likely that life would arise on the surface of the sun. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4466.0s)]
*  Well, I think that there's a perfectly good entropic answer to that, namely that the surface of the sun might be big, but it's not very hospitable to the existence of life. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4473.0s)]
*  Therefore, I have answered that question. Therefore, that question is in the pile of questions I'm not going to worry about anymore. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4482.0s)]
*  Right. So I think that's a very trivial, very true, very robust use of entropic reasoning. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4487.0s)]
*  Now, where it becomes much more problematic and difficult and not necessarily wrong, but just legitimately difficult and requiring care is where you want to say, what can I conclude about the wider universe from my place in it? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4493.0s)]
*  So if there is a universe where there's a set of very different conditions, like a multiverse, whether it's different branches of the wave function or different pocket universes in a cosmology, how should I reason probabilistically about what I expect to see in such a universe? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4510.0s)]
*  There is sort of the straightforward idea that I should just imagine that it's most likely that I'm a typical observer in that ensemble. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4527.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be humble, right? And I could even extend this to time as well as space. So I should be a typical observer in the history of humanity, right? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4536.0s)]
*  If I'm given that I'm human, conditionalizing on the fact that I'm a human being, we should be typical human beings. That sort of has a sweetly reasonable character to it, right? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4543.0s)]
*  Like, of course, we're typical. That seems very humble and modest. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4552.0s)]
*  And this leads to arguments like that. There's a famous thing called the Doomsday Argument, which says that humanity won't last too much longer. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4555.0s)]
*  I mean, too much might be, you know, a few hundred thousand years, but not millions or billions of years. Why? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4563.0s)]
*  Well, because if humanity lasts a million years, then we are not typical. We are really right near at the beginning. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4570.0s)]
*  But if you think we're neither in the first five percent of all human beings who ever lived nor the last five percent, then that bounds where we are in the history of humanity. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4576.0s)]
*  I think that's complete nonsense, to be honest, because there's no reason to think that we're typical observers within humanity. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4586.0s)]
*  It sounds very humble, but it's anti-humble because you're getting all your leverage not from saying you are typical, but from saying typical people are like you. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4593.0s)]
*  And that's not humble at all. I talk a little bit about this in my paper on why Boltzmann brains are bad. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4601.0s)]
*  It's called The Presumptuous Philosopher Problem. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4608.0s)]
*  And I'm actually, you know, I have some notes for another paper that I might write someday about this, about anthropic reasoning more generally. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4611.0s)]
*  My favorite paper ever written about anthropic reasoning is by Radford Neal, N-E-A-L, who is a statistician at the University of Toronto. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4618.0s)]
*  And it's called Puzzles of Anthropic Reasoning Solved. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4626.0s)]
*  I forget exactly, but solved or something like that by fully non-indexical conditioning. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4630.0s)]
*  So he takes the opposite point of view, that rather than thinking that you're a typical observer, you should you should take into account all of what you already know about what kind of observer you are. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4635.0s)]
*  And that's the only anthropic reasoning you're allowed to do. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4645.0s)]
*  I'm not 100 percent on board with this, but I think it's much better than the typical paper on this stuff out there. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4647.0s)]
*  Cam Umbers says, Could you recommend some classic papers in your area of interest for the more advanced but very much amateur physics fan? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4653.0s)]
*  For context, I'm a landscape gardener and carpenter, but spend my work days listening to lectures and my free time studying mathematics. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4660.0s)]
*  So, you know, unfortunately, this is I understand why you're asking this question, but I'm not going to be able to give you a very satisfying answer, Cam, because we don't read classic papers. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4666.0s)]
*  That's just not what physicists do. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4676.0s)]
*  Right. When when a classic paper is written, typically, it's at a point in the history of the development of physics where you're going out on a limb a little bit. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4678.0s)]
*  Right. You're literally the first person Einstein inventing general relativity, like, you know, no one before him really appreciated the gravity was the curvature of space time. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4686.0s)]
*  And so he didn't have at his fingertips, the best most modern way of thinking about it, notation, problems to solve, you know, the the paradigm that Thomas Kuhn talked about in the same book, Structure of Scientific Revolutions. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4694.0s)]
*  And so if you want to learn general relativity, honestly, you could try reading Einstein's original papers, but I've never read them. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4707.0s)]
*  You'd be much better served reading my textbook, honestly, or anyone else's textbook, because we're much better at explaining general relativity now than Einstein was. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4716.0s)]
*  We're much better at explaining quantum mechanics than Bohr was, etc. or Heisenberg or Schrödinger. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4723.0s)]
*  Now, there are certain examples where it's fascinating to read original papers. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4728.0s)]
*  It's fascinating to read the EPR paper on quantum correlations because they were trying to make an argument that we still argue about today. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4732.0s)]
*  It's fascinating to read John Bell's original papers and some things like that. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4741.0s)]
*  But to be honest, I don't have I mean, it's fascinating to read Steven Weinberg's paper on the electroweak theory that's simply called a theory of leptons because it's kind of, you know, it's one of those things where the implications are so much bigger than the rhetoric. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4746.0s)]
*  Right. He's like, yeah, here's a theory of leptons. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4760.0s)]
*  Maybe it works. Who knows? But it was enormously brilliant and influential in just a few pages. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4762.0s)]
*  Didn't take very long. But for the most part, my point is that reading the classic papers is not something we do. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4767.0s)]
*  Sorry. Paul Torek says in the Carol Chen 2004 model of baby universes being born with low entropy, the babies spring from random fluctuations in the vacuum of the present universe of the parent universe. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4773.0s)]
*  Is there any way to avoid also getting lots of Boltzmann brains from similar fluctuations? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4785.0s)]
*  Can we have this explanation of our universe's low entropy and also be reasonably confident we aren't Boltzmann brains? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4789.0s)]
*  So I think the answer is yes. I think this is exactly one of the benefits of this model. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4794.0s)]
*  The point being that. Counterintuitively, it is much easier to fluctuate a whole new universe than it is a brain. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4800.0s)]
*  And partly that's because brains are big, right? You know, brains are a few pounds and a lot of particles and they're very complex, very specific systems. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4809.0s)]
*  Universe, you might think, wow, universe has even more particles and is even more specific, but that's not true. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4817.0s)]
*  This is the beauty of general relativity and inflationary cosmology. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4822.0s)]
*  You can make a baby universe that is not much bigger than the Planck scale and is completely featureless, has zero particles in it, just has energy. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4825.0s)]
*  And through the power of inflation, inflation can expand that Planck scale thing to a macroscopic size. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4834.0s)]
*  And through the power of quantum mechanics and reheating, it can turn that energy into a large number of particles. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4839.0s)]
*  So if you just do the math, the number of new universes you will make is much, much larger than the number of Boltzmann brains you will make. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4845.0s)]
*  Murray Dunn says, At some point a podcast you mentioned working on an iPad Pro. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4853.0s)]
*  Will you talk a bit about what programs you use, your workflow, how you organize, et cetera? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4858.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, a little bit, but, you know, I'm not that systematic. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4863.0s)]
*  I'm not sort of a workflow fetishist. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4867.0s)]
*  I take what is available to me. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4871.0s)]
*  You know, for most of my life, I just worked on eight and a half and 11 by 11 pieces of paper with a pen. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4874.0s)]
*  Someone asked me previously my favorite pens, the Uniball Vision Elite remains my favorite pen. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4880.0s)]
*  And then I would just stick my loose pieces of paper into Manila envelope files and file them away. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4885.0s)]
*  These days, it's much more often done on the iPad with the Apple Pencil. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4892.0s)]
*  And I use either Notability or Note Plus. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4897.0s)]
*  These are two programs that make it very easy to write equations and stuff like that. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4900.0s)]
*  What makes them especially nice is that they are they basically output PDFs, which you can then print and also that you can import PDFs. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4906.0s)]
*  So like for signing documents and for filling out forms and stuff like that, it's very helpful. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4915.0s)]
*  You can import someone's paper and you can read it and take notes on it, right? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4919.0s)]
*  You can have a red pen and circle things you think are important in the paper and so forth. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4923.0s)]
*  So I'm not completely organized in my way of doing that, but that's mostly what I do these days. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4927.0s)]
*  There was something else I was going to say about that. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4935.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Recording equations. There is this amazing thing that, you know, I tech my papers, late tech my papers like everybody else does. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4937.0s)]
*  And there's this wonderful program you can get at least for the Mac, I think is available. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4945.0s)]
*  Everyone called. What's it called? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4951.0s)]
*  Darn it. Math Snip. Is that what it's called? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4954.0s)]
*  Math picks. I forget. I'm looking for I'm actually using the program right now and it's not telling me what the program is. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4960.0s)]
*  So sorry about that. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4967.0s)]
*  Preferences. It's just not giving me the name of the program. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4970.0s)]
*  I think it's called Math picks. Anyway, the point of it is sorry about this. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4974.0s)]
*  The point of it is you can write. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4978.0s)]
*  Basically, what it does is on your screen of your laptop, you can snap a screenshot of a region of your screen that has equations. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4982.0s)]
*  And this will turn them into late tech equation formulas. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4991.0s)]
*  Right. So if you have someone else's paper, you can screenshot their equation and turn into late tech and drop into your paper. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=4994.0s)]
*  But even better, it has quite good handwriting recognition abilities. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5001.0s)]
*  So I can write equations in notes plus or notability, import them as PDFs to my laptop. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5006.0s)]
*  And I just did this yesterday. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5013.0s)]
*  It is a long series of four equations with a lot of Greek symbols and so forth. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5015.0s)]
*  Just snap them in here and get it turned into late tech without doing any typing. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5019.0s)]
*  It's not perfect. You know, my letter G's and my number nines turn out to be similar looking and things like that. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5024.0s)]
*  But it's close enough that it's way easier to do that. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5030.0s)]
*  Go in and edit than to type from scratch. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5033.0s)]
*  So that's the only other clever trick that I use. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5036.0s)]
*  OK, so the file got too big for the audio recording of this month's AMA for Patreon. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5042.0s)]
*  They won't let me upload a file bigger than a certain size. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5048.0s)]
*  So this is part one. This is the end of part one. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5052.0s)]
*  Look for the other post where part two of the AMA is going to be. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipw61UhuM98&t=5055.0s)]
