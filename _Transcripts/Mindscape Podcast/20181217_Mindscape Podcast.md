It's a big universe out there, full of an astonishing variety of questions and puzzles. Today's guest, Janna Levin, is a physicist who has delved into some of the trippiest aspects of cosmology and gravitation: the topology of the universe, extra dimensions of space, and the appearance of chaos in orbits around black holes. At the same time, she has been a pioneer in talking about science in interesting and innovative ways: a personal memoir, a novelized narrative of famous scientific lives, and a journalistic exploration of one of the most important experiments of our time. We talk about how one shapes an unusual scientific career, and how the practice of science relates to more traditionally humanistic concerns.

# Episode 27: Janna Levin on Black Holes, Chaos, and the Narrative of Science
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 17, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy8r71G0rKo)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. In today's
*  episode I have a conversation with an old friend of mine who happens to also be an enormously
*  respected scientist and writer, Jana Levin. Like me, Jana maintains both an active research
*  program, she's a professor of physics at Columbia University in Bernard College where she thinks
*  about black holes and cosmology and astrophysics in various ways, but also a broader effort
*  to interact with other disciplines and with the general public. But we choose slightly different
*  ways of going about that broader impact kind of sector of our efforts. In particular, what Jana
*  has done is mastered a way of writing about science that is fundamentally narrative in focus
*  and tone. Her books that explain science to a broader public really read like novels, and in
*  fact one of them is basically a novel. She mixes the human side of science with the actual research
*  being done better than anyone else that I know. So we'll talk a little bit about her research,
*  because that's always where things come from in some sense, but mostly about the book she's
*  written and why she chooses to write about science in this way. Her most recent book,
*  which I recommend that you read, is called Black Hole Blues, and it's about the discovery
*  of gravitational waves, the building of the LIGO observatory, and all the effort that went into
*  that over the years. So this conversation serves as an interesting companion piece to my conversation
*  with Kip Thorne from just a couple of episodes ago. As Kip was there, he was one of the people
*  who was interviewed by Jana for his efforts in helping to build LIGO and make it happen. So you
*  get different sides of the same story, which is interesting to compare. Okay, this talk has two
*  old friends talking at great length. There's lots of laughs. I think you're going to enjoy this ride.
*  Let's go.
*  Jana Levin, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Ah, thanks for having me.
*  So as we've been reminiscing here pre-recording, we've known each other for a long time. We were
*  graduate students, but not at the same place. You started out at MIT, and I went to Harvard. So tell
*  us a little bit about the trajectory scientifically, like what you started trying to study and where you
*  are now.
*  Well, I mean, mostly, we usually talk about our meeting story.
*  There's that, yes, you're welcome to tell that.
*  What were we on? We were on a, what were they called? Tram? Tram?
*  The T is the subway.
*  Oh, God, so cute. In Boston, it's called the T. And I think I was reading Beryl and Davies, quantum
*  field theory and curved spacetime. As you do, as you do during rush hour. And then this tall, skinny
*  dude is looking over at me like, Hey, I know Beryl and Davies.
*  No, you're leaving out the best part. I was with a guy I knew who was trying to hit on you.
*  Oh, yeah, that's right.
*  And I tried to like save you by saying like, wait, aren't you reading a book on quantum field theory
*  and curved spacetime?
*  So basically, yes, you you derailed.
*  He was mad at me afterward. Yeah,
*  was he? He should be. Well, no, he shouldn't be. I was not mad at you. So that's, so that's the
*  benefit. And we've basically been friends since, which is kind of hilarious.
*  That's right. It's extremely hilarious. But you were. We studied a lot. We studied a lot together.
*  There were a lot of problems sets. A lot of problems sets. A lot of discussions about whether
*  coffee should have milk in it or not. How much coffee should be drunk after midnight.
*  At 2am, we're in the middle of a problem set. This is very important.
*  Crucial.
*  Decision making.
*  So I would say that in terms of trajectory, I was definitely not that kid who thought I was going
*  to be a scientist. And, you know, I discovered it really late.
*  I had really negative ideas about science and physics in particular, which is really kind of
*  hilarious. It's like my punishment in life was to become a physicist and have to redefine the
*  identity. So I think that one thing that you and I always really enjoyed when we were even students
*  was the sort of creative aspect of physics and how there are different solutions and different ways
*  to approach things. And that it's like cracking the walnut. You find this really clever insights.
*  And it's just this pleasure. It's this pleasure to be connected to the universe through this medium,
*  which is wild that it works. And I feel like you and I kind of grew up together with that, learning
*  that. Not like high school, college level, but like feeling it.
*  Yeah, because it's in graduate school that you first get to sort of be right up close and personal
*  with the universe in some sense, right?
*  Right. Right. And we're still asking the most naive questions then.
*  I hope so.
*  And it's so sweet.
*  That's right. Yeah.
*  So sweet.
*  And a lot of people do something in grad school and then end up doing it for their lives. Right?
*  Yeah.
*  Which is not exactly what you've done.
*  No, that's true.
*  Tell us what science you did in grad school.
*  Well, gosh, I was kind of lost in grad school, to be honest, because I wasn't at my happiest point.
*  But I was definitely working on alternative theories of gravity and space time stuff and how to
*  interpret the Big Bang. But I don't think it was my best work.
*  I mean, I know it's not my best work.
*  I think that a lot of that came later with sort of more fluency and lots of different subjects and
*  less trying to prove something to somebody.
*  Right.
*  Grad school was very much about making sure your professors thought a certain thing about you so
*  that you could go on.
*  Yeah.
*  And my most creative work definitely came, I think, later when I felt less of that.
*  You know, less constrained by what other people thought.
*  And yeah, so you got into a whole bunch of, you know, interesting buzzwords stirred together with
*  chaos theory and topology and cosmology and black holes.
*  Still like all that stuff.
*  Yeah, still like all that stuff.
*  So what does it mean?
*  It's all good stuff.
*  How does that come together to do science?
*  Well, it's funny.
*  So I think that right from a distance, it looks like none of the things I'm interested in have a
*  coherent theme.
*  But they all do really, which is basically space time physics.
*  It's basically the coherent terrain on which all the other stuff plays out.
*  So even when I've done chaos theory, which I learned a lot from other people just by
*  collaborating with other people who were very thoughtful, like dynamical systems, it's the best
*  way to learn actually is from other scientists.
*  So very much borrowing and sharing and collaborating on chaos theory from people like
*  Neil Cornish.
*  It all happened in a curved space time.
*  That's where we were interested.
*  And one of the most interesting questions was, you know, chaos is usually defined as a loss of
*  predictability over time and exponential deviation over time.
*  But you can't define a singular time in relativity.
*  That's the whole point.
*  So suddenly you have this.
*  What does it mean to be chaotic?
*  What are there on ambiguous declarations?
*  And chaos really does mean that there are not functional solutions to.
*  Sorry, my phone.
*  God damn it.
*  I thought I put it on silent.
*  You know that there are not functional solutions to the equations of motion that's on
*  ambiguous.
*  It can't be ambiguous whose time, what time.
*  So a lot of the fun we had was to try to make understandable declarations of chaos that
*  were the same for all observers in space time.
*  Well, this actually puzzled me about chaos still always puzzled me about chaos, maybe
*  because I learned relativity first, you know, in relativity, time is up to you.
*  You can choose time however you want.
*  So you could have a logarithmic time or something like that where the chaos goes away.
*  Technically, the other way around.
*  I'm thinking like if two things diverge only linearly with time, I'll define time to be
*  log time.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  Make it exponential.
*  So did you succeed?
*  Yes.
*  What we realized is that in a lot of these systems, what you can look at is the possibility
*  of large sets.
*  So for instance, large numbers of orbits around black holes, whether they merge or escape
*  or are stable, that you can begin to find fractal sets in the space of possibilities.
*  And fractals are unambiguous declarations of chaotic behavior because what's happening
*  with a fractal, which is so smart that nature does is it figures out a way to pack tons
*  of information in the smallest space possible.
*  Right.
*  So our heads can remain volume wise small ish, but surface wise very large by having lots
*  of fractal folds.
*  Because the brain is a two dimensional sheet crumpled up inside.
*  Exactly.
*  Crumpling it up, making it a fractal allows you to have this huge surface area without
*  scaling up the volume, which we couldn't support on our little necks.
*  And so what are you looking at in the black hole?
*  You're like throwing a particle at it and seeing how it comes out?
*  Yeah.
*  Like here's an example.
*  Two black holes can be arranged to be completely static with charge and gravity balancing.
*  So they're charged.
*  So they're electromagnetically repulsive, but they're massive.
*  So they're gravitationally attractive and you can tune it just on paper to be perfectly
*  stable.
*  These are not real experiments.
*  These are not real experiments.
*  It does not exist in astrophysics.
*  But the orbits of stuff around those two will be like a pinball game.
*  It'll be like a complex game of pinball.
*  And so what you can do is look at the fractal set of possibilities.
*  So how many little things you throw in there fall in, how many little things escape, how
*  many little things are stable.
*  And if you start to try to very precisely define whether it's stable, merging, or escaping,
*  no matter how precisely you try to make those definitions, you still find a mixture of all
*  possibilities.
*  Right.
*  And that's classic fractal behavior that you look closer and closer and you still can't
*  pinpoint what happens because a subtle, subtle dependence on the tiniest difference in the
*  initial condition leads to the exactly opposite outcome.
*  So what we did show was that the fractal dimension was related to things like the Lyapunov exponent,
*  which is measures in time.
*  Tell us what that is.
*  I know.
*  Oh, geez.
*  You said it.
*  Sorry.
*  No, it's my fault.
*  Oh, my God.
*  That was really naughty.
*  So if it was just ordinary space, we would say that the time scale over which there was
*  a divergence in predictability was set by something called the Lyapunov exponent.
*  But because of what you raised about the ambiguity of time in relativity, it's different for
*  every different observer.
*  So we were basically able to show that the fractal dimension was the same for all observers.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  And it was a combination of things like Lyapunov time scale and a spatial time.
*  Details don't matter, but everybody would agree that the fractal was there.
*  And this is a classic thing that physicists like to do, that you can sort of calculate
*  something one way, but you worry that it depends on how you calculated it.
*  So you look for something you can show everyone would agree on this, no matter how they calculate
*  it.
*  Yeah, physics is really hard in that way.
*  Physics is nothing but not hard.
*  Don't tell the audience that.
*  I can tell them it's very easy the whole time.
*  Yeah.
*  So what you want is a measure of something that's the same for all observers.
*  That's really what you strive for.
*  So as you well know in relativity, you can't say time is the same for all observers.
*  You can't say space is the same for all observers.
*  But you can say that there's a space-time interval, which is a measure in the four-dimensional
*  space-time, which is the same for all observers.
*  And that's really gratifying.
*  And that you can orient all your interpretations around that invariant.
*  And has this interest in the chaotic behavior of particles going around black holes lead
*  you later to think about real astrophysical black holes that are out there?
*  It did.
*  Oh my God, this crazy thing.
*  And I think you and I also suffer from this a little bit, which is that in our youngest
*  years being most fascinated with the most abstract, most surreal, maybe not astrophysically
*  relevant.
*  Right.
*  And because there was something about it that just appealed to our tastes.
*  Yeah.
*  So for the audience out there, there are astrophysicists who are, as I keep saying, relatively down
*  to earth, despite doing astrophysics.
*  Right?
*  They're worried about real stuff.
*  We see it in telescopes.
*  We understand the underlying physics.
*  But then there's some of us who go right to the edges of what we understand, which is
*  a little fuzzier.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that there's still that pull for me.
*  But a part of as I started to think about what's your contribution and what comes back
*  to you.
*  I wanted to see something predicted and verified.
*  Yeah.
*  It's about nature at the end of the day.
*  It's about nature at the end of the day.
*  We have this total, and I love to call it an unrequited love for nature.
*  We love her.
*  She does not love us back.
*  She is quite indifferent to us.
*  Playing hard to get.
*  She is very hard to get.
*  So I think that there was this sense of, oh God, if there was one thing, just one thing,
*  and then I'll go back to my insane abstractions.
*  But one thing that was verifiable while I was alive, that would feel so good.
*  It would be so fun.
*  It would be very childlike fun.
*  Just exploratory.
*  And then there's the instinct gratification.
*  So yes, it did lead me from being completely theoretical, imagined models of black holes
*  to wait a minute, they're real black holes.
*  They're out there.
*  Cool.
*  There are things that we can say about them that people haven't said yet.
*  It's still in some sense accessible to discovery.
*  So I started getting really into more how black holes could contribute to electronic
*  circuits and weird things like that.
*  But wait a minute.
*  So I think that the typical person listening is going, electronic circuits I do build
*  in a little lab room and I put things together and a light bulb comes up.
*  So how do I stick a wire into the black hole and light a light bulb or what happens?
*  It's so funny.
*  It's one of these things that I learned as a student but always never really understood.
*  And one of the things if I try to tell my students now is that if you don't understand
*  something, keep leaning on it because maybe you're going to crack something that everyone
*  else has been glib about.
*  And this was sort of one of those examples which was black holes have no hair, meaning
*  they cannot support complicated things like magnetic field lines.
*  If you remember in high school throwing iron shavings around a magnet and seeing the path
*  of the field lines traced out that you couldn't see with your eyes but that the iron filings
*  you see it literally looks like hair coming out of the top of a head and then usually
*  going into the chin.
*  So it's a perfectly spherical head.
*  It's a hair beard.
*  And the earth has such a magnetic field.
*  Neutron stars have very big magnetic fields.
*  Neutron stars, exactly.
*  Black holes, the formally proved cannot support the hair of magnetic fields, meaning they
*  just can't have them.
*  So I was always confused about that because as you said, neutron stars have these big
*  magnetic fields that can be a trillion times that of the earth.
*  They're literally the strongest magnets in the universe.
*  Neutron stars, they're almost black holes but not quite.
*  They're dead stars that don't make it to be black holes.
*  And if a black hole swallows one, which we suspect happens quite frequently, what happens
*  to magnetic field?
*  And there was always this very glib argument.
*  And I think that just by not accepting the standard lore and just sort of scratching
*  at it, just being stubborn, we realized that there's this phase where the huge magnet
*  is whipping around the black hole and it's going to create an electronic circuit.
*  So if I disconnect a light bulb out of a lamp, I don't have a lamp here, and I disconnect
*  the light bulb and I hold it in my hand, in principle, absolute basic electricity magnetism,
*  no relativity, no black holes, nothing fancy.
*  If I wave a magnet around strongly enough, I will light up that light bulb.
*  It doesn't need to be plugged into a battery or the wall or anything.
*  So I create electricity by a waving magnet.
*  Because the magnetic field stretches away from the magnet.
*  Even though you don't see it, there's something stretching from the magnet to the light bulb.
*  Varying magnetic fields create electric fields.
*  It's not spooky action.
*  It is not spooky action at a distance.
*  It's completely predictable.
*  It's totally normal.
*  It's totally natural.
*  And so basically that's what we have.
*  We have this magnet whipping around near the speed of light around the black hole, and
*  it's creating actually an incredibly powerful electronic circuit.
*  I don't know how we were the first ones to point this out, because this is basically
*  from like 1885.
*  But there's so many things like that.
*  Like someone must have pointed this out there, if I won't think about it, right?
*  And then you lose the chance.
*  Yeah.
*  So this No-Hair Theorem, which is so lovely, doesn't say that a black hole can't have
*  a magnetic field.
*  It says it can only have a magnetic field consistent with the certain circumstances.
*  The stuff around it.
*  Exactly.
*  And charge, which we can get into it.
*  So that's fun.
*  I mean, I was drawing circuit diagrams for like the biggest, most powerful batteries
*  in the universe.
*  Well, you know, it seems like we're just doing it for fun, but that's where a lot of great
*  science comes from, right?
*  Like why care about chaos in black holes or electric circuits in black holes?
*  Part of the motivation might be not just, well, this is going to lead us to the super
*  secrets of the universe.
*  It's just kind of cool.
*  It is cool.
*  Totally.
*  And that's where super secrets sometimes get revealed.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think when people, and I know you and I have also had this conversation privately,
*  when people say things like it's murdering to dissect or doesn't it make you feel glum
*  or despair that the universe is this, you know, mathematical machine.
*  I don't know how you can walk away from this and not feel meaning, right?
*  Not feel exactly the opposite, which is how are we so fortunate to be connected to the
*  origin of the universe through math?
*  What a gift.
*  And that it's so meaningful and so moving.
*  So we absolutely do this for emotional reasons.
*  Yeah, which is fine.
*  There are no other reasons, right?
*  That's where the reasons come from.
*  Exactly.
*  And this is a great segue right into what I mostly want to talk about was you've been
*  extraordinarily successful in addition to the science at things science adjacent, especially
*  in telling stories, telling stories strictly about science or scientifically inflected.
*  You've written several books, a memoir, a novel and narrative history.
*  So in every case, there's a story going on.
*  So maybe I don't know whether you want to tell us about the first book or tell us about
*  the underlying motivations throughout them.
*  I'm super interested in structure in writing.
*  And I think we are all taught to write very, very badly.
*  I was a philosophy student for philosophers.
*  And this is also another conversation we have to get into.
*  I learned to write so badly and I saw it because of the philosophers.
*  I love philosophers.
*  I'm sure the physicists would have taught you just as badly.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Even worse.
*  Even worse writing passive construction.
*  It was shown by and it is known that whatever it's terrible.
*  But I grew up loving books and loving, loving narrative and loving fiction.
*  Not so much nonfiction.
*  I'm actually not a huge nonfiction reader.
*  So it was so much the power of fiction.
*  Fiction is so rich and it's so complicated and it's so interesting.
*  And so every time I sat down to write a book, I would be lost in terms of structure.
*  Structure was always the hardest thing.
*  What am I doing structurally?
*  It's not what am I trying to say?
*  That was in some sense more accessible.
*  Yeah, I kind of knew what that was.
*  But how to say it was so challenging.
*  And time and time again, I would throw away entire books.
*  The second book, especially, which ended up being a novel, I tried to write as a straightforward,
*  nonfiction expository math proof sort of discussion about what can be known and what can't be known
*  on knowability of certain mathematical facts.
*  This is a book about Turing and Gödel.
*  Yeah, Turing and Gödel.
*  And it just was wrong.
*  And so I threw away an entire book in order to write this other thing, which was a novel,
*  which structurally seemed to be truer, which was to say there are some facts we cannot
*  know simply by listing the data.
*  In mathematics, we would say the transformation rules from the axioms do not always yield
*  a theorem which is verifiable within the context of that, you know, what sort I'm looking for,
*  that theory.
*  That formal system, yeah.
*  That formal system.
*  And so the whole idea of the novel was there are some truths we can only get to by stepping
*  outside, by being fictionalized or by being narrative or by being something different.
*  Right.
*  And once you say that, of course it has to be a novel.
*  Exactly.
*  So it became a novel with an unreliable narrator who doesn't know the truth but is grasping
*  for the truth.
*  And it was such a pleasure to write.
*  It was such a pleasure.
*  Once I was a terrible pain before I realized that.
*  But once I made that decision, it just became this fluid.
*  I just knew what I was doing.
*  Is there something besides the obvious that drew you to Turing and Alan Turing, famous
*  computer scientist and Kurt Gödel, famous mathematician, logician?
*  I mean, they're both fascinating characters.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sorry, this is the one book of yours I haven't read.
*  So I have to confess that right from the start.
*  OK, we're going to go out for drinks and I'll read it to you.
*  Download the audiobook right now.
*  Were they close?
*  No, they never met.
*  They never met.
*  That's right.
*  But they knew each other.
*  They were very influenced by each other.
*  But you wrote a novel about them.
*  So how do they fit together?
*  I think, oh, wow.
*  That's a good question, John, because I think the way people rarely ask me that, because
*  they don't fit together that well, except for cumulatively, their proof is about limitations
*  of what we can know.
*  But I think I was fascinated by the fact that Turing became such a cool-hearted atheist
*  and that Gödel continued to believe in an afterlife where he would be reincarnated and
*  find a more platonic existence in a pure mathematical state.
*  I just think that despite the fact that they started in the same intellectual, mathematical
*  core, that they had these wildly divergent beliefs.
*  And that's actually why I think I paired them.
*  Why don't we just be very straightforward?
*  Because I'm realizing you and I know who these people are, but maybe not everyone does.
*  Who is Alan Turing?
*  Alan Turing became very famous as a very young mathematician for realizing that there were
*  some numbers that were uncomputable, meaning literally, if you tried to mechanize thought,
*  and so here he invented the computer.
*  So this is why Alan Turing is most famous, just point blank for inventing the entire
*  idea of the computer, which at the time was a word for people who calculated things, but
*  we now understand as a machine that's able to do lots of flexible stuff.
*  And they used to be called universal Turing machines after Turing.
*  But Turing's idea was to imagine mechanizing thought and figuring out a way in which theorems
*  work and proofs work.
*  And in that process, he proved that there were numbers that could never be computed
*  in a form shorter than the number itself.
*  So let's say I have a number 0.123579.
*  It goes on and on for infinity.
*  The code to generate that number is exactly as long as the number, no shorter, which is
*  not true of like the number two or three fourths.
*  Well, the number two is true.
*  It's two plus two is five, right?
*  It's Orwell.
*  But the square root of two.
*  Yes, the square root of two is actually an irrational number, but it is computable in
*  a very short code.
*  So the difference between square root of two and these other numbers was that there was
*  no code that could be written, no mechanized system that could be devised that would yield
*  the number any more quickly than just randomly tossing the die of what the next digit should
*  be after the decimal point.
*  So it sounds very abstract, but what it means is that there are facts about numbers, simple
*  numbers, numbers between zero and one about which we will never know anything.
*  Not only that, but there's an infinite number of such numbers.
*  Not only that, but it's the largest infinity of the numbers between zero and one.
*  Most numbers.
*  Most numbers are numbers about which we will never know anything.
*  Okay, so this is a cutting revelation in the time when people are trying to recover from
*  the wars and they're trying to find solace and rationality and they're trying to find
*  some sense.
*  So this belief that everything can be rational and noble and suddenly there's this kick in
*  the teeth.
*  Well, yeah, this is all not only in the aftermath of World War II, but in the early days of
*  the 20th century, we had this optimism about mathematics, Russell and Whitehead, Hilbert
*  had this program.
*  We're going to set out some axioms.
*  We're going to prove every true thing.
*  Totally.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  Total.
*  You know, like Turing is a strange character.
*  He's lovely, but he's very likely autistic, openly gay and persecuted for his homosexuality
*  and also contributed significantly to the war effort turning the tide in favor of the allies.
*  Breaking codes.
*  Breaking codes and yet is convicted of homosexuality and given hormone treatments, which leave
*  him depressed and devastated and suicidal.
*  And so it is largely believed that he takes his own life.
*  He was obsessed with Snow White, which had recently been aired, you know, what's screened
*  and he bit from a poison apple, an apple that he dipped in cyanide.
*  And so some people say things like, which might be apocryphal, but that the Mac symbol
*  of the half-eaten apple, the apple with the bite out of it is a reference to Turing because
*  Turing does invent the computer in this indirect way, because he start what he's really thinking
*  about is mechanizing thought.
*  And then he not only says, sure, I bet I could build a machine that could think as well as
*  we do that machines could think that there's AI.
*  So he's he's really the father of AI.
*  But then he says, we are machines that think.
*  So then he becomes this sort of cool atheist that he gives up all of this other stuff and
*  says we simply are machines.
*  And and I think we've been playing catch up with Turing ever since.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And meanwhile, Austrian, the addition Kurt Gödel, Austria or Germany?
*  Gosh, Austrian.
*  Yeah.
*  Go to home.
*  Go home with any number of famous, brilliant, crazy people.
*  I think I have a little bit of a thing for crazy, brilliant.
*  I do pretty well in New York.
*  Gödel is so fascinating because he predates Turing and he makes the first blow.
*  So Hilbert, as you said, is this brilliant mathematician.
*  He's the most powerful mathematician of the era.
*  And so he makes this turn of the century.
*  And Hilbert calls for a proof that all true facts among the numbers can be proven to be
*  true.
*  He doesn't literally mean he wants a list of an infinite number of proofs.
*  He just wants a proof that it can be done.
*  And everyone expects that this is true.
*  I mean, why wouldn't you expect this is true?
*  So Gödel is the one who deals the first blow before Turing.
*  Turing is very influenced by Gödel's work.
*  Even though they never met.
*  And Gödel shows.
*  Really, it's so lovely the way he does it that there are facts among the numbers that
*  can never be proven to be true.
*  And his is more...
*  True facts.
*  True facts.
*  Well, at least what is the technical statement?
*  Either the formal system is inconsistent.
*  That's true.
*  Or there are true facts that can't be proven.
*  And he rejected inconsistency.
*  So either there's a bold-faced paradox in math, which he rejected.
*  Or there are facts that can't be proven to be true.
*  And that is largely where people side.
*  It would be much worse if one plus one was sometimes two and sometimes three.
*  I wouldn't put it past those mathematicians.
*  They come up with all sorts of crazy ideas.
*  And so Gödel initiated that blow.
*  But he was a strange character.
*  He was very isolated and very withdrawn.
*  And had strange ideas about the afterlife and Platonism.
*  He really believed in math was real in a physical sense.
*  I can never draw a circle.
*  But there's no such thing as a perfect circle in reality.
*  But he believed that the...
*  And maybe he's right.
*  I don't know.
*  That the mental experiment of a perfect circle is sufficient to prove it exists.
*  And I think that's insightful and interesting.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, he was a little crazy, Gödel.
*  But they have this thing in common where there's something that always slips through your fingers
*  the more you tighten your grip, right?
*  And something true about the universe that we can never grasp.
*  Yes.
*  What Gödel did...
*  And actually, oh, Shawn, we should talk about this later.
*  What Gödel did, which was so clever, was he constructed a sentence which basically says,
*  this true statement can never be proven.
*  Right.
*  And then he translated it through a very clever cipher into a purely arithmetic statement
*  that was just like about numbers.
*  Yeah.
*  And proved that that equation was correct and therefore unprovable.
*  Right.
*  If it were provable, it would have to be incorrect because the Satan said it's unprovable.
*  Right.
*  Now, it is possible that you try to construct such a sentence and you cannot mathematize it.
*  Right.
*  And you don't prove anything.
*  Yeah.
*  But he mathematized it perfectly and there it was.
*  And ever since then, every mathematician who's been trying to prove things and getting stuck
*  is always wondering, like, is this one of the things that is not provable?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's rarely true.
*  So I'm sure you get asked this a lot too, which is, oh, don't you think that something
*  we'll never know?
*  And my argument is until somebody proves to me we can never know it and that can happen
*  and we have examples of that in history and Turing and Gödel.
*  Yeah.
*  Then we keep trying.
*  And then so you're, these are fascinating stories, obviously very important, human intellectual
*  history, blah, blah, blah.
*  So at what point did you say the right way to tell the story is via a story, via a novel?
*  I think just because I failed so badly at telling it as nonfiction.
*  It just wasn't working.
*  It wasn't, it wasn't interesting.
*  It didn't, it would have not reached.
*  I just feel like sometimes we experience an element of truth in the solar plexus.
*  Like, we just feel it through the narrative and that that spoke so much more even to the
*  premise of there are things that we can only know by stepping outside and looking in.
*  I mean, that is really ultimately Gödel's lesson is that you know it's true because
*  you step outside of the mathematical system and you reflect on it and you can declare
*  it's true and that there was something about narrative that allowed you to do exactly that.
*  Right.
*  So I basically wanted to structure the narrative on the premise of the theorems, but I thought
*  it would reach people much more than if I forced them to go through the agony of Cantor's
*  diagonalization.
*  Okay.
*  But just between us, that was an extremely elegant and compelling, rational rationale
*  for why we should, but did you have that before you wrote the novel?
*  Or did this come up after you wrote it?
*  No, again, I only had it after I failed at writing the non-fiction book.
*  No, but before you wrote the novel version, did you say like, oh, maybe I need to step
*  out of the system?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  By then, by then, by the time that I had given way, like most of, so I've written three books
*  and almost everyone, I write the wrong book first and I bomb out and then I figure out
*  what the right book is to write.
*  It's your process.
*  It's my process.
*  So I definitely, you know, it was painful.
*  It wasn't feel, it didn't feel good until I abandoned that first approach and then thought,
*  okay, I mean, maybe I'm going to try this.
*  And a lot of it is just worrying.
*  You don't have permission.
*  I mean, we're all sort of like that a little bit.
*  Do I have permission to do this?
*  Am I going to get slammed by my colleagues?
*  Is my editor going to be furious?
*  Is my agent going to kill me?
*  You know, so I have to have one of which is perfectly reasonably implausible.
*  Right.
*  I mean, these things happen.
*  Right.
*  They all basically showed up at my door with torches.
*  But even my last book, the third book was the same way.
*  I kept trying to do the right thing to like do what was expected of me and failing.
*  Right.
*  And then just, you have this terrible moment where you decide, okay, what's worse?
*  A bad book or getting some flack from.
*  And you know, every single time my agent, my editor and my scientist friends have all
*  stepped up.
*  So in reality, it was all in my mind, basically the fear.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, but you had this previous experience.
*  You'd already written one book and that book, How the Universe Got Its Spots, I've said
*  it before and I'll happily say it on tape, was one of my favorite books of all time.
*  I love that.
*  And it's a combination of your personal narrative, right?
*  Which is yet another daring thing to do.
*  You're not supposed to do that as a scientist with an explication of the science of
*  cosmology and the topology of the universe.
*  That book was definitely written because I thought we would never know the answer
*  scientifically.
*  And so, you know, whether or not the universe was infinite or finite.
*  So this was a question we were asking, again, because we could, because it was the math
*  was fun.
*  The math was accessible.
*  It's a big question.
*  It's a great question.
*  Did I honestly, at no point working on it scientifically, did I think it was going to
*  be answered observationally?
*  Because what year are we talking here that you're writing?
*  Oh, man, like 15 years ago, probably like a little after the turn of the early 2000s.
*  And and honestly, it's probably never a question we're going to answer.
*  The universe could be finite.
*  It could be wrapped onto itself, but it's just so big.
*  We'll never see around.
*  And I knew that that was likely.
*  It's not that I was foolish, scientifically thinking we were going to observe it.
*  But the question was fun and it was fun to do.
*  And I think the whole book was about what happens to these ideas if they're not
*  measurable and this anxiety about being disconnected not only from other people,
*  because what I work on and what you work on is so weird and and difficult to grasp,
*  but because it might not even end up in the canon.
*  Right.
*  So basically, could these be wasted years?
*  Because I was fantasizing about something real scientifically, but not necessarily
*  measurable.
*  But this was a special case.
*  It wasn't intrinsically unmeasurable.
*  There were, you know, for certain answers, we could have measured it like the universe
*  had been small and topologically interesting.
*  Right.
*  But if you had put a gun to my head, I would have said it's not that small.
*  Yeah.
*  And you would have been right.
*  I know.
*  I mean, there was no part of me that was pushing it as this is going to be my big mark in life.
*  You know, but it was just the beauty also and the fascination of the talk about narrative,
*  the idea that if light wraps around the universe, I can look far enough away and far
*  enough in the past that I could see myself or the Milky Way or I could see Sean and I
*  studying for physics.
*  And that's how the universe got its spots.
*  Literally.
*  And that is literally how the universe got its spots.
*  Yeah.
*  But so at what point do you then say, I mean, everyone we know has written a book about
*  cosmology, but then you decided to put your personal story in there, right?
*  Like, is that something that came in later?
*  Did you get resistance from your editor and publisher?
*  Yeah.
*  I think that that one actually, I knew that's how I wanted to write it because partly
*  I'm at the time I had no quote unquote right to write a book at that point.
*  We we come from a field where you can write a book when you're coming down from the mountain,
*  you know, with with the tablet, right?
*  Do your thing first.
*  Do your rear.
*  Come back as Professor Emeritus and declare the results.
*  Yeah.
*  And this was much more, hey, we are never going to have this result.
*  And so it was sort of turning it on its head.
*  And I think so I thought a lot about how I don't like that tone of I know things that
*  I am sharing with you my conclusion.
*  And I think that that contributed to my really negative idea about physics when I was a kid.
*  And scientists when I was a kid is that they simply recite facts or no facts or have information.
*  So it was definitely like physics is about not
*  knowing and that's the fun.
*  And that's the experiment.
*  And that's the experience that leads you to be so lost from more normal pleasures of life.
*  And, you know, traveling all the time and separated from your closest and your dearest.
*  And so I think it was much more a clear decision to not write the definitive book of
*  factual information, but to more write about the struggle.
*  The fact that it was in process was a feature, not a bug.
*  Exactly.
*  In progress.
*  Yeah.
*  But okay, but why did you put you into it?
*  Is this why?
*  Because you wanted to reflect the sort of psychological state you were in while doing
*  the research?
*  You know, I think I was disciplining myself not to sound, you know, what's the word,
*  not to sound authoritative.
*  I think by choosing a person to speak to, which in this case, it was letters to my mom,
*  who's somebody I respect, but is not a physicist, that it was a way for me to be respectful
*  to my audience, not authoritative.
*  Exactly.
*  And, and kind of like to experience that humility of the not knowing.
*  And so, so I, I think that's why I chose her as my target audience.
*  And I just thought, why not just declare that that's my target audience?
*  Why pretend otherwise?
*  Why not just say, I'm writing this to her.
*  Make it subtext text.
*  Yes.
*  Just do it.
*  Just be blunt.
*  And I think it really helped me find the voice for a first book, especially where,
*  you know, voices, you struggle to find voice.
*  Yeah.
*  And even when books are written, not by famous scientists, but by, you know, journalists
*  or whoever, they generally wait until the result is in hand.
*  Right.
*  And so there is this idea of a rational reconstruction.
*  We tell the story how it makes sense, not how it happened.
*  And you got to tell the story in all the messiness, right?
*  Because there's so many mistakes you make and blind alleys you go to.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And actually the last book was, was so much about that.
*  So it's really funny because Ray Weiss, who won the Nobel Prize along with Kip Thorne
*  and Barry Barish for the discovery of gravitational waves, kept saying to me when he realized
*  that there was a discovery, he kept saying, so what are you going to do about the book?
*  The book.
*  What are you going to do about the book?
*  You don't want to write it yet.
*  And I was like, oh my God, Ray, I love to write that the book was about not knowing,
*  you know, the tension, the anxiety, the reality of failure, like looming.
*  So the book was about gravitational waves.
*  It was originally about the search for gravitational waves.
*  It was originally about the search for gravitational waves.
*  Turned into a story of the discovery of gravitational waves.
*  Well, only an epilogue.
*  Maybe an epilogue.
*  And again, I mean, there's no way I would have, I could never had I known about the discovery.
*  I mean, I'm not sure I could have maintained that sense of the tension and the, you know,
*  anxiety and all of that stuff.
*  The climbing Mount Everest aspect of that story.
*  I don't know if I could have reproduced if I had known it succeeded.
*  Right.
*  So it was so great to write it not knowing if they were going to succeed,
*  that the failure was real and looming as a real possibility.
*  But again, you threw away tens of thousands of words.
*  Yeah.
*  How was the book different in the first conception?
*  I had a lot more stuff about physics.
*  Like I had a lot more pedagogical kind of stuff and it wasn't,
*  and it was what I was doing is I was chickening out.
*  I was burying these stories because I was really scared to talk about Ray.
*  It never goes away.
*  You know, and I love these guys.
*  They were really important people to me.
*  They're statesmen of the field and Kip, especially, I mean, I became very close
*  with Ray during the writing of the book, but I've known Kip since I was what?
*  19, 18, something like that.
*  And he's always been this wonderful, supportive inspiration.
*  And to write about him made me incredibly uncomfortable.
*  Because there is dirty laundry in the library, right?
*  Like it's not all it's not all great.
*  And I was trying to bury it.
*  I was chickening out basically.
*  And that was a point where my editor, Dan Frank was fantastic because I knew I was doing it.
*  But I wasn't sure if other people would notice.
*  And Dan was like, what is this shit?
*  He's like, stop pulling your punches.
*  That's why you still need editors.
*  Yeah.
*  And in literally 24 hours, I threw away half the book.
*  I mean, it's so easy to disconnect because it just didn't belong there.
*  It was like literally like two disconnected pieces jammed together.
*  And I took one, I threw it away.
*  And there was the book.
*  But it sounds like someday in the future, there's going to be a thousand page,
*  exposition of black holes.
*  Well, and Cantor's diagonalization theorem of infinity.
*  All these pedagogical things you've written and have never seen the light of day.
*  Right. They're in there.
*  I mean, I think especially with Go to Lenturian that there were better versions written.
*  But you know, black holes has started my thing.
*  I got a little jive.
*  For me and black holes, we got something going on.
*  So maybe I'll publish that one.
*  But you know, have to say the most amazing thing about both Kip and Ray is that on the
*  day of the discovery, the day that the instruments about which I was writing and that they designed
*  recorded the first sound of black holes colliding by coincidence, I printed a draft of the book,
*  one for Ray and one for Kip and sent it to them.
*  And what was amazing is that neither of them told me not to say something.
*  So for instance, Kip took issue with certain things.
*  But what he did, being the scientist all the way through to the very bitter end,
*  presented me with all the evidence of the contrary argument.
*  And I included the counter argument.
*  But he never said, take it out, never said, suppress it, never said, he said instead,
*  also the counter argument.
*  It's a true scientist.
*  It's a true scientist.
*  And Ray too.
*  Ray was like, I don't like it, but it's true.
*  I don't like it, but it's true.
*  And he said, it's a shame it's in the public record, but it doesn't have to be in your book.
*  And that quote is in the book.
*  And I'm sure you liked it more.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Having it be that way.
*  But again, so your third book was in yet another mode, right?
*  You had the sort of memoir exposition first, and then you had a historical novel.
*  And in this one, you're almost like the new journalist, right?
*  Like you were going, embedding yourself in the LIGO experiment, talking to people,
*  take, I mean, recording conversations.
*  Yeah, that was honestly, for the first six months, I didn't think to record because I'm not a journalist.
*  Dummy.
*  And then I was like, oh, Jesus, I got to start recording this stuff because I was
*  transcribing so frantically afterwards, trying to remember exactly what was said.
*  I did learn, okay, I got to start to record.
*  So yes, now I record my conversations.
*  Yeah. So what did you learn by that experience?
*  What was it like to be a journalist?
*  You know, it was really, I quite enjoyed it.
*  I think it's like, I have a lot of respect for experiments.
*  And I am notoriously not allowed anywhere near a lab.
*  I mean, I burn water.
*  I burn boiling water frequently.
*  So, so there's a sense in which like I had a crush on the experiment
*  and it was just this total homage.
*  It was this, it was this respect.
*  And, and so the journalism was really pleasurable because it was just observing.
*  And I just remember these funny observations, just watching so many of the experimentalists,
*  it's a thousand person team and not all of them are on the ground, obviously,
*  but there's no sense of strict hierarchy.
*  It's as though everybody knew what to do.
*  And they, you know, and they would move kind of like, I said slowly, like not space station
*  slowly, but this sort of sense of it's just there's and hundreds of people all knowing
*  what to do.
*  I mean, it just, it's kind of mind blowing.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And that it's real.
*  They built something real based on things that we do on paper.
*  And that connect and just has my total admiration.
*  It'll never stop surprising me.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  My total admiration.
*  And I think that one of the reasons why I got along with the experimentalists so well
*  is because that was so obvious on my face.
*  Yeah.
*  It was just, I was just there.
*  Such a fangirl.
*  I know.
*  I was like such a fangirl.
*  But yeah, I mean, they did it.
*  And your journalism wasn't just, you know, talking head interviews.
*  You were there at the different places you visited.
*  Yeah.
*  Field work, et cetera.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I really think I was trying to write that book like a novel.
*  That was, that was the target.
*  The target was Ray as a character.
*  Ray has lines.
*  Ray says stuff and it's Ray's dialogue and that it could be fiction for as long as I
*  could maintain it.
*  It could literally have opened and read as though Ray was a fictitious character with
*  lines.
*  And that came from Ray, that idea, because his speech is so spectacular.
*  The rhythm of it, the cadence, the swearing.
*  I groomed a lot of the swearing out, which I, you know.
*  The director's cut will come later.
*  Yeah, the director's cut.
*  And it just was, who am I?
*  It was almost sub journalism.
*  I mean, I don't know who am I to tell this story.
*  Right.
*  Ray tells a story.
*  Kip tells a story.
*  Barry tells a story.
*  Even Robbie Vogt, who had a very dark relationship with Lego at the end, tells his story and
*  I don't interpret.
*  I don't sit there and try to say what the truth is.
*  Yeah.
*  And I simply convey as best that I can what they say.
*  So it really should be like a novel.
*  Where there's not a narrator who declares to you what the truth is and what's real.
*  But you get caught up in the characters and you decide for yourself.
*  When you write a book like that, I mean, there's two sides, obviously, right?
*  There's your, you have some standards.
*  You want to write a good book, you have a vision.
*  But then there's an audience that reads it, right?
*  So we get a feeling from what you're saying about how there's certain circumstances under
*  which it's just the right thing to do, you know, to tell things in this narrative way
*  rather than a straightforward.
*  Pedagogical way.
*  How does the audience receive it?
*  Are they outraged that you're not just giving them the, you know, simple drawing of a
*  interferometer?
*  Yes, actually.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's a good point.
*  It's really funny.
*  The biggest complaint I've ever gotten about this book is that it didn't have figures.
*  And it was a really clear decision with Dan, my editor, and I, we talked about it.
*  If it's really a novel in that spirit, you don't put pictures in.
*  And so can it be conjured up solely with the words?
*  And I think that because people anticipated a nonfiction book, they demanded figures.
*  It was literally the only complaint I've consistently gotten.
*  And, you know, and I think we made the right call, but I get that it was uncomfortable.
*  And it's mostly because of expectations, right?
*  It's not that it didn't work.
*  It's just that I wanted or expected something else.
*  These books have figures.
*  Right.
*  Why doesn't your book have figures?
*  Yeah.
*  And so, and I would say that some, mostly I feel people really got it.
*  I mean, the figures aside, I get that it's hard to visualize.
*  So I appreciate that.
*  There are novels that can put figures in because they're doing the opposite.
*  They're playing with that.
*  You know, like Dave Eggers plays against type and puts figures in his books.
*  I get it.
*  Totally.
*  So this was a call.
*  But, but, but that, but most people I feel really got it.
*  They got that it was a climbing Mount Everest story.
*  They got that it was sort of a tragic comedy in some sense.
*  Occasionally would be totally misunderstood.
*  Like somebody would be like, oh, if only you had known they succeeded,
*  you would have written a book about it.
*  It's like, oh my God, that's so bad.
*  You did not like that.
*  You didn't get it.
*  And that happens.
*  That's okay.
*  And we shouldn't pass by this without, you know, expressing our mutual admiration
*  for the exquisiteness that is the LIGO experiment.
*  It is.
*  The fact they did this.
*  I remember, you know, inviting people to give talks just 10 years ago
*  and they would give talks on here's LIGO.
*  Here's the update.
*  Here's what we want to do.
*  And the audience members who are, you know, physics faculty professors
*  really shake their heads that you'll never do that.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  They literally thought they, the proverbial they, we want, you know,
*  we want to implicate people because it was fair.
*  It was actually fair to be critical of it.
*  Not just a few, you know.
*  These were people.
*  It was a lot of people.
*  Really smart, really insightful, really thoughtful people had every reason
*  to believe it would fail.
*  And that's not the interesting story.
*  I don't know what is.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So, but they did measure the vibration of a, what is it?
*  The mirrors at 40 kilograms.
*  Jesus, I should not have to read my own book.
*  She's spoke.
*  I can recommend it.
*  It's what happens by less than one 10,000th width of a proton over four kilometers.
*  And what a stunning technological.
*  They've done it several times now.
*  If it had failed, it would have failed because nature didn't provide.
*  And like we've already established, nature doesn't love us back.
*  Nature isn't trying to make us feel good.
*  This is one of the rare cases where we sort of got lucky, right?
*  Like, I mean, we were certainly very hopeful to find something,
*  but the things that LIGO found were a little bit
*  bigger and more spectacular than we'd expected.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I love that.
*  I love that out of the gate black holes.
*  And the reason why I called the book black hole blows
*  was because Ray said to me in August, right before the discovery,
*  obviously neither was new.
*  If we don't detect black holes, this thing is a failure.
*  And that is also Ray at his most honest, because he could have been a politician and said,
*  well, as long as we succeeded technologically and as long as we detect
*  neutron stars or whatever, you know, but he didn't.
*  He was so honest to the end.
*  If we do not detect black holes, this thing is a failure.
*  So I was like, oh, black hole blues.
*  So for those of us who haven't read the book yet, I did read the book.
*  For those of you out there in podcast land, how many years of his career was Ray Weiss
*  working on LIGO?
*  Probably 50.
*  I would say 50.
*  So he was a young man at MIT who also succeeded on other fronts,
*  but mostly because they told him you're not going to get tenure working on this crap.
*  And they literally, he was building an instrument that was like a meter and a half.
*  Got to start somewhere.
*  And this ramshackle structure on a table, the instruments now four kilometers long.
*  So he realized and a billion dollars that a meter and a half wasn't going to cut it.
*  But at the time he was working on this little demo prototype,
*  his colleagues were saying things like, I could do better looking out the window.
*  They were like, if the sun blew up, you wouldn't even hear it with this instrument.
*  He was like, it's true.
*  The sun blew up, I wouldn't hear it with this instrument.
*  He's like, I can do better looking out the window.
*  Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
*  So that's discouraging.
*  And what you've got to love about Ray is that he said, OK, I'm going to spend three years
*  doing an industry study to determine if it's feasible, how big, how expensive,
*  what the technological cost and requirements will be to make this instrument.
*  So this is 50 years of his life.
*  50 years of his life.
*  And you have to remember, and a lot of people think the instrument turned on
*  and was immediately successful.
*  In the year 2000, it was running while those black holes that were detected in 2015
*  were colliding, they were orbiting each other.
*  And it was still too quiet for that very sophisticated instrument between 2000
*  and 2015 to detect anything.
*  Silence.
*  And the gravitational waves were there and they were washing over the Earth
*  and they could not be measured.
*  And so to be able to move to phase two, the advanced machine, and turn it on,
*  and to say two weeks before the detection, this could fail.
*  And my understanding is that from the talks I heard, some people say that they heard
*  different things, but I heard talks saying that that is exactly what they expected.
*  I heard talks saying, in other words, when we turn on LIGO, we probably won't see
*  anything, but when we turn on advanced LIGO, we probably will.
*  That's true.
*  So kudos to the National Science Foundation and the government for saying,
*  we're going to give you a billion dollars to build something that won't see anything.
*  Right?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  First generation machine, Kip, and Ray, and Barry were all really clear that they
*  weren't guaranteeing a detection.
*  Maybe if they were extremely lucky, but they absolutely were saying, we fully
*  anticipate having to go to a second generation to advanced LIGO before we'll
*  make a detection.
*  So it's possible that you have written more narratively oriented science physics
*  books than any other person?
*  I don't know.
*  That's probably people out there who do it.
*  Does it include people who don't publish?
*  Yeah, well, there is that.
*  I get a lot of letters.
*  I think we should start a Facebook page for all the people who write us letters.
*  Just to point them in that direction.
*  Yes.
*  You know the classic story, right?
*  I heard it attributed to John Wheeler where he would get letters from different crackpots
*  and then he would put them in contact with each other.
*  Oh my god, brilliant.
*  And he'd say, oh, you should talk to this guy.
*  But both of them would come back and say, why did you point me to him?
*  He's a crackpot.
*  Crackpotteness is not transitive, right?
*  They think that everyone else is also a crackpot, except them.
*  Priceless.
*  Doesn't work.
*  Anyway, so did we learn something about the efficacy of this kind of way of talking about
*  science?
*  Is there something we get at?
*  I mean, science is done by human beings.
*  It's true, but it's a cliche, but true.
*  And you could have written books about street builders or something like that, right?
*  Sorry, I want you to finish your thought.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  It's an interesting question.
*  Do we learn something specific about the way science is done that is different and interesting?
*  By telling the stories as stories per se?
*  I mean, to my mind, yes.
*  And I think that I love the abstraction of science.
*  I love it.
*  It's what moved me when I was frustrated that people were still trying to figure out what
*  Emmanuel Kant meant.
*  It drove me insane because it can't be locked in one human's mind.
*  It has to be shareable.
*  And there was something about math and physics that is transcendent.
*  It belongs to all of us.
*  Nobody is saying, what did Einstein mean?
*  Nobody learns relativity by reading Einstein's papers, right?
*  Right.
*  You'd learn it because we all own it.
*  As soon as he gave it to us, it's a gift.
*  It's ours.
*  It's 100% ours.
*  We can use it like a hammer, right?
*  And there is something about that that just broke my heart when I discovered that.
*  When I realized what physics really was, when I got away from this negative, foolish
*  stereotype of reciting facts, when I realized, oh my God, this is a tool that's been given
*  to me and it belongs to everybody.
*  And I think that there is something about that that speaks to our humanity.
*  We inherited these concepts, these abilities because we're evolutionarily involved under
*  forces dictated by physics.
*  You know, it's in our minds.
*  It's such a wonderful thing.
*  And so I think that to dispel the sense of this is solely about facts and to realize
*  that this is very much about humanity and something shared and something, you know,
*  that could unite us.
*  I mean, there was this moment when they announced the discovery of the gravitational wave detection.
*  And I know it was hard to understand and that people weren't really sure what it was.
*  But honestly, I'm sure you had a similar experience.
*  It was like the whole world paused.
*  I was doing interviews remotely with Qatar, Qatar.
*  I apologize.
*  My pronunciation.
*  It's dangerously on Qatar.
*  That's amazing.
*  It was like this moment where we all realized for a second we're under the same sky.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I wrote a book about the Higgs boson, which is the other.
*  Exactly.
*  Discovery of that magnitude we've had in the last 10 years.
*  Exactly.
*  It's an international team of people working together and exquisite harmony.
*  I think people should think about the Nobel Peace Prize for these experiments because
*  they really are internationally transcendent, culturally, racially,
*  religiously transcendent experiments that involve the whole world working together
*  on some completely benign yet fascinating.
*  I mean, what could be more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize and something like that?
*  I had this quote.
*  I actually sadly forget who it was from, but in my book, if the United Nations worked as
*  well as Atlas and CDF collaborations at CERN, we would have world peace.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Then the irony during my interview with Al Jazeera TV was that they were about to ask me and
*  they prepped me.
*  They were like, we're going to ask you a question about what this means for humanity.
*  So I was about to say something rousing about how we're all under the same sky.
*  And then they're like, I'm sorry, we have to take a break for the war in Iraq.
*  And I was like, oh, damn it.
*  The skies will still be there tomorrow, but the present does intrude itself sometimes.
*  I forgot to say, this is just coming back to something earlier, but this idea of being
*  a journalist and going there and doing interviews, because you said you enjoyed it.
*  I didn't when I wrote the Higgs boson book.
*  Yes, you were very journalistic in that book, too.
*  I was and I didn't like it.
*  You didn't like it.
*  I married to one of the world's great science journalists, so I know how it's done well.
*  Jennifer, we love you.
*  And it's not me.
*  So I said, interviewing is not for me.
*  And I say this as I'm interviewing you for the podcast.
*  Yes.
*  What happened?
*  What went terribly wrong?
*  Because we're chatting.
*  Well, no, the difference was then I wrote the big picture.
*  And again, I interviewed people, but I wasn't looking for anecdotes and stories.
*  I was trying to figure out what they were thinking.
*  So I talked to philosophers and biologists and whatever.
*  And that I loved.
*  So you're much better than I am at caring about the human stories.
*  I remember you specifically telling me I'm never going to be the one to describe the beard on his
*  face. And I have one line about Robbie Vo, which is one of my favorite lines on the book, if I'm
*  allowed to say that about my own book. I don't know if that sounds bad, but about how he looked
*  at me through wilted orchids because his eyes, he had this. It was literally like wilted orchids.
*  You know, I do like that.
*  Yeah, no, exactly. You have to do what you're good at.
*  I recognize my inability.
*  I remember we had this conversation. It's so fascinating.
*  And maybe the other aspect of journalism I wouldn't enjoy as much, which is really how
*  journalism is written for papers.
*  It's more Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson.
*  Yes, exactly. I'm long form. Lord knows I'm not glad about it.
*  It would be so fun to be short form and whip stuff out, but I can't do it.
*  Even some of my writer friends, I amazed them by saying I enjoy writing books.
*  Yes.
*  Give me 100,000 words ahead of me. I'm at my happiest.
*  Yeah. I mean, because it takes me a while to do the whole structure and think about
*  what the different architecture of a new book is going to be. And I'm always lost in it.
*  And it takes me that long to do it. That's how long it takes me.
*  But I want to give you a chance before we go to plug your big ongoing, I don't want to call it
*  a new project, but you're here in New York and you have this amazing public event series that
*  you're doing out there in Brooklyn, out there in the suburbs.
*  I love it.
*  Tell us what it is.
*  Where we are now, we're up at Columbia and Barnard, and I call this Upstate Manhattan.
*  Here we are, Jenna and Ana.
*  In the parks. And a sweet hour away, which we can take a ferry to from Wall Street is
*  Pioneer Works, which is a cultural center in Red Hook. Red Hook is slightly inaccessible because
*  the ground cannot support a subway system.
*  So you have to get there by boat or foot or bus. But it is also a kind of pristine part of
*  New York City because of it. And my dear, dear, dear friend Dustin Yellen started Pioneer Works
*  there. He bought this old ironworks factory from, you know, 1850s and renovated it to become a
*  cultural center. And the founding artistic director is Gabriel Florence, who's just been
*  incredibly visionary and aggressive and interesting and unafraid. And so it started mostly as an art
*  center. And Pioneer Works. And we brought science in there. Now we have a science, very strong
*  science presence. In some sense, our science events are the biggest events we do. We do not
*  fully understand our audience, but they come out for it. And you've been to one of my, you were in
*  one of my events, which was such a pleasure.
*  People love it. People love science presented in an accessible way. And you're doing it in a
*  particular way, but it's certainly very accessible.
*  Yeah, I think what we're doing, which I'm trying to understand retroactively, is that people feel
*  like the scientists are coming to their house. Okay, so it's free, open to the public, and it's
*  very much in this cultural community center. And it's a very, very, very, very, very, very
*  community center that's open and welcome. And people hang out in the garden and they stay late
*  and they talk. And there's booze. And there's booze and there's food. And there's, you know, we do
*  pop-up exhibits. A friend of mine was like, I was in the longest beer line and I got to the front.
*  And it was a genetics experiment.
*  Bonus.
*  Yeah, exactly. So, some things make people feel like it's theirs.
*  To be fair, instead of beer, not where the beer was coming from.
*  Yes, right. We didn't give them genetically modified beer. They were in the wrong line.
*  So, I think that, right, people want it to feel like it's theirs. And so we talk at a really high
*  level. We do not, and as you know from our event, I don't prep people in part because I don't want
*  them to have lectures and I don't want them to...
*  Yes, no PowerPoint or anything like that.
*  No PowerPoint, nothing like that. And sometimes we have to stop. You know, Frank Wilczek won the
*  Nobel Prize. He's a good friend of both of ours who came from MIT to give a talk. He said something
*  like, well, as you all know, the Hicksville breaks the electric wick symmetry. And I was like, Frank!
*  Can't do that.
*  No, but it's okay. So we stop and we translate. But we let Frank talk as Frank talks.
*  But it's a great, I never heard that idea that part of the charm is the scientist coming to our
*  house. Right? I mean, it's another twist on the idea of telling the human side, telling the stories,
*  bringing people into our house. And I think that, you know, actually, and this podcast is also in
*  the service of the same ideal that there shouldn't be a dividing line between science and other parts
*  of human intellectual life, whether it's philosophy or economics or whatever. And so this is definitely
*  contributing to that.
*  Oh, thank you for saying that because that's probably the most important philosophy behind
*  Pioneer Works. We don't come out of the womb as scientists or artists. We come out as both
*  and all things. You know, every child palpates the world. Every child puts things in their mouth and
*  tries to figure out what it is. And every child develops their own sense of time and space.
*  There's a forward and a backward. I mean, this is a fascinating revelations that children aren't taught,
*  but they discover and every child is an artist. And I don't want to bring scientists to go be
*  artists professionally. I'm not into that. And I don't bring artists to come be, you know, I don't,
*  I actually don't like the sire mix. But what I do love is just human beings rubbing elbows and
*  feeling that they live in a bigger world and feeling less isolated.
*  Can't think of a better place to end. Thanks so much for being on the podcast.
*  Thanks, Sean. Fun as always.
