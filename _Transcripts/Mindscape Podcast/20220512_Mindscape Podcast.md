Welcome to the May 2022 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | May 2022
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1PDIK6b4LE)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the May 2022 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Things have been a little hectic around here at Mindscape World
*  International headquarters. Writing some science papers, giving some talks, preparing to move from
*  Los Angeles to Baltimore, which is a big deal. And of course, working on the copy editing and
*  proofreading for the book, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe, volume one, Space Time in Motion,
*  that's supposed to be out in September. A lot of copy editing, a lot of making sure the figures
*  look right and stuff like that. But anyway, it's all refreshingly normal kind of stuff,
*  so I'm not going to dwell on it, tell any stories, anything like that. Let's just remind everyone
*  that the AMAs, the Ask Me Anything episodes, are brought to you by supporters on Patreon.
*  You can become such a supporter yourself by going to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll. Patreon
*  supporters pay for nice things like the transcripts for all the episodes and they help with the sound
*  quality a little bit in some ways. And by being a Patreon supporter, you get ad free versions of
*  every podcast, plus the ability to ask questions at these AMAs, as well as the usual warm,
*  fuzzy feeling for doing a nice thing and being part of something bigger than ourselves. That's it. Let's go.
*  Dave Legudice says,
*  Do you think our current electromagnetic sensing abilities rule out local alien visitors?
*  I'm surprised at the near zero credence given to the possibility that aliens are in our solar system
*  in Fermi Paradox discussions. Well no, I mean as you ask the question, the answer is no. I do not
*  think our current sensing abilities rule out local alien visitors. It would be completely trivial
*  for aliens with very, very high technological abilities to be in the solar system without giving
*  off a signal that we could notice. All they have to do is hide on the far side of the moon and then
*  it would be very difficult to notice them. But certainly if they hit out on Pluto, it would be
*  even easier. But I also don't really think that's the issue. And this is the kind of
*  backwards pseudo-Basianism that gets you in trouble when we think about things like aliens.
*  The question being asked is, can you think of a way, can we cook up a scenario in which there are
*  aliens there but we haven't noticed them? Sure, that's easy to do. It's not that difficult to
*  imagine. But it's also not the question we should be asking. The question we should be asking is,
*  in the two different hypotheses, one of which there are aliens here in the solar system and the
*  other which there aren't, what do you expect? What are the predictions, the expectations,
*  the likelihoods in the technical Basian jargon under each one of those hypotheses? And then we
*  compare that to the data. And the point is if there's no aliens in the solar system, we
*  expect exactly what we see, namely no evidence for aliens. If there are aliens out there,
*  why would they be hiding? Under the vast majority of versions of aliens in the solar system,
*  I could think of, they would be easy to find. And therefore, the fact that we don't have any
*  evidence for them is strong evidence against their existing. It's never 100%. So maybe they're out
*  there. But given that it would be very, very easy to notice them under the vast majority of
*  circumstances that we can imagine, the absence of such evidence is strong reason to decrease
*  whatever prior you have. If your prior that there are aliens in the solar system is .99999,
*  it won't matter. You'll still think that. But that's the slippery problem of being a principal
*  Basian when you try to pick your priors in a good way. Eager Parshkin says, Can you convince me to
*  vote? I've never voted in my life because I know that I don't know enough about what's going on
*  behind the curtains to make an informed decision. Anyone who just reads the news gets biased opinions
*  that do not reflect everything that's going on. Also, if say I lean left and you sit me down with
*  a smart politician from the right and I'm open minded enough, I'm 100% sure they can change
*  my opinion. So how can I vote based on my values when I know that there are definitely things I'm
*  overlooking and things I can't possibly know because they're happening on the inside? So this
*  is an interesting question because the usual question, can you convince me to vote is more
*  about the unlikely hood that any one vote would matter. We talked about this with Herb Gintis,
*  right? When you talk about elections with enough people voting, the probability that any one person's
*  vote is going to be the deciding factor is so incredibly tiny that it might as well not matter
*  at all. But Eager's question is a little bit different. He's saying, I just don't know enough
*  to vote, right? And therefore, maybe I shouldn't. And honestly, I'm not going to try to convince you
*  to vote. I think it's okay if you don't vote. We talked to Andrew Lee, who is a working politician
*  in Australia where they have mandatory voting, and he thinks it's a good system. And he thinks
*  that because people are supposed to vote in that country, they actually pay closer attention to the
*  media. But if you don't, I'm of the opinion that if you don't want to vote, that's okay. I do wish
*  that more people would vote. So I think it's a legitimate question. Can I convince you to do it?
*  And but I don't know really what to say to the question, except I don't buy the argument. I don't
*  buy the argument that you can't get good information in the news media at all. You can get bad information
*  from the news media. That's perfectly true. But also there's good information out there. And I
*  think it's a little bit of an abdication of abdication of responsibility to just shrug your
*  shoulders and say, well, who knows what's going on? I think we have to develop our skill set of
*  being able to distinguish between good information and bad information. If you're 100% sure that
*  talking to someone on the other side can change your opinion, that's, you know, in some sense,
*  good for you. But in another sense, it means that you need to do that talking to both sides and
*  figure out which side you agree with more. I hope it's not the case that if you talk to two people
*  on different sides, alternating 100 times in a row that you would change your mind 100 times.
*  That would be well, at least it would be very strange. I don't think most people are like that.
*  I think that most of us have values, we get information, and not only are there factual
*  matters about what a certain policy is, etc. But there's also value alignment, right? There's the
*  idea that certain political figures are just talking the talk that resonates with how you
*  want things to be. The reason why we vote for people rather than do direct democracy and vote
*  on every single bill or issue coming up is because we aren't supposed to be experts. We're
*  supposed to vote for people who, I mean, ideally they would be experts, but in the real world,
*  things are so complicated that they hire staff members who are experts themselves.
*  But the point is you vote for people who will represent your values, who if they care about
*  the environment, if you care about the environment, you can vote for someone who clearly cares about
*  the environment. If you care about gun rights, you can vote for someone who cares about gun
*  rights and all those different ways of going down the line. Of course, there will be misinformation
*  and people will lie about things, but you know they have a record for voting, right? You can see
*  what they actually vote for and against if you're really interested. If you don't care, that's one
*  thing, okay? But if you're interested but you don't think that you have enough information,
*  I'm just skeptical that that's true because I think there's a lot of information out there,
*  a lot of it is pretty objective, right? You can choose to get information from biased sources,
*  but a lot of information is actually pretty reliable. Like where someone voted on some bill,
*  just look up in the congressional record or whatever, I think that's pretty reliable.
*  There's a lot of news sources out there who are perfectly reliable, no one's perfectly reliable,
*  but quite reliable and who are nevertheless denigrated by one side or the other because
*  they don't like what they're saying, but that's something we have to learn to get beyond.
*  I don't have any specific either advice or arguments to convince you, but I will put forward
*  the opinion that we all have values and we all have a responsibility to figure out what we think
*  is true about the world and that's the stuff on the basis of which we vote. It's not an easy thing
*  by any means, but that's what I think that we're supposed to try to do. Kevin O'Toole says,
*  I really enjoyed your book from eternity to here. One question though still bothering me.
*  In the first two chapters you describe time asymmetry from two different perspectives.
*  There's a physics-based asymmetry where entropy was low in the past and will be high in the future.
*  There's also a cause and effect asymmetry where from the perspectives of people and other agents
*  of change and agents action cannot change the past but can change the future. It seemed like
*  the point there was to say that one asymmetry implied the other, but unfortunately I just don't
*  see any good reason why the two asymmetries should be related at all. Is there some fundamental
*  contradiction either intuitive or in the math in imagining a time reversed agent who remembers
*  the high entropy future and whose actions change the high entropy past? Yes, there is a fundamental
*  contradiction in that and it's kind of too long of a story to tell you right here in the AMA.
*  I will point to the fact that I just gave a talk on this at Berkeley which is going to be mentioned
*  in the very next question but in a different context. So the title of the talk was The Arrow
*  of Time in Causal Networks. It's on YouTube. You can find it where I talk about exactly this. I talk
*  about the connection between the increase of entropy and the causal arrow, the fact that causes
*  precede effects. Now there's a footnote. There's many footnotes there. Different people have
*  different ideas about what you mean by cause and effect so you can have a certain construal of the
*  idea of a cause by which causes and effects are simultaneous etc etc etc. So forget about all of
*  those details. I mean the usual thing. I mean that if I swing my arm and knock over a glass of wine,
*  I say the glass fell down because I swung my arm. I do not say I swung my arm because the glass was
*  going to fall. That's explicable because entropy has been increasing. The entropic arrow of time,
*  the fact that entropy was low in the past and is increasing toward the future, that in my view is
*  the single fact underlying all of the asymmetries between past and future in our macroscopic
*  universe. So what is the connection? You know very very briefly, if you didn't have entropy at all,
*  if you were Laplace's demon, you know exactly the microstate of the universe, right,
*  then there's no such thing as cause and effect and there's no such thing as an arrow of time.
*  There's just the state of the universe at every moment and it exactly implies the state of the
*  previous moment and the next moment in a deterministic universe. We can also argue
*  about determinism but that's again another kettle of fish to talk about. But in the deterministic
*  assumption like the Schrodinger equation or Newton's laws of motion, every moment has all
*  the information that implies all the previous moments and all the next moments. So just by
*  construction, the existence of something like an arrow of time and including causes preceding
*  effects must come about because somehow you coarse grain, right, because you're not Laplace's demon.
*  If you know the exact microstate of the world, then you predict both the future and the past
*  with perfect fidelity and it doesn't make sense to talk about causes and effects.
*  The information contained in the universe at every moment of time fixes every other moment in this
*  deterministic model. So you can't pinpoint whether something is a cause happening first or in effect
*  happening after, okay. But we don't have that information. We are not Laplace's demon. We have
*  very incomplete information about the universe. We coarse grain. We look at the universe and we
*  notice some observationally accessible features of it and there's other microscopic features that
*  we do not notice. And so what I argued in my talk in Berkeley is that you can actually use this fact
*  in the context of what are called causal networks. This is a way of thinking about cause and effect
*  relationships that is very, very popular in both computer science, artificial intelligence right
*  now, but also all over the social sciences. A way of stringing together different facts about the
*  universe, which they will call random variables because they're facts with certain probabilities
*  attached to them. Drawing lines between them and making a little network and then saying, okay,
*  where are the causes and where are the effects? And there's certain features of where you can
*  draw those arrows connecting the different random variables, the different features of the universe,
*  like I'm swinging my arm, the glass is falling down. So that means there's a certain probability
*  that I swing my arm, a certain probability the glass falls down, and a mutual relationship
*  between them, right, conditional probabilities and so forth. And all of that can be used to talk
*  about causes and effects if you also add in some counterfactual information. If I consider what
*  happens if I hadn't swung my arm, would the glass have still fallen down, right? That's where you
*  can get a true handle on causality. And so the thing is that you can do that going forward in
*  time. You can draw arrows from past features of the universe to future features of the universe,
*  purely based on the macroscopically available information. That's what we do all the time.
*  We predict the future probabilistically, not deterministically, because we don't have all the
*  information, but we predict what's going to happen in the future on the basis of the present state
*  of the universe. This is a feature of physics is that you don't need to also know the past.
*  You might need to know certain relics of the past that are embedded in the current moment,
*  but the point is you only need to know the current moment. This is called the Markovian
*  property in computer science and statistics and elsewhere in random processes. Generally,
*  Markovianness is the fact that you can predict what happens next just on the basis of the current
*  moment. And so you can make a causal diagram going from events to other events forward in time,
*  that is to say from the Big Bang to today and toward the future. But the point is you can't
*  do it backwards. You cannot make a causal diagram with the arrows pointing in the other way.
*  And the reason is because when you go backward in time, the current state of the universe is not
*  enough to predict the past state of the universe. You also need to assume a low entropy past. That's
*  what's called the past hypothesis. Otherwise, if that were not true, then the kinds of reconstructions
*  we do of the past and the future would be the same, right? You'd have the same access to things
*  about the future and things about the past from the present. But we don't. We have things like
*  memories and records and fossils and photographs, right? We have information about the past. Why?
*  Because there's an extra thing going on, namely that the universe started with a low entropy past.
*  That gives us extra information about the past that we don't have about the future. But we need
*  to assume that low entropy past to really make that information be reliable. So therefore,
*  the evolution from today to yesterday is not Markovian. It's not you know today and therefore
*  you can retrodict yesterday. It's that you know today and you know the Big Bang. You know the very,
*  very low entropy past. Those two facts are enough to reconstruct what it is possible to reconstruct
*  about the past. Okay. So anyway, the very short answer here, which I'm not necessarily sure is
*  going to make sense if you're not already familiar with this jargon, but I'm trying to give you the
*  very short version of the argument. You can make a causal diagram with arrows moving toward the
*  future if entropy is increasing, but you cannot do it with the arrows going to the past if entropy
*  was lower in the past because there's an extra fact that you need. And now you can argue whether
*  or not the notion of causality in these causal networks is the right one. The notion basically
*  is that if I were able to keep everything else in the universe fixed but change one fact, change
*  whether I swing my arm, does that have effects downstream? So the glass is being knocked over,
*  the glass is not being knocked over. The classic example is you notice a correlation in the data
*  that if people are outside and it's sunny, they do not have umbrellas up. If people are outside and
*  it's raining, they do have umbrellas up. So in the data, you don't know whether rain causes
*  umbrellas to go up or putting umbrellas up causes rain, right? There's just a correlation between
*  them. So you need this information that is not in the data, this counterfactual information.
*  If you could imagine putting a person there raising their umbrella, would it start raining?
*  No. If you imagine it raining and there's someone who didn't have their umbrella up, would they raise
*  their umbrella? Yes. So that's the direction in which the causality goes. And that's a story
*  you can tell forward in time because entropy is increasing. It's not a story you can tell backward
*  in time. Related question comes from Liam McCarty who says, in your recent lecture at Berkeley,
*  The Arrow of Time and Causal Networks, and then he gives the YouTube address if you want to check
*  it out in the comments, you mentioned that the smoothness of the cosmic microwave background is
*  dependent on the past hypothesis. That is, without stipulating that the early universe was low
*  entropy, we couldn't say that the cosmic microwave background is smooth. This is a fascinating point
*  I hadn't heard before, but I'm still struggling to understand exactly what you meant. Can you
*  discuss this here? Yeah, this is a very, very important point because it's part of recognizing
*  that how we reason about the world, physics and other things, always sort of assumes the past
*  hypothesis even before we knew what it was or knew there was such a thing as entropy. We assume
*  the arrow of time, I think is probably a better way of saying it. So we put a telescope like WMAP
*  or PLONK out there in the sky, or we do observations here on the ground or in balloons, etc. We map the
*  cosmic microwave background. We find that this leftover radiation from the Big Bang is pretty
*  smooth. It looks more or less the same in different directions, but not exactly. There are small
*  fluctuations, one part in 10 to the 5. And we say, look, therefore, the early universe, the moment
*  from which this radiation was emitted, which is only like 300,000 years after the Big Bang,
*  the physical world was smooth. That's why the radiation that we're seeing now looks smooth,
*  because the actual primordial plasma was smooth, more or less the same density and temperature
*  at different places throughout the universe. But that's not what we see. We don't see the
*  primordial plasma. What we see is photons, microwave photons, landing in our telescope here on Earth.
*  We see the radiation field locally, right next to our telescope. That's what we actually see.
*  We use our brains to reconstruct what the early universe must have looked like based on that
*  radiation field impacting our telescope here and now. But of course, when we do that, we're assuming
*  that entropy has been increasing along the way. So think about it, the photons that come to us from
*  the microwave background, their wavelengths depend on many different things. Their wavelengths depend
*  on what the temperature was at the cosmic microwave background, but it also depends on the velocity
*  of the fluid. There's a Doppler effect going back and forth, and it also depends on the
*  gravitational field that is going around, because there's a gravitational redshift that can
*  redshift or blueshift, depending on how the gravitational field goes, it can change the
*  frequency of that photon. So if you just ask the question, given the photons that we see here in
*  our telescope, but we make no assumption about the low entropy of the Big Bang, we allow it to be
*  super duper high entropy. And you say in all the different ways that we could have gotten that
*  image that we get in our telescopes, what does a typical reconstruction of the early universe look
*  like? And the answer is it is wildly inhomogeneous. There's very different densities and temperatures
*  and velocities and gravitational fields from place to place. But they have all conspired exactly to
*  cancel out so that we see a very smooth radiation field in our telescope today. And if you ask
*  yourself, well, if you think to yourself, that seems very unlikely, why in the world would there
*  be some massive conspiracy where all these very different effects exactly cancel out or almost
*  exactly cancel out to give us an isotropic, smooth cosmic microwave background? Well, there's no good
*  reason for them to do that. But that's not the question we asked. We asked the question conditionalized
*  on the fact that we have a smooth image in our telescope, and no other fact. What is the likelihood
*  that the early universe looked one way or another? So without the past hypothesis, the early universe
*  is overwhelmingly likely to be very, very, very high entropy, right? Because you didn't make it be
*  low entropy, and there's more ways to be high entropy than low entropy. It is unlikely, given
*  that high entropy state, that we would see a smooth CMB today, but it's less unlikely than that
*  there really was a low entropy state in the early universe just by accident. So if you don't have
*  the past hypothesis, you have to imagine that with overwhelming likelihood, the smoothness of the CMB
*  is just a conspiracy. It's just an accident. It is a downward fluctuation in entropy, because without
*  the past hypothesis, we right now are at the minimum moment of entropy in the history of the
*  universe. It would be higher in both the past and the future. Now, no one believes that's true.
*  There's zero reason. It just doesn't make sense to think that that's true. The actual universe was
*  low entropy is the right way to think, and therefore you can use ordinary scientific reconstruction to
*  understand that the pictures we take in our telescope really are evidence that the early
*  universe was smooth, but it's only evidence because we can and do and should assume the
*  past hypothesis of low entropy. Okay, Mr. Fu says, looking back 500 years in the past and how we
*  managed to disprove so many scientists of that era, do you think that 500 years in the future,
*  all of our understandings of quantum mechanics and mathematics could be proven completely wrong by
*  scientists of the future, which might in case invalidate many worlds and other important
*  concepts? Well, you know, I think it's actually there's two things going on. One is that by
*  picking 500 years in the past, you've gone a little bit further than the scientific revolution.
*  So there weren't scientists back in that era. Okay. Once we had the scientific revolution,
*  once we had people like Galileo and Copernicus and Kepler and Descartes and Newton and so forth,
*  and Hooke and whatever, they said a lot of things are true that we still think are true
*  today, right? Now, they're not fundamental truths. Newtonian mechanics is not fundamentally true.
*  It's been superseded by quantum mechanics and relativity, but there is still a limit in which
*  it's a very, very good description of what happens. There are situations in which it is
*  correct. You don't need to know general relativity to fly a rocket to the moon.
*  Newtonian mechanics and gravity works perfectly well. That's what I expect will be the case going
*  forward. Sometimes we have ideas in science, even post scientific revolution, that turn out to be
*  wrong. That's absolutely true. You know, the plum pudding model of the atom is everyone's favorite
*  example. But you know, the plum pudding model of the atom was never something everyone believed.
*  It was just an idea out there that we knew perfectly well we weren't certain about,
*  or even very, very high credence. So I think that the thing is that the something like quantum
*  mechanics, something like general relativity, even the standard model of particle physics,
*  the core theory, if you like, these are really accurate effective theories, and they're not
*  going to go away. They might be replaced by better theories, but there will still be a regime, a domain
*  in which they work perfectly well. Whether or not many worlds is going to survive or not, I have no
*  idea. You know, I mean, I have a credence. I think it will survive, but I could be wrong about that.
*  Eric Speckhardt says, You've mentioned several times that humane constructivism lets you be judgy.
*  Can you elaborate on what you mean by that? If moral beliefs are contingent and specific
*  to an individual, as I understand the case to be in humane constructivism,
*  in what sense can you be justified in being judgy? So I think all the work here is being done by the
*  word justified in that last sentence. So for those of you who don't know, I talk about humane
*  constructivism in the big picture and elsewhere. It's a view of morality where you say that there
*  is no once and for all universal rational way to be moral. What there are are individual ways of
*  deciding what you think is moral. And then in the world, you get out there and talk to other people
*  and try to work with them the best you can, given that you don't necessarily agree on how morality
*  works. And as I like to point out, that is what actually happens. So that is how the world actually
*  works. So if your objection to this view is, well, if that were true, it would just be chaos and
*  calamity and nothing would work. It's just the world. I'm just describing what actually happens
*  in the world. So I'd like to talk about constructivism as opposed to relativism,
*  because moral relativism, as I understand it, and everyone has slightly different definitions of
*  these words. So I'm not that interested in debating the definitions, but moral relativism posits that
*  morality is in here in a community or a set of individuals and is only relevant to that community
*  and those individuals. But I didn't say any of those words when I just described humane constructivism.
*  I construct a moral theory and I think my moral theory is the right one. For me, it's the one I
*  constructed, but I'm definitely going to use it to judge other people's behavior. That's one of the
*  things you do with a good moral theory. The crucial thing, like I said, in the end of the question is,
*  can you be justified in doing that? And I'll say, I think that this hope is a relic of the days when
*  we were all moral realists, moral universalists. Most people still are. But back in the days when
*  we thought that there was a morality out there in the sky or whatever, or that we could just perceive
*  by pure reason or whatever, we had a justification that was universal, that was objective, that you
*  could just logically tell people, you know, either God says this or Emmanuel Kant says this or
*  whatever, the golden rule says this, and then that's the way to move forward. But I think that was a
*  mistake. I think that thinking that that's the kind of justification that morality needs was just a
*  mistake from the start. It's sort of antiquated these days. So what do you mean by being justified?
*  I think that, you know, when I say, like, for example, men and women should have equal rights, okay?
*  This is my judgment. I do not think that this is a universal truth, because I don't think there are
*  any moral universal truths. But I will also judge someone harshly if they discriminate against men
*  or women in any very obvious way. And they will say, well, no, my morality is different, okay?
*  And what I can do is judge them. What I can't do is use logic to convince them that they're wrong.
*  What I can do is try to use their own views to convince them that they're wrong. Like, are you
*  sure you believe that? Is it really consistent with other things you believe, knowing, you know,
*  things that maybe you didn't know about men and women and their status in the world? Maybe you'll
*  change your mind. Like, I can do the things people actually do when they're trying to make a moral
*  case to a different person. But there is no absolute ground to stand on to say that they're
*  making a mistake, right? Like, if they say two plus two is five in ordinary arithmetic, that's a
*  mistake. If they say men and women do not deserve equal rights, that's not that kind of mistake.
*  I'm still going to judge them for it. It's just not going to stop me. And I'm happy to admit I
*  don't have that objective justification that I might have had if I could appeal to God or reason
*  or anything like that. Okay, I'm going to group two questions together. Joshua Hillerup says,
*  what do you think about having a university having a rule that a certain percentage of
*  professor slots have to be cross discipline, with two or more departments having to work together to
*  do the hiring? Obviously, there's lots of details that could make specific setups bad. But what is
*  your opinion on the general idea? And then Tomer Huckowin says, how would you design your dream
*  university or research institute given the budget of a big university like Harvard or Yale? What
*  sort of professors would you hire? On what subjects would you focus? What would the curriculum look
*  like, etc. So Tomer's question is too big for the AMA. But some of it will be addressed by trying to
*  answer Joshua's question. I don't really have a grand design for university slash research institute
*  because, you know, there is no such thing as my dream university or research institute. I'm,
*  I actually think that if anything, the problem with the set of universities and research institutes
*  that we have, they're too much alike. They have more or less the same model rather than trying
*  to experiment and do different things, focusing on different things. They're pretty homogeneous,
*  they have like the same way of doing things. And if you think that's the perfect way of doing things,
*  that's fine. But we don't know what the perfect way of doing things is. And you know, in fact,
*  I'm leaving Caltech, but I have huge admiration for Caltech for being different than other places.
*  That doesn't make it right for everybody. I'm very, very happy to tell prospective undergraduates,
*  Caltech is not right for some people, as great a place as it is. For some people, it's the perfect
*  place. For many people, it's a terrible place. And I think that a lot of places should be like that,
*  right? I think a lot of places should have a little bit of personality and be a little bit
*  different. So I don't have a dream university or research institute. Also, research institutes are
*  very different than universities. I mean, universities are weird things, trying to combine
*  research and teaching in the way that they do. It's a 500 year old model, in some sense, or a
*  thousand year old. I don't know when it goes back, it goes back quite a ways 1200s, maybe 800 year
*  old model. When research was a different thing than it is now, as was teaching. And I wonder if,
*  how long the perfect, the model that we have right now will actually last. But having said all that
*  with all those caveats in mind, I'm a huge fan of the traditional arts and sciences curriculum.
*  I like that. History and English and physics and biology. As an astronomy major at Villanova,
*  I had to take a huge number of astronomy and physics and math courses. And because it was a
*  university with very, very broad distribution requirements, I had to take a lot of humanities
*  and social sciences also. I didn't take any biology and chemistry. Maybe I should have,
*  I don't know. Maybe it shows up in the podcasts I'm doing right now. But I think it deserves
*  careful thought, this question. So when I'm not answering it, I'm not answering it because it's
*  not a good question, because it's a huge question. How to make different kinds of research
*  universities and institutes that would optimize across a whole bunch of different things.
*  Many that are very good at teaching, some that are good at science, some that are good at humanities,
*  some that are four years, some that are eight years, some that are two years, some that are
*  all people living on campus, some that are people not living on campus. And a whole bunch of
*  different ways to sort of be have a personality and be a university. Anyway, that didn't answer
*  your question, but I rambled on about it. Joshua's question is a little bit more focused on the idea
*  that universities should have a certain percentage of faculty that are specifically cross discipline.
*  I do like something like that. I'm not sure if that's exactly the way to do it.
*  You know, in my, as I just said, in the universe that I would like to have where there's many
*  different kinds of universities, I would love to see some universities without any departments at
*  all, right? Where faculty could just do the research they wanted to do. Students could in
*  consultation with faculty, design their own courses of study. People could be hired and promoted
*  via ad hoc committees with different kinds of people. So that the question of, you know,
*  if you want to hire an economic historian, do they belong in the history department or the
*  economics department? That's a terrible question that should never come up. You know, that's a
*  huge failure mode of universities. And the way that it happens is, you know, if you're super good,
*  if you're a very productive senior level person, you can be interdisciplinary, right? You can get
*  your own grants, you can found your own little institute, bring, get your own group together
*  and whatever. There's plenty of interdisciplinary research institutes at universities. What there
*  isn't is a path for young people who are interdisciplinary from the start to get hired,
*  right? The path to become a professor is to excel in a discipline and get hired in that discipline
*  and then branch out later. And that works pretty darn well for many people, but for other people,
*  it just doesn't. So I do like the idea that one way or another, it should be possible to hire people
*  as professors in a way that is not the individual departments doing all the work.
*  That is the way it is right now. For those of you, maybe you're not in universities or don't know,
*  at universities, it's departments that have the power, roughly speaking, to hire and promote
*  people. It's not the president of the university or the provost or any or the deans or whatever.
*  They will assign a slot. I mean, they'll say, okay, you have money to hire somebody.
*  The negotiation is more or less the department will say, okay, we would like to hire a biophysicist.
*  And the president and the dean will say, okay, you have money to do that or no, you don't. Or,
*  you know, make a case. Why is biophysics interesting, et cetera? And so there's a
*  back and forth there. But when it comes to choosing the person, 98% of the work is done
*  by the department. And what that means is if you have a physics department, a biology department,
*  an economics department, a history department, and they know that jobs are scarce, that they're
*  not going to get to hire that many people, they will, as a department, almost always decide to
*  hire people who fit well in the boundaries of that department. And that just leaves out people who
*  don't fit well into those boundaries. And I think it's a huge mistake. I think it's a huge
*  opportunity cost for universities that want to do better.
*  Universities should always be competing with each other to hire the best people, do the best research,
*  to be the best educators of the best students. This is a clear way, I think, that you could
*  snap up a bunch of really great people who are young and imaginative, are going to change the
*  world, but don't fit exactly into individual departments. That's how I would put it anyway.
*  I'm never going to be a university administrator, though, so this might not ever happen.
*  Andrew Goldstein says, in your blog describing the move to Johns Hopkins, you make reference to two
*  seminars. The one is entitled Physics of Democracy, which sounds disparate but very intriguing, even
*  hopeful given current events. The other includes Complexity in Emergence, which is a passionate
*  interest to me. So as an outsider, might it be possible to hear or read about any of the
*  discussions that will transpire during these seminars? I would gladly up my membership to
*  the quantum tier for the privilege. The second one that you're referring to is an upper level
*  undergraduate seminar just called Topics in Philosophy of Physics. I will do a little bit
*  of quantum mechanics, a little bit of the arrow of time, a little bit of the anthropic principle,
*  and things like that. I think that's what you're referring to. I'll also be talking about complexity
*  in the Physics of Democracy class, but neither one of these seminars are going to be videotaped or
*  online or anything like that. I think that's correct. I think that's the right thing to do.
*  There's a big place for videotaping things and handing them out freely, as hopefully you know,
*  because I do it all the time. This podcast is audio taped, which is then handed out freely,
*  and that counts. But the biggest ideas in the universe videos were also handed out freely.
*  But the place for that is kind of broadcasting, right? When the role of having a video and having
*  people watch it is you have a person talking. A person with knowledge is trying to spread that
*  knowledge to the rest of the world. That's when that model works very well. But a seminar is not
*  that model. A seminar at the university level, we're going to have like 15 students or fewer
*  in the room. Much of the conversation is going to be the students talking, not me talking.
*  It's got to be a little protected from criticism from the outside world. You have to feel like
*  you're free to say some stupid things because you don't know. If you're worried about saying
*  things and the world making fun of you, then you might not speak up when maybe you should.
*  I think there's a perfectly good place for having seminars that are not recorded,
*  that are just ephemeral. There's a moment there in the classroom, sitting around the table,
*  people are talking to each other. It's fun. It can be life-changing, and it's important,
*  and it's not for external consumption. There's other cases where I don't think that cameras
*  should be allowed. Also, if you have some really focused workshop among your own research group
*  where you're bouncing back and forth ideas that are not yet completely baked and you want to
*  build on them and write papers and so forth, that's not for public consumption either.
*  I'm a huge believer in filming things and letting them be shared, but that's not for everything.
*  Some things are like that and some things are not. The good news is that for the physics of
*  democracy, I certainly hope to write a book on the subject at some point, and that will hopefully
*  appear. For the foundations of physics seminar, I don't know whether I would ever write anything
*  about that, but certainly individual topics within that are things that I write papers about,
*  including complexity and emergence, the anthropic principle, the arrow of time,
*  quantum mechanics. Things will get written about that one way or the other.
*  Rob F says, do you think progress in answering the biggest questions in modern physics will
*  be primarily achieved iteratively through collaboration of large teams of scientists,
*  or do you think it will progress via a paradigm shift sparked by a handful of genius individuals?
*  The popular history of science seems to suggest, perhaps wrongly, that great leaps in understanding
*  were made by exceptionally gifted individuals, Newton, Einstein, etc. But modern science seems
*  more of a collaborative effort. Put another way, do we have to wait for the next Einstein in order
*  to make the next great leap forward? I love this question. I think it's very important because the
*  answer is in between. There have been studies that have purported to show that super duper smart
*  people are way more influential in the history of science than the average person. I actually
*  don't believe these studies because I think that there's a methodological flaw in them.
*  I think that what happens is there are very, very smart people out there in the world,
*  but those people absolutely lean on the efforts of the other people who they talk to and collaborate
*  with. I understand there's history behind the remark, but when Newton says he saw further than
*  others because he stood on the shoulders of giants, he stood on the shoulders of all sorts
*  of people of different heights. That was really, really important. In the Biggest Ideas book that
*  is going to come out, I tell the story of how, very, very briefly, how Newton was inspired to
*  write the Principia Mathematica, the greatest work in the history of physics where he proposed
*  Newtonian mechanics and the inverse square law for gravity and a bit of calculus.
*  There were other people who had most of those ideas. In particular, Robert Hooke had the idea
*  that there's an inverse square law of gravity, and he had the idea that would explain Kepler's
*  laws of motion and the planets moving in ellipses. He wasn't as good at math as Newton was,
*  so he couldn't quite prove it. He couldn't quite derive that the motion in an inverse square
*  potential or inverse square law, force law, would be an ellipse. So Hooke and Christopher Wren and
*  Robert Halley of Halley's Comets fame, they used to get together and talk about these things at the
*  coffee shop, and they eventually engaged Halley to go visit Newton, who was up in Cambridge. All
*  these other people were in London, and asked Newton because everyone knew even at the time,
*  even before the Principia, the word had gotten out that Newton was the smart one around here.
*  When Halley asked him, he said, yeah, no, it'll be an ellipse.
*  And Halley's like, how do you know? I calculated it. And Halley says, well, why didn't you write
*  anything? Yeah, I can't really be bothered to write these things. But, you know, Halley
*  provoked him to write about it, and then eventually that turned into the Principia,
*  which tells us both that if it hadn't been Newton, it would have been somebody else. I mean, given
*  that the idea of the inverse square law was already there, someone else would have put it together.
*  Galilean relativity, conservation of momentum, they were all already there.
*  Leibniz invented calculus not long after Newton, you know, etc., etc. But Newton was there,
*  and he was extraordinarily smart, and he did the greatest single achievement in the history of
*  physics. Okay. So I think it's both. I think that super talented people play an outsized role,
*  but they wouldn't be able to do it without all the work of everyone else. And that is even more
*  important today when we have these large collaborative efforts. It's sometimes hard to
*  see the impact of the smaller incremental steps along the way, but they're important.
*  They're important for the whole story. Joel Curtis says, Do you think the fact that our
*  most successful theories explain interactions and forces in terms of local gauge symmetries
*  is explanatory in any deep sense? Does it tell us something very important about nature or our
*  relationship to it? Well, I have no idea. That's a very good question. I honestly don't know. And
*  I think that I think I my credence for answering questions like this is less now than it was 10
*  years ago, because I've been thinking about quantum gravity in the meantime, and gravity
*  changes everything a little bit. You know, so for folks who are not experts in these buzzwords,
*  our best current theories of the world in terms of predicting things and being accurately mapped
*  to data and so forth, are quantum field theories. So quantum mechanical field
*  theories of fields that pervade space. And in particular, they have different kinds of fields,
*  and the forces that we think of, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force,
*  and gravity for that matter, are all certain kind of field defined by certain kind of symmetry
*  called local gauge symmetries. Okay, we won't go into what that means. But there's a certain
*  symmetry property that helps explain the features of the forces of nature. Did it have to be that
*  way? Could it have been some other way? Is it telling us something deep? I don't know. And one
*  of the reasons why I don't know is because just being a field theory, I don't think is right. I
*  don't think the world is a field theory. And the reason why is because in field theory, there's an
*  infinite number of things going on in any one region of space. And to me, that means that there
*  could in principle be an infinite amount of entropy in any region of space, right? Because
*  entropy counts the number of things that could be going on in a region given its macroscopic
*  features. And so if field theory were right, then I claim that you could imagine states in the
*  universe where there's arbitrarily large amounts of entropy in any region. But we know that's not
*  true, or we think that's not true, because if you keep putting things in a region of space, the energy
*  keeps going up and eventually you collapse into a black hole. And black holes have entropy, but that
*  entropy is not infinite. It's a finite number. So that tells us there's only a finite number of things
*  that can happen in any one region of space. And that tells us that nature is not described by a
*  quantum field theory. Now we're still working on understanding the implications of that, because
*  certainly the local gauge theories that we use are really super duper successful. But once gravity
*  becomes important, it seems that they can't be fundamental, even though they're very successful.
*  How that all fits together, I don't know. So it's very, very possible that the success of gauge
*  theories in our low energy accessible world is not an accident, does reflect something really deep going
*  on at a profound level. But it's also possible that in some sense it's an accident. In some sense,
*  it's an epiphenomenal something that would be true in some approximation, but is not very deep or
*  fundamental. I honestly just don't know. It's worth thinking about. Lester Su says, are you able to
*  explain the context implications of the latest Fermilab results on the W boson? So for those of
*  you who don't know, Fermilab, the giant particle accelerator facility just outside of Chicago,
*  recently published a paper where they measured the mass of the W boson. W boson is one of the
*  two kinds of bosons we have carrying the weak interactions. It's a boson that is an excitation
*  of a local gauge field, as we were just talking about. The Z boson is the other kind. Z bosons
*  are neutral, W bosons are charged, their masses are similar, but a little bit different. And it's
*  hard to measure the mass for many, many reasons, but people have been trying to do it and people
*  have been doing it. And then the question is, keep doing it and get more and more accurate results.
*  The reason why it's an especially interesting thing to do, not only are you saying, well,
*  that's the constant of nature, the mass of the W boson, that would be nice to know,
*  but other features of the world feed into the measured mass of the W boson. This is a feature
*  of quantum field theory, that all fields kind of vibrate around in the background and affect the
*  properties of all the other fields. This shows up when you think about Feynman diagrams and the fact
*  that the mass, what is the mass? It's just the property of inertia of a particle moving all by
*  itself, right? The mass you would think doesn't have anything to do with interactions. If you
*  just have a particle not interacting, just moving, it still has a mass, right? Or even just sitting
*  there, it has a mass. But in quantum field theory, the Feynman diagrams are telling you that as that
*  particle is just sitting there, it is interacting with all the other fields around it. And these are
*  quantified by little loops that you can draw in the Feynman diagrams. And those loops will eventually
*  connect the properties of that particle sitting there to all the other properties of all the other
*  fields in the universe. So in principle, by measuring things like the mass of the W boson
*  and other particles, you can tell whether there are other fields that we haven't yet directly
*  detected in any other particle accelerator. You can say that there are consistency relations
*  between things like the mass of the W boson, the mass of the Higgs, and the mass of the top quark.
*  Okay? And so this new result from Fermilab seems to be telling us that at a statistically significant
*  level, the mass of the W boson is a little bit bigger than we thought before and is not consistent
*  with the standard model of particle physics, but would be consistent if there were somehow some
*  other particles that were feeding into the W and giving it a little bit of extra mass.
*  I'm not going to tell any details about what those models look like. You can check out Matt
*  Strassler's blog where he talks about those things or other, if you just go to archive,
*  I'm sure there's many, many models have appeared since this happened. But here's the context which
*  should make you be cautious about the whole thing. You know, it's Fermilab that is getting
*  this result, right? It's not the Large Hadron Collider. That's at CERN outside Geneva in
*  Switzerland. I didn't even know Fermilab was still running, you might say to yourself,
*  and you'd be correct because Fermilab's accelerator, the Tevatron, turned off in the year 2011.
*  So this analysis is not because Fermilab has collected new data. It's because it has been
*  analyzing more carefully the data that was collected in 2011 and before, which is fine,
*  you're allowed to do that. But this result is not compatible with previous results, either from
*  Fermilab itself or from the LHC in Switzerland. Maybe it's like close to being compatible in the
*  error bars or whatever, but it's clearly not precisely compatible. And so it's both based on
*  old data and it's incompatible with previous results. So if there is some amount of credence
*  you have that this is just a goof, that somehow there was some systematic effect in the accelerator
*  or the detector or the data analysis pipeline, this would be a, you know, above average chance
*  for something like that to happen. And you know, if they had just measured it and gotten the right
*  answer, the answer everyone thought was the correct one, people would think it would be
*  perfectly fine. But it is okay to be more skeptical about dramatic claims, right? And this is one where,
*  you know, there's sort of a route to skepticism if that's what you want to take. At the same time,
*  the people who are actually doing the analysis, etc., they know what they're doing. You know,
*  they're not dummies. They know their detector pretty darn well, but anybody else does. And they
*  wouldn't say something dramatic like this unless they thought that they had double-checked every
*  possible single thing that would cause this to happen. So we'll have to wait. We'll have to see
*  if better data or experiments from LHC or elsewhere are able to pin it down. Otherwise,
*  I would not get too excited just yet, but it would be very cool if it were true.
*  Kathy Seeger says, how best to argue with people who claim that Ukraine should surrender because
*  they can't win on their own and an active involvement of NATO would maybe lead to a third
*  world war or nuclear strike? I get the argument in a way, but it still feels flat out wrong to let me,
*  to me, to let Russia win the war and get away with atrocities. From a moral philosophy point of view,
*  what would you say? So I don't know if Kathy, you yourself were inspired by this, but a claim
*  close to that claim was famously debated just a little while ago because Noam Chomsky, of all
*  people, said it. Noam Chomsky famous for many things, linguistics most prominently, but also
*  as a leftist critique of imperialism, et cetera. And there's a worry that you get so interested
*  in critiquing American and European imperialism that you sort of take it easy on imperialism from
*  other places, from China or Russia or whatever. So that was the counter argument to Chomsky,
*  because Chomsky is basically saying, look, Ukraine can't win. They should just take it,
*  rather than sacrificing themselves, they should let Russia basically win. I don't know exactly
*  the word, so don't quote me on that. You can go look it up. But there are certainly people
*  who have that point of view. There's no question. I do not see any justification for me to tell
*  Ukraine what to do about this. I think that throughout history, there have been stories of
*  countries or people who've been attacked and against overwhelming odds and have resisted.
*  And sometimes their resistance has worked and sometimes it hasn't. But there is something,
*  since you asked from the moral philosophy point of view, there is something intrinsically noble
*  about the resistance, about fighting for your country, for your freedom against an authoritarian
*  oppressor who is invading you. So I think there's something noble about what Ukraine is doing.
*  I'm not going to give them advice. Look, what I mean when I say I'm not going to give them advice
*  is if they wanted to surrender, if they said, look, we're hurting ourselves, too many people
*  are dying, too many atrocities, we have to end this even if it means surrendering to the imperialist
*  aggressor, I would not criticize them for doing that. But I certainly won't criticize them for
*  continuing to resist. I mean, go them, go Ukrainians. They have shown enormous courage and pluck and the
*  whole world is rooting them for very good reasons. The harder thing to do is to say what other
*  countries should do. And I have no influence over what Ukraine does. I also have no influence over
*  what the United States does. So it's just me talking. I don't have any policy levers to pull
*  on this one. But it's an interesting, weird kind of dance, isn't it? Because, of course, as I said
*  in the last AMA, World War III would be bad. Having literally hundreds of millions of people die
*  is an outcome because of nuclear weapons throwing back and forth is an outcome to be avoided at all
*  costs, I think. So that is why NATO and the US, etc. do not want to send troops to the Ukraine,
*  because then those troops would fight Russian troops and it will be war between NATO and Russia
*  and that war could escalate to nuclear weapons. I'm completely on board with that worry. I think
*  that's a very reasonable worry. But what's weird about it is we are allowed to send weapons,
*  right? Somehow we, by we I mean the collective humanity, have decided that if we send weapons
*  or food or resources of some sort to Ukraine and they use them to fight against Russia,
*  that's not an act of war. So I think it's okay. I'm not arguing against it. But the philosopher
*  in me wants to say that's a particular place that you've chosen to draw a line between two things.
*  And I bet that that line would not stand up under very, very strict scrutiny. Helping Ukraine one
*  way versus another seems to me to be the issue. But as long as it prevents a nuclear war, I'm
*  happy to go along with the conventional understanding. Anyway, I'm very, very happy that we give
*  Ukrainians resources to fight against the invading army. Robert Ruxin-Drescu says,
*  imagine I write to you a sentence in Romanian, my native language. For you, it will look like
*  a random sequence of letters with no meaning or information in them. For me, that sentence would
*  be meaningful and have a lot of information. What then can be said of the relationship between
*  information and entropy? It seems like what we call low entropy is arbitrary. So I like how you
*  are assuming that I don't speak Romanian. In this case, your assumption is completely correct,
*  because I do not speak a word of Romanian. But this is a perfectly good question, but there are
*  perfectly good answers to this. I don't think this is very mysterious at the fundamental level.
*  It becomes mysterious because we use the word information in different ways.
*  So there is a sense of information that Claude Shannon introduced, where it really is a
*  perfectly objective quantitative thing based on the frequencies of different symbols coming your
*  way. So if someone sends you a text in Romanian, you can look at the frequency with which different
*  letters are used or different words are used, etc., and talk about the entropy of a message.
*  In the sense that, given that language, even if I don't understand it semantically, even if I don't
*  know what it's supposed to be telling me about the world, I can still say that within this language,
*  a certain message is information packed or not very informative at all. That's a purely mathematical
*  statement. And how you should think about it is certain sentences are surprising. They don't appear
*  very often. They therefore convey a lot of information. If someone says the sun rises in the
*  east versus saying the sun rose today in the west, even though the length of the sentences are the
*  same, one conveys much more information. Because we already knew the sun rises in the east. Telling
*  me it rose in the east this morning doesn't give me any more information than I didn't already have.
*  Telling me it rose in the west, which is not a common sentence that you would hear people say,
*  would, if it were true, convey a lot of information. So in that sense of the word information,
*  doesn't matter whether I can speak Romanian or not. I can still talk about the entropy.
*  There's another sense, though. I mean, like you say, there's this connection between the words and
*  the meanings of the words out there in the world. And there, it's still an answerable question. The
*  point is that there's different ways of coarse graining, right? The same exact text might have
*  no information content from the perspective of a certain observer and a lot of information content
*  from the perspective of another observer. Let's say that there's an observer who interprets it
*  as Romanian and understands what it means, and another who interprets it as English and therefore
*  gets nothing out of it. They have different ways of coarse graining. They have different ways of
*  dividing the space of letters up into words, etc., and calculating its entropy. And so they
*  would get different answers for that. So in that sense, it's not arbitrary, but it's relative to
*  the coarse graining. It's relative to the way that you're looking at the world. When it comes to actual
*  physical systems, not strings of text letters, there are ways that we all as human beings look
*  at the world and we coarse grain it in the same way. That's why using the ideas of information
*  entropy and the connection between them is not arbitrary in practical purposes. Sean Coram says,
*  can photons have arbitrarily high energy or would an energetic enough photon turn into a black hole?
*  Nope, photons cannot turn into black holes. Why? Because there's no such thing as a photon having
*  an arbitrarily high energy. Why? Because energy is not an intrinsic concept to the photon. The
*  energy is not Lorentz invariant. We know that objects have kinetic energy as well as rest energy,
*  rest energy being equals mc squared plus kinetic energy. But the kinetic energy depends on their
*  velocity, depends on their motion, and that's relative to who's observing it. If I'm in the
*  rest frame of the object, it has zero kinetic energy. Likewise for a photon, even though it
*  moves at the speed of light, I can still change my reference frame and observe its energy in different
*  reference frames. And there's always a reference frame in which the photon looks like it's low
*  energy. There's always another reference frame in which it looks like it's high energy. So there's
*  no such thing as a photon just having high energy once and for all and therefore there's no danger
*  that it turns into a black hole. Brad Dowden says, do you recommend that we say the arrow of time is
*  entropy increase or instead is whatever the entropy of the universe does? I recommend that we say the
*  arrow of time is all of the ways in which the past is different from the future. So one of those
*  ways is that entropy is increasing. Entropy was lower in the past, will be higher in the future,
*  but there are other ways. We already talked about causality, there's memory, there's aging and
*  biology and evolution of the universe and evolution of the ecosystem, things like that. Those are all
*  defining versions, not versions, but features of the arrow of time. The next correct statement is
*  that the reason why there are all of these arrows of time is because entropy is increasing. So that
*  is the single thing that enables all of these other asymmetries between past and future. So the
*  fact that entropy is increasing is the reason why there is an arrow of time. I would not say that it
*  is the arrow of time. Alex Ellis says, more than once I've heard statements along the lines that
*  many worlds is the only interpretation of quantum mechanics that doesn't add anything, it just
*  follows directly from the math. What does that mean? No equation or mathematical process means
*  anything unless you attach meanings to the mathematical entities involved. Sure, so that's
*  a not a very accurate or at least somewhat sloppy statement that you have quoted. Many worlds is the
*  only interpretation of quantum mechanics that directly follows the math. What the correct
*  statement is that the ontology and dynamics of many worlds are the simplest ones. It says that
*  there is nothing but a quantum state, which is an element of Hilbert space, and the quantum state
*  evolves according to the Schrodinger equation. That's what many worlds says. It says, in other
*  words, there are not other degrees of freedom, there are not other dynamical laws, there are not
*  other ways of thinking about it involving agents or experiences or anything like that.
*  Of course, just like any other physical theory, you have to be able to explain how this mathematical
*  formalism accounts for the world. If you tell me the earth goes around the sun, how do I get that
*  from a state evolving in Hilbert space, according to the Schrodinger equation? Of course,
*  you have to do that, but that's no different for many worlds than anything else. The correct
*  statement is the minimal ingredients that are part of everyone's theory of quantum mechanics,
*  namely wave functions in the Schrodinger equation, are the only ingredients you need for
*  many worlds. There's no statement that is especially mathy or anti-mathy about many worlds.
*  It's no more or less than any other physical theory. Claudio says, I notice that wormholes
*  are being mentioned more often lately. What's the current understanding of wormholes and what
*  would be evidence of their existence? I don't know what social media you're listening in on,
*  where wormholes are being mentioned more lately, but wormholes are a hypothetical construct that
*  were made famous by Einstein and collaborators, but there are other people talking about them,
*  where you can basically use the fact that in general relativity, space-time is curved
*  to imagine building a tunnel through space-time. Building a little wormhole, as it were, connecting
*  two different parts of the universe. The really cool part about it is in this imagination space,
*  where we're just making things up. We're not worried about what actually happens in the real
*  world. You can imagine wormholes that are shortcuts. Even though I'm here and someone else
*  is on Alpha Centauri, I can imagine a version of space-time in which there's a wormhole where
*  it would take me four light years to get to Alpha Centauri the usual way, going near the speed of
*  light, but it would only take me a day to get there through the wormhole. The distance would
*  be shorter. The short answer is I don't think there are any wormholes. I don't think this is a part of
*  the real world. People have tried and they have not completely succeeded in saying it's impossible
*  to make a wormhole. What they have shown is that if you try, lots of bad things happen.
*  Generally speaking, if you try to make a wormhole, what actually happens is everything collapses
*  into a black hole. It's very, very similar to the cosmic censorship conjecture. Cosmic censorship
*  says that the only singularities appear beyond event horizons of black holes. It's a similar
*  thing with wormholes when you get right down to it, but there are technical details that we don't
*  need to go into. From the thought experiment point of view, they're very, very interesting.
*  A lot of work being done these days in the ADS-CFT correspondence uses wormholes of various kinds,
*  but they're not trying to model the real world. They're trying to learn general principles that
*  might somehow tell us about it. And of course, as Kip Thorne and others realized long ago,
*  if you have a shortcut through space, you can go backwards in time. So wormholes are useful both to
*  travel great distances through space and also maybe to enable time travel, which might be,
*  depending on your stance on these things, a reason not to think that there are any wormholes,
*  because time travel would be a mess in its own right. Tarun says, where do you stand on Hume's
*  skepticism toward the principle of induction and what this means for the validity of science?
*  Well, you know, I'm a Bayesian, so I don't think that there's any principle of induction that is
*  any hard and fast rule. You know, the principle of induction, if we, what was it ever supposed to be?
*  I'm not sure. If you see a white swan and a white swan and a white swan, when do you reach the point
*  where therefore there are no black swans? I mean, you just get more and more credence, right? Like
*  good Bayesian has just no problem with this. You say, well, if we live in a world where half the
*  swans were white and half were black versus a world where they were all white and none of them
*  were black, the probability of seeing a hundred white swans in a row would be very high in one
*  and very low in the other. So I'm going to increase my credence in the one that is more likely to be
*  true. But I admit that the next one I see might be black, right? So that's one sort of the cheap
*  and easy part of the answer to that question. Like the principle of induction was never supposed to
*  be, never, or never had any good reason to be taken completely seriously as a way to get
*  reliable knowledge of the world. The other, of course, like hiding here is the issue that
*  any good Bayesian has about the priors that you have for all of your credences. So, you know,
*  this is the Nelson Goodman is a philosopher who pointed out, look, you know, when we're trying to
*  do induction, what are we inducting on? Like, what are the properties that we're measuring? So when
*  we talk about the swans, it was either white or black, right? And you say, it's white, it's white,
*  it's white, it's white. Every swan I've ever seen is white. Therefore, they're probably all white.
*  Even a good Bayesian would be tempted to say something like that, right? Not 100%. But if you
*  see a million white swans in a row, you become pretty confident. So what Goodman says is,
*  for some reason, he went with blue and green instead of white and black. But he says, look,
*  let me define a property called GRU. And GRU is green up until the year 2100 and blue after the
*  year 2100, right? That's a property. Absolutely true. And he says, look, so far, when I see,
*  you know, my, I don't know, shishito pepper, every shishito pepper I've seen is green. And therefore,
*  I'm tempted to say it'll be green forever. But it's also true that every shishito pepper I've
*  ever seen is GRU, right? Because they're all green before the year 2100. And it's compatible
*  that they'll be blue after the year 2100. So how do I know which conclusion to draw? And from the
*  Bayesian language, what this is saying is, what are the priors that you put on different propositions?
*  And it might, your prior may be much higher, that the wavelengths of light reflected by this,
*  by this vegetable remain constant versus changing into something else, right? Or something like that.
*  But you still have to ask where those priors come from. And I'm very happy to say that they're a
*  little bit subjective, right? That we human beings invent priors, because we have a pre existing
*  image of the world, the manifest image that gives us certain predilections towards certain ways of
*  thinking that the world behaves. And that's where our priors come from. And different people will
*  have slightly different priors, etc. But that is where the subjectivity comes in. And that's okay,
*  the short answer to all of these questions is pre-Hume, there was a real effort to put everything
*  on a firm foundation, right? You didn't really have knowledge unless it was kind of like math,
*  like it was kind of like absolute truth descended from completely believable postulates or axioms.
*  I think that the usefulness of what Hume did was to undermine that program, and to soften people
*  up, even though Hume didn't have all the final answers, he soften people up for accepting the
*  idea that knowledge is a little bit more fallibilistic, a little bit more approximate,
*  a little bit more probabilistic, in some sense, something we work toward getting higher and higher
*  credences in things rather than getting them true once and for all.
*  Jeffrey Sagal says, I enjoyed everything everywhere all at once, but I need to defend
*  the everything bagel as my favorite bagel. What is your favorite bagel? And do you have an
*  alternative candidate for the bad bagel? So I don't want to know no spoiler alerts, but there's an
*  everything bagel in the movie, everything everywhere all at once, it plays an important role.
*  And I love everything bagels. I don't think that you should need to defend it. And I don't think
*  the movie is necessarily anti everything bagel. Still not a spoiler, don't worry.
*  I also just like garlic bagels or onion bagels. I like the savory bagels. So my alternative
*  candidate for bad bagel would be something sweet, right? But you know, in the right circumstances,
*  a blueberry bagel with some, you know, strawberry cream cheese or something like that is perfectly
*  fine. So I don't think there are any bad bagels. There are just bad bagel eaters.
*  Bruno Teixeira says, after the podcast with Nicole Younger Halpern, do you still stand by the statement
*  that we have already discovered all the laws of physics that affect our everyday lives?
*  Well, technically, no, I do not stand by that statement. But I've never made that statement.
*  It is not a statement that I would ever make. The statement I actually make is that we know,
*  we completely understand the laws of physics underlying the everyday world. And all the words
*  in that statement matter. You can't just kind of leave some words out and get a statement that is
*  equally true. In particular, the word underlying is very, very true. Nobody in their right mind
*  thinks that we understand all of the laws of physics at all of the levels of analysis you
*  might want to think about. We don't understand, I don't know why bumblebees fly, how they fly.
*  I'm not even sure that's true, or if that's an urban myth. We don't understand high temperature
*  superconductivity. We don't understand what the dark matter is. Plenty of things we don't understand.
*  And the specific statement that I've tried to make is that we understand the laws of physics
*  in one domain at one level. And that level is the standard model of particle physics plus
*  general relativity, the core theory. Nothing that Nicole and I talked about is in any sense
*  incompatible with the standard model plus general relativity. So there's no reason why I would change
*  my stance on that particular statement. Brad Malt says, we, your loyal listeners, I appreciate the
*  loyalty Brad, thank you, seem to be continually asking questions reflecting our confusion about
*  improbable branches of the multiverse. In the April AMA, this took the form of a question about
*  the meaning of making moral choices. And you counseled us not to be discouraged because the
*  bad branch of the wave function was improbable. I think we would stop asking this question if you
*  could articulate why thin worlds are any less real. For instance, if there is a 99% chance of
*  a good world and a 1% chance of a bad world, aren't there just two worlds, 50% of which are bad?
*  You say the worlds don't count equally, but why not and in what sense? This is a perfectly good
*  question. As you say, versions of it have been asked many times. I predict that I can articulate
*  it very well and it will not stop people from asking the questions. And that's not because
*  people are stubborn, it's because it's a very different kind of thing. This is an issue that
*  arises in the many worlds interpretation that just doesn't arise in other theories and therefore,
*  you know, it's okay to struggle with understanding what is going on here. The mathy way to say it is
*  that in quantum mechanics, in many worlds quantum mechanics, the quantum state of the universe is a
*  vector and the different worlds are components of that vector. So if you imagine a simple example
*  where there's a vector in xy plane, right, I draw an arrow going from the origin to some point x,
*  y and I could project it down to the x-axis and over to the y-axis to get its components.
*  Now let's say that my coordinates of the tail, the head of the vector, I don't know which one
*  is which, the arrow is x equals one, y equals ten, okay? So I have two components, the x component
*  has length one, the y component has length ten. But you would not be tempted to say the there's
*  two components, they're equal. I think that these two components matter the same, right? One component
*  is ten times longer than the other one is and that's what the world is in quantum mechanics.
*  The world is a vector and these different components are the different, the world, the
*  quantum state of the universe is a vector and the different individual worlds are components
*  of that vector. Components can be bigger or smaller, that's the basic fact. That's the
*  mathy version. If you want a more sort of physical version, think of it this way. We want to be able
*  to compare different worlds. We need to be able to say that some worlds do count more than others.
*  And the reason why we need to be able to say that is because we do want to assign more probability
*  to seeing some result, okay? And if you don't think that's possible, if you just take a stubborn view
*  which says I'm not allowed to assign different amount of worlds, then you don't believe many
*  worlds. So you don't have an issue. You can't make many worlds work unless you're willing to make that
*  metaphysical step. And then if you are willing to make that metaphysical step, the question is, okay,
*  how do I do it? How do I assign amounts of umph to the different worlds with thickness, whatever you
*  want to call it? Should it just be 50-50? Should it just be equal for every world? And the answer is
*  that that possibility of trying to give equal umph to every world just fails. It just fails right
*  away. And one way of seeing that is think about if I were to split one world into three, okay? So now
*  I have three worlds and you're going to say, well, I'm going to give them equal, for equal thickness,
*  equal width. So it's one third, one third, one third, right? But now instead of splitting into
*  three, so let's keep that in mind, now let's imagine I just split into two, okay? So I measure a spin
*  or something like that. I get two outcomes. I have now two worlds and I split into two. But I agree
*  ahead of time that if I get spin down, I'm going to split again, right? If I get spin up, I'm not
*  going to split again. So in that case, I first split into two worlds and now you're saying, well,
*  I'm going to give them one half, one half, right? And now I split again the other world. Now the
*  choice is either I give that world that is now split one quarter, one quarter for each of its
*  successors, right? Because it was half for the first splitting and then another half for the
*  second splitting. So it's one quarter, one quarter. So the spin up world gets a half and the other two
*  worlds get a quarter. Or I say, okay, let me say why that doesn't make sense. The reason why that
*  doesn't make sense is if I take the limit as that second splitting happens closer and closer and
*  closer to the first one, then I can't tell the difference. There becomes no difference. That
*  limit should be continuous. It should be smooth. There's no difference between splitting into three
*  all at once and splitting into two and then conditionally splitting into another two really,
*  really, really, really quickly. I'd better get the same answer. So one quarter, one quarter, one half
*  is a different answer than one third, one third, one third. So that doesn't work. So instead, you
*  might say, oh, okay, when I do the second splitting, I will update, I will redo my idea what the
*  thickness of all the worlds is and I'll give it one third, one third, one third. But then, you know,
*  for those of us who are on the spin up world, we had thought that our world was half of all the
*  thickness and now something that happened in a completely different world reduced us to one third
*  of the thickness. That doesn't make sense either, right? You're like, oh my goodness, none of this
*  makes sense. Whatever are we to do? Well, the answer is give an amount of thickness that is
*  given by the Born rule, given by the wave function squared. The, you know, x squared plus y squared
*  equals the length of the arrow squared. That is the conserved quantity that is there all the time.
*  So I know it's very different than what you're used to, but if you accept many worlds at all,
*  you have to count the worlds unequally. Let me give you a third way of thinking about this or a
*  third justification for doing it this way. Let's say that you do, you want to treat some worlds as
*  equally thick or equally important, okay? Well, you know, since it is the component of a vector,
*  maybe you say, well, at least I will treat worlds equally thickly if they have the same amplitude,
*  right? If the component has the same length, then I could treat it equally, right? If it's spin up
*  and spin down, it's literally one over square root of two spin up plus one over square root of two
*  spin down, and then I make that measurement, now I should treat it equally. So that's okay. Yes,
*  you are allowed to do that, but then what does that imply when the amplitudes are not equal?
*  What it implies is that if I have two unequal amplitudes, then I could ask for the two different
*  components, the two different worlds, what if I subdivide them unequally, right? What if I
*  subdivide them until they're subdivided into a number of worlds such that their amplitudes are
*  are equal, right? So I keep slicing until they have equal sizes of the pie. So I get, you know,
*  two-thirds of one world and one-third of the other world, but then I take the two-thirds world and I
*  split it one more time, right? And so then I get worlds with equal amplitudes, I assign them equal
*  width or thickness, and I ask what does that imply pre-splitting? What does that imply before I did
*  that extra splitting? Well, what it implies is the width of the two-thirds world was two-thirds,
*  right? That's what works. So if you want to assign equal width to worlds with equal amplitudes,
*  that means you should use the Born rule, the wave function squared, when you don't have equal
*  amplitudes. So no matter what way you slice it, no matter what way you come at the problem,
*  if you want to make sense of the worlds in many worlds, you have to assign a meaningfulness,
*  thickness, umph, whatever you want to call it, which is proportional to the wave function squared.
*  If you don't think many worlds make sense, that's a different question, but that's what you need to
*  do in many worlds. Ford Prefect says, in principle, could there exist a particularly
*  lucky configuration of massive objects in the universe that would happen to bend light in such
*  a way so that by observing it, we could snoop into our past and see how dinosaurs are being
*  wiped out by an asteroid? Well, in principle, there could be, but let's emphasize precisely
*  how impractical it is. For one thing, when you have things like stars and planets, which have
*  gravitational fields that do bend light, the amount of light bending is really, really tiny.
*  If you want anything close to several degrees of bending, you're going to need something like a
*  black hole, okay? So you have black holes out there in the universe, but what's happening is the Earth
*  sending light out in all directions, and that light is spreading out as it goes further and
*  further away from the Earth. So even if there was a configuration of black holes somewhere out there
*  in the galaxy many light years away, which had exactly the property that a single beam of light
*  precisely targeted could zoom out from the Earth, wrap around. So the dinosaurs were what, 65 million
*  years ago? So it would have to be 32.5 million light years away, very, very far in another galaxy.
*  So some photon could go exactly in the right configuration and come exactly back to us.
*  But think about it, what would the photon next to it do? Well, it's so thinly spread out that it
*  would not come anywhere close to following. It would be in a different path. It would be diverging
*  because all the photons are moving apart as they leave the Earth. Think about it this way. Think
*  about taking a picture of the Earth from the orbit of Pluto just with a video camera. You're
*  not going to see that much, right? The Earth will be a little tiny dot. That's all it's going to be.
*  In fact, that's literally the pale blue dot image that was taken by the Voyager spacecraft. It's
*  just a dot. You're not going to get any images. And that's just the orbit of Pluto. That's not
*  35 million light years away, right? So for all intents and purposes, this is not really going
*  to happen. The other thing is, this is an elaborate setup to do something pretty simple. If you really
*  want to capture images from the past, just take a picture. Let's take a photograph. Now, admittedly,
*  we don't have any photographs from 65 million years ago, but we have other records. We have fossils,
*  right? We have footprints. We have bones and things like that. And you might say, well, that's not as
*  detailed as we would like. Yeah, it's not. But it is much, much, much more detailed than we would
*  ever get from light that was sent off to some black hole 35 million light years away, 32.5 million
*  light years away, and then sent back to us. Tom says, I enjoyed your recent conversation with
*  Daniels and subsequently saw the movie. I'm curious if you ever had any ideas for movies
*  or creative projects of your own. I know you've consulted on the physics portrayed on film, but
*  what about a screenplay of your own? Yeah, I've absolutely thought about it. I've even,
*  I don't want to say collaborated. That sounds too, gives me too much credit. I have talked to
*  friends of mine who are screenwriters about maybe collaborating. It's never really gotten off the
*  ground. Entirely my fault that it's never really gotten off the ground because there's just too
*  many other things going on. And I've had situations where, let's put it this way,
*  if I had really devoted myself to getting the screenplay written, it would have been written.
*  I'm not going to say the movie would be made. The vast majority of screenplays never get made in this
*  town. But I think that'll be a lot of fun. I'm very much interested in it. I'm not giving up on it yet,
*  but still there's plenty of other things I got to get done first. Ken Wolf says, I think that one of
*  the key questions in the future of artificial intelligence is whether or not something like
*  human level artificial general intelligence can be developed without creating a conscious entity.
*  I'm not asking whether you think this is possible, since I don't think anyone can answer that
*  at this point. My question is whether you think an advanced AGI with or without subjective conscious
*  experience represents a greater existential threat to humanity and why? Well, I have a couple of
*  comments here, none of which are going to be really satisfying answers to your question.
*  I don't know what it means to say that a certain AGI, artificial general intelligence, has
*  consciousness or not. Not that I'm saying it's impossible to answer. So I'm not saying that in
*  the sense of saying, oh, I don't know what that means because I don't think it makes sense. I just
*  mean I don't know what it means. I'm not exactly sure how to draw that line. I'm perfectly willing
*  to believe that AGI could be conscious. I just don't know what the criteria are. So I have no idea.
*  I just don't have a good answer to the actual question of whether an AGI with or without
*  consciousness is the bigger threat. Also, I don't know what the origin of the threat is.
*  This is a slightly different issue than what you're asking. But how does the super intelligent,
*  conscious AI actually threaten me? I can imagine if we turned over all of the levers and buttons
*  that controlled our economy or our military, that would be a threat. But maybe we could have an AGI
*  but didn't give it any access to the economy or the military. So I'm not exactly sure what the
*  precise scenario to worry about is. I think that it's all a little vague. I would be more interested
*  in this issue if it were a little bit more specific what it was I should be worrying about.
*  Henry Jacobs says, perspective, free will is a bad theory, not because it's false,
*  but because it's not a theory. Thoughts. Follow-up, so this is a parody of a quote of you
*  roughly replacing free will with God. And I suspect even the explanation logic is isomorphic.
*  Am I being lazy? So yes, I think you're being lazy, or at least you're being very wrong.
*  Sorry about that, Henry. But you know, you asked the question, so you kind of open yourself up for it.
*  Look, I've given a talk called God is not a good theory. You should watch the talk,
*  because in the beginning of it, I tell the amusing story of how you can find on YouTube.
*  It was at a conference at Oxford on cosmology and theology and the intersections between them.
*  And in the program for the conference, the title of my talk was listed incorrectly.
*  It was listed as God is not a theory. And I tell the story of how that is exactly the opposite
*  of what I think. That is why the title of my actual talk was God is not a good theory.
*  If it's not a good theory, it is a theory. It's just a bad theory. That is exactly the point that
*  I was trying to make. So you seem to be under the impression that I think that God is not a good
*  theory because it's not a good, because it's not a theory. But that is the opposite of what I believe.
*  I do not think that the cut and replace that you are suggesting has much oomph whatsoever. Sorry.
*  Cooper Veidt says, priority question. Remember, I keep forgetting to mention this, but priority
*  questions are every person who is a Patreon of Mindscape gets to ask a question once in their
*  life that I promise to answer, or at least try to answer. I do not promise the answer will be
*  satisfactory, but I will not ignore it. There's too many questions, so I have to
*  delete some questions. And therefore, sometimes you're really interested in a question that I'm
*  not. This is the way that you can get your question answered by labeling it as priority.
*  But you only get to do it once in your life, so make it good. So Cooper says, on the issue of
*  morality, Adam Smith talked about a sympathetic observer, someone who will be able to sum up
*  the net most preferable alternative outcome or macrostate. Do you think net preferability is
*  remotely scientific? I have mixed feelings about this one. I think this is a good question. So,
*  again, my mixed feelings are because they're really mixed, not because I think it's an ill-posed
*  question. Let me say two things. One thing is that if you have some decision procedure,
*  if you have some way of saying in these circumstances, you should act in a certain way,
*  this is the moral thing to do. You can always translate any decision procedure into a procedure
*  of maximizing some function, even if it's the very trivial thing of the function equals one on
*  decisions that you should make and the function equals zero on decisions you shouldn't make.
*  So there's always some way to mathematize and to think of a decision procedure or a theory of
*  morality of what is right and what is wrong as assigning numbers to things. So that can't be the
*  objection to this kind of thing. But there can be an objection, namely, what kind of number are you
*  assigning? The idea, and this is sort of proto-utilitarian consequentialist, right? Summing
*  up the net most preferable alternative. What exactly is it? If I understand your question
*  correctly, Cooper, you're asking what exactly is it that I'm summing up? And is the thing that
*  I'm summing up something that is sensibly summed up? Just because we can use words like summing
*  things up doesn't mean that it makes sense to sum things up. You cannot add up the number three to
*  the coffee cup in front of me. It doesn't make any sense. You're adding two things in different
*  spaces that do not have an addition operation defined on the set that is their union. So
*  that's a real worry, right? That the idea being there's something called preferability
*  that we can attach numbers to and then we can add them up. I do think that, again, maybe
*  there is a trivial sense in which this is always possible in principle, but I have big worries
*  about it as in practice that there is, I mean, there's assumptions being made here. You know,
*  maybe about the linearity, for example. You know, if I have two people that for some reason their
*  preferences or their utility or whatever you want to call it is one half each and that's equal
*  under some calculation to a person with preference one and another with preference zero,
*  I'm not sure that does make sense. But I can't rule it out. I don't think it's the practical way
*  to go about doing these things. I think that it's sort of, maybe this is what you're getting
*  at with your question, I think that it sounds more rigorous and quantitative and sciencey
*  than it really is. I think that the right thing to do is not necessarily phrased in those terms.
*  That would be my position, but it's not a position I hold very strongly. I'd be willing to talk into
*  something better with convincing counter proposal. David Culbert says, I've recently dipped my toe
*  into exploring ancient Greek schools of philosophy or perhaps more accurately life philosophies
*  like Stoicism or at least it's more modern incarnation appeals to me. Do you find any
*  such life philosophies intriguing or do you eschew adherence to things like this in much the way,
*  same way as you dislike hero worship? Well, I think it's a different thing than hero worship,
*  but there is a similarity. So a school of thought or a philosophy is a set of ideas.
*  You know, adhering to a set of ideas is not the same as hero worship in my mind. I'm very
*  much in favor of adhering to ideas that make sense. I'm a naturalist. There you go. I'm a
*  many worlds person. You can attach all sorts of isms to me. I think that there's a certain kind
*  of person that says, oh, I don't like isms, but I think that isms are really helpful. If they're
*  well designed and you don't take them overly harshly, that is to say you don't insist that
*  everyone adhere to the rules in some kind of overly precise way, they convey information.
*  When you say someone is a socialist or a fascist or whatever, hopefully information is contained
*  by saying those things. Likewise, with schools of thought of ancient Greece or anywhere else,
*  East Asia or indigenous Americans or whoever, these are philosophies that you are welcome to
*  adhere to if you want to. Now, personally, maybe this is what you're getting at. I wouldn't
*  take these schools of philosophy as looking for the right one, as a set of things that one of them
*  is right and we should figure out which one is right and then follow that. I think that any of
*  them are worth looking at for good ideas. For that matter, religious traditions are also perfectly
*  good sources of good ideas, just as they are sources of bad ideas also. What matters to me
*  is the quality of the idea much more than where it comes from. So if you can read texts from ancient
*  Stoics or for that matter Epicureans or whoever and get good ideas for living your contemporary
*  life, then I think that's great and good for you. Chris says, I think you've talked about morality
*  as being emergent but not scientific. So I'd like to ask how you view these as compatible.
*  It seems by emergent you mean that it's built from things described by the fundamental laws.
*  So if this view is taken for morality, why would that not be investigated scientifically too,
*  like how the emergent physics of fluids is studied scientifically?
*  Wouldn't it seem that either morality is not emergent or it has to be able to be studied
*  scientifically? So certainly I've never said words like morality is not scientific. The words that I
*  might have said are that morality is not a science. You cannot derive moral conclusions from the same
*  way that you can derive scientific conclusions. Namely, you put forward hypotheses and then you
*  test them experimentally. That's how you derive scientific conclusions. That's how you figure out
*  what is the correct scientific point of view. That is because in science there are alternate
*  worlds, alternate possibilities. Like maybe there's a world in which Newtonian mechanics was right.
*  Maybe there's a possible world, not actual worlds necessarily, but hypothetical worlds in which
*  the axion is the dark matter, another hypothetical world in which a weakly interacting massive
*  supersymmetric particle is the dark matter. We're trying to do observations to figure out
*  which world we live in. It's not that one can be driven to the right conclusion just by thinking
*  about it or talking about it. That's just not how morality works. No one is saying, well,
*  here's a moral possibility and here's another moral possibility. Let's do an experiment to see
*  which one fits the data. That's just how it works for morality. So I'm not a moral realist. That's
*  why I don't think that you can study morality scientifically. I do think that morality is part
*  of the level at which we describe the world that is emergent, the level involving human beings and
*  their interactions, because human beings describe the world in moral terms. They say this is good,
*  this action, this is bad, etc. Human beings do that. So it's not fundamental. It's emergent in
*  that sense. But my point about morality is that there's two questions to ask about morality. One
*  is, what are the morals that people have? That question can be studied scientifically. We can
*  say, well, if people have these morals, they will do this or they will say that and then we can go
*  investigate it. The other question is, what are the morals that people should have? That question
*  cannot be investigated scientifically. Different people have different morals. They're going to
*  make them up on the basis of different things and there's no once and for all right answer.
*  Again, scientifically, there's a once and for all right answer, but in morality, there's not.
*  So you can study aspects of morality scientifically, but you can't find the right morality
*  by doing science in the same way that you can find the right dark matter candidate by doing science.
*  Peter Solfest says, when I hear the heat death of the universe described, it is usually described
*  roughly as a giant void with some lonely low energy photons floating around. If that's the
*  case, what would have happened to all the lumps of iron? Are they just not mentioned or is there
*  some decay process that would also wipe them out at some point? It's definitely the decay process.
*  It will take a very, very long time, but even lumps of iron will eventually go away. We don't
*  exactly know how. So one possibility and maybe the most likely, the most popular one, is that
*  protons are not perfectly stable. Protons have never in the real world been observed to decay.
*  There are limits on the proton lifetime that are something like 10 to the 35 years,
*  but there are also theories that predict that the proton lifetime is 10 to the 36 years.
*  So that's very, very plausible that iron nuclei are not perfectly stable. They just decay when
*  the protons decay because the protons would decay into lighter particles that would then
*  fly away. Eventually, that would happen to all the protons and all the neutrons.
*  Once you got rid of some protons in the iron, when I say protons decay, neutrons will also decay.
*  We don't say that because we know that neutrons decay. Neutrons all by themselves out there in
*  the world have a lifetime of something like 10 minutes, but protons observed in the world,
*  as far as we know, are stable, but maybe they're not perfectly. Maybe also those theories, especially
*  grand unified theories in which protons are not stable, are not correct. Again, we have no
*  experimental evidence for them, but even then there is something called gravity, right? So an
*  iron nucleus could, in principle, decay to a black hole, and that black hole would evaporate away.
*  Or maybe we don't know what it would decay into because we don't understand quantum gravity,
*  but there could be some gravity-like process by which the nature of the iron nucleus changes
*  into something else. That would be super, super rare, much slower than the decay of the protons
*  by grand unification or something like that. But the good news is that we know gravity exists,
*  right? So if you wait long enough, it would happen. The iron nucleus would decay into other things.
*  I have no idea how long it will take, but eventually it would happen. And likewise for
*  bigger things like rocks and so forth. All of this is hypothetical. All of this is speculative. We
*  haven't been around for 10 to the 100 years or whatever, but it's based on very straightforward
*  physics. It's pretty solid stuff. I'd be surprised if there were any individual collections of protons
*  and neutrons and so forth that were perfectly stable in our universe. Brendan says, when you
*  write your trade books, do you have a process for determining the right balance between being too
*  technical and being too general? Short answer is no, and a longer answer is that every book is
*  different. In the Biggest Ideas series that I'm writing right now, it's pretty technical. There's
*  a lot of equations in them. From Eternity to Here was not as technical, but it was still a little
*  bit demanding both in physics and philosophy, whereas I think The Big Picture and the Higgs
*  Boson book were less demanding in terms of technicality. Sorry, I should mention something
*  deeply hidden on quantum mechanics along with From Eternity to Here were both a little bit demanding
*  in terms of the concepts being talked about. The Big Picture and the Higgs Boson book were a little
*  bit less demanding, but neither one of them is like quantum mechanics for babies. They're both
*  involving some ideas that are tough to wrap your mind around a little bit. I'm very open to the
*  possibility of someday writing a book that is much less technical or much less demanding than
*  either one of those books were. I don't know whether that would happen or not. I don't have
*  any immediate plans. Maybe the physics of democracy, for example, will work out to be that way. I could
*  make that one technical. I'm not sure about that. I hope not. I hope that's not overly technical.
*  I hope to make it a fun gripping read. That's what I'm always aiming for. So it's more about
*  keeping the level uniform and consistent within a book rather than making any one book aim at some
*  imaginary perfect balance between being too technical and too general. Vladimir Belik says,
*  what are some of the skills that aren't directly related to science but are very useful to have
*  for a professional physicist? For example, I've been wondering if being a good salesman or marketer,
*  in the broadest sense of the term, could be useful for a researcher in physics. Also,
*  thank you very much for the advice you gave regarding giving talks and being engaging,
*  last AMA. So I kept that little lessons in there, Vladimir, because before I read it,
*  I was going to say the single best advice I could give is learn to give good talks.
*  It's right up there. The second best advice is learn to write good papers.
*  The basic advice is that there is science that we do to become a professional physicist,
*  but there's also telling other people what science we have done. And you'd be surprised at how often
*  that how important that is, both for better and for worse. There are very good examples of people
*  saying something in such a compelling way that everyone caught on to it very, very quickly.
*  There are also examples where someone had a good idea and they wrote about it and no one paid
*  attention. And it's not because that person wasn't famous. For other reasons, I was just looking over
*  the transcript of the podcast I did a while back with Leonard Susskind. He's one of the co-inventors,
*  among other great accomplishments. Lenny is one of the co-inventors of the holographic principle.
*  The other co-inventor is Gerard Atouf, another famous Nobel Prize winning scientist. Sorry,
*  Lenny has not won the Nobel Prize, although he's at that level. But Atouf was one of the
*  single most important theoretical physicists of the second half of the 20th century. A huge
*  name in quantum field theory really just revolutionized the field in the 70s.
*  And Lenny tells the story that in some sense, in some very real sense, the holographic principle
*  first appeared in Atouf's paper. And Susskind wrote another paper about it, not knowing about
*  Atouf's paper second, but no one read Atouf's paper because the title of the paper was about
*  dimensional reduction in quantum gravity. And dimensional reduction has a separate meaning to
*  physicists and they didn't think that that was an interesting thing to read about. So just because
*  the title of the paper was not exactly on point, not enough people read and absorbed and understood
*  that crucially important point about the holographic principle, at least according to
*  Lenny's retelling, which I think jibes with my experiences as a very young postdoc at the time.
*  And Atouf is pretty clear, often, he's a very good writer, he's fun to read, and there's many people
*  who are just not good to read at all or fun to read at all. And that affects whether people are
*  going to read your papers, right? Likewise for giving talks, some people, you always want to go
*  to their talks, even if you're not interested in the subject matter, because you know you'll learn
*  something, it'll be fun. And other people, you never want to go to their talks, even though you're
*  super interested in the subject matter. So I think the single most important thing is communication.
*  And I don't want to call that being a salesman or marketer, because that's a slightly different
*  thing. The point of being a salesman, salesperson, is that you want someone to buy your goods.
*  That is disconnected from the question of whether or not your goods are any good.
*  You want people to buy them. So what I'm emphasizing is not selling your goods, but explaining to people
*  what the goods are. Let them decide whether or not they're interesting or not. That's what I think
*  is the most important other skill. Flyingwaffle says, aren't superfluidity and superconductivity
*  examples of strong emergence? I.e. to understand those systems from a macroscopic point of view,
*  we can't just break them down into the behavior of individual particles. So I know what you mean,
*  but no, I do not think that these are examples of strong emergence. And for those who are not quite
*  following along, the idea of strong emergence is that you can't just take a microscopic theory,
*  right? A theory of the fundamental constituents of a thing, put it on a computer, and let it run.
*  That would be, if that process, if that procedure did tell you always exactly,
*  correctly what happened, there might be weak emergence. There might be a way of talking about
*  the system at a higher level, but still the way of talking about it at the lower level is complete
*  and comprehensive and gives you everything. That's weak emergence. Strong emergence says that you
*  can't just do that. You cannot just take the microscopic theory, simulate it, and get the
*  right answer because something new comes in at the macroscopic level. So in quantum mechanics,
*  the world is not made up of little things. That's just not how quantum mechanics works
*  at the fundamental level. There is one wave function for the whole universe, and usually
*  you can get away with ignoring that, or let's say either think of things as truly separate or
*  separate but entangled with each other. In the examples of superfluidity and superconductivity,
*  you can't do that. You really need to take seriously the fact that there is just one
*  wave function for the whole system. So that might seem to be a challenge to the idea of weak
*  emergence, but I think it's a fake challenge because I think that most people who think about
*  emergence are not really familiar enough with quantum mechanics as they should be, and they
*  make this mistake of conflating the idea of a microscopic theory with a theory of microscopic
*  things. To my mind, a microscopic theory is just the more comprehensive theory. It's the
*  theory that works in a wider domain of applicability, including ones where individual
*  systems are microscopic, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the system is comprised of little pieces.
*  So I just think that there's a sloppiness in the way that many people define what is meant by
*  emergence. If you define it in the conventional way with little pieces making up big things,
*  no quantum mechanical system counts as being emergent. I think that's just a mistake because
*  people are still embedded in a classical way of thinking. I haven't actually written this up. I've
*  been writing about this for a little while, but I haven't actually completed a paper or anything
*  like that, but we're working on it. We're trying to get there. But I think that the fundamental
*  issue of strong emergence is not about quantum mechanics versus classical mechanics. So superfluidity
*  and superconductivity don't really qualify as what the people who like strong
*  immersions really want to be talking about. Tim Kennedy says, at the very end of a black
*  hole evaporating, does it explode in a blaze of glory? And if so, is it at all similar to the
*  Big Bang, given there will be pretty much nothing around it? It does explode, but it's not much of
*  a blaze of glory. The black hole gets smaller and smaller over a tremendously long period of time,
*  and as it gets smaller, it gets hotter. So its rate of evaporation increases. And you can go
*  down to the Planck scale, right? And that's the last burst of energy is when the black hole is
*  down to the Planck scale. And you can calculate how much energy is given off when a Planck scale
*  thing explodes. It's not that much. It's like a grenade going off, if I remember correctly.
*  I haven't thought about this in a long time, so I might be misremembering, but it's not some big
*  world-shattering kind of thing, because most of the energy has already been transported away much
*  earlier. Eric Stromquist says, the universe appears roughly homogeneous and isotropic,
*  reflecting the translational and rotational symmetries of physics. However, the third
*  spacetime symmetry of Lorentz symmetry seems observationally broken by there being a preferred
*  inertial frame, for example, that of the CMB or even the ordinary matter of the nearby universe.
*  My question is, what is the significance of this, and in particular, is the existence of a preferred
*  frame related to concerns raised about exactness and fundamentality of Lorentz symmetry? I've never
*  seen any doubts raised about either translational or rotational symmetry in the laws of physics.
*  I wanted to answer this question not because I have any great wisdom about it, but because I have
*  written papers about violating translational and rotational symmetry with Mark Wise and some other
*  collaborators, Lottie Ackerman and Chenyao Zheng. We wrote papers on violating rotational invariance
*  or translational invariance during inflation, so how would you see the impact of that in the cosmic
*  microwave background? But I don't think it's likely that that's true. We just wanted to figure out,
*  this is a very common thing to do in physics. We said, if it's true, how would you know? So now
*  people can go and look in the microwave background, because they weren't looking before our papers came
*  out. But the basic question, I think, is an interesting one, but I don't have a pithy answer
*  to it. I do think that it is a fact that our universe seems to have a preferred, at least
*  approximately preferred, rest frame, being at rest with respect to the cosmic microwave background.
*  And in fact, this was an issue in the early days of inflationary cosmology. People pointed out
*  that a lot of the models that people were throwing around had perfect Lorentz invariance during
*  inflation. Basically something that was De Sitter space, not quite Lorentz invariance, but at least
*  no preferred rest frame. Sorry about all the jargon words here, but no preferred rest frame
*  during inflation, and then one somehow got established when inflation ended. And that
*  didn't quite make sense. And there is a resolution to this problem, and the resolution is basically
*  that it's not ever perfectly free of a preferred rest frame. There is always during inflation,
*  some inflaton field doing the inflating, and that field does pick out a preferred rest frame.
*  Now, why was it ever there? That I don't know. That's a more difficult one. It was always there,
*  as far as we know, so it's not a matter of creating it, such as understanding why it was always there.
*  But I don't think that that's a puzzle that people have really thought about very carefully. So
*  sorry about that. No helpful answers for that one. John says, thanks for answering my question
*  about positronium during a previous AMA. I have a follow-up. You said that positronium and hydrogen
*  don't have the same spectrum because of the difference in mass between a proton and a positron.
*  This must involve gravity, right? No, it has nothing to do with gravity. Mass has something
*  to do with gravity, that's true, but mass also just has something to do with inertia, right?
*  I mean, the idea of mass is there in F equals MA, Newton's second law, even if the F has nothing to
*  do with gravity. It's just a matter of the average energies or the total energies involved
*  in binding two particles together with different masses. The energies all come from the
*  electromagnetic force. There's a little bit of quantum mechanical play there, but the
*  electromagnetism is the force that is holding together the proton and the electron or the
*  positron and the electron. Gravity has nothing to do with it. Jesse Rimmler says, in the realm of
*  foreign policy, do you agree with the principle that it is most important for a citizen to be
*  critical of the actions of their own state? Well, I think that's a little bit too vague to be a
*  principle that I agree with. Most important in the universe, the most important thing ever written
*  down. Maybe what you mean is it's more important to be critical of one's own state than of other
*  states. I don't even agree with that. What I would like is just to be correctly critical of everybody.
*  I do think that in practice, so not in principle, but in practice, one tends to know more about
*  the pros and cons of one's own state. I do think that maybe the implication is you don't want to
*  give your own state a free ride just because it's yours. That I agree with, yes, absolutely.
*  But there's no idea, I would not agree with an idea that until I fix all of my own state's problems,
*  I'm not allowed to criticize other states. I think that's going too far. Frank Layman says,
*  what do you make of the academic job market for recent PhDs in STEM or any other fields?
*  Are the woes that come with it these days reflective of a profound shift in the prospects
*  for young scholars, or was it ever thus? It's always very hard for me to tell, to be very
*  honest, about questions like this. There are some numbers and data out there, but there's a lot more
*  feelings. People's feelings are inevitably shaped by their own personal circumstances and what
*  they're familiar with. I recognize that, and therefore, I'm going to try not to project my
*  own feelings onto things like that. The job market is not very good in the sense that there's always
*  many more people who want to be professors than there are jobs for professors. That's true.
*  That's a weird kind of thing to complain about. If the number of jobs stayed the same,
*  but suddenly overnight twice as many people wanted those jobs, suddenly the job market is a lot worse,
*  but it doesn't reflect some flaw in the system or anything like that. The job market for PhDs is
*  much better than the job market for NBA basketball players. Many, many, many more people want to be
*  basketball players and would get hired doing that. I think that's kind of the wrong way to look at
*  the problem. Frank, in part that I didn't read of his question, he mentions adjuncts. That's a
*  problem. For those of you who are not in academia, there's an increasing reliance at many colleges
*  and universities on not having the professors teach most of the courses, but not having the
*  full-time professors teach most of the courses, but rather bringing in part-time adjunct professors,
*  people who don't have tenure, who are not on tenure track, who have no chance of being promoted
*  or anything like that, who have no time or resources to do research. They're just basically hired
*  guns to teach a course. I can imagine that on occasion that might be a useful thing for
*  university to do, but it's way, way overdone in the current market. I don't worry about the
*  overproduction of PhDs because I think that getting PhDs is a good thing. It's an individual choice.
*  I think that people coming into PhD programs and applying for them should be told in no uncertain
*  terms what the job market is like. I've gotten flak actually from my colleagues because sometimes
*  I'm too honest about the difficulties of the job market. They're like, no, you should be encouraging
*  the young people. I don't want to encourage young people. I want to be honest with the young people.
*  If that encourages them, that's great, but I'm not encouraging them for the sake of encouraging them.
*  I want people to know what the situation really is. The situation really is that the vast majority
*  of people who get PhDs are not going to become tenured professors someday, but if they still want
*  to get a PhD knowing that, I think that's awesome. I think that's great and we should allow them to
*  do it. I actually think there's an overproduction of postdocs, if you ask me. There's postdoctoral
*  thing. If you're a PhD student, the thing you do next is you apply for postdocs, at least in
*  scientific fields, and then eventually you become a faculty member. That's great if you do succeed
*  at eventually becoming a faculty member because it means that you've had some time to practice and
*  do research without all the extra burdens of being a faculty member, etc. But very often,
*  people don't only just get a PhD but then spend what, six, nine, ten years as a postdoc and then
*  still don't get a faculty job. That, I think, is much, much less justifiable from the point of view
*  of that researcher because getting a PhD is clearly, like I said, a good thing. It trains you,
*  it gives you some credential, etc. The extra marginal benefit of being a postdoc for eight
*  years is very tiny in my mind, unless you go on to become a professor, in which case it can be
*  substantial, but for other jobs, it's very tiny. I don't think the problem is overproduction of PhDs.
*  The problem is that we let PhDs linger around without giving them permanent jobs. I think that's
*  the problem. Carlos Nunes says, do you have a specific argument for why you don't want to
*  have kids? Are you familiar with the philosopher David Benatar? And if so, what's your opinion on
*  his anti-natalist view? Benatar argues that we should avoid bringing more people into this world
*  due to the inherent suffering of being alive. So I think that Benatar's argument is very wrong,
*  from my point of view. I do not think that there is inherent suffering of being alive. I kind of
*  think being alive is pretty awesome. It has its ups and downs, but I think that's part of it being
*  awesome. If there weren't downs, we wouldn't appreciate the ups as much, to vastly oversimplify
*  a very complicated set of issues. I just don't want to have kids. That's it. It's not a deep
*  philosophical position. I have other things to do. I have other things that I want to spend my time
*  doing. People are some of my best friends. They have kids. It's great. I don't actually mind kids
*  as such. It's just that with my lifestyle, with what I want to do, I would like to put my time and
*  resources elsewhere. I think it would be terrible to be a parent and then not spend time, spend
*  effort, spend resources being with your kids. And I don't really have the resources to do that myself.
*  Justin Walcott says, my five-year-old son Nicholas, see there's a good kid right here. Nicholas, I'm
*  sure is an awesome five-year-old kid. Nicholas and his friends at school are debating whether
*  infinity is the largest number or not. Nicholas says, it can't be since it's not a number because
*  infinity plus one equals infinity. Very good for Nicholas. But sadly, the answer to this is it
*  depends. I mean, obviously, as soon as you ask this question, you're going to know that the answer is
*  it depends on what you mean by number. So there are systems of numbers like the integers where
*  infinity is not a number. Infinity is not an integer because like you say, infinity plus one is not
*  is still equal to infinity. But there are other systems of numbers that are bigger than the
*  integers and you can add infinity and include that in your system of numbers. You have to change a
*  little bit the rules for what happens when you add numbers to each other, etc. But the point is,
*  depending on how you define number, you can accommodate infinity, but you don't have to.
*  Not a perfectly satisfying answer, but it should inspire you to go Google around different systems
*  of numbers and how infinity fits into them. Joseph Williams says, do you think our seemingly
*  advanced mathematical abilities, along with our appreciation of the beauty and elegance of math,
*  is an involved trait? If so, why and how? Well, in some sense, everything is an evolved trait.
*  All of our traits are evolved, right? So in that sense, sure. I would also kind of question the
*  assumptions of the question. I don't think our mathematical abilities are all that advanced.
*  You know, compared to cats, the mathematical abilities of humans are quite advanced. But,
*  I make mistakes all the time doing math, even in elementary arithmetic. So I'm hesitant to give
*  myself a lot of credit for advanced mathematical ability. So the real question is, is there some,
*  I think what you mean by the question, is there some adaptive advantage to having much more
*  mathematical ability than a cat has, right? Or than a chimpanzee? Well, I tend to think probably not.
*  I mean, there might be an advantage, but I don't think that the use of mathematics has
*  arisen sufficiently long ago in evolutionary history that that particular trait was selected
*  for. You know what I mean? A lot of things that we're able to do, we're able to do just sort of
*  as a side effect of some of our features or traits or whatever you want to call them, being selected
*  for completely other reasons. So I can easily imagine that our brains developed in certain ways
*  and those developments were evolutionarily advantageous. And as a side effect, we got
*  better at doing math. I suspect it's more like that. I cannot imagine really that a lot of,
*  you know, group theory or differential geometry was useful to hunter-gatherers on the plains
*  tens of thousands of years ago. Richard Cajdan says, I have a serious problem with the way people
*  always seem to talk about simulation theory, the idea that we are living in a simulated universe.
*  They generally say that the universe is 13 billion years old and therefore there is plenty of time
*  for civilizations to grow up to the point that they can build simulations and therefore the
*  probability is that we are in a simulation because there would be many more simulated
*  universes than the one original universe. I wonder if you would agree with me that this argument is
*  nonsense because we have no clue how old the actual universe is. All we would know is that our
*  simulated universe feeds us signals and clues to make us conclude that if our universe were real,
*  it started with the Big Bang some number of years ago. What does that have to do with how and when
*  the real universe started? So there's two things going on here. One is, is it conceivable or likely
*  that if we are in a simulation, the simulators have tricked us into thinking that the universe
*  is 14 billion years old when it's really not? So that is possible, but I think it's not likely,
*  and I'll explain why. So it's completely possible. You could arrange it goes back to what we were
*  saying about the low entropy of the Big Bang vis-a-vis the smoothness of the cosmic microwave
*  background, right? In some sense, what you're thinking about is the simulators are tricking
*  us into thinking that there was a low entropy Big Bang 14 billion years ago because the cosmic
*  microwave background is smooth, but they could easily set up a radiation bath near our telescopes
*  here that would trick us into thinking that, okay? Except, even though it's possible, it's not the
*  best way to do it. It's not the simplest or algorithmically most straightforward way to do it.
*  If you wanted to make us think that the universe was that old, you would just simulate the whole
*  universe because the starting point is enormously simpler, right? The starting point of a hot Big
*  Bang that is smooth and dense and rapidly expanding, that's easy to put into your computer.
*  All of the specific details about the universe today in order to match that very simple beginning
*  are incredibly complicated. You're asking your computer simulator to do much more work than is
*  necessary if you want to make them trick us into thinking the universe is old. Now, maybe they want
*  to do that. It's possible. Sure, it's possible, but I'm just saying that it's not the sensible way to
*  do it. If you think that our simulators are very smart, then they would just run from the Big Bang
*  onward. But more importantly, for your actual question, I think that your logic is a little bit
*  shaky here, Richard, because basically what you're saying is if we live in a simulation,
*  then the universe might not be 14 billion years old. Sure, that's true, but the argument is supposed
*  to be that if we don't live in a simulation, we could still build a lot of other simulations,
*  and therefore there would still be a lot of people living in simulations. And then the question
*  comes about why aren't we one of them, right? I don't agree with that argument, to be honest,
*  but not for this reason, because basically you're already assuming that we live in a simulation,
*  so they've already won by the standards of your version of the argument. So I don't think that
*  that's a good objection to the simulation argument. Casey Mahone says, sometimes I find it really odd
*  that I happen to be born human. After all, it seems far more likely that I'd be born a bacteria
*  or an insect. Of course, the answer is that someone had to be me, but that feels unsatisfying. Can you
*  offer any insight? Maybe. So this is actually related to what I just said, why I don't believe
*  the real, the regular simulation argument, because there's a presumption, a premise of this kind of
*  reasoning that said that somehow there is this thing called I, me, myself, right, that had some
*  probability of being some thing in the universe. And if that probability was equal with all kinds
*  of things, then there's a lot more bacteria or insects than there are human beings. I mean,
*  clearly, just by saying it out loud, by spelling it out loud, I hope the craziness of that chain
*  of reasoning becomes clear. There is no you that exists outside your physical body that becomes
*  embodied in either a bacterium or an insect or a human being. That's just not the way it works.
*  What happens is that a lot of bacteria and a lot of insects and a lot of human beings come into being
*  through the physical evolution of the universe and the biological evolution of the species.
*  And there's just no sense in which you are randomly selected from all possible living beings. Why would
*  we ever think that, right? And this is why I think that a lot of anthropic reasoning is incorrect,
*  that we somehow tend to reason as if that were the case. But it really, it just isn't. You're just you.
*  There's nothing to be explained there. There's no sense in which you could have been someone
*  other than you. Someone else could be someone other than you. And in fact, if you took a vote
*  among all the bacteria and all the insects and all the human beings in the world, which one of them,
*  how many of them are bacteria, they'd mostly be bacteria. That's true. But all the humans would
*  say that they're human. That's just how it works. Igor Velotic says, in what way has conversation
*  with Justin Clark-Done affected the way in which you think about the reality slash objectivity
*  of mathematics? So yeah, I've been continuing to talk to Justin, who was on the podcast a little
*  while ago, who's an expert on these foundations of mathematics questions. And he hasn't convinced me
*  yet. I'm not a mathematical realist. I'm a reality realist. I think that the physical world
*  exists and that mathematics is something that we human beings use to talk about the physical world.
*  I don't want to go into all of the details, but let me just say sort of one thing that Justin keeps
*  saying and one thing that I keep worrying about. The thing that Justin keeps saying is, it's not
*  an original argument with him, but it's one of the arguments for mathematical realism is
*  we need to believe in the consistency of our theories. If you make a statement like the
*  standard model predicts the following result, you believe that there are predictions of the standard
*  model, which is to say that you believe that the theory itself is consistent. It doesn't predict
*  everything. If you have an inconsistent mathematical formalism, it can predict anything.
*  So you have to assume that your systems are consistent in order to do science, etc.
*  But making statements about consistency of theories is a higher level thing that you can't
*  prove. This is a consequence of Gödel's theorem and subsequent work in mathematics. You can't prove
*  the consistency of your theories. In fact, you could choose to add extra axioms to sufficiently
*  powerful theories that either say, and this axiom system is consistent and it's not consistent.
*  Okay, so the argument is that you have to accept in order to believe in the consistency of your
*  theory, you have to accept some extra non-provable fact about the theory, namely that it is consistent.
*  And since that's not provable, you're basically accepting some mathematically real fact that just
*  exists as truth. Okay, I don't quite buy that argument because I don't quite think that,
*  I mean, I think I can just assume my system is consistent and keep using it without accepting
*  the existence of some objective fact of the matter outside of human invention about whether it is
*  consistent or not. But I'm not 100% certain about that. So that's the thing I wanted to say about
*  my own point of view is that if I were to criticize myself, I would say that in some sense,
*  I want my cake and eat it too. I want to be able to use math and trust it and think that, you know,
*  if people in a completely different physical reality had invented arithmetic, they would still
*  think that the twin prime conjecture is either true or false in that world, while still not
*  believing that it's a separate part of reality, right? I want the math to be true but not real.
*  And I think that is a distinction worth drawing, but I couldn't actually promise you that it's
*  worth drawing. So maybe eventually I have to give in. I'm not sure about that. But I do think that
*  people are using words like realism and existence a slightly different ways when they talk about
*  these different things. That's the heart of my objection. Chris Murray says,
*  when planning to dine at a very expensive restaurant, how do you prepare? Besides
*  dressing for the occasion, are there other steps you take? This is a fun question, but the answer
*  is no. There's really no other steps that I take. I do think it's nice to dress nicely when you go
*  to a nice restaurant. But some people will try to like check out the menu online, see what is going
*  on. Other than sharing some food allergies with the restaurant ahead of time, I just like to show
*  up and have no spoilers ahead of time, right? See what's going to happen. Different restaurants
*  are very different. There's some fine dining restaurants that are still following the paradigm
*  of appetizer entree dessert. Others have like 20 little tiny courses that are one bite each and
*  things like that. So there's many ways that the paradigm can work. And that's part of the
*  playfulness and part of the fun of it. Some are very stuffy and formal. Some are much more
*  playful, et cetera. And so I just like to wallow in the experience, let it happen. I don't do any
*  preparations. Now, Jimmy Summer says, I was reading a quanta article and it said that when speaking
*  about space-time emerging from quantum mechanics, you could essentially construct an equivalent
*  theory where quantum mechanics instead emerges from space-time. So in that construction, space-time
*  is ontological and everything else is emergent rather than the other way around. And these
*  emergent theories based on correspondences, it would be difficult to know which way reality is
*  actually set up. Does this make any sense or am I misunderstanding this or is this just wrong?
*  I'm not exactly sure what was being referred to in the quanta article here. Probably it's
*  referring to ADS-CFT, which is this correspondence between quantum gravity in anti-desider space,
*  that's ADS, anti-desider space, and quantum field theory without gravity in one dimension lower,
*  that's the CFT, conformal field theory, CFT. And the CFT side of the duality, the idea behind the
*  duality is that these two theories are supposed to be equivalent to each other. You can start
*  with one and derive the other or vice versa. But the fact is the CFT side of the ledger,
*  where there is no gravity, is much easier to define rigorously. And so in practice,
*  when you really want a full description of the theory, you start with the CFT and you derive
*  the quantum gravity side from it as an emergent holographic phenomenon because the quantum gravity
*  side has one more dimension of spacetime than the conformal field theory side does. And I'm not even
*  sure that the gravity side by itself has a full rigorous description. So I'm not quite sure this
*  really is a duality. I'm not a super expert here, but there's been enough mumblings in talks that
*  I've gone to and papers I've read to make me a little suspicious that there's a full 100%
*  super accurate correspondence between conformal field theories and anti-dissident space quantum
*  gravity. I think that there's probably a restricted correspondence in the sense that many emergent
*  descriptions are, right? There's a domain of applicability for them that does not extend over
*  the complete theory. But anyway, both of these sides of the duality are quantum mechanical,
*  and both of them also have spacetime. The difference is that one side has gravity
*  and the other doesn't. Okay, so if that is what is being referred to by the article that you read,
*  I would certainly not say that you derive quantum mechanics from spacetime. You derive spacetime
*  from quantum mechanics either way that you go. But maybe I'm missing it. Maybe I'm not maybe
*  referring to some other idea. I don't see any possible way that you could get quantum mechanics
*  to emerge from spacetime. Spacetime is classical. I mean, when you say spacetime, you need to have a
*  theory of what spacetime does like Einstein's general relativity or whatever. That's a classical
*  theory. You're not going to get quantum mechanics to emerge from that as far as I could tell.
*  David de Kloet says, in your recent talk about the arrow of time, this is referring to the
*  talk I gave at Berkeley at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. It's amazing that
*  I was invited to give a talk at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, giving
*  that I know nothing about the theory of computing. But there was a workshop there at the time on
*  causality. And I know a tiny bit about causality, much less than most of the other people there.
*  But I know a lot about the arrow of time. So I could talk about the arrow of time and causality.
*  So in this talk, David goes on to ask, you mentioned that we believe that entropy was
*  low in the past because of a very strong bias in our brains and that without the past hypothesis,
*  it's much more likely that air molecules randomly push the wine glass off the desk than your swinging
*  arm did. But now that we know that we're biased, shouldn't we correct for our bias and choose to
*  believe whatever we know to be more likely? Given that we know we're biased, why should we
*  continue to believe the past hypothesis? Well, this is a case where bias is a good thing because
*  our bias is correct. Or our bias is certainly, yeah, our bias is correct. Let's just put it that way.
*  And this is an argument, I've talked about it before, but it's articulated most clearly in my
*  paper called Why Boltzmann Brains Are Bad. The point is that if you didn't have the past hypothesis,
*  you only had, let's grant you some information about the current universe. You know, we could
*  argue in detail about what you would know and not know about the current universe if there were no
*  arrow of time, but let's just say you know the current universe. But there's no past hypothesis
*  so that you extrapolate from the current state into both the past and the future, and the entropy
*  increases in both directions. That's what you would predict if you didn't have the past hypothesis.
*  But as a result of that, what you're saying is, is that your current moment, including your current
*  self, are the results of a random unlikely fluctuation downward in entropy from a high
*  entropy past. And that's very possible. But what it means is that the stuff inside your brain,
*  not only your knowledge of the past, but all your knowledge of physics and logic and math and reason,
*  just randomly fluctuated into existence. And it's equally possible for incorrect ideas to fluctuate
*  into your brain randomly as for correct ideas. In fact, honestly, it's way easier to fluctuate a wrong
*  idea than to fluctuate a correct idea randomly into your head. So the point being that if you
*  accepted that past view of the universe, if you accepted that history of our universe, you would
*  have no reason to accept the past history of the universe, because you would have no reason to accept
*  your own views on anything at all. So this is cognitively unstable, this point of view. This
*  is a point of view which you cannot simultaneously hold and believe you have good reason for holding,
*  because in virtue of holding that view, you shouldn't believe that view. Okay. So therefore,
*  the way to get out of it is just to say, I don't believe that view. You can say, look, maybe it's
*  true, just like maybe we're a brain in a vat or being taunted by an evil demon, like any other
*  skeptical hypothesis, but it's no way to go through life. In order to have a view of the universe that
*  makes sense and makes it possible to make progress, etc. You have to assume the past hypothesis. And
*  then you check it. You say, okay, I assume that the entropy was low in the early universe. And then
*  you look at our maps of the microwave background and so forth. And you go, yes, this is consistent
*  with that assumption I made, I think I'm on the right track. That's how it works.
*  Rue Phillips says, Can you please expand on the meaning of it from bit that John Archibald
*  Wheeler said decades ago, Chalmers seems to take it quite literally in his latest book on virtual
*  worlds. What's the real insight here? And how speculative is it? Well, I don't know. It's the
*  short answer. John Wheeler famously was better at coining pithy, provocative phrases than at
*  spelling out all the details of the implications for these phrases. So it from bit is probably
*  his most inscrutable phrase. In some sense, what it's supposed to mean is that information is key
*  to understanding what happens in the universe, rather than thinking of the world as just stuff
*  it right bumping into each other. Think about the information contained in that stuff. And the
*  implication would be that if you had very different stuff, but following the same pattern,
*  containing the same information, standing in the same relation to other stuff in the universe,
*  then it would for all intents and purposes qualify as the same thing going on.
*  So a down to earth way of saying this is the substrate independence of consciousness or
*  cognition. It doesn't matter in this point of view, if it's in a computer or in a brain or whatever,
*  if the same kinds of information processing events are happening, they are equivalent to each other.
*  So it's not a principle that you can test or anything like that. It's a perspective that you
*  can take on what is going on in the world. So you can take it quite literally or not. I mean,
*  I think that if you're careful, there are both differences and similarities between what happens
*  in a biological brain and what happens in a computer. For some purposes, the differences
*  will matter. For some, they will not. And I'm not trying to dismiss the question. I think these are
*  very important questions, but I think that a pithy slogan is not going to be the final word
*  on those questions. Brian Tidmore says, my 12 year old son has stated that he wants to invent
*  teleportation. I explained to him why it's impossible, delved a little into the physics
*  of what we know of matter and how the universe has rules, but I felt my answer was discouraging him.
*  What are your thoughts on encouraging creativity and interest in science, but keeping a young mind
*  grounded in reality? This is a great question. And you know, it doesn't stop when your son is
*  12 years old. It works with graduate students and postdocs and even colleagues and maybe even
*  yourself. Going on that line between explaining why something doesn't sound to you like a good idea,
*  while still encouraging them to try. I mean, I think everyone, certainly I, everyone who has
*  gone up through theoretical physics has had this experience of having an idea, taking it to some
*  wiser elder person, running it by them and being told why it wouldn't work and believing them and
*  going away and then realizing either because you figured it out or because someone else scooped you
*  on it, that it would have worked if you had just tried harder on it. So in my own role, sometimes
*  as an advisor or something, I try to have exactly this balance between saying, well, you know, here's
*  the problems with that idea, but I don't want to discourage you. And then sometimes you just got to
*  discourage them because the idea is so obviously wrong that you think it's not worth it. And that's
*  a risk. This is just the risk of doing science. But okay, at the level of talking to a 12 year old,
*  you know, for one thing, are you sure the teleportation is impossible?
*  You know, I get that there are very good arguments for it. How well do we know that those
*  arguments are true? How well do we know that energy is conserved or that information cannot
*  travel faster than the speed of light? These are things that we know that we that we think we know.
*  And in fact, I think that they're probably true in some construal of them. But you can ask how well
*  we know why do we know, right? And also, you can sort of steer from the original idea to a related
*  idea, like, okay, why do you want to invent teleportation? What's important about that?
*  Given the constraints of physics, as we currently understand it, maybe the original idea didn't work,
*  but maybe there's some other idea that does the job just as well or is more interesting.
*  You can explain that, okay, here's what we are able to do. Here's what people are thinking about now.
*  You know, here are ways to get around very fast from place to place. You can talk about wormholes,
*  for example. You could talk about quantum teleportation, all the things you can just
*  Google. I'm not going to explain them all right now. But you can say, look, there are things we
*  think we understand quite well. There are things that we don't understand nearly as well. Sometimes
*  it's a little tricky to clearly discern the boundary between them. And so, you know, encourage
*  him to go look it up and think about it. And the other thing is that this is just inevitable. And
*  I don't know any way around this. To really understand what's going on in these issues,
*  right, deeply into the heart of physics, it takes time. It takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of
*  prerequisites where you have to learn things and a lot of math is involved. And that can be
*  really discouraging. When you're 12 years old, you want to skip to the answer. You don't want to
*  learn differential geometry and quantum field theory. You want to know why you can't build a
*  teleportation device. And that's very, very, very frustrating. At some level, you just have to be
*  honest and say, sorry, you have to learn all this stuff. At the other level, you can say, look,
*  your good news is there's all this stuff that you get to learn. And other people have already
*  figured it out. So you don't have to invent it for yourself. You can just learn it. And it's
*  possible to do and it will take time, but it's enormously fun and rewarding to do that. So you
*  have to preach a little patience. You have to look for the chinks in the armor of what you think is
*  true. And you have to encourage people to really think through the ways in which their crazy ideas
*  may or may not work. And then, you know, there's a crucial divergence at some point in the young
*  person's life where they decide to become a scientist and really think about things and
*  give up on some favorite ideas when they don't work out but still keep working on others if
*  they're promising, or they become a crackpot. And the difference is that the crackpots don't listen
*  and learn. The crackpots have zero interest in learning from you. They think they know the
*  answer already and they just want to tell you. And that's what you want to avoid, letting your
*  children become. Don't, mama, don't let your babies grow up to be crackpots. Encourage them to keep
*  learning, to accept that their ideas might not be right, but maybe they can make them better
*  by working on them, learning more and listening to others and thinking about it all.
*  Vicintas Morkvenas says, do you have any handcraft hobbies? No, is the short answer. I don't even have
*  that many hobbies. I don't know what counts as a hobby. You know, a lot of my time is spent either
*  thinking or talking or writing about physics and philosophy and other ideas out there in the world.
*  And I like it that way. I'm not going to apologize for that. I'm very, very fortunate to be in a
*  situation where I can do this and an enormous amount of my energy goes into doing it and I get
*  paid to do it. It's my job. I have a job title, you know? So no complaints about that. But not a lot
*  of time do I spend on, you know, puttering around, building things or whatever. I have painted in the
*  past. I was never any good at that. As I mentioned earlier on the podcast, I bought a bass guitar
*  during the pandemic. I still have every plan to learn that, but it's been slowed down by other
*  obligations. Maybe after I move to Baltimore, we'll have a music room, who knows? But building things
*  or creating things or, you know, quilting or crocheting and things like that. No, I've never
*  really taken that up. Let a thousand flowers bloom. Let people do different things. I love it when
*  people do it. So, but I can't offer any wisdom from my own perspective. Ray Fucillo says,
*  doesn't the holographic principle place an upper bound on the size of the universe? I've heard you
*  say the universe may be infinite, but it seems that at some large size, there'd be insufficient
*  space on the boundary to account for the density of information that we observe around us,
*  since the surface to volume ratio decreases with size. So, no, not quite. The trick is that there's
*  less information around us than you think. So the holographic principle says that if I have a region
*  of space and I surround it by a boundary, the amount of information inside the region, the amount
*  of information characterizing the region itself, can be encoded or is no greater than
*  the area of the boundary as measured in Planck units. So you don't need a very big region
*  before there are far fewer Planck units on the boundary than there are Planck volumes in the
*  region. Okay? But the point is of the holographic principle that what is happening in all those
*  parts of the region of space is not independent. What's going on in one region is sort of
*  redundantly encoded with what's going on in other regions. That's the only reason holography is
*  possible. Now, you have to understand that the Planck length, the Planck volume, the Planck area,
*  these are really, really tiny. So you can fit a lot of information on a Planck-sized boundary
*  surface around you. So the limitations of doing that in terms of what you see around you literally,
*  like planets and stars and galaxies, that is nowhere close to saturating the amount of
*  information that you can encode on the boundary according to the holographic principle. Rafael
*  Busso has nicely formulated the holographic principle in a completely rigorous way, and it
*  works differently in different kinds of cosmological space times. If you have a
*  sufficiently rapidly expanding universe, then there's sort of no limit to the amount of
*  information you can put on because it's really not when you technically go into it, it's not
*  about the area of the boundary. It's about the, well, sorry, it is the relationship is not between
*  the area of the boundary and the information inside. It's between the area of the boundary
*  and the information that ultimately flows through the future light cone of that region.
*  But that future light cone can be infinitely big if you live in an expanding universe of the right
*  form. So there's tricky subtleties there. But anyway, the short answer is no, there's no
*  upper bound on the size of the universe. In Minkowski space, where there's no expansion of
*  the universe, it can be infinitely big, holographic principle can still apply, no problem.
*  Jonathan Goodson says, when I see two particles exchange a photon on a Feynman diagram, it looks
*  like it's a simple matter for the photon to find the target particle. But given their size, their
*  spatial separation and the fact that the photon could be emitted in any direction, the exchange
*  seems extraordinarily unlikely. Is the photons trajectory constrained by an electromagnetic field?
*  And if not, how do we account for its incredible navigation skills? So yeah, in that first question,
*  you're sort of, you're almost there in getting the right answer. Remember, the world is not made of
*  particles, the world is made of fields. So particles are a convenient way to talk about what we see
*  when we observe the quantum fields, the tiny fluctuation vibration, the field looks like a
*  particle. And even better, Feynman discovered that we can talk about the interactions between the
*  fields in terms of an infinite number of particles that we're summing over. So when you see that
*  image in a Feynman diagram of a particle being exchanged between two different particles,
*  a virtual particle, right, that's a shorthand for vibrations in the fields. And the fields are
*  everywhere. The particles look like they live on some line on some world line traveling from one
*  place to another. But it's a representation of what is actually happening in the field and the
*  field is everywhere. So the field doesn't have to find the target particle, every little vibration
*  in one field is sort of sympathetically causing vibrations in all the other fields, and all of
*  their combined feedbacks lead to these interactions that you're talking about. So you just have to
*  keep in mind that Feynman diagrams are just shorthand for what quantum fields are actually
*  doing. Kunal Menda says, how do you envision the many worlds interpretation winning out? Will it
*  forever be an argument based on parsimony? Or are there any experimental findings that might help us?
*  Well, I think both, you know, I mean, I think that many worlds is both simple and it fits the data.
*  And if that continues, then it will look good for many worlds. But there's two other things that
*  will happen. One is that there's also the question of fruitfulness. You know, Thomas Kuhn, long after
*  he had done his famous book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, where he talked about
*  paradigm shifts and so forth, he was accused of being a relativist about scientific truth,
*  and he wasn't. So he explained in a later paper that, you know, there's absolutely criteria that
*  we use to choose between scientific theories. The problem is that the criteria are not quite
*  an algorithm. There's different criteria that weigh differently. And one of them is the fruitfulness
*  of an idea. So I think that what will really cause people to get on the many worlds bandwagon is when
*  you can make some money with many worlds, when you can use that perspective to understand other
*  puzzles in physics, like quantum gravity, for example. So that's exactly what I am trying to do.
*  So if you show that the many worlds perspective is really, really useful, I mean, arguably,
*  it helped lead to the invention of quantum computers with David Deutsch and others. So that's
*  already a useful version of it. But if you can keep showing that it is the most productive way
*  of thinking about quantum mechanics, then people will begin to accept it more. But on the question
*  of experimental findings, you know, that's where you're going to be able to distinguish between
*  many worlds and other competitors, like pilot wave theories or whatever. Well, it's not the only way.
*  I suspect that other versions of quantum mechanics just don't make sense. Ultimately,
*  pilot wave theories or objective collapse theories, I think that they're ultimately ill-defined,
*  especially in the context of quantum gravity, they always help themselves to some pre-existing
*  classical notion of location and space and things like that, which won't be appropriate once you
*  quantize gravity. So support for those alternatives might just wither away anyway. But I would love to
*  be able to find experimental differences. There are obvious experimental differences between many
*  worlds and objective collapse theories. And those experiments are ongoing. People are looking for
*  evidence of objective collapses. They haven't found any yet, but who knows? Eventually, hopefully,
*  they will be able to rule out all of the promising models. For pilot wave theories, there is this
*  idea, there's a claim that there are no differences in the predictions between pilot wave theories and
*  many worlds. I'm a little skeptical of that claim. It's a theorem that you can prove, but like any
*  theorem, there are assumptions that you make that go into that theorem. And I'm a little skeptical
*  of the assumptions. So I would love to develop an actual killer, here is the experiment you can do
*  to distinguish between many worlds and pilot wave theories. But I haven't done it yet, so I'm not
*  sure whether it's possible or not. Now I'm going to group two questions together. One is from Charles
*  Miro, and it's a priority question. And he asks, if each semi-classical branch of the wave function
*  instantiates a different real universe within its own space-time, it seems that for non-interaction
*  between the branches, both space and time must be emergent from the quantum formalism. But this
*  doesn't seem to be the case. Also, it's hard to understand how decoherence can create new space-times
*  because it is a dynamical phenomenon that spreads outward in a light cone within the present space-time.
*  So the question is, how is this possible, the dynamical process of decoherence, creating
*  different non-interacting space-times? And Paul Torek says, can you sketch an outline of how
*  ever-readying quantum mechanics leads to each branch having its own space-time, i.e. one that
*  lacks any curvature that will be due to massive objects in the other branches? So yeah, I'm someone
*  who believes that when you have an ever-readying branching of the worlds, each world has its own
*  space-time. And one sort of question that is lurking in the background here is, what do you mean
*  by a space-time? So I think there's two different ways you could slice it. You know, and the point
*  of space-time is that it has a metric. There's a metric on space-time that tells you where the
*  light cones are, what the curvature is, what distances are, all of that stuff, right? That's
*  the geometry of a space-time is encoded in the metric. So if you wanted to, you could say there's
*  only one space-time, but there are two different metrics, right? So let's imagine you do something
*  like an experiment where, because Don Page has actually done this experiment, just for fun. He
*  said, you know, let's take a Geiger counter, or let's take some, I don't know exactly what he used,
*  use some quantum measurement device that can give you two different answers, up or down, left or
*  right or whatever. And if it's one answer, he takes a bowling ball and moves it to the left,
*  and if it's the other answer, he takes a bowling ball and moves it to the right, and then use a
*  Cavendish experiment, which measures the gravitational field of a nearby object to say,
*  you know, did the gravitational field follow the bowling ball? And of course, the answer is that
*  the gravitational field followed the bowling ball, exactly as it would if the world were just classical,
*  right? And if you thought that somehow the gravitational field of the bowling ball in the
*  other branch of the universe could still be felt in your branch, that should not happen. You should
*  observe a gravitational field that was halfway in between the two bowling balls, okay? Now,
*  no one expects that to happen, but that would be what you should expect if you think that the force
*  of gravity in one could leak into the other branch. But if you think of it in terms of the metric,
*  the metric defining the curvature of spacetime, the metric is just another field just like the
*  electromagnetic field or the electron field or whatever. So it's conceptually not hard at all
*  to imagine that there are two branches with two different metrics on them, right? And what we would
*  call that is two different spacetimes, because spacetime is defined by what the metric is doing,
*  but it's not that conceptually difficult. So in Charles's question, I think that I would like to
*  undo a lot of the assumptions here. Number one, space and time can be emergent from the quantum
*  formalism. Some of us, like myself, have written papers saying exactly that. So I think that that's
*  pretty straightforward. We don't know that it's true in any obvious way, but it's certainly
*  possible, certainly conceivable. I happen to think it's very promising. And then also you say
*  decoherence is a dynamical phenomenon that spreads outward in a light cone within the parent spacetime.
*  That's not true either. That is an option that you have in ever-writing quantum mechanics,
*  how to define the splitings of the universe, whether or not you want to localize it inside
*  a light cone, or whether or not you just want to say in some frame that you choose,
*  you describe splitting as happening instantaneously in that reference frame.
*  Either way of doing it is perfectly legitimate, gives all the same experimental predictions,
*  etc., etc. So branches of the wave function are like, are a higher level immersion phenomenon,
*  okay? They are like entropy or temperature or things like that. They are not something
*  that exists at the fundamental level. They are higher level constructions that are useful for
*  human beings to talk about. It's human beings who care about the classical limit. It's not the
*  universe that cares about the classical limit. So we can choose, we were given this option
*  in many worlds to define branching as either being confined to a light cone or being instantaneous.
*  John Eastman asks a priority question. I accelerate charged particle A, causing virtual
*  photons to travel to distant charged particle B, which feels a force proportional to A's
*  acceleration. Is there an inertia-like reaction force acting back on particle A? Could a weak
*  field gravity analog of this effect explain inertia itself? I'm sorry, I know this is a
*  priority question, but I think that the words are a little bit too vague for me to understand
*  what is being asked. I don't know what an inertia-like reaction force is supposed to be.
*  It is true that there are radiation reaction forces for all long-range forces, which I guess
*  basically is E and M and gravity. Namely, when you accelerate a particle that has charge or mass,
*  then the field around it responds and that changes what you might naively think would be the
*  acceleration of the original particle. It doesn't really affect, it doesn't really depend on whether
*  or not there is another charged particle B far away. This radiation reaction effect can happen
*  just with one particle in the universe. If you have other particles, then there will be other
*  forces going on. Yes, indeed. However, I would say that none of this explains inertia itself.
*  It's an extra tiny little correction onto the fact that there is inertia. And also, I don't
*  know why you want to explain inertia. Inertia is just a fact about the universe. F equals MA,
*  in the Newtonian limit. At some point, you say this is how the world works and you don't try to
*  explain it. Or if you really are devoted to explaining an idea, what you really have to do
*  is imagine that the idea was wrong. So you don't just say, I would like to explain inertia. You
*  say, I would like to compare two different universes, one of which has the notion of inertia in it and
*  one of which does not. These are two different hypothetical universes. And now I will explain
*  why we seem to live in one rather than the other. That is a sensible program to undertake. And I
*  don't think the radiation reaction has any impact on either one of them. Paul Hardy says, I watched
*  a discussion on entanglement and they suggested that entanglement could be closely related to the
*  creation of space. So space isn't fundamental. Would this mean that our entanglement might play
*  a crucial role at the Big Bang when our universe was created? Yeah, possibly. I mean, as I mentioned,
*  I've written papers on space arising from quantum entanglement and I did write one paper with
*  collaborators called Quantum Circuit Cosmology, where we talked about how the expansion of space,
*  in a view where space is an emergent feature of a bunch of entangled quantum degrees of freedom,
*  then what does it mean for space to expand? Well, it means that more degrees of freedom
*  are becoming entangled. So we have this picture where you see a bunch of entangled quantum
*  degrees of freedom. So we have this picture where you start with a large number of
*  unentangled qubits or other quantum degrees of freedom. And you have a quantum circuit
*  that describes how those unentangled qubits become entangled with the rest of the world and now become
*  part of space time. And if you play that movie backwards, you reach a point because of the
*  holographic principle, there's only a finite number of qubits in our current universe.
*  So if the number of qubits is increasing as time goes on, it was decreasing in the past
*  and you reach a point where there's the first pair of entangled qubits. And it's basically
*  at the beginning of inflation in our picture that we wrote about. So in some sense, it's not the Big
*  Bang. You know, I want to maybe I should have started this answer by saying that, what do you
*  mean by the Big Bang? The Big Bang, of course, there's a difference between the Big Bang model,
*  which is just a hot expanding universe that we live in and that's true. There's also the Big Bang
*  event, the singularity at the beginning of the cosmos. That doesn't exist. There is no singularity
*  at the beginning of the cosmos. Okay, that is a prediction of classical general relativity,
*  but classical general relativity is not right. So it's a stand in for whatever happened at that
*  moment. Okay, it's not a singularity. So in this picture, what happened at that moment, the first
*  thing that happened in our universe was two qubits became entangled. Now, why did that start? Why did
*  that happen? What happened before that? Were they just unentangled forever? Or what's going on? All
*  very good questions, none of which we tried to answer in our paper in that particular paper,
*  I tried to answer them in other papers. But we don't know. So to your direct question,
*  would this mean entanglement might play a crucial role at the Big Bang? Sure, completely possible,
*  but we don't know. This is all very speculative right now. Anders Hansen says quantum
*  electrodynamics QED is considered to be one of the most accurate theories in the history of science.
*  However, there are opinions about it that it is wrong in different aspects. What is your
*  opinion and why? So I'm not sure the sense in which you mean that it is wrong. It's a little
*  vague to say there are opinions that it is wrong. I'm not quite sure what that refers to.
*  It's clearly wrong in that it's incomplete, right? There are particles other than the ones that are
*  described in QED. Strictly speaking, QED is the theory of photons, electrons and positrons, and
*  that's it. Electrons, anti-electrons, and the photons that give forces between them. That's
*  the original definition of QED. So if you believe there are neutrinos and quarks, if you believe
*  there's a strong interaction and weak interactions, then QED is wrong. But really, we don't usually
*  say it's wrong. We say that it's just part of a bigger structure. Electromagnetism has become
*  unified with the weak interactions and the electroweak theory. We also know there are the
*  strong interactions and so on. Maybe all three of those forces are unified in grand unification,
*  but we just don't know right now. There's another sense, a much more subtle and interesting sense,
*  in which QED might be wrong. When we understood finally, it wasn't until the 1970s we really
*  understood quantum field theory. And part of that understanding was renormalization group flow. So
*  renormalization has this reputation as being about hiding infinities. And it was originally,
*  that was in the 40s and 50s, the idea that we had infinities in quantum field theory, we had to get
*  rid of them, we renormalized them. But it was understood much better through the work of Wilson
*  and previously Gelman and Lowe and Katanov and others in the 60s and 70s, where we understood
*  that renormalization is really a way of looking at physics at different scales, including the
*  effects of different processes at different energy and time and length scales. So what Wilson in
*  particular was able to show is that you can take a quantum field theory and cut it off. You can say,
*  I'm just not going to include effects above a certain energy scale. And because energy is
*  inversely proportional to length, that's like, I'm not including effects below a certain wavelength.
*  And you might say, well, who chooses that wavelength? That sounds important. You're
*  just arbitrarily cutting off your quantum field theory. And the renormalization group is a way
*  of dealing with that, of saying, I can choose whatever cutoff I want to not include processes
*  of very high energies. And by letting the other parameters of my theory change with respect to
*  that cutoff, so the mass of the electron and the charges of different particles, all these things
*  depend on the cutoff. I can make everything vary together in such a way that my low energy predictions
*  remain unchanged. That's the renormalization group. So when we finally figured out that
*  there was a feature of QCD of the strong interactions, which is that it is asymptotically
*  free, that at higher energies, the interaction becomes weaker and weaker. That was good. That
*  made QCD our best defined theory of fundamental physics, because all of the problematic aspects
*  of QCD, of any quantum field theory, the problematic aspects are always at high energies.
*  And in QCD, the interactions turn off at high energy, so it's really not problematic at all.
*  QED is not perfectly well defined at high energies. And there is in fact a very subtle kind of blowing
*  up singularity called the Landau pole of QED. And it's very, very much higher energy than the Planck
*  scale. It's not anything you have to worry about in practice, but it is a sign that you can't just
*  take QED and extend it to arbitrarily high energies or short wavelengths. Maybe that is what
*  was meant by QED being wrong. You can cure that by embedding QED in a bigger framework. I don't
*  think the standard model is sufficient, because there's still that U1 in SU3 cross SU2 cross
*  U1. That U1 is basically an electromagnetism-like theory. But if you embed it in a grand unified
*  gauge group, then you can solve that Landau pole problem. So QED is certainly right for describing
*  what goes on in computers and in your biology, even if it's not right at these super duper high
*  energies. Sekhar Rabala says, it is fair to say that you are quite successful outside of physics
*  and academia. Did you think of quitting academia and research before you moved to Johns Hopkins
*  University? Is your motivation and drive to do physics, academia research the same say as it was
*  10 years ago? Yeah, I thought about quitting academia, but I had not thought about quitting
*  research. Research is the thing that makes me the happiest. It keeps me the most intellectually
*  engaged and I have a million ideas of things I want to do research wise. So if anything,
*  the drive to do research is higher now than it was 10 or 20 years ago. I mean, I always sort of
*  abstractly loved doing research and thinking about the universe. But I think now I have a much better
*  idea than I did decades ago about where the interesting questions are and how I can make
*  progress answering them. So if I was going to leave academia, it was so that I could do more
*  research or and the research of the kind that I precisely wanted. The reason why I'm going to
*  Hopkins other than the fact that they offered me the job was because it's a job that is suited to
*  let me do that to let me do exactly the kind of research I want to do with the people I want to
*  do it with, etc. So it's worked out very, very well that way. I'm not going to stop doing the
*  non academic stuff that that'll still go on. Tyler Whitmer says, you're really good at remembering
*  former guests and cross referencing them on the fly when topics overlap with your current guest.
*  Do you have a cheat sheet or something or just a really good memory? I think that I
*  neither I certainly don't have a cheat sheet. I don't have a good memory either. In fact,
*  I think it's the opposite. It's interesting that it is often the case that I don't remember
*  interesting tidbits of former podcasts because while I'm podcasting, while I'm, you know,
*  the questioner live there with the guest, I'm thinking about what question comes next,
*  I hit the record button, how was the sound quality, how much time is left, all of these things,
*  right? And I try to make it also seem like a real conversation. Like I'm not just listing,
*  I don't have a pre listed set of questions to ask. I'm trying to respond mostly to what the person
*  just said. There's some talking points that I want to reach. There's some things I want to get to.
*  So I might sometimes change the topic for that reason. But usually I'm just trying to
*  actually act like it's a conversation and ask questions. But of course, I do some preparation
*  for each episode, which involves, you know, reading or listening or whatever. And while doing that,
*  I might be reminded of previous podcasts. The thing is that for a podcast like this,
*  I'm the one inviting the guests, right? And that's the difference between this and a talk show on
*  radio or TV where someone books the guests and some different person asks them the questions.
*  So if I'm inviting someone on the podcast, it's because I'm interested in what they have to say
*  for some pre existing reason. So I'm not just, you know, thinking, well, this is the question
*  I'm supposed to ask. I'm thinking, this is the issue I want the answer to. And often, those are
*  connected with previous podcasts that I often also had issues I wanted the answer to. So to me,
*  it all does kind of fit together in a way. So it's not a matter of having a really good memory.
*  It's a matter of having reasons why previous guests were there and relating them to what the
*  current guest is saying. Jason Worrell asks, Is the bigger motive for physics mainly to comprehend
*  the place of humanity in the vast cosmos? Or is it mainly to advance the place of humanity in the
*  vast cosmos? I don't think that there is a bigger motive, honestly, I'm not sure that's a competition
*  that there's going to win. Different physicists will have different reasons and different people
*  will have different reasons. My own interest is mostly in understanding and comprehending
*  the cosmos. I'm very interested in advancing the place of humanity, making the world a better place
*  both here on earth and in the cosmos. But I do have this conviction, two convictions. Number one,
*  that advancing humanity is easier when you understand the world in which you live. And
*  number two, there should be an ecosystem, a balance between people who are purely trying to
*  make things better and advance humanity and people who are trying to lay the groundwork
*  for doing that in a more comprehensive way down the road. I think that my skill set of my interests
*  are more aligned with the understanding big picture kinds of questions than with advancing
*  this particular local issue right now. Jeff B says, Occasionally when I study physics, I can feel my
*  woo-woo side longing to break free. As much as I want to understand the truth of the universe,
*  another part of me wishes that we live in a world with angels, demons, and gods that play tricks.
*  Do you ever have this wish? Are you ever able to satisfy it through fiction? Well, I did have that
*  wish when I was younger and I was very much interested in science fiction and fantasy and
*  movies and comic books and things like that. It strikes me now that comic book characters are
*  movie stars, that the comic book characters that I liked when I was a kid in comic book age
*  were the ones who were most supernatural in some sense, the most cosmic, the most spooky.
*  Doctor Strange, Green Lantern, Thor were much more interesting to me than Batman and Superman
*  and Spider-Man ever were. I think the same thing remains true except now that I know
*  that it is purely through fiction. When I was a kid, I was very interested in parapsychology and
*  ESP and telekinesis and UFOs and all that stuff. Now I know more about the world. I think the
*  chances that any of that are real are very, very tiny. That's okay. I'm very happy to tickle that
*  itch, scratch that itch. You don't want to tickle an itch. To scratch that itch through fiction of
*  various sorts. By the way, I just realized I said comic book reading age. What I meant by
*  that was my comic book reading age. People of all ages are very, very welcome to read comic books.
*  I still do it myself sometimes as an indulgence, but when I was a kid, I was into it and I knew
*  what was going on. These days I have no idea what's going on in comic book land. Speaker
*  Ukraine says, to explain science to people, scientists often dumb it down using approximations
*  and analogies. People take these simplifications at face value and build crazy theories around them,
*  arriving to crazy or at least false conclusions. How would you dissuade any conspiracy theorists
*  of their being wrong? Sometimes you have to challenge them anyway as they are decision
*  makers or influencers, et cetera. Well, I think there's two things that are being smushed together
*  here that maybe I'm not quite willing to smush together. Yes, scientists absolutely simplify.
*  They use approximations and analogies. Yes, it is absolutely a danger that people can listen and
*  hear the analogy perfectly, but then presume that parts of the analogy that weren't meant to be
*  taken seriously should be taken seriously and therefore end up misunderstanding some delicate
*  nuanced scientific point. That is absolutely a danger. I think that it is something where
*  that's something that people have to watch out for because scientists know when they're using
*  an analogy which parts of the analogy are real and which parts are not, the person listening
*  might not know that. That's why I am very much against things like the balloon analogy for the
*  expanding universe because we know as scientists that there's no inside the balloon or outside the
*  balloon. There's just the surface of the balloon, but the people who you're showing that analogy to
*  have trouble appreciating what that really means. So I just don't use it. I just use expanding
*  raisin bread or something, something where it's three-dimensional from the start.
*  The other thing you're asking about are conspiracy theorists and decision makers. I do not think
*  that people become conspiracy theorists because they listen to scientists explain things and
*  take the simplifications too literally. I don't think that's why you become a conspiracy theorist.
*  I don't know. I don't have a fully fledged out theory of why people do become conspiracy theorists.
*  I encourage everyone to listen to the podcast with Tee Wen who really has a wonderful theory
*  of the valorization of clarity. Conspiracy theorists like the fact that their conspiracy
*  provides an answer to everything and it provides an answer that is crisp and clear
*  and immediately understandable and black and white and rigorous. The world is not. The world
*  is a mess. The world has things we don't understand, et cetera. So a real correct understanding of the
*  world is less complete than a good conspiracy is. I don't know the way to talk conspiracy theorists
*  out of their conspiracy theorizing, but one thing to point out is you have to be willing to accept
*  ambiguity and uncertainty in your picture of the world. Also, the other thing to point out is
*  one problem with conspiracies is that they often don't really think through how they were going
*  to happen. They sort of imagine actors with infinite superpowers pushing things around out
*  there in the world, whereas really it's people. All these people with their own flaws and their
*  own hopes and their own ways of working and there's some collective emergent behavior that
*  comes out of all of that. And it's very hard to imagine a small cabal of ultra-powerful people
*  pushing around the world in any realistic kind of way. I don't know if pointing that out actually
*  changes the minds of any conspiracy theorists, but I think that's a real reason to not be a
*  conspiracy theorist yourself. Dipankar Bose says, in our universe, all matter and thus all life
*  forms including us are made up the first generation of particles in the standard model.
*  That is to say, this is me now talking, electrons, electron neutrinos, up quarks and down quarks,
*  and of course the up and downs make protons and neutrons. So that's the first generation of
*  particles. The next generation is muons and their neutrinos, charmed and strange quarks.
*  The third generation is taus and their neutrinos, top and bottom quarks, and all those heavier
*  particles just decay away, leaving us with the first generation. So anyway, resuming the question,
*  I was trying to imagine some other universe that has matter and life made of entirely of particles
*  from the second or third generation. Is this possible or does the question not even make sense
*  because the standard model only applies to our universe? Well, no, I think the question makes
*  sense. No, sorry, I don't think the question makes sense, but not because the standard model only
*  applies to our universe. I think it's perfectly sensible to ask if we didn't have the standard
*  model, but something like it but slightly different, how would the universe be different?
*  That's a perfectly sensible counterfactual question to ask. The problem is that by definition,
*  the second and third generation is made of the heavier particles, right? So very similarly to
*  we define the past to be the direction which entropy was lower, ex post facto, we define the
*  first generation of particles to be the particles that are the lightest. And it's just a feature of
*  quantum field theory that heavy particles decay into light ones. Why do they do that? Ultimately,
*  it's because entropy increases. Because when a heavy particle decays into light particles,
*  it decays into several particles, right? One particle cannot decay into one particle
*  if the two particles had different masses without conserving energy. So when the neutron decays,
*  for example, it decays into a proton plus an electron, a neutrino and an anti neutrino. So
*  there's more particles and therefore more entropy. You can imagine a process by which several
*  particles come together, several light particles come together to make a heavier one, but that
*  would decrease the entropy of the universe because there would be fewer particles. Sometimes it
*  happens, but the overall tendency is for heavier to decay into light. So anyway, the answer is
*  in whatever universe you're in, if that universe obeys the laws of quantum field theory and has an
*  ordinary arrow of time, you're going to make whatever matter you have out of the stable light
*  particles. So if you think about it, I talked about this in the biggest ideas in the universe,
*  in the video about either atom, I think it's atoms, that video. Basically all the particles,
*  there's many, many, many particles in the standard model, they're all produced in the early universe,
*  but they all decay until you hit the lightest set of particles that contain some conserved quantity.
*  So neutrinos are just the lightest particles period, the lightest particles with the lightest
*  fermions. Let's put it that way. Massless particles like photons are of course lighter, but you can't
*  turn a fermion into a boson. Electrons are the lightest particles with charge, protons are the
*  lightest particles with baryon number and so forth. Neutrons are not the lightest particles with
*  anything, but neutrons are also not stable, they decay. When you combine neutrons with protons,
*  you can make metastable nuclei. That's what atoms are made out of. Jim Murphy says,
*  were you a gifted student in grade school and do you think that the US school system does a good
*  job, good enough job, at helping these students reach their full potential? I was, I was a gifted
*  student, I was in the gifted classes. In fact, I was a student when that idea of having gifted
*  classes first came into existence. I remember very vividly that when the idea first happened
*  in my local Pennsylvania public school system, they had no idea what to do. We kind of did arts
*  and crafts for a year as gifted students, but eventually it just turned into advanced courses
*  in the same kind of thing. We had gifted English, gifted math or whatever. It was sort of a, they,
*  in principle, why the letter of the law did what the mandate said to do, but it wasn't anything
*  special. Do they do a good enough job at helping these students reach their full potential? No,
*  of course not. But the same thing is true for not gifted students or for average students or for any
*  students. The US system, as I know it, does not do a good enough job at helping students reach their
*  full potential. And different, so I don't think of it as in terms of gifted versus non-gifted.
*  All students are different and we can't invent a new educational system, a new for each student.
*  Therefore, it will always be the case that whatever the system is, it's going to make
*  compromises to try to optimize teaching as many students as it can as well as it can.
*  So some students are going to not get as much out of that as other students and that's a shame.
*  And we should try to do it better. I don't think any students are fully served by the current system,
*  especially because some students will have secret talents, right? Will be very bad at taking
*  whatever standardized test you're using, but really good at something else. And the system is not
*  built to really find those talents and encourage them. It sort of bulldozes you into a certain
*  way of being, which is not the ideal thing. I don't know how to fix it either though. So,
*  you know, there's one thing to complain about it. There's another thing to try to make it better.
*  Brandon Lewis says, what is your favorite subset of mathematical notation and what is the least?
*  And how is the notation you use regularly evolved over the course of your career?
*  Uh, this is a funny question, but that's why I took it because I had not really thought about it.
*  The short answer for favorite mathematical notation is tensor notation in general relativity.
*  And I've always had like a pet theory for why it is so good. Namely, the general
*  relativity was kind of useless for a long time. Einstein invented it in 1915 and it didn't really
*  become heavily used in astrophysics until relatively recently. You know, the number of
*  Nobel prizes that lean heavily on general relativity was very tiny. It was like one
*  before the year 1980 and it's like half of them in the most recent 10 or 15 years.
*  So general relativity has finally become really, really important.
*  So basically, and again, pet theory, I have no idea if this is true or not. I think that the
*  physicists who did care about general relativity during the early days had enough time to like
*  really make the notation really good and agree on what they said. Whereas in quantum mechanics
*  and quantum field theory, they were so busy leaping to the next puzzle and trying to solve it
*  that they never had good time to figure out what the good notation was. So that is my story. I'm
*  not necessarily sticking to it, but that's what I think is true. Richard Graff says,
*  in your podcast with Nicole Younger-Halpern on quantum steampunk thermodynamics,
*  she described how information could perform work. Compared to a classical example like a
*  spark fuel moving a piston, the steampunk example appears less direct. It's not so much
*  the knowledge that moves the weight as what the experimenter does with that knowledge.
*  And the effort required of the experimenter requires additional work input that seems more
*  directly tied to the weight movement than the knowledge does. Have I tangled myself up in too
*  much nuance here? And if so, can you help untangle and clarify? Well, I can try to explain what is
*  going on. So in some sense, I don't think, let's put it this way. Information and its role in physics
*  is both a very old topic and a hot new topic. Like we've always known that there was a relationship
*  there, but people are really becoming more and more impressed with how important that relationship
*  is. But we haven't yet settled on the once and for all cleanest, clearest, best way of both explaining
*  what that relationship is and putting it to work. So this means both that sometimes we miss
*  the importance of information and other times we exaggerate the importance of information. So
*  people will often say, and I think I probably said that you can use information to do work.
*  What does that mean? So the typical example is you have a piston on one side of the piston,
*  you have some fuel, you spark it, it expands and heats because of combustion and it pushes the
*  piston. That's the standard thing to do. What Richard is referring to is the idea that if I
*  have just one particle inside a box and the particle is moving around, right? So it has a
*  lot of velocity, but it's bouncing around in different ways. If I don't know where the
*  particle is, I can't do anything with that. There's no way if I put a divider in the box,
*  half the time the divider will move to the left, half the time will move to the right.
*  If I do that many, many, many times, it will do a random walk and that's not doing a lot of
*  work. It's doing very, very little. Whereas if I have the information of knowing exactly where
*  the particle is and how it's moving, then I can wait to put the divider in at exactly the right
*  time so that I know the particle will bump into the divider and move it in the direction I want
*  to move it. So if I know that for many, many particles, I can do that many, many times and
*  coherently add all of those pushes because I had that extra information. I'm basically being
*  Maxwell's demon in this case. I'm extracting work from a high entropy set of particles
*  because I have information about it. So people say, look, in some sense, information is doing
*  the work. Clearly it's not doing the work. What's doing the work is the particle bumping into your
*  divider, but information enables you to do that work. Now, if I were a little bit cynical, I would
*  say, look, information also enabled you to do the work when you burn the fuel in the regular piston
*  because you knew the fuel was in a low entropy state where you could release some of that free
*  energy by sparking it. So it's always information in some sense that is allowing you to do the
*  manipulations that extracts work from a physical system. And it's always the physical system that
*  is actually doing the work. But there is an interplay here. Knowing more information lets
*  you do more work, lets you do more interesting things. That is perfectly clear. So what again,
*  we want to be able to do is to say once and for all what that relationship is in a clear, crisp way.
*  We're not quite there yet, but it's not wrong to say that knowing that information is helping you
*  do a little bit of work. Lewis B says, one of my favorite parts of listening to you and other
*  scientists is the quickness and freeness with which you will admit you don't know or we don't
*  know something. I've even heard you say we have lots of ideas, but you don't have high credence
*  in any of them. That said, there are some places, e.g. many worlds, where you do seem to assign
*  relatively high credence. I wonder what differentiates these for you. What about these ideas capture you?
*  Well, that's complicated, but there's many things. It's basically for whatever sets of
*  reasons I'm assigning high credence because of some combination of priors and likelihoods and
*  data that comes in. So I have a high prior as a scientist on a simple explanatory theory.
*  That's one reason why many worlds is one of my favorite theories. But then I will modify
*  that credence based on the data that comes in and I learn more things about it. So the only reason
*  why people switch from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics was because they were forced
*  to do so by an overwhelming amount of data. And some things we just don't have the data. So my
*  favorite example is always dark matter. I think we have very good data that says there is dark
*  matter. And we have very good data that tells us certain properties of the dark matter, that it is
*  cold, there's a certain density, that is a certain distribution through the universe. We have
*  essentially no data about what it is within that set of properties. There are many different kinds of
*  particles you could imagine that would be cold, that would be dark, etc. So we don't know whether
*  it's axions or wimps or something else. So it makes perfect sense to me to have high credence
*  that there is dark matter and low credence that the dark matter is axions, etc. I don't think it's
*  any more deep than that. But maybe what you're referring to is the idea that sometimes people
*  do have very different credences even when there's no data. So let's still think about axions versus
*  wimps as dark matter candidates. For a long time, wimps were the leading candidate to be the dark
*  matter, wimps being weakly interacting massive particles. And axions were like the second
*  leading candidate. And there were many, many other candidates. But people didn't give equal
*  credence to every candidate. They liked some better than others. Why do you do that if the data do not
*  distinguish? Well, the answer is that some of those theories fit well with other ideas. Some of those
*  theories are more explanatory than others. So wimps are extremely popular because they fit perfectly
*  well with many other ideas about physics beyond the standard model. Supersymmetry is an idea,
*  but extra dimensions, strong coupling, there's a whole bunch of ideas for physics beyond the
*  standard model that would naturally lead you to a weakly interacting massive particle. And there's
*  even what is called the wimp miracle, that if you ask if you have a particle that was in thermal
*  equilibrium in the early universe and eventually it stopped annihilating and sort of froze in,
*  what would the interaction strength have to be for that to happen? And roughly speaking,
*  the answer is the weak interactions of particle physics. So that was sort of a miracle that gave
*  people more credence that this theory was on the right track. So it fit in with other ideas.
*  Axions likewise were not predicted, they were not invented to be the dark matter. Axions are a
*  hypothetical particle that were invented. I mean, the original idea came from Peche and Quinn,
*  Roberto Peche and Helen Quinn, when they were trying to solve a problem in quantum field theory
*  called the strong CP problem. CP is a potential symmetry of particle physics, which unlike many
*  times in particle physics, you think that there should be a symmetry and you find that it's broken.
*  In the case of CP, what we found was that the strong interactions should break it, but they
*  don't. That's sort of the opposite kind of problem. And so Peche and Quinn invented a mechanism that
*  explained how you could add one extra field and you could explain why CP was not broken by the
*  strong interactions. And then both Frank Wilczek, former Minescape guest and Steven Weinberg,
*  pointed out that the Peche-Quinn mechanism predicted the existence of a new particle.
*  And people were very optimistic they would find the particle because it was very easily
*  findable. They did not find it. So they did the next sensible thing. They expanded their parameter
*  space a little bit, right? And they said, well, okay, maybe let's be less choosy about what
*  symmetry breaking scale is involved with this particle. And once they did that, they realized,
*  oh, if we pick the symmetry breaking scale appropriately, we can get a dark matter candidate
*  and the axion could be the dark matter. And so that was a pretty good dark matter candidate
*  because it's a particle that was invented for a completely different reason, but it's not
*  perfectly good because you have to like make up this energy scale to fit the data. Whereas with
*  WIMPs, the energy scale just comes along for free. But at least it was not invented to be the dark
*  matter. And other candidates for dark matter were just invented to be the dark matter, right? They
*  were not even trying to solve any other problems. So you see that there is kind of a hierarchy of
*  how the idea fits in with other ideas and whether it's solving problems or creating them and so
*  forth. And these are all perfectly good reasons to have high or low credence in different ideas
*  before the data come in and decide the question once and for all. Brian Charleboix says, first
*  time question asker here. And since you want to write a book on democracy, I'm calling this a
*  priority question. Do you wish or hope for some form of direct democracy to exist worldwide in
*  the next thousand or 10,000 years? No, I have zero hope for direct democracy to exist ever.
*  In any group of people, more than like 20 people. Because as we talked about before,
*  direct democracy is the idea that issues that come up before the nation or the state or whatever
*  group of people you're talking about, every person votes on every individual issue, as opposed to
*  representative democracy, where you vote for a representative and the representatives have the
*  job of really devoting their lives to understanding these issues and deciding what to do. That latter
*  system just seems much better to me. It's still democracy. It's still people voting and the
*  authority and the authenticity. What is the word I'm looking for? I don't know. I'm losing the word.
*  But the justification for the power being held by these representatives is that the people vote for
*  them. That's the essence of democracy. It's the people's will that is giving government its
*  legitimacy. But representative democracy is just infinitely more sensible for any system that is
*  even a little bit complicated. The modern world is extremely, extremely complicated. The idea of
*  ruling the world by direct democracy seems crazy pants to me. In fact, if you're interested,
*  you can go back to the podcast I did with Edward Watts about the fall of the Roman Republic.
*  The Roman Republic fell and we talked about why that happened. But first, the question is,
*  I mean, not the question, but the point that should be appreciated is the Roman Republic lasted for
*  500 years and was very, very successful over those 500 years before it eventually collapsed.
*  So that's a pretty good run. And there is a very clear comparison to be done between the Roman
*  Republic and Greek democracy because the Greeks were often much more invested, the Athenians,
*  I should say, in direct democracy where you would vote on everything. And it led to complete
*  chaos because you would vote to send out the naval fleet. Then a week later, you would vote
*  to bring it back. And it was not a good way to run a country. And so the Romans were much more
*  successful because they voted for representatives and the representatives did the work. Representatives,
*  if they're good, of course, you can always question whether or not you're having a system that
*  elects good representatives. But if they're good, they will be much more able to understand the
*  complexities of the world and guide the country through them. Humberto Nanni says,
*  may you please comment about your favorite places on the internet? I'll go first. All the nooks of
*  preposterousuniverse.com. So thank you, Humberto. I don't really have a great answer to this. I just
*  wanted to give Humberto a chance to advertise my website, preposterousuniverse.com. So there are a
*  lot of things. There are a lot of nooks and crannies on the website that you can spend hours
*  of fun reading and watching videos and things like that. But other favorite places on the internet,
*  look, my internet use is not that sophisticated in some sense. I'm on the internet all the time,
*  but I use it for email. I still use Feedly to read blogs. If you're a long time listener,
*  you remember Neha Nerula, one of the very first podcasts I did talked about cryptocurrency.
*  And we talked about the different ways that people use the internet. And I said that I still read
*  blogs using a feed reader. And she was kind of shocked and appalled that there are still people
*  who do that. So I still do that. I'm on Twitter, YouTube, Imgur for just wasting my time or Reddit
*  or whatever. I often lurk on the Sixers subreddit, much more interesting than the physics subreddits
*  to me, et cetera. But nothing very profound. I don't have any special places that you haven't
*  heard of that I would go recommending to be honest, sorry. Niccolo Musmessi says,
*  regarding Bayesianism, you've often argued that the potentially subjective nature of priors is
*  not an issue. And I agree with that. But what about the fact that often we can't list all
*  possible priors in the first place? Like for example, in theoretical physics, this is precisely
*  the case since listing all possible priors would imply coming up with all the possible theories
*  before being able to update from evidence. Doesn't this issue limit the application of
*  Bayesianism to less speculative settings? Yeah, I think that this is a very important issue. I
*  wouldn't put it exactly in the words that you put it in because any good Bayesian, especially when
*  you're doing something like theoretical physics, let's say you're trying to explain the dark matter,
*  right? Like we were just talking about, you have different credences on different theories. But
*  you should put a certain amount of credence on the set of theories I haven't explicitly listed,
*  the set of ideas I haven't come up with yet, right? I mean, that's obviously always an open
*  possibility. So that's easy to say. Like that's not the problem. There should be some credence
*  on stuff you haven't thought of yet. That's easy. The problem is that the whole point of Bayesianism
*  is that not only you have those priors, but then you update them when new data comes in.
*  And you update them on the basis of these likelihood functions. You say, well, if this
*  theory is right, how likely is it that I would have gotten that data? That's easy to do when
*  you have a theory. But that's very hard to do when the proposition you're talking about is,
*  I don't yet have a theory, right? In the space of all theories I haven't yet invented,
*  what is the chance I would see this data? That's really hard to specifically say. So I don't,
*  in practice, you can very often get around this. But well, you can think you get around it, but
*  it's not perfectly clear at a principled, rigorous level that you're making sense. So we saw this at
*  the very beginning of this AMA with aliens in the solar system, right? You need to ask yourself,
*  what is the likelihood that aliens in the solar system would act in a certain way?
*  And so you say, you fool yourself into thinking, I have a theory called aliens in the solar system.
*  But that theory is not very specific. What kind of aliens? How long have they been there? Are they
*  aggressive? Are they made of biological materials? There's a million things that you haven't answered,
*  and therefore it is difficult to answer questions about what the likelihoods are.
*  And I do think that that is an issue for Bayesian reasoning. And I'm sure people have debated
*  to death in the depths of the Bayesian literature, and I don't myself really know what the answer is.
*  I'd like to know more. Anyone out there who has some ideas or knows some literature about that,
*  that would be fun to read. Oleg Ruvinsky says, I am an Israeli who was born in Ukraine,
*  so I've been following the war very closely, and it made me reconsider what I thought about
*  the severity of our conflict in comparison to the scale of what happens in Ukraine.
*  I wonder whether you had similar thoughts about the severity of U.S. internal political conflict
*  and the threat it poses to U.S. democracy in comparison to the gradual slide over the years
*  of Russia into totalitarianism. Do you still think U.S. democracy is going through a severe
*  existential crisis? Well, yeah, I do. But I mean, this is a good set of issues to be thinking about.
*  For one thing, one correction, I don't think there's any gradual slide of Russia into
*  totalitarianism. Russia was part of the Soviet Union, which was totalitarian from the start.
*  I would say that there was a brief moment when maybe in some sense Russia was trying to be
*  democratic. But there was never a time, to me, that you know that your democracy is working
*  when the ruling political party tries to win but loses and hands over power.
*  As far as I know, that's never happened in Russia. You have to be able to lose,
*  and you have to be able to hand over power when you lose in a peaceful transition. That's what
*  really makes you democracy, not the voting part. I think it's a very different situation from the
*  start comparing the U.S. to Russia. There's no one-to-one comparison. They come from very
*  different historical trajectories. Having said all that, the U.S. is a much healthier democracy
*  right now. It's been around a long time. It has established institutions. Therefore, it is not
*  the same kind of worry that you have in China or Russia or other places that have a totalitarian
*  history. That doesn't mean there's no worries, though. We just talked about the fall of the
*  Roman Republic. It lasted 500 years and then became an empire, a dictatorship. The U.S. could
*  do the same thing. Maybe every single year, the chance is small, but there's an accumulated
*  effect. The result of losing democracy in the U.S. is enormous for not only the U.S. but the world.
*  Part of why I worry about the U.S. is because I live here. This is my country. I have some
*  voice here in a way that I think that other people should have voices in their countries.
*  But also, it's not just you say there's some chance that democracy could fail per year,
*  and it's small. You say, well, how is this year different than last year or 10 or 20 years ago?
*  I think that there are many, many objectively true facts about the current situation that make it
*  clear that democracy is more fragile right now than it used to be. I just said that the real
*  test of democracy is a peaceful transfer of power, and we just had a major political party that tried
*  not to hand over power. Rather than those people being thrown in jail, they're still in the
*  government. They are still trying to be a ruling political party, and we're trying to treat it as
*  business as usual. Just politics, people disagree with each other, blah, blah, blah. I don't think
*  it is business as usual. I think it is a true undermining of legitimacy of democracy. Even
*  though it's not nearly as bad, the Democrats have another problem with democracy, namely that they
*  look at what Republicans are doing, and they cease to think of Republicans as partners in the
*  Democratic project. They think that they're not really legitimate people in the system anymore.
*  The whole point of democracy is you have to work with the people you don't agree with.
*  I think that's breaking down, and that breakdown of the ability to work with the people you don't
*  agree with might ultimately be much more important to the failure of democracy in the US than any one
*  politician's attempts to seize power or change their vote outcomes or anything like that.
*  You need buy-in. You can only have a successful democracy if everyone in the country wants to be
*  in a successful democracy. I think that is evaporating in the United States. That's a
*  huge crisis, and I can't say too much about what a big problem that is in my view. Tomas Sedevich
*  says, are there plans for audiobook versions of the Biggest Ideas books? I've thoroughly enjoyed
*  the previous ones, but the equations would likely make that difficult. Could this be solved by a
*  supplemental PDF or something similar? There will be audiobook versions, yes. I'm not exactly sure
*  how we're going to solve the obvious problems here. There usually are PDF supplements for figures
*  in books. There's many more figures in the Biggest Ideas books than there
*  were in previous books because it's more, you know, I have a lot of graphs and things like that,
*  as well as the ordinary, you know, illustrations. So what I tentatively think
*  is that there will be an audiobook and I will narrate it, but it won't be an exact translation.
*  In other words, when I did my other audiobooks, they're very fussy, the producers of the audiobooks.
*  You need to say exactly every word, no more or no less than what was in the book. I can easily read
*  the equation out loud. That I can do, no problem. But figures are a little bit harder and sometimes
*  the meaningfulness of the equation is a little bit less clear if you can't stare at it with your
*  eyeballs. So what I would like to do is negotiate an ability to improvise a little bit while reading
*  the book and be a little bit more wordy and explanatory about what's going on in the figures
*  and the equations rather than just reading it word for word. I have no idea whether the, you know,
*  I don't make the audiobook. I read it, but there's a company that produces and sells them. And so I
*  have to see what they think. I will try to do that, but we'll have to see. So there can't be
*  really a supplemental PDF with equations because that would just be the book. That would just be
*  by the book, which I encourage you to do, the hard copy of the book. Even if you get the audiobook,
*  I still encourage you to get a hard copy exactly because these are deep, difficult ideas and you're
*  going to want to look back at the paper and say, oh yes, I see. I mean, either hard copy or, you
*  know, ebook version. That's okay. There will definitely be an ebook version. And again,
*  we'll try our best to make sure the ebook version has the equations presented correctly, etc. But
*  when I say we, it's not me. People always come to me and like, you know, this equation was typeset
*  badly in your book. Like, I don't do that. They don't even ask my input about that. So you have
*  to talk to the company that makes the books. Okay, I'm going to group two questions together.
*  One is from Phil, who says, do you think there's value in making the basic math of physical
*  theories more constructive slash computational? Right now, a lot of it builds on things like the
*  real numbers, their whole existence is not proven constructively, and only an infinitesimal fraction
*  of them are computable. This seems like a bit shaky as a foundation. And then Rollo Burgess says,
*  This is a question I've been thinking about since coming across an observation in Scott
*  Aronson's book, Quantum Computing Since Democritus. Basically, mathematically, the set of computable
*  numbers is a subset of the reals of measure zero. This means that if the universe is continuous,
*  almost none of its states can ever precisely be calculated using any set of physical laws.
*  The laws must be continuous, but our calculation procedures can only yield computable answers.
*  Aronson thinks this point makes it seem likely the universe isn't truly continuous in a
*  mathematical sense. Do you think this kind of point is potentially sound or flawed in some way?
*  And if the latter, why? Well, I don't know. So both questions are asking, you know,
*  are our difficulties of various forms in coping with the continuum, the real numbers, right,
*  that particular uncountable infinity of numbers that we have in the real numbers.
*  Every theory of physics that is very successful right now is based on continuum numbers,
*  quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, relativity, whatever you want, quantum field theory, etc.
*  Real numbers or complex numbers or the equivalents, vector spaces, manifolds,
*  these all are smooth, continuous things. There are problems both conceptually and in the
*  foundations of math with dealing with these things. And therefore, it's very natural to wonder, you
*  know, maybe nature doesn't actually use that. Maybe it's just that we approximate it that way,
*  because there's some discreteness or granularity or something like that, but it's too small for us
*  to see. So I don't know, I don't have strong feelings about this. You know, I think that
*  one thing that I would emphasize is that our difficulties don't matter to the world, you know,
*  our difficulties in calculating some state that the universe is in or our difficulties in
*  understanding the definition of the continuum or the continuum hypothesis, etc. Nature doesn't care
*  about any of these things. So the only motivation for me would be as if you could really show the
*  continuous theories were just incoherent, right? Were just impossible. If they're possible, then
*  nature can do it. And maybe that's true. I don't know one way or the other. It certainly would be
*  easier in a lot of ways if nature were not continuous. And by the way, one thing to emphasize
*  very strongly here is that the opposite of continuous is not living on some kind of lattice.
*  Okay, the simplest way to take the world and make it discrete is to literally take the smooth
*  space time around us and map it onto a set of points, a lattice of points in space and time.
*  There's very good reason to think that is not how the universe works. There's no like length scale
*  like the plank length with little bits connected point by point. Quantum mechanics just doesn't
*  work that way. And certainly holography and black hole information, etc. do not work that way.
*  But there still could be some kind of discrete countable structure underlying everything. So
*  I'm very open to people who think that. But it's a challenge because quantum mechanics isn't that.
*  The Schrodinger equation is defined on a vector space, which involves smooth evolution.
*  So you are you would you're potentially changing quantum mechanics. And I do have ideas about this,
*  by the way. But let's be honest, there is no empirical motivation. There's no data that says
*  we should change quantum mechanics right now. Andrew Harris asks a priority question.
*  Isaac Newton was no doubt a very clever intellect. If you could magically revive him and he was your
*  student, how long do you think it would take him to get up to speed with current day physics? What
*  would be the main obstacles you as his tutor face in accomplishing this task? Yeah, Einstein,
*  or Einstein, I said. Newton, he was very smart. He invented calculus. So he would be fine, I think,
*  in the modern world, it would absolutely take him time to come up to speed. You know, roughly
*  speaking, if you just did the dumbest thing in the world and said, given Newton's knowledge of the
*  world, how would he correspond to a modern day physics student? And roughly, it's some kind of
*  first year undergraduate, right? Because first year undergraduates learn Newtonian mechanics and
*  calculus. And he invented those things. Now, admittedly, we have slightly better notation,
*  and we have slightly better concepts. Like he'd never talked about energy, for example. That was
*  not something that he understood very well. Certainly didn't talk about vectors. That's
*  something they didn't know about at all. But by the second half of your first year student
*  studies as a physics student, you're learning about electromagnetism, which he certainly didn't
*  know about. And in your second year, you're on to relativity and quantum mechanics and things like
*  that. So roughly speaking, he's a first year undergrad, give him three years to catch up on
*  the undergrad stuff, two more years in grad school, and he's a working modern physicist.
*  But I suspect that he's a better than average working modern physicist. So let's give him
*  four years overall, three or four years to catch up. If you really devoted yourself to doing nothing
*  but learning physics, which maybe Newton would do, make it one or two years. But it's something
*  like that, something roughly. He was very, very smart, but he was not superhuman. He was not an
*  alien, and he needs to learn the notation and do the problems. That's just like everybody else.
*  I don't think there'd be any deep conceptual issues. He would have to unlearn some
*  cherished beliefs that people had in the 1600s about the nature of reality. But I mean, that was
*  what made him very good is I bet he could relearn that stuff pretty quickly. Krather Luca says,
*  How do you believe a person should weigh their feelings versus rationality in decision making?
*  Emotions are usually so random and unreliable, yet a life trying to avoid passion
*  barely seems like a life worth living. So I don't think that there is any weighing between feelings
*  versus rationality. I think they do two totally different things. It's like saying, which is more
*  important in driving a car, pushing down the gas pedal or turning on the ignition key? You need to
*  do both. Likewise, your feelings, and you know, David Hume was very clear about this reason is
*  and always should be the slave of the passions. What he meant was, passions tell us what we want.
*  Reason tells us how to get it. Those are compatible operations. Those are not incompatible
*  operations. I think it's a mistake to say that, you know, acting passionately and emotionally is
*  somehow the opposite of acting rationally. You can let some subset of your passions override your
*  rationality and get in trouble that way, and find out that ultimately your passions are being
*  undermined because you are not rational enough. So my philosophy is absolutely 100% that what you
*  should do is not weigh one versus the other, but let your emotions and your cognition work together
*  rather than work against each other. Cooper says, the question why is there something rather than
*  nothing appears to presuppose that nothing is a more natural state than something, and thus the
*  presence of something demands explanation. I'm not sure why that should be, as the concept of true
*  nothingness is difficult for me to philosophically wrap my head around. Do you have any thoughts on
*  the matter? Yes, I have thoughts. You can read them on the internet. You can google, why is there
*  something rather than nothing, and my name, and you'll find a paper that I wrote with exactly that
*  title. It appears in some Rutledge companion book, you know, major, I forget the name of the book,
*  but it's like, you know, current controversies in physics or the Rutledge companion to the philosophy
*  of science or something like that. It was an invited chapter, and I wrote about why is there
*  something rather than nothing, and you're right, the language steers us a little bit wrong.
*  I wouldn't say that asking why is there something rather than nothing necessarily presupposes that
*  nothing is more natural state. I mean, maybe there is no natural state, but there are alternatives.
*  You know, there could have been something or there could have been nothing, and maybe there's some
*  reason why, but honestly what I ultimately come down to say is there probably isn't a reason why
*  there is something rather than nothing, because there isn't really such an alternative. What does
*  it mean to say there could have been nothing? Nothing is not something that can be. Nothing is
*  not a state of existence. It is a state that nothing exists, right? So I think that the most
*  likely thing is that this is not a question that has some answer that it will satisfy everyone.
*  It's just a question we are tricked into asking because of the way that we talk,
*  not because of the way the explanatory matrix of the universe is actually arranged.
*  Okay, the very last question for this AMA comes from Emmett Francis who says,
*  have you thought about doing a live Mindscape episode, perhaps a Zoom session that patrons
*  could attend and submit questions to the chat? It could be a fun experiment and a good way to
*  get together with this highly diverse group of Mindscape patrons. I'm sure some of us would be
*  willing to help facilitate if that would be of interest. You know, I've thought about lots of
*  things, including things like that. I've thought about having a live event with former guests.
*  I've thought about bringing old guests back on to talk to each other rather than just talk to me.
*  I've talked about having a live call-in event like you're talking about. And there's two things that
*  prevent me from doing it right now. Number one, it seems like work. Even if the actual event
*  doesn't work, you have to put a lot of thought into how to do it right. And that's work. And
*  there's lots of ways to do it wrong. So it does require some thought and some arrangement.
*  And the other is, like, I haven't really thought of any particular way of doing something very
*  different than what I'm doing now that would be better or even good in a different way compared
*  to what I'm doing now. I mean, we have certain goals. I have certain goals with the Mindscape
*  podcast. Your mileage may vary. But I want to get to people's ideas. I want to be able to
*  interrogate them and increase our understanding of them. Ideas that are a little bit subtle
*  and systematic and require some time to dig out and explain and think about the consequences of.
*  The AMAs, what we're doing right here, this is a perfect kind of off-the-cuff thing. I don't do
*  planning for the AMAs. So I can be sloppy and say, oh, I don't know. That's perfectly fine in
*  AMA land. But a live thing is just a different thing. It's not systematic. There will be very
*  good questions and some not so good questions. Some questions will be more interesting to others,
*  et cetera, et cetera. So I don't know how to do that in a way that would be clearly better than
*  what is going on right now. So maybe I could. I will keep thinking about it. I'm very happy to
*  get, you know, keep suggesting things like that. I don't want to dissuade people even though I
*  haven't done anything radical like that. I'm still very open to the possibilities. So who knows?
*  That's the great thing about having your own podcast. I can do whatever I want. I could make
*  it all me talking to my cats from now on. Maybe that would double my listenership. I don't know.
*  But the cats don't tend to talk back unless I just literally put them in their little cat carriers.
*  And then they'd be making noises, but it would not be talking to me in a comprehensible way.
*  So it's not really in the spirit of the podcast per se. That's how we are. That's where we are
*  right now. Hope you're enjoying the podcast as it is, and I'll see you next month. Bye-bye.
*  Bye.
