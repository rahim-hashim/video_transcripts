It’s too easy to take laws of nature for granted. Sure, gravity is pulling us toward Earth today; but how do we know it won’t be pushing us away tomorrow? We extrapolate from past experience to future expectation, but what allows us to do that? “Humeans” (after David Hume, not a misspelling of “human”) think that what exists is just what actually happens in the universe, and the laws are simply convenient summaries of what happens. “Anti-Humeans” think that the laws have a reality of their own, bringing what happens next into existence. The debate has implications for the notion of possible worlds, and thus for counterfactuals and causation — would Y have happened if X hadn’t happened first? Ned Hall and I have a deep conversation that started out being about causation, but we quickly realized we had to get a bunch of interesting ideas on the table first. What we talk about helps clarify how we should think about our reality and others.

Edward (Ned) Hall received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Princeton University. He is currently Department Chair and Norman E. Vuilleumier Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University. According to his web page, “I work on a range of topics in metaphysics and epistemology that overlap with philosophy of science. (Which is to say: the best topics in metaphysics and epistemology.)” He is the coauthor (with L.A. Paul) of Causation: A User’s Guide.

# Mindscape 76 | Ned Hall on Possible Worlds and the Laws of Nature
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 09, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VryPxPKfZpQ)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean
*  Carroll and you know if you're a longtime listener that I tend to mix
*  things up from week to week. The episodes are not really related to each other for
*  the most part, but this week's episode can in some sense be thought of as a
*  philosophical companion piece to last week's episode. Last week we had Max
*  Tegmark talking about the mathematical multiverse. Today we have Ned Hall who's
*  a philosopher, in fact chair of the philosophy department at Harvard
*  University, who's done absolutely important work on causality, on the laws
*  of nature, and also on the idea of possible worlds. The philosopher David
*  Lewis, who is very well known in philosophy circles, although less well
*  known to the general public, examined this idea of all possible worlds and how
*  they could be related to each other, not physically, not sort of causally, but the
*  different ways in which they differed from each other and how those ways
*  entered into our analysis of counterfactual conditions, examining
*  possibilities that didn't actually come true in our universe. So I talked with
*  Ned about causation and the laws of physics, as I said, and how we analyzed
*  these ideas in the context of imagining all the different possible universes out
*  there. Now Lewis thought that all the different possible universes were
*  actually real, that they actually existed. That's very close to Max Tegmark's idea
*  of a mathematical universe where every mathematical structure actually exists.
*  But it's a little bit different. I think you can actually use the idea of possible
*  worlds in a way that doesn't necessitate that you believe that they're all real.
*  But whatever your position on that is, we're gonna get there today. This is a
*  wonderful conversation. Ned is just a true genius at taking esoteric
*  philosophical ideas and bringing them down to earth and making them very
*  understandable. So let's go!
*  Ned Hall, thanks for being on the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Oh, delighted.
*  You're a real honest philosopher, which I take it in some sense, is it
*  unfair to think of what philosophers do as taking sort of the common sense
*  questions we all have and then taking them super duper seriously and digging
*  into them?
*  I think that's fair. I think that's fair. Sometimes questions will arise along the
*  way that you didn't anticipate and they don't have any clear common sense
*  analog. So some of these questions you know about. So if we're talking about
*  foundations of quantum mechanics, we could ask questions like, how do you get
*  a world of middle-sized dry goods that seem to have a kind of relatively clear
*  geometrical arrangement in space out of something as weird as a quantum
*  mechanical wave function?
*  Yeah, I wish the physicists would take that question a lot more seriously
*  than they do. But yeah, philosophers are definitely there. But it starts with
*  looking at an object and going, what's this?
*  That's right. Yeah. So even that question, you could think, goes back to a
*  question that I gather was like very prominent in Aristotle. You pick
*  something out in the world that's familiar and you ask, what is it? And
*  there's a certain way of asking that question where you have in mind a kind
*  of a certain kind of answer. So if I point to that book on the table and ask,
*  what is it? You're not answering the question appropriately if you say, oh,
*  it's Ned's copy of this report.
*  It doesn't capture the essence somehow, capturing the essence of things. So
*  there's many questions that we could start with, but I know the one that you've
*  written about quite a bit and also I am personally interested in is the idea of
*  causation or causality, cause and effect. What is your favorite word there,
*  causation, causality?
*  Oh, I'm ecumenical. I used to be, for some reason, I have no idea why,
*  but I used to bristle when people said causality. I don't know why. That's not
*  the way I learned it, but it's the same thing.
*  Yeah, okay, good. So roughly speaking in our everyday lives, in the folk image we
*  have of the world, the manifest image, we are always talking about causes and
*  effect. I got sick because I had bad sushi or whatever. And therefore, the
*  philosophers like to analyze this. So why is it even hard? What are the
*  mysteries that pop up when we try to ask what do you mean by causation?
*  Oh boy, so there are mysteries, I think, along a number of different axes.
*  So one of them we might get to later if we talk about laws of nature.
*  But when we talk about cause and effect, that kind of talk goes along with other
*  kind of talk, like talk of the powers of things. So for example, suppose you have
*  a headache and you take some ibuprofen and your headache goes away and you say
*  it went away because you took the ibuprofen. We would happily add, right,
*  ibuprofen has the power or capacity to cure headaches. And that talk of powers
*  and capacities seems to introduce a dimension to our sort of picture of the
*  world that's different from the dimension we're focusing on when we simply give a
*  kind of blow-by-blow account of what happened where and when.
*  It does seem to add something over and above the stuff.
*  Something that in some sense knits things together. And for a philosopher,
*  that's like the candle to a moth. Sometimes we get burned.
*  We want to understand what is that knitting together?
*  And you'll find in the history of philosophy, radically different views about
*  this. Some people think, like, well, right, we just have to think of the world as
*  really having two aspects. There's the kind of aspect, again, that we get at when
*  we simply report what happens where and when, when we fill out our encyclopedia
*  of the occurrences that make up the world. And then there's the aspect we get at
*  when we say things like, what causes what or what has the power to do what?
*  Or ultimately, if we kind of translate this into the language of modern physics,
*  what are the fundamental laws that govern what happens?
*  So there are some people, philosophers and non-philosophers like, who think,
*  like, really, you need a two-factor view of what reality is like.
*  There's kind of the stuff that happens, and then there are the necessities,
*  the powers, or the necessary connections.
*  Right. As a hard-boiled physicist, but I will play the role today of the
*  hard-boiled physicist since you're the philosopher in the room.
*  I think I can just get along with just the stuff doing things, and the rest is
*  commentary in some sense. Is that one fair attitude?
*  Yeah. The question is whether you think that, how you think about that commentary.
*  So there is another kind of view, which has a long tradition, which says there's a
*  kind of commentary on that stuff, which should be thought of as a kind of
*  conceptual grid we impose on the way we think about the stuff that happens.
*  But it's a kind of mistake to think that that conceptual grid is latching on to
*  some structure that's out there.
*  Right. It really is a little bit extra in some sense.
*  Yeah.
*  But okay, but then there's another point of view which says, no, that there's a
*  fundamental feature of the world, which are these powers, I guess.
*  Right. And sometimes you can bring out the difference by fairly cleanly by
*  thinking of, you know, imagining really, really simple scenarios.
*  So imagine a scenario like this, like a quote unquote possible world that looks
*  like this. It's got two Newtonian particles in it and they sort of orbit
*  around each other because things are the initial conditions are set up just right.
*  So they orbit around each other in perfect circular motion thanks to the
*  gravitational attraction between them.
*  So they've got mass, no charge.
*  The only force there is the gravitational force between them.
*  And since we're Newtonian, it's not even gravitational waves.
*  So they can do this forever.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  And and it seems like I could describe that scenario in a very different way.
*  I could ask you to imagine a world in which there are particles and each
*  particle just follows a very, very simple, boring law that really permits no
*  interaction between them.
*  Every particle simply orbits in a circular motion.
*  We'll have to imagine that there's something it's moving relative to, like
*  absolute space.
*  Let's just let's just spot that so that we can understand what it is to be
*  moving in a circular orbit without reference to other material objects.
*  So so here's this alternative way to describe this.
*  There's one law. It governs every particle individually.
*  Every particle just moves for all time in a circular orbit.
*  And someone who thinks that talk of necessary connections or powers or causes
*  or laws is a kind of valuable, useful grid that we impose on the phenomena.
*  We'll look at this and say, well, these are two alternative ways you might have
*  of describing exactly the same thing.
*  So there really is no factual difference between these two possible worlds at all.
*  And of course, there's not really any practical need served by describing things
*  one way or another, because the world is so simple.
*  That's a simple world. Right. Right.
*  Like, you know, there's no prospect of being in that world and describing it.
*  There are no people in there to think about it.
*  Right. Right. Right. Yeah.
*  Because I didn't say these are smart particles.
*  And and someone who's on the other side will say, no, no, no, there's all the
*  difference in the world, as it were, between these two scenarios.
*  So one way they might try to bring that out is they might they might ask you to
*  consider hypotheticals pertaining to the worlds like they might say, well, here's
*  something that's true of the Newtonian world.
*  If there were a third particle somehow introduced, the motions going forward would
*  no longer be circular.
*  Right. Which is almost certainly right.
*  You'd have to set. I mean, you're better at this than I am.
*  You have to set things up just right to still preserve circular motion.
*  Whereas in the other world, where there's there's just a simple law that applies to
*  all particles separately, if you introduced a third particle, then by
*  stipulation, it too would move in a circular motion.
*  And so so for people on this side of this divide that we're talking about, it will
*  simply be obvious that there has to be a difference between these two worlds
*  because there's a difference in what would be the case were a certain thing to
*  happen. And then you might you could probably predict how this will go.
*  Like people on the other side will say, well, look, that conceptual grid that
*  we're talking about imposing on a reality is quite rich.
*  It includes talk of laws and causes and talk of hypotheticals.
*  Yeah. That's another aspect of the grid.
*  And so all you're doing is drawing attention to the fact that like the grid we
*  impose has this kind of rich conceptual structure.
*  But you haven't yet convinced me that that structure is answering to anything
*  that's really out there in the world.
*  It's a little bit difficult even to think too deeply at this level about this very
*  simple example simply because it's so simple.
*  And we inevitably think about those two particles as if they were part of our much
*  richer world and that it sort of enables us in some sense to ask these hypothetical
*  questions, whereas the particles themselves could never ask these.
*  Right. Right.
*  Right. Right.
*  So there's a different kind of example you could think about that connects much
*  more to our world as we experience it.
*  Although to motivate the example, I have to take sides on debates in the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  Go ahead.
*  No, I'm used to that.
*  In particular, how we should think about probability.
*  So so you're as I know, you're very familiar with.
*  There are approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics that say that the
*  fundamental dynamical laws are stochastic as it were, if we write down the equations
*  that govern how things evolve, those equations have probabilities written right
*  into them. And you can't explain away those probabilities as a reflection of our
*  ignorance about initial conditions or anything like that.
*  So let's just let's just grant for the sake of argument that let's imagine.
*  Yeah. Or imagine that that's the correct description of our world.
*  Like, obviously, we know quantum mechanics has to be fixed, but we imagine any way of
*  fixing it up is going to preserve this irreducibly probabilistic component.
*  So then you could ask, well, how do you think about that probabilistic component if
*  you're on one side or the other of this divide?
*  So for people who think that the world has this extra dimension, many of them are just
*  happy to include a probabilistic dimension as well.
*  And that will that stance will have certain like concrete ramifications.
*  For example, if I'm on that side of this divide, I think, right, there's just this in
*  addition to the facts about what happens where and when there are these facts, among
*  other things, about probabilities.
*  I will think that while it's likely that those probabilities are reflected in
*  observable frequencies, there's no guarantee of that.
*  We could get lucky, unlucky.
*  Yeah, we could get unlucky.
*  Like we might be unlucky.
*  Whereas if I think that no, talk of probabilities is just another component of this
*  conceptual grid, I have no particular reason to grant that possibility.
*  It's not even clear what it could mean for me to say we could be unlucky.
*  In the sense that the probability is nothing other than the frequency.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And you have to be kind of sort of careful about how you spell out that idea, because
*  no, we could ask embarrassing questions like which frequencies determine the
*  probabilities. I think those kinds of questions ultimately can be answered.
*  But the overall approach would be one that said talk of probabilities is a way to
*  kind of encapsulate in a mathematically elegant form a whole ton of information
*  about frequencies.
*  Yeah.
*  Or it might be information that we don't yet have.
*  So we could say our current best guess about what those frequencies will be.
*  I want to take a moment to talk about Peloton exercise bikes.
*  Longtime listeners know that I am not a mind body duelist.
*  I think that the mind comes out of the body.
*  And if you think that, then keeping your mind in good shape means keeping your body
*  in good shape. And of course, if you're busy, if you're trying to do a lot of things,
*  that can be very inconvenient.
*  And the Peloton home bike solves that problem.
*  When I visited the showroom, I was struck by the convenience that this idea provides,
*  because basically you can get on your bike and do the equivalent of a gym class
*  without ever leaving your home.
*  There's a workout for every different member of your family, no matter what your
*  fitness level.
*  And now there is a worry free trial, a 30 day home trial where you can try the bike
*  if you don't like it.
*  Within 30 days, if you decide it's not for you, you can return the bike for a full
*  refund. Peloton will even come and pick it up at no cost.
*  So this holiday, give the gift of Peloton for a limited time.
*  Get $100 off accessories when you purchase the Peloton bike by going to one Peloton
*  dot com. That's O N E P E L O T O N dot com and using the promo code Mindscape at
*  checkout. So I'm getting the impression my plan was to start with causality and go
*  to other places, but I'm getting the impression there's so many other things we
*  need to think about before we really do causality right.
*  That maybe we should finish with causality and talk more about things like the nature
*  of the laws of physics.
*  Like when you talk about laws, you've introduced these concepts of powers or
*  propensities. As a physicist, I hear philosophers talking about these, but they're
*  not our language as physicists.
*  So what are the different ways that we have of thinking about what you mean by a law
*  of nature, a law of physics?
*  Good. So there's one approach that's squarely in the conceptual grid camp that
*  sees talk of laws as earning its keep because of the way that concept of law helps us
*  organize our view of the world.
*  Right. So can I just rephrase that as there's a bunch of things happening, we perceive
*  patterns within it and it's a way of encapsulating everything.
*  Let me try to give an analogy that may be kind of familiar and easier to get a
*  handle on. Imagine you're a mathematician and you do number theory.
*  And what are you trying to do when you do number theory?
*  Well, prove interesting results about the numbers.
*  We have some background view that certain results would be interesting to prove and
*  certain other ones not so interesting to prove.
*  It's not clear where those judgments come from, but that's OK.
*  We can just say we tend to agree on what's interesting and what's not.
*  Like Fermat's theorem is interesting.
*  Like how many sevens are in the decimal expansion of two, the two, the two, the two,
*  the two, the two, you know, like it's not interesting.
*  And we also tend to agree on which statements about arithmetic are obvious, maybe
*  obvious enough that we would not feel ourselves to be any more confident of them just
*  because we prove them from other statements.
*  They're kind of starting point obvious as it were.
*  And over time, we hit upon a small set of those obvious statements that seem to do a
*  very effective job for us of organizing our mathematical practice.
*  What do I mean by organizing our mathematical practice?
*  Well, when I claim to have a proof of something, you can say, Ned, can you show me
*  how to get that proof from our small set of starting point statements?
*  And maybe we ask other things of those statements as well.
*  We want them to be powerful enough that we think it's plausible.
*  It's at least a reasonable hypothesis, working hypothesis, to think that we can use
*  them to establish or refute interesting.
*  Is it OK?
*  So these statements are axioms or assumptions?
*  OK, good.
*  I didn't want to sleep ahead.
*  So that was like I was being sneaky about it, right?
*  That was the reveal.
*  Right.
*  No, no, that's fine.
*  You gave up it right.
*  Just the right moment.
*  Like this is a view about what it is for something else.
*  This is a view about what it is for something to be an axiom.
*  And it's a view that's anthropocentric in a certain way, because it's we who find
*  these things obvious or epistemically powerful, powerful with respect to their ability to
*  establish or refute the claims we care about.
*  Maybe there are other desiderata we have as well.
*  But it's not like out there in the mathematical universe.
*  Like if we imagine like we're Platonists and we think there's a universe of mathematical
*  truths, it's not that some of them somehow shine more brightly as like being the fundamental
*  truths.
*  Yeah, OK, that makes sense.
*  As long as you're truth, you're truth.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  So this is a little like capsule story about the rationale for us humans who are interested
*  in number theory to single out certain statements as axioms.
*  And it can be used to justify a choice of axioms.
*  We could all agree that in certain senses, it's objective what the axioms are.
*  What do I mean by that?
*  Well, I mean, we find ourselves agreeing on what's a good choice.
*  Things could have turned out differently.
*  You could imagine a race of creatures who can think about numbers.
*  But there's vast disparity between those creatures as to which statements about the numbers they
*  find obvious.
*  Right.
*  But you think two plus two is four is obvious.
*  But maybe you can't.
*  Maybe you think you can imagine those people, but maybe really every set of rational people
*  would agree.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And that which is an interesting conjecture.
*  Maybe like now we're getting into really deep waters.
*  Maybe there's something about the nature of rational thought itself that kind of grounds
*  or explains why we find some obvious or some not.
*  And that would be very cool if someone could establish that.
*  But even if that's not the case, that doesn't need to be a threat.
*  We could still say, look, it's enough for us to have an agreed upon way of organizing
*  our view of the world.
*  And I kind of like that as an analogy for the way that this one camp might as well give
*  them a label.
*  I'll call them Humians after David Hume, because he was this Scottish philosopher who famously
*  denied that there are any real necessary connections in the world.
*  So Hume is on the side like there's a bunch of stuff happening and we impose some way
*  of talking about it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Love it.
*  So that's one way to go.
*  And then a number of interesting questions arise.
*  What is the best way to organize our view of the world?
*  The example of axioms is maybe overly simple in some respects, because it's a little too
*  easy to spot the interests of ours that are served by singling out axioms.
*  Whereas when it comes to laws of nature, there are all sorts of interests that might be served.
*  Now there's a lot of things that people will call them the anti-Humian side would say in
*  response.
*  But I think one place to focus, which is a place that many of them will want to put pressure,
*  is on a particular use that we put concepts like the law of nature to, which is in explanations
*  of phenomena, not just predictions, but explanations.
*  And here you can see that the analogy with mathematics is beginning to weaken and maybe
*  break down.
*  Yeah, this is more science.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Because I think there is such a thing as explanation in mathematics.
*  Presumably mathematicians in our audience are going to be nodding vigorously here.
*  But it's not the same as scientific explanation.
*  In scientific explanation, it actually looks like one thing that we do routinely in giving
*  scientific explanations is talk about not just what happens, but what would have happened
*  if things had been different in certain ways.
*  So here's a nice example.
*  And you can correct me if I've got the physics wrong on this.
*  But my understanding of Newton is that in the Principia, when he argued for the 1 over
*  r squared force law for gravity, the argument was not that it was this law as opposed to
*  alternatives, like maybe the force varies directly with r or with 1 over r cubed or
*  something else.
*  The argument was not, well, look, 1 over r squared gives you elliptical motion.
*  It's true that it does.
*  And it's true that other forces don't.
*  But and this is I have this on the authority of my spies.
*  It's not I've not read the Principia.
*  So audience, go and check.
*  At the time that Newton was writing, the empirical data was not precise enough to distinguish
*  an ellipse from the other sorts of curves that would have been given by other force
*  laws.
*  Well, I'm pretty sure that it was good enough to distinguish between that and 1 over r cubed.
*  Yeah, but there are other but I think you're right.
*  There are things that would have done just as good a job empirically.
*  Yeah.
*  However, the 1 over r squared law gives you a different prediction if you've got other
*  planets in the solar system besides the Earth, which is that the axis of the ellipse as a
*  planet goes around the sun, you just focus on the long axis of the ellipse that it traces
*  out.
*  And it itself rotates over time, which it wouldn't if the other planets weren't there.
*  Now notice what I just said.
*  There would be no procession of these orbits.
*  I think that's the right term.
*  If there weren't other planets.
*  No.
*  So I'll say it again.
*  Like we Newton puts us in a position to evaluate a hypothetical.
*  If there had been no other planets, then this orbit would not have processed.
*  And that actually looks like it's an explanation of the procession of the orbits.
*  And it looks like an explanation that cites not just facts about what does happen, but
*  facts about what would have happened.
*  And how do we make sense of that?
*  Well, thankfully, according to these anti-humans, we've got laws to appeal to.
*  And those laws actually dictate not just facts about what happens, because they're sort of
*  more ontologically robust than that.
*  They dictate facts about what would have happened.
*  And they are what allow us to kind of use these counterfactuals in a rigorous and controlled
*  fashion.
*  And we need to use them because otherwise we can't explain anything.
*  And I think behind this is like a much, much sort of more fundamental, maybe fundamental
*  in the sense of slightly murky thought, which is that to explain phenomena in the world,
*  it's not enough simply to add to your description of them.
*  It's not your kind of blow-by-blow description of their surroundings, say.
*  But to explain why something is the case, you have to give information about what it
*  constrains it to be that way.
*  And this, so I think that you're building up to, or maybe you've already achieved the
*  motivation of the anti-humian viewpoint.
*  But as a humian, should I really be bothered by any of this?
*  I mean, I can contemplate subjunctive situations, counterfactual.
*  I can ask like what would have happened under other circumstances.
*  So in other words, as a humian, I think I can look at the actual world, distill laws
*  from it, and then use those laws to say what would have happened in other circumstances.
*  So what am I gaining by this anti-humian addition?
*  Well, if you can do that, you might think that you could, if you wanted to, describe
*  those hypothetical situations with reference to any of a number of candidate laws, as long
*  as those laws agree on the facts, on what actually happens.
*  They're all, as far as the world is concerned, equally good in the same way that different
*  axiom mutations of arithmetic are equally good as far as the mathematical truths are
*  concerned.
*  Like you don't want to include in an axiom a mathematical falsehood, but as long as you've
*  got truths, math doesn't care.
*  The only constraint on the choice in the case of mathematics seems to be that we care about
*  using some rather than others because it suits our purposes.
*  But it can sound awkward to think that which explanatory counterfactuals are true is somehow
*  relative to our purposes and interests in marking out certain claims as the laws rather
*  than others.
*  Okay.
*  I think I'm getting it actually, so remarkably in real time.
*  But test me on this.
*  So if I'm a true humian and I think that the so-called laws of nature are just convenient
*  encapsulations of what actually happens in our actual world, that makes it harder to
*  talk about other possible worlds, right?
*  How do I know which features of our world to extend to those worlds?
*  Yeah.
*  And you can stipulate that.
*  You can say, for my present purposes, I'm going to stipulate that the possible worlds
*  I'm going to consider are all worlds in which the following statements are true.
*  And now we sort of write down the things that we're treating as laws.
*  And if you've got a stipulation like that, then you're okay.
*  The worry that the anti-humian has with this approach is that the stipulation seems like
*  it's governed by questions about what's useful to us, whereas what's explanatory, what's
*  genuinely explanatory shouldn't be governed by those questions.
*  I can give you another example.
*  I'm sort of curious what you think about this.
*  But it's another example that we could see as like an intuition pump.
*  This is a phrase Foster's like to use, to try and sort of tempt you over to the dark
*  side of anti-humanism.
*  So imagine that some number of years from now, we're imagining kind of utopian future
*  where there's world harmony and we've solved global warming and we're all human sort of
*  resources are now devoted to doing fundamental physics because we've all realized what a
*  great pastime that is.
*  So no wars, just like lots of fundamental physics.
*  Everyone gets a job.
*  All the post-docs you want.
*  And we've reached the point where we realized that in order to test the two sort of remaining
*  candidates for what the correct theory of fundamental physics is like, we need to build
*  this like superclator that rings the equator so that we can achieve high enough energies
*  and so on.
*  And we built it and we've got the test set up and we realized that the experiment we're
*  going to run is going to achieve conditions that we can plausibly say have never been
*  achieved in the history of the cosmos and absent our intervention on this case will
*  never be achieved unless there's some other intelligence that does this.
*  So these are unique conditions.
*  And now someone sort of comes rushing in as we're about to like fire up the experiment
*  and says like, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop everything.
*  I've just done some calculations.
*  We've got these two theories, A and B. If theory A is correct, the test will go beautifully
*  and in fact will give us results that will show us that theory A is correct.
*  But we haven't been careful enough in working out the ramifications of theory B. If theory
*  B is correct, this test will set off a new Big Bang.
*  This is uncomfortably close to arguments people actually had when we turned on the Lord Tadder
*  on the light.
*  So that's not such a thought experiment.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, if you're an anti-humian, here's how you will think about the practical situation
*  we face.
*  You'll think there's just a fact of the matter about which laws are correct.
*  Of course, we could have gotten everything wrong.
*  No, we could have been unlucky and deceived and it's really theory C that's correct.
*  But we've done our job well and so we have entitlement to think that the true fundamental
*  laws are either A or B. And that's just a fact that's given independently of what happens,
*  as long as what happens is consistent with them.
*  It's a kind of behind the scenes.
*  The rules of the game are either the A rules or the B rules and we simply don't know which
*  are the correct rules yet.
*  And so we can reason if they are the B rules for all we know they are the B rules and so
*  maybe we want to be cautious and not run the experiment because for all we know we
*  might destroy the world now or we started over without us in it.
*  If you're a humian and you think that what laws are simply something like highly useful
*  summaries of what happens, it's really hard to know how to think about this because if
*  we don't do the experiment, then the remember I said that the experiment is going to achieve
*  conditions that are unique in the history of the world.
*  If we don't run the experiment, then there will be no such conditions to as we're include
*  in the summary.
*  There's no fact to discern a regularity.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So it looks like you ought to say if we don't do the experiment, then it's simply indeterminate
*  whether the laws are the A laws or the B laws.
*  That's not the way we would actually think about this.
*  So a humian could say, well, right, our thinking is infected by a kind of certain anti-humian
*  elements.
*  And some humians will actually point to history here.
*  They'll say if you look at how physics arose in, say, the 17th and 18th century, it was
*  against a kind of theological background.
*  So someone like Newton would have happily said in writing down the laws, I'm literally
*  seeing into the mind of God.
*  Like laws are God's commandments.
*  And if you had that view, that's a very anti-humian view.
*  Oh, that's the most anti-humian you can get, I presume.
*  Yeah.
*  But the humian might say, look, we should have outgrown that.
*  So in offering this thought experiment, partly I'm offering it just because I think it's
*  fun to think about.
*  Yeah.
*  You get to do that as a philosopher.
*  But I don't mean to be suggesting it's somehow decisive in favor of the anti-humian, but
*  it does show, I think, that there's a kind of deep-seated component in the way we think
*  about the world that the anti-humian is latching onto.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't it evidence against the anti-humian view that there is no famous champion whose
*  name we can attach to this view?
*  Like we can for the humian view.
*  Maybe that's right.
*  I suppose an anti-humian might say, well, that's just because, like, it's...
*  Every smart person agrees, I guess.
*  Yeah.
*  Why are we calling it the humian view?
*  What does David Hume have to say about this?
*  Well, so famously, Hume, as you mentioned before, did deny that there are any real
*  necessities in nature.
*  And for reasons I don't fully understand, he's now kind of the historical standard
*  bearer for that view.
*  I say that because usually in philosophy, when you find some philosopher who's famous
*  for advocating some interesting idea, you can find some predecessor.
*  Yes.
*  I did too.
*  It has to stop somewhere.
*  Right.
*  But Hume was relatively late in the day.
*  But Hume's own approach was kind of interesting and detailed and well thought
*  out enough to have a lasting impact.
*  He added something to the mix that we haven't really talked about, which is a kind
*  of view that we humans naturally tend to project kind of features of our psychology
*  out into the world.
*  So one example that might be familiar or be kind of easy to grasp is color.
*  We see the world as colored.
*  Maybe it is, but maybe it isn't.
*  No, maybe it's just like atoms and no, like electrons moving around, like
*  reflecting light in a certain way.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, sorry, let's explain a little bit more what it would mean for it not to be
*  colored.
*  I mean, like you said, we experience color, but you're saying not to be colored in the
*  sense that it's just an illusion or it's just an emergent phenomenon or what do you
*  mean?
*  The view I'm imagining here, which I don't mean to be endorsing, but just to have it
*  on the table, is that it is an illusion, although unlike other illusions, like,
*  seeing a stick in water that looks bent or something like that, a highly serviceable
*  and useful illusion.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  So if you had to design a human, a human being with a visual system in a way that
*  where that visual system would help the human being survive and flourish.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's not really there.
*  That's the thought.
*  No.
*  So we could use that as an example.
*  It's very hard not to see the world as genuinely colored, but someone who thinks
*  it's an illusion will be like, well, the way our visual system works, we're kind of
*  projecting when we take the world to be colored, we're kind of projecting something
*  that's properly understood as a feature of the way we respond.
*  Well, sorry.
*  Well, we're having this conversation.
*  What mindset should we be in?
*  Do we know that there are things called, you know, frequencies of light that
*  correspond to different colors or are we sort of in a pre that perspective?
*  So this view got going pre that perspective, but where, where advances in
*  physics had gotten to the point where the, the, the so-called natural philosophers
*  who took this view about color were confident that, that the material world was
*  just material objects in space.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you bring in a more complex view of material objects where they have
*  charge and where they're, you know, they come in different fundamental varieties
*  of their photons and the electrical properties of matter can make a difference
*  to how that matter interacts with photons.
*  It opens up space for reintroducing colors into the world as real elements.
*  But in the, but for purposes of this thought experiment, we were honestly
*  asking whether or not colors are fundamental real things or just illusions.
*  Okay, good.
*  And so you might think like that's an example of a projection.
*  It actually occurs to me as we're talking, a much less controversial one might
*  be our judgments about like what foods are disgusting.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Good.
*  So I have, I have a constant argument with my family members about beets
*  because I know I'm very ecumenical when it comes to food.
*  I like almost everything except beets.
*  It's as if all my sort of childhood food aversions coalesced somewhere
*  around age 18 into beats.
*  Well, you know, this might be exactly analogous to color because it turns out
*  that a lot of people's visceral reaction against certain foods can be traced to
*  different taste receptors in their tongues, like something like 20% of people
*  really can't stand raw tomatoes.
*  And this is a, this is something that is so, so sorry for them.
*  Well, yeah.
*  Number one, you feel sorry for them, but not only do they not enjoy tomatoes, but
*  they get social approbation because of it.
*  Like they're somehow flawed because they don't enjoy tomatoes as much as they
*  could, but it's honestly just a physiological difference.
*  Right.
*  Whereas fortunately for me, beats are enough of a fringe food that I
*  don't suffer the approbation.
*  But you know, I enjoy getting these arguments where I will say, look, most
*  people just don't understand how disgusting beats are.
*  Like I know I perceive the truth about beats, but other people don't.
*  And of course it's a joke, right?
*  Sure.
*  And it's a kind of, for our purposes, an illuminating joke, because if I were being
*  serious, I would be committing what you might call a projective error.
*  I would be taking my reaction to beats and somehow projecting it out into the
*  beats as if what I'm doing is simply passively picking up on this feature,
*  disgustingness.
*  Yeah.
*  That's in the beats.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  And so, sorry, that is what Hume accuses us of doing?
*  Yes.
*  With our talk of necessity in particular.
*  And here the reaction is our own psychological habit of expecting things.
*  So if you're walking along and, oh, suppose you walk over a clear glass
*  pane and there's a 20 foot sort of gap underneath it, you will have a very
*  strong psychological reaction to that.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's just a vivid case, but he thinks these reactions to the world, these
*  expectations that we build up over time are legion.
*  And of course they are.
*  Normally when I walk along, I don't think about whether the ground will
*  remain stable under my feet.
*  I'm just habituated into automatically expecting it well.
*  Okay.
*  And good.
*  And so the connection to the laws of physics is that these habituations are sort
*  of our fault.
*  They're not there in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And like the example of color, Hume thinks it's good for us that we become
*  habituated in this way.
*  Right.
*  He didn't know about evolution, but still, so it wasn't selected Darwinianly,
*  but he could at least say, yeah, there's clearly a purpose being served by
*  understanding of their colors and patterns in the world more broadly.
*  Okay.
*  Mindscape listeners know that Pretty Litter is my favorite brand of cat litter.
*  Now, admittedly, it became my favorite brand when they sent me a free bag to
*  try out, but the reasons are legitimate.
*  This really is the best kitty litter that Ariel and Caliban here have ever used.
*  It's convenient.
*  They ship it to you.
*  So it just shows up at your door.
*  It's efficient.
*  It's a relatively small amount that you need and one bag lasts one cat for one
*  month.
*  It's extremely good at odor control.
*  There's not a lot of dust.
*  Pretty Litter is manufactured with a specialized de-dusting process.
*  So it keeps the area around your cat box cleaner than average.
*  And best of all, Pretty Litter acts as a health indicator.
*  It monitors your cat's health by changing colors when it detects potential
*  underlying issues.
*  You will not find that kind of innovation in conventional litter.
*  So you can change to a better kitty litter right now.
*  You can make the switch like I did today by going to prettylitter.com and using
*  promo code Mindscape, which gets you 20% off your first order.
*  That's prettylitter.com promo code Mindscape.
*  Does this connect to...
*  OK, so this is definitely food for thought for me because I tend to be a proud
*  humian on most things, but I think it gives me a good reason to wonder whether or
*  not I'm cheating in what I talk about possible worlds and counterfactual
*  situations.
*  This must be closely related to Hume's famous problem of induction.
*  How we go from seeing N things to assuming that it's true for N plus one as
*  well.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And in the context in which he was raising this point about our, as he saw it,
*  our tendency to project our expectations, our habits of expectations out onto the
*  world as if we're just passively picking up the necessary connections that are out
*  there.
*  He was very concerned to try to show that, as he would put it, induction, this
*  kind of thing we do routinely or indeed any kind of inference where we take some
*  limited data about the world and extrapolate it.
*  Could be towards the future, could be towards the past, could be towards the
*  small scale, could be towards the large scale.
*  Any kind of extrapolation like that was for Hume not rational.
*  For Hume, this point about projecting expectations was part of a longer kind of
*  investigation in which he was trying to argue, I should say, in a way that was not
*  received well by his contemporaries that are the kind of psychological processes we
*  go through when we extrapolate are not really an instance of reasoning.
*  That's what he said.
*  Crazy to any scientist.
*  You're saying that I'm not engaging in reasoning when I take in data and spend days
*  or weeks or months analyzing it.
*  So let's bring it down to earth.
*  What is an example of the kind of induction that he has in mind that we
*  are not reasoning about?
*  So a simple case might be we could go back to something like Galileo's experiments
*  involving freely falling or rolling objects.
*  Hume thinks that we shouldn't feel guilty about the fact that after conducting those
*  experiments, we all find ourselves endorsing Galileo's conclusion, say that
*  objects fall with a constant acceleration near the source of the earth.
*  But he thinks that we can't see that as a species of reasoning.
*  And the argument is clever and frustrating.
*  And to try to encapsulate it, the key idea is that in extrapolating in a case like
*  that, we seem to need to have as a background assumption, some kind of statement to the
*  effect that nature as a whole behaves in a uniform manner.
*  So before I go like fill out the argument, let me give a different illustration.
*  Okay.
*  Imagine that Newton had a kind of lesser known brother.
*  We'll call him, I guess Newton was Isaac, we'll call him Schmeisig.
*  Right.
*  That's what philosophers do when they want to introduce a character to the front.
*  And Schmeisig Newton published his own version of the Principia complete with a
*  gravitational force law, which had the feature that it said that the force between any two
*  massive objects is a constant times the product of their masses divided by the square of
*  the distance between them until the year, say 2020.
*  And then it just drops to zero.
*  And understandably, nobody paid attention to this.
*  Yeah.
*  You can see the trick here.
*  This is a way of fashioning a force law that by design gives you the same predictions for
*  any phenomena that we're presently in a position to look at or test, but differs outside the
*  range that we have direct access.
*  It's falsifiable.
*  It's a good time to scientific research.
*  But of course, this wouldn't be taken seriously.
*  No, as a kind of side note, I will say when I tend when I bring up this kind of example
*  in Fossil Science classes, there are always a certain percentage of students who want
*  to say, well, we just have to wait and see.
*  Really?
*  They honestly?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They think like, well, we don't know that gravity doesn't work that way.
*  But we don't know that we're going to have to wait and see.
*  So we're going to have to wait and see.
*  And then we're going to have to wait and see.
*  We don't know that gravity doesn't work that way.
*  But we can wait until 2020 and find out.
*  I mean, arguably, Karl Popper thought that way.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Like you just list every single possible thing that can happen and you chop them off one by
*  one.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And I think Hume would have been fairly impatient with this because he would have correctly
*  pointed out that we need to make these inferences, these extrapolations in order to act, in order
*  to know how to act.
*  So if you were kind of designing a probe to sort of send to Mars, you would design it
*  under the assumption that gravity is going to continue to operate in the way it has.
*  Not all of these hypotheses are equally plausible.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But Hume would ask, how do we-
*  So sorry.
*  So on the one hand, Hume is pointing out that it's a bit of a unsupported extrapolation.
*  On the other hand, he's saying, but we got to do it.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So I think that's the perfect of Hume's view that's unusual here, which is that he thinks
*  human reason- I'm going to kind of go out on a limb here because hopefully there are
*  no Hume scholars in the audience.
*  But the way I read Hume, he thinks of human reason as sort of like digestion.
*  No.
*  It's something that serves us in a certain way and it can serve us better or worse, but
*  it's a mistake to overinflate it.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So Hume is saying, you can't form a rational argument to extrapolate one way rather than
*  another.
*  However, you will find yourself inevitably extrapolating one way rather than another.
*  And certain ways of extrapolating are better for you than others.
*  A typical scientist not philosophically trained would just say, well, but look, the gravity
*  is the same tomorrow as it is today theory is just simpler.
*  Yes.
*  Therefore, I have greater credence in it.
*  What's wrong with that?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  The question that will now arise is how do we know, on what basis are we confident that
*  the world operates according to simple principles?
*  And here's where Hume's argument becomes clever because he observes that that very claim,
*  no, the world operates according to simple principles or as he would put it, nature's
*  uniform, that looks like an empirical claim.
*  And if you have the background attitude that any empirical claim about the world has to
*  by empirical data.
*  But you also think that the very process of substantiation in order for that to get off
*  the ground, we need to presuppose that nature operates according to simple principles or
*  is uniform.
*  Then it looks like you run in a circle here.
*  A little bit.
*  That's Hume's famous presentation of the argument for the problem of induction.
*  Good.
*  So but the conclusion of it, just to be very clear, because I think some people get this
*  a little bit wrong, it's not that you can't do induction.
*  It's not that you can't extrapolate.
*  It's that the ground beneath you is shakier than you thought, but you got to do it anyway.
*  The way I like to think about it is you might have thought that you could endorse with a
*  clear conscience this principle that any empirical claim about the world should only be believed
*  if there's empirical evidence to back it up.
*  But if Hume's right, we have to abandon that.
*  We have to say something like there's certain empirical claims about the world that we can't
*  give up on pain of just not knowing how to extrapolate at all.
*  And arguably in some sense, this line of reasoning, I must be getting this wrong, but somehow
*  this line of reasoning seems to be feeding into the argument you gave for being anti-Humean.
*  Because in some sense, we would have more justification for doing these extrapolations
*  if we attributed the laws of nature some extra property over and above mere regularities.
*  That's a really interesting suggestion.
*  And there's a lot of dispute within philosophy about that very question.
*  So there are some people in philosophy, in recent decades, you could find this argument
*  very clearly presented in the work of, say, David Armstrong, who's deceased now, but he's
*  a very influential Australian philosopher, who argued that unless we see laws as having
*  some genuine power or force, induction is irrational.
*  He wouldn't say it's non-rational, but he wouldn't say it was irrational with all the
*  negative connotations that word has.
*  But these philosophers will say, no, we need real necessities in nature.
*  Otherwise, if we take seriously the alternative, we should not expect anything about the future.
*  Except beyond the bland statement, something will happen.
*  The tricky question here is whether Hume's problem is just going to re-arise.
*  So one way to bring this out is against a kind of theological background.
*  So it would be one thing if we could say to ourselves, look, we have independent reason
*  to think that the cosmos was created by a benevolent, all-powerful being.
*  And back in, say, Newton's day, a lot of people did think they had independent reason for
*  that, believing that.
*  At any rate, it was probably not a good idea to deny that in public.
*  But if you had that view, then you could say, OK, the laws of nature, this goes back to
*  what you were saying, like the ultimate anti-Humean view is this kind of theistic view.
*  You say there are these laws of nature, there are genuine rules.
*  And furthermore, we should be confident that those rules are intelligible to us, that as
*  were the rules were built with us at least somewhat in mind.
*  And that would give you a positive argument for thinking that the world is uniform or
*  uniform enough for us to discover its principles, because the alternative is that God has this
*  very kind of malicious or at least mischievous attitude.
*  Subtle and also malicious.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  But doesn't the flip side work, too?
*  I mean, in the modern perspective, us being designed to understand the rules seems less
*  plausible than, well, sorry, the rules being designed for us to understand them seems less
*  plausible than us being designed to map onto the rules since we obey the rules.
*  Right.
*  We're part of this world.
*  Yeah.
*  So discovering things about it is maybe not completely wildy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's an interesting question how far that kind of perspective can take you.
*  If you have the theistic perspective, you might be quite optimistic.
*  You might think we can discover all the rules, even the rules that govern phenomena at an
*  incredibly small scale or at energy scales that are incredibly large and so not the sort
*  of thing we would ever encounter.
*  Because there is a worry that if you think that we are designed, our cognitive equipment
*  is the sort of equipment that will get us around well in the world.
*  That's fine for catching causal relations and regularities at our scale.
*  Yeah.
*  But you might start to get uneasy.
*  Like, great, why should we think that the cognitive equipment that evolution has bequeathed
*  us with is going to let us do quantum gravity?
*  Well, as someone who tries to plump for the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics,
*  I see the resistance because it's so different than what our intuition is.
*  But I try to make the argument that at some level, some point in the history of evolution,
*  we became, you know, touring complete and we can use logic and then we can just put
*  aside our, not put aside our intuitions entirely, but not rely on them entirely either and do
*  a little bit better.
*  Right.
*  So that gives us back to Hume's observation, at least if it's correct, that we seem to
*  need to operate in the empirical domain with some background presumption that nature is
*  uniform.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that's not going to fall out just from logic.
*  No, absolutely not.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  And so if we ask, like, well, suppose we posit these anti-Humean laws, but suppose just to
*  continue with the theological metaphor that we imagine like the rules laid down by a god,
*  but a god whose intentions we have no idea about at all, like zero idea about.
*  Many people think that they're really tuned into God's intentions, I have to say, but
*  okay.
*  So this would be a much more humble perspective, like, yes, there is a god, but who knows what
*  she wants?
*  No idea whatsoever.
*  Then, then Hume's question looks like it's going to re-arise.
*  Why would we expect those rules to be what we would consider simple?
*  No.
*  And it's actually, I mean, I've been doing a lot of talking about, I'm very curious what
*  your take is on what theoretical physicists think about standards of simplicity.
*  Well, I was going to mention it's been taken for granted in most circles that, you know,
*  beauty, simplicity, elegance are guiding principles when looking for new theories of nature.
*  It's come under a bit of criticism lately, most notably by Sabina Hassenfelder, who is
*  a physicist who has been saying it for a while, but I said more loudly recently that
*  we've been tricked by looking too much or trusting too much in elegance and simplicity.
*  And we do have this looming empirical fact about the world that we turned on the Large
*  Hadron Collider.
*  We had what I thought and what most people thought were very good reasons to think that
*  we would discover not only the Higgs boson, but a proliferation of new particles.
*  All of those arguments were based on considerations of elegance and simplicity, and they were
*  clearly wrong.
*  And so there's two ways to go.
*  Either elegance and simplicity aren't as important as you thought, or we got the elegance
*  and simplicity wrong, right?
*  I mean, that's always a possibility.
*  So I think it's still most people, including myself, think that, you know, elegance and
*  simplicity are extremely helpful.
*  Of course, the data have the final say, but when you're extrapolating, as you say, into
*  realms that we haven't actually done the empirical tests yet, of course, you put the highest
*  probability on the simplest thing going on.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And that's a very interesting observation, because one of the things that I think is
*  really fascinating about standards of elegance and simplicity is that they don't wear their
*  content on their face.
*  No, it's pretty clear what sorts of things would count as inelegant on any reasonable
*  way of understanding that, like my Schmeisig-Newton's law.
*  But that may leave a fair amount of room within the things that could reasonably be
*  viewed as elegant and simple.
*  Presumably, there's a fair amount of room for maneuver.
*  Well, certainly comparing Newtonian gravity and absolute space-time to Einstein's general
*  relativity, the beauty is in the eye of the beholder a little bit, right?
*  I mean, to someone who is not up on tensor calculus, general relativity can seem very
*  far from elegant.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So there's another aspect to this discussion, which is you may need to have a certain amount
*  of training.
*  This is a biased way to put it, but you may need to have a certain amount of training
*  to appreciate elegance and simplicity that's there.
*  I think that many worlds are very elegant and simple.
*  Not everyone agrees.
*  Oh, yes, it's probably elegant and simple.
*  But well, to be fair to them, the connections we are forced to draw between the underlying
*  formalism and the world of experience are not very elegant and simple.
*  And so if that's part of the theoretical framework, then granted, it's a mess.
*  Yeah, that's a good point.
*  My own instinct, I think I have kind of old-fashioned rationalist instincts.
*  I would have been very comfortable in that.
*  My own instinct is to think that the principles of elegance and simplicity should be seen
*  as good guides if you're down at the level of fundamental physics.
*  And then from then on up, things get messier and messier.
*  We might come back to this when we talk about causation, because that's part of what makes
*  causation such a vex topic, is that as you scale up, the kinds of relationships you can
*  completely track become fewer and far between.
*  Well, yeah, let's start moving in that direction.
*  For the argument in favor of taking anti-humanism seriously, it relied on various hypothetical
*  counterfactual situations.
*  And we tossed around the phrase possible worlds, and probably Hume didn't toss around that
*  phrase or Newton, but it's become very popular in recent decades in philosophy.
*  Was David Lewis your advisor?
*  Or were you related to him somehow?
*  He was one of my mentors.
*  He was not officially an advisor, but he's someone that I worked very closely with.
*  So explain to the audience why philosophers love to talk about possible worlds.
*  Oh, okay.
*  That's a complicated question.
*  There are all sorts of different reasons.
*  Let me highlight a couple very different reasons.
*  One reason is that possible worlds just seem like an interesting topic in their own right.
*  How do they become an interesting topic?
*  Well, by a connection to something that we could already recognize, if we go back to
*  your original comments, as part of our basic way of thinking about the world, that we seem
*  to draw distinctions between what could be the case and what has to be the case.
*  And for a philosopher, that's just puzzling.
*  What is that distinction?
*  Yeah, because we draw it all the time without interrogating what we think.
*  That's right.
*  And over the course of the 20th century, probably starting somewhere in the 40s, I'm a little
*  hazy on the history here, it came to seem that we could clarify that question if we
*  talked not directly in terms of possibly necessity, just using those words, but in terms of possible
*  worlds, where the intuitive conception of what a possible world is, is it's a way that
*  reality as a whole could have been.
*  Another way to put it, which is a little more illuminating, is a possible world is something
*  like a complete, consistent story about the world.
*  So just as a footnote, it's very different than the many worlds of quantum mechanics,
*  which are all just different pieces of the same world.
*  So we're using world to mean all of reality in one example.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  So many worlds interpretations of quantum mechanics would describe one possible way
*  for reality as a whole to be.
*  On that way of describing it, reality as a whole contains multiple Cosmoids, if that's
*  what the plural of Cosmos is.
*  Whereas for philosophers who are talking about possible worlds, there's no connection between
*  possible worlds in the way that there's a connection between different branches of the
*  multiverse.
*  So far so good.
*  We can say, look, here's a kind of convenient way to clarify and regiment our talk of possibility
*  and necessity.
*  We can talk about what is the case according to a complete and consistent description of
*  reality as a whole.
*  Which includes, just to make it perfectly clear, not only the purported laws of that
*  world, but the individual events that happen in it.
*  If I had not crossed the street, denotes a possible world.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, why would you want to talk this way?
*  There are a number of different motivations, and I'm definitely not going to do justice
*  to them all.
*  Some of them come from analyzing language.
*  You want a kind of systematic analysis of logical connections between statements about
*  what could have been the case and what is the case and what must have been the case.
*  Or you simply want to have a way of clarifying what I mean when I say something like this.
*  I could have been taller than I am.
*  So let's just pause over that example.
*  We can all hear that there's an ambiguity there.
*  On one way of hearing that, it's obviously false.
*  Wouldn't be you if you were told.
*  And on another way of hearing it, it's plausible.
*  And if you embrace talk of possible worlds, you can clarify the difference.
*  You can say, on one way of hearing it, I'm asserting that there's a possible world according
*  to which Ned, as Ned is in that world, is taller than Ned as he is in that world.
*  And there is no such possible world.
*  In any world in which I exist, I'm as tall as I am.
*  On another way of understanding it, I'm saying there's a world in which Ned, as he is in
*  that world, as height greater than Ned as he is in the actual world.
*  And so we see just in microcosm here how talk of possible worlds can help clarify distinctions
*  that ordinary language can kind of blur.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  And I want to mention the name David Lewis because I think he's probably the greatest
*  ratio of importance to modern philosophy versus public recognition.
*  Right?
*  Like most people on this page have never heard of him in a way they've heard of Vittgenstein.
*  And he took this, you know, he did a lot of the spade work in making sense of this notion
*  of possible worlds.
*  And he went so far as to say they're all real in some sense.
*  Right?
*  Yes.
*  Modal realism.
*  That's right.
*  And it's hard to overstate how dramatic this move is.
*  So so far, if you're hearing the way I'm talking about possible worlds, you might think, like,
*  all right, that seems like a useful device.
*  Exactly.
*  A tool.
*  Yeah.
*  Lewis wanted to say it's not just a useful device.
*  He wanted.
*  Well, he didn't just want to say he did say that that in order for us to use this talk
*  of possible worlds with a kind of clean intellectual conscience, we need to answer the question,
*  a version of the question that we started this podcast with, which is what are they?
*  No.
*  And it's not enough just to say their stories.
*  No.
*  Because Lewis would say, OK, stories in what language exactly?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Are these stories that are graspable?
*  Are they written in a language that could be understood by a human?
*  A little awkwardly, if they're stories, they can't just be any stories because they have
*  to be consistent on the usual way of understanding it.
*  And they have to be complete in that the story as it were answers any question we might pose
*  of it.
*  It's the whole world.
*  Right.
*  And completeness is actually related to consistency through the back door.
*  Because part of what we mean by saying a story is complete is that any addition to it would
*  render it inconsistent.
*  It's so full in what it says about the world that it couldn't say anything more without
*  collapsing into inconsistency.
*  There's some answer to every question you could allow to be asked.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But just focus on this demand of consistency.
*  Lewis would want to know, well, what do we mean by consistent there?
*  And for him, it was very important to give an answer to that that didn't just reintroduce
*  notions of possibility and necessity.
*  So there's a move he's making here that for people who are coming at this from outside
*  philosophy is going to seem strange and cards on the table, rightly so.
*  But the move is to say it's not enough to use this notion of possible worlds to clarify
*  our talk of possibility and necessity.
*  We need to use it to analyze that talk into some other terms.
*  So what do we mean by analyzing talk into other terms?
*  Well, it's helpful to draw on mathematics here.
*  So in number theory, we don't think of the notion of a prime number as a kind of primitive
*  notion like where, you know, like it's like jazz.
*  Like if you have to ask what a prime number is, like you obviously never worked with on
*  it or something like that.
*  We think we can define precisely what a prime number is in other terms.
*  And in philosophy and indeed in the sciences and mathematics, we very often face this question,
*  when should we take some term as needing to be defined?
*  When we should think, when should we think there's a if we're going to use this term
*  with a good conscience, we really need a story about how to understand it in other terms.
*  I, for example, think our talk of causality is like that.
*  I think we there's as a matter of good intellectual hygiene, we really need to explain our talk
*  of causation, cause and effect in some other terms.
*  It's initially difficult to do that.
*  Lewis thought we had to do that with our notions of possibility and necessity.
*  And he thought he could do that if in a two step process.
*  So first step to say that something is possible is to say that there's a possible world in
*  which it's true.
*  OK.
*  OK.
*  Second step, a possible world is literally a concrete chunk of reality as a whole.
*  How is it related to the chunk that we're in?
*  It bears no space time relation to our chunk at all.
*  It is in that sense, a completely separate chunk of reality.
*  Now notice something fast just happened.
*  I said it's a chunk of reality.
*  That is, reality as a whole includes the actual world and it includes other concrete material
*  chunks that are other possible worlds.
*  But didn't I say before that a possible world was a way that reality as a whole could be?
*  Well, you can't say both of those are the same.
*  The words are failing us a little bit.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And so Lewis recognized that and he said, right, when I say just to sort of lodge the
*  basic idea in your head that a possible world is a way reality as a whole could be, I didn't
*  really mean reality as a whole.
*  I meant our corners.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  So that's sort of the whole package there.
*  Parenthetically, MaxTagMark has reinvented and reintroduced this idea from a cosmological
*  point of view saying that every mathematical structure corresponds to a real existing world.
*  Right.
*  Does it corresponds to or is?
*  Is.
*  I'm not sure there's a difference, but if I'm channeling Max, then he would say is.
*  So it's going to get us a feel, but I'm going to say it anyway.
*  There's a measure problem in that case.
*  Like if all the possible worlds exist, one exists where gravity is the inverse square
*  law up until 2020.
*  That's right.
*  And why can we therefore say it probably isn't?
*  In our world.
*  So Lewis himself didn't have a lot to say about the problem of induction.
*  I think and I say this just from conversations I had with him, not from my knowledge of what
*  he's written.
*  I've read a lot of what he's written, but I may have missed something.
*  I think he thought it was just unavoidable that we have to spot ourselves something like
*  a rational entitlement to believe that the corner of reality that we're in, the actual
*  world, is simple and elegant.
*  Good.
*  So Max would like to say he so I think he's actually improved that a little bit.
*  He's saying like there is some measure of simplicity in the sense of algorithmic simplicity.
*  Like the way the shortest descriptions of the entire universe get more weight somehow
*  than longer ones.
*  And I think that he's just pulled that out of nothing, but at least it would help.
*  Yeah, that's interesting.
*  So it would be interesting to know how he would answer the following question.
*  Shortest descriptions in what language?
*  Well there you go.
*  But I do think that's an answerable question.
*  I think computer scientists think about that.
*  There's some universality.
*  You know, there's some, you know, in the studies of Clomol growth complexity, there's like
*  some wiggle room, but not infinite wiggle room in answering that question.
*  Right, right, right.
*  So that would be interesting to dig into.
*  There's a kind of famous variant on the problem of induction here due to Nelson Goodman that
*  involves like using weird predicates to describe a pattern.
*  This is the Gru and Bleen problem, which you may have heard of, which kind of arises.
*  Because the kind of example Goodman had in mind is very simple, like much simpler than
*  the kind that Max is thinking about.
*  But if you imagine that you go out into your garden every day and you look at your tomatoes
*  and you notice that the young ones, the unripe ones are green and the ripe ones are red,
*  you can describe the pattern you've observed in two different vocabularies.
*  You can use the familiar vocabulary, green and red, or you could use a kind of bent vocabulary.
*  Where you say something is, I'm going to change, for Goodman it was blue and green were the
*  things, now it's going to be red and green.
*  I say something is like, green if it's green up until 2020 or red and it's after 2020.
*  And I say something is grad if it's red up until 2020 or green thereafter.
*  The clever move here is that green and red are inter-definable with green and grad.
*  And so now we can ask, which is the right way to describe this?
*  We might say, well look, a world in which the colors flipped on that date, 2020 would
*  be a less simple world.
*  We should believe our world is less simple.
*  Well, it looks less simple if you describe it using the green-red vocabulary.
*  But using the green-red vocabulary, it'll look simpler.
*  It's the world in which, no, very young tomatoes are green and ripe tomatoes are red.
*  Always.
*  This seems to be a problem that could in principle be overcome because of the fact that these
*  concepts do not exist in isolation.
*  There are photons, there is the universe, and maybe there's not as much free play of
*  labels as we might imagine.
*  That's right.
*  So you'd want to look at how things appear when you're down at the level of fundamental
*  physical details.
*  Is there still the same flexibility available?
*  I think there's some flexibility there.
*  Like there's Hamiltonian versus Lagrangian mechanics, right?
*  But it's not infinite.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  And just because we have to cover so many centuries of knowledge in such little time.
*  So Lewis sets out this idea of possible worlds.
*  He supposes that they're real.
*  Sorry, do we have on the table the best argument that we should think of them as real?
*  I can give you what I think is the best argument, but it really demands a crucial premise, which
*  is that an account of possibility and necessity that doesn't analyze those terms in other
*  terms that have no modal character to them is distinctively inferior to an account that
*  does analyze them in non-modal terms.
*  And I don't know how to argue for that premise.
*  Lewis, in this famous work called On the Plurality of Worlds, employs that premise very cleverly.
*  And I indicated some of the ways, I guess I didn't give him proper credit, but it was
*  from reading that book that I learned this point about the best complete stories that
*  to make that account of possible worlds work, you really do need a modal notion, a notion
*  of consistency down at rock bottom that you don't analyze away.
*  And for Lewis, that was an incredibly serious cost.
*  Now, what I, again, don't know how to make plausible is why that was a serious cost.
*  And it may be that at heart there was this deep, humane sympathies he had.
*  He was a humane about laws of nature.
*  But it may be that that ran much deeper, that a notion, an unanalyzed notion of possibility
*  or necessity is just anathema.
*  Like there's something just profoundly mysterious about that.
*  I'm certainly personally skeptical about the reality of other possible worlds, but I think
*  I could sympathize with the feeling that it would make life easier.
*  If we have to keep using these in our talk, just believing in them, you know, just takes
*  a burden off our shoulders.
*  Right.
*  That's right.
*  And it is true that philosophers often talk the way Lewis would recommend that they talk.
*  We routinely say things like, well, there is a possible world in which and we don't
*  we're not careful about this.
*  We don't say there is a consistent story about the world according to which we just say,
*  no, there's this thing.
*  That's right.
*  And philosophers of all people are supposed to be careful about the fact that they have
*  trouble with maybe meaning something.
*  Good.
*  So I think this is bringing us back to what it means to be the cause of something.
*  Because when we say I got sick because I had bad sushi, we're comparing the world we live
*  in to another possible world in which I didn't have sushi.
*  Is that right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's not quite enough.
*  Right.
*  Right. Because not just any possible world, because here's a possible world in which you
*  didn't have bad sushi, you had bad chicken wings instead.
*  Still would have gotten sick.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's where all the fun lies, right?
*  It's like comparing how we compare the possible world.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  And there's been a lot of thought put into this recently by philosophers and non-philosophers
*  alike.
*  And a little backstory there.
*  Why are non-philosophers involved in this debate?
*  Well, there are a lot of non-philosophers who worry quite a lot about how we can draw
*  conclusions about what causes what from statistical data.
*  From data.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And again, this is an area where I'm no expert on the history, but I'm pretty sure that
*  statistics as a field started out in the early 20th century fairly hostile to the notion
*  of causation.
*  You can find, I've actually checked one important work.
*  I think it was Pearson.
*  Now, a book-length treatment of statistics early in the 20th century where there's a
*  whole chapter on why notion of causality should be banished from good science.
*  Well, Judea Pearl, who is leading the counterattack there, certainly is very vocal about the
*  fact that statistics as a field does not take causation seriously, to put it that way.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  But the early statisticians did have a point in the sense that it's, if you compare our
*  ordinary way of talking about cause and effect to the ways of talking that they were recommending
*  in terms of precisely definable notions of correlation, it looks like with respect to
*  scientific rigor, it's no contest.
*  The notions of correlation are so much more rigorous.
*  Again, it's reminiscent of the humane versus anti-humane argument.
*  If you know what all the correlations are, what do you get by saying that something causes
*  something?
*  Yes. Absolutely.
*  Absolutely.
*  And so that's a deep foundational question, I think.
*  And I think that if I had to say what the prevailing view of that question is among
*  people like Pearl, who are fans of causal talk, it's that you get the kind of knowledge
*  you need to help you decide how to intervene.
*  Because when we're deciding how to intervene on the world-
*  Which, by the way, is another hypothetical possible world kind of discussion.
*  That's right.
*  Right?
*  Like if I do intervene, if I don't.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  In fact, we probably should have brought that up earlier because that's, in a way, the
*  most sort of immediately intuitive way in which we in our encounter with the world are up
*  to our ears in hypotheticals.
*  We're constantly thinking about what would happen if I were to do this or to do that.
*  Or retrospectively, we might think like, oh, if only I had done that.
*  And someone like Pearl takes that kind of talk very seriously.
*  And rightly so.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever our philosophical stances are, we do talk that way and we kind of have to.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  With that wild thought experiment about the two theories.
*  No.
*  Because that evokes the same sort of thought that like, well, there's a structure to the
*  possibilities that's preset.
*  And when we're reasoning about what to do, we're sort of wondering what that structure
*  is like.
*  No.
*  So for fans of what has come to be called an interventionist approach to causation,
*  has lots of different labels.
*  The core thought is that causal relations are relations that, at least in principle,
*  are exploitable for purposes of manipulation.
*  So another way to put it is, our interest in causation is an interest in facts about
*  the world that we can use to settle what would happen if.
*  What would happen if you do one thing or another.
*  And you can easily think of examples where manipulation by humans is off the table.
*  We might wonder what would have happened to the dinosaurs if no asteroid had struck at
*  a certain point.
*  And for people who take this interventionist approach, I think you're supposed to see that
*  as a kind of natural extrapolation of a kind of way of thinking about the world that really
*  has its home in human agency.
*  And when you say it that way, it just seems so sweetly reasonable.
*  So isn't that just right?
*  What are the other possible ways of thinking about causation?
*  I think that that is an open question.
*  And I find myself in a rhetorically awkward situation here, because I think there are
*  severe limitations on the interventionist approach, which I can explain.
*  But it would be much better for my purposes if I could say, oh, and here's a nice alternative.
*  But it's actually hard to think of an alternative.
*  It's like string theory and quantum gravity.
*  Like, you know, it's the leading candidate and many or the multiverse is even better
*  example in explaining cosmological fine tuning.
*  I had Leonard Susskind on the podcast and he, you know, is a fan of the multiverse and
*  how it explains why various parameters in our observable universe have the added the
*  numbers that they do.
*  And he gets a lot of pushback for that.
*  And he says, just tell me what else it could be like.
*  I don't want it to be this, but I have a theory that predicts it.
*  It seems to work.
*  I'm going to go with that until you can do better.
*  Yeah, which which I think is a reasonable adjuice, especially for a working scientist.
*  I think you have to be careful, though, not to throw too many babies out with the bathwater.
*  So just to indicate where where some of the difficulties arise in the social sciences,
*  we might want to attribute effects to features of the world where it's not just that we can't
*  manipulate them.
*  It's not even clear what we would have in mind by manipulating them.
*  So, no, maybe your social class has effects on downstream effects on the kind of
*  opportunities available to you.
*  We think how do you manipulate someone's social class directly?
*  And it's important to recognize that the background idea here is that causal relations are the kinds of
*  relations that would be manifested in an ideal controlled experiment.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So what would be a controlled experiment?
*  And in the possible world language that corresponds to something like a minimal change.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  In fact, the cleanest change would be you have a godlike power to swoop in on the cosmos at some localized
*  place in time, tweak it while holding everything else at that time fixed and then see how things evolve
*  forward.
*  And in some sense, that's what Pearl tries to formalize in his causal calculus.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Though he's a little quietest, I think, about how the what the background is.
*  Like here for me, I come at this against the background of all the stuff we've been talking about
*  about laws of nature where I say, like, well, if you've already got in place, however you think about
*  them, humane or anti-humane, things that you're going to treat as laws that that tell you how to extrapolate
*  forward from any given complete state of the world, then we can kind of get some control over
*  counterfactuals that involve localized changes to a state.
*  No. But Pearl doesn't say much about that.
*  He doesn't. As I would put it, this is a place where I would want the counterfactuals that he describes in
*  his causal diagrams, I would want them to be analyzed in terms of something else.
*  Yeah. And that that made, who knows, maybe that's just an aesthetic preference on my part where he's happy to treat
*  that notion really as a kind of primitive and build a formal system around it.
*  OK. But you were giving us reasons to be skeptical of interventionist accounts.
*  Right. So if you think of like social features like like class is one, but here's one race, you might think that
*  that what race you have has effects on your prospects.
*  But that is a little awkward if you're an interventionist to try to answer the question, what would be a perfectly controlled
*  experiment? Yeah. No, in this case, or there are much more mundane examples, too.
*  They're they're everyday examples. So so you're right now wearing a kind of no sort of blue gray shirt.
*  Here's a question we could ask. How would this conversation have gone differently or be going differently right now if
*  your shirt were some wild Hawaiian print? No, maybe it wouldn't go to maybe.
*  Lost respect for me.
*  Exactly. What was that question? Yeah. Right.
*  Here's a way not to clarify that question about about the influence, the color of your shirt may or may not be having on
*  the course of this conversation right now at this moment.
*  We should not clarify that question by seeing it as the question.
*  How would this conversation go from this point forward if your shirt as a result of a localized intervention were a
*  Hawaiian print like a loud Hawaiian print rather than this nice blue gray?
*  Because the hypothetical situation we're imagining here is one where, you know, as it were, God swoops in, makes a localized
*  change to the pattern on your shirt.
*  And then we see how our conversation goes forward from there.
*  Here's how the conversation would go.
*  Oh my God, John, what happened to your shirt?
*  It seems to violate the laws of physics as we understand it.
*  Yes.
*  And once you notice this, this problem ramifies in the social and psychological realms.
*  There's actually a student of mine, Alex Prescott Couch, who's now a philosophy professor at Oxford, who really
*  pointed this out to me, at least quite clearly, how widespread this issue is.
*  He imagines a case where, oh, you know, there's a Joey is a student at a school and Joey has a child of a single parent
*  and gets teased a lot at school for being a child of a single parent because his classmates are kind of jerks and
*  Joey is stressed out.
*  And you might you might think it's a good question how the teasing is interacting with the fact that he's just got a
*  single parent in producing a stress.
*  And for an interventionist, the natural way to approach this question is to ask like a bunch of hypotheticals.
*  Like there's the actual situation where the variable, you know, the parent variable is set at one and the teasing
*  variable is set at one.
*  And what we should do is contrast that with hypothetical situations in which those variables have the other possible values.
*  Yeah.
*  And that works OK for some settings of those alternative variables.
*  We could meaningfully ask how stressed out he would be if he weren't teased but still had just one parent or how stressed
*  out he would be if he had two parents and weren't teased.
*  Here's the weird one. How stressed out would he be if he had two parents and were systematically teased at school for having one?
*  And as Alex points out, he would be in some Kafka.
*  He's like, dude, why are you doing this?
*  And whatever like whatever answer that question is, it simply does not seem to be illuminating the cause of question we were asking in the first place.
*  Seems like the wrong way to think about it.
*  And it's kind of the minimal change.
*  Yeah, that's right. It's the minimal change.
*  Yeah.
*  And there are other things, too.
*  If we think about protracted events like maybe Randolph, for example, smoked heavily in his 20s and he got cancer in his 50s.
*  And we're curious about whether his decade long history of heavy smoking caused his cancer.
*  Notice we're not curious about whether that puff on that occasion causes cancer.
*  We really feel like in order to track the causal relations we're interested in, we need to zoom out to a larger timescale.
*  So what would it be to intervene on that history in a localized way that doesn't introduce potentially confounding variables?
*  That's the crucial thing.
*  So very roughly and perhaps unsatisfyingly, the situation we seem to be in is talk of causation and whatever it means to talk of it does involve a comparison of different possible worlds.
*  What is not completely clear is how to do the comparison.
*  I think that's a very good way to put it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's interesting to me, especially because in science over and over again, we reach situations where we're asking and caring about different questions because of advances in technology, like quantum computing, for example, now that we can do it.
*  But in some sense, this is an example where maybe not within philosophy, but in the rest of the world, we're asking this philosophical question because of advances in technology.
*  Now that we're in the big data era and we can see some correlations, the idea of pointing them and being a good inductor or whatever, seeing some pattern and attaching some emerging reality to it is becoming more important.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think some social scientists who are fans of this interventionist approach would really emphasize this kind of point.
*  They would say, no, we're now in a position to do causal investigation or causal inquiry better.
*  And this interventionist approach provides us the right conceptual tool.
*  We now have the ability to use that tool because we can either do randomized control trials or the best social scientists are incredibly clever at finding ways in which nature has done that for us.
*  Yeah.
*  And that will give us insight in a kind of rigorous, grounded way that we didn't have before just by going and talking to people or living with them and so on.
*  But there is ongoing uncertainty, I think, within that field or even sort of outright dispute about whether we're losing something if we just sort of set aside as kind of unscientific or unrigorous those more, quote unquote, qualitative methods that have historically been very important.
*  But it sounds like there's plenty of room for useful, productive interaction between philosophers and social scientists here.
*  Yes, that's the hope.
*  All right. That's always a good lesson to end on.
*  So Ned Hall, thanks so much for being on the podcast.
*  Oh, you're welcome. It's been a delight.
