As each December comes to a close, we wrap up another year of podcasts with the Mindscape Holiday Message. Nothing too profound, just some thoughts that wouldn’t fit easily into a regular podcast. This year we’re talking about academic disciplines and cocktails. What do they have in common, you may ask? Listen and find out!

Mindscape will be dark on Monday December 27, and will resume regular programming on Monday January 3. Here are the two books I mentioned in the podcast, and the one essay:

The Aviary Cocktail Book
Death & Co Modern Classic Cocktails
Steven Weinberg, “Against Philosophy”

# holiday-message-2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 20, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGYMChTgu-g)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean
*  Carroll and this is the 2021 edition of the Holiday Message here at Mindscape.
*  The original idea of the Holiday Message was I wanted to take a couple weeks off
*  near the holiday times to just you know clear the mind of podcast oriented
*  questions and so I took one week off where in between Christmas and New Year's
*  that makes sense and just before Christmas I didn't quite have the energy
*  to do it but I thought I should reward all the wonderful people who are
*  listening here every week with at least some message to express my appreciation.
*  That's the real job of the Holiday Message is to say thank you to all the
*  many people who've tuned into Mindscape. Couldn't do it without you. Well that's
*  not true. I could do it without the audience. It might be harder to get
*  guests but I could do something. It wouldn't be nearly as much fun and I
*  probably wouldn't do it if no one were listening. So you play a very important
*  role here by listening and the original idea also with the Holiday Message was
*  to maybe do a state of the podcast address right to talk about what we did
*  over the last year the different guests we had. I found that that was number one
*  work which I didn't want to do and number two is hard to do because I talked
*  to a lot of different people a lot of different things. It seemed cheating in
*  some way to try to boil it down to a few themes and I thought that even if I
*  mentioned like some of my favorite podcasts others would get lost or
*  insulted or whatever they're all good. I love all my children equally. So what
*  has actually happened over the years over the couple years is that the
*  Holiday Message has morphed into a kind of mini solo episode where I just talked
*  about something I'm interested in talking about and so today that's what
*  I'm gonna do. I'm gonna try to keep it mini. I always say this is gonna be
*  short and then things get longer because I don't know I like to hear the sound of
*  my own voice I suppose but the topic this year of the Holiday Message is
*  disciplines that is to say disciplines within academia and also cocktails like
*  you drink at a bar. Now you might be wondering what do disciplines and
*  cocktails have to do with each other? Only one way to find out. Let's go.
*  Let me give a slightly deeper version of the thought process that went into
*  choosing the topic for this year's Holiday Message. One of the things that
*  did come up as a theme in the episodes over the year and also other discussions
*  I've been having elsewhere is the idea of agency. Agency in the sense that a
*  person, an agent, has the ability, has some power in the world, right? Some
*  influence over the world. Some causal impact on what happens in the universe
*  around them and this happens at a level of sort of philosophy. Where does agency
*  come from? Do we have free will? Things like that. It certainly is a crucial
*  concept in complex systems research where you do agent based modeling. A big
*  idea in complex systems research is that rather than doing thermodynamics or
*  statistical mechanics and treating every atom as a simple system that bumps into
*  every other atom, you treat the individual pieces making up your complex
*  systems as themselves somewhat complex, right? Agent based modeling. You let the
*  individual sub pieces have their own agency and of course it's crucially
*  important the idea of agency in politics today. If anything, as I've talked about
*  democracy and politics on the podcast and elsewhere, I've been more and more
*  struck with how many of our current political problems come down to people
*  not thinking that they have a voice, that they have any impact. You know, they can
*  vote but what difference does it make? The politicians are all the same and it
*  causes them to lash out in different ways and it causes the common project of
*  democracy to hit some roadblocks, some potholes along the way as you might have
*  noticed that we are actually meeting right now. So I've been thinking about
*  this like what gives people a feeling of agency? Is it true that we should try to
*  get that feeling? People have too much agency, whatever it is. So occasionally
*  like if something is not worthy of a whole deep thought I'll just put it out
*  there on Twitter to see what the responses are. So a couple months ago I
*  put out a tweet saying something like if you want to understand a position,
*  whether you know a position in science or politics or history or whatever, I
*  said the first thing to do is to get it from the mouths of the people who
*  actually hold that position. That is to say rather than learning about an idea
*  from its opponents, learn about the idea from its advocates. Not and take that as
*  the final word but at least understand why these people would believe this.
*  Right? That sounds like a sensible way to learn a potentially controversial
*  position. First try to understand why anyone in the world would believe this
*  and you're not going to get that without listening to the actual people. So that
*  you see where it's related a bit to agency, like listen to what the people
*  are actually saying rather than trying to put words in their mouth. I thought
*  this was an incredibly boring tweet that was almost you know a cliche and would
*  be ignored but a mini eruption came in the comments to that particular tweet.
*  People did not agree with me that you should learn ideas or come to understand
*  them. Learn is not even the right word but you know it's not like you're
*  learning some new bit of science necessarily but why do people hold this
*  idea? Listen to the people who hold it. Right? That was my suggestion and people
*  didn't like that suggestion. Many people didn't like it. It's always hard to know
*  on Twitter what people are actually thinking because it's a very very tiny
*  minority of people who are speaking and there's all sorts of biases that come
*  into who comments etc. But it was clear that a lot of people basically said well
*  what about the bad ideas? I don't want to learn the bad ideas from the people who
*  actually hold those bad ideas. What about the Nazis and the racists? You're not
*  telling me I should read what those people wrote to understand them. They're
*  bad and we know they're bad. We don't have to think any more about them. I
*  didn't you know I don't generally go back and forth on Twitter. I don't use
*  Twitter as a medium of discourse and conversation because it's really ill
*  suited for that. But if I had I would have said yes especially for the bad
*  ideas because it's the bad ideas. It's the ideas that make our skin crawl and
*  seem a little bit horrifying to us that it takes the most work to understand why
*  anyone would ever hold them right. If an idea is attractive and basically good
*  sounding then we can more or less work out why someone would hold that idea.
*  Whereas if an idea is kind of horrible to us if we want to understand why anyone
*  would ever hold that we need to talk to them and you know or read what they've
*  written try to think get a view into their mind and think about why they would
*  have come to such a conclusion. But it's clear that it's not just a few people
*  but but quite a large number of people who think that there's something wrong
*  about being exposed to radically different ideas from the horse's mouth.
*  Like maybe it will poison you or maybe like we already know ahead of time we
*  don't need to understand that etc. I don't feel that way. So that was the first
*  idea for a holiday message to talk about agency and the importance of talking to
*  people with very very different ideas than we have. This morphed as I thought
*  about it I said well you know maybe this is just a specific case of the more
*  general example that we should engage with people who are intellectually from
*  elsewhere right. People who come from very different points of view not just
*  politically or whatever but academically as well you know people who like many
*  worlds should talk to people who like pilot wave theories or epistemic models
*  of quantum mechanics and so on. String theory should talk to quantum gravity
*  people. This is something I also believe. I'm a big believer in interdisciplinary
*  engagement and cross platform and cross positional talk so that you can better
*  understand why in the world these other people would have these crazy ideas. You
*  can't figure it out for yourself. You cannot just reason your way a priori into
*  understanding why these people have these clearly problematic ideas right.
*  Whether it's innocent as in different versions of quantum mechanics or
*  something perhaps more darker in politics or social circles. So I started
*  thinking about that interdisciplinary engagement in academia and of course the
*  one that I care about is the relationship between physics and philosophy right.
*  Those are the two areas that I actually think about at a research level myself
*  certainly the most and maybe even you could say that was the only ones that I've
*  been successful at and they have guess what a problematic relationship physics
*  and philosophy. I completely coincidentally while thinking about this
*  came across Steven Weinberg's article his piece which I think first appeared in
*  the New York Review of Books but anyway was reprinted in Dreams of a Final Theory.
*  He has a piece called Against Philosophy. You got to love Weinberg who we lost this
*  year. He passed away a giant of physics but even though I disagreed with him about
*  some things including his views on philosophy he at least sat down and
*  thought about it. You know we don't need to name names. There's plenty of
*  scientists out there today who will just know zero about philosophy and poo poo it
*  just to get some cheap laughs. Weinberg wasn't like that. You know he would say
*  why he thought that philosophy was not worth taking too seriously as a
*  physicist but he would say it after having thought about it very carefully.
*  You know Weinberg was one of the people who I recruited to come to our Moving
*  Naturalism Forward Conference and he was you know he was willing to do it. You
*  know he wanted to talk to the philosophers who were there but at the
*  end of the day his position was no physicists should not be involved with
*  all this philosophy stuff and I disagree with that. So that is something that I
*  care a lot about getting it correctly getting it right. You know one way of
*  putting my position is you can't not do philosophy. That's a double negative but
*  you're always doing philosophy okay but you can do it badly and as soon as you
*  hear scientists explain why philosophy is not important you're instantly
*  witnessing them do philosophy badly. They will make philosophical claims that have
*  not been thought through or have been thought through hundreds of years ago
*  and we figured out you know what to say about them and they just don't know okay.
*  So it's a problematic relationship and you know it there's obvious reasons why.
*  There are differences in style as well as in substance between physics and
*  philosophy. I mean there's a bad caricature that some people seem to
*  think is real that says that physics or science more broadly is based on data
*  and hypotheses and you know we put out ideas and we let them be knocked down by
*  experiments whereas philosophers just sit in their armchairs and think and
*  that's an outmoded way of thinking that we should have given up on 500 years ago.
*  I'm not even going to respond to that because that's just goofiness that's
*  just not knowing what is going on. Plenty of physicists mostly sit in their armchairs
*  including myself. Plenty of philosophers engage with data in interesting ways but
*  more importantly I think that there is a stylistic difference not just this
*  substantive difference. You know philosophers dig very deeply into
*  individual questions. They're very very patient. The joke that I made in my first
*  trade book from Eternity to Here is that physicists are always really baffled
*  about why philosophers can spend so much time thinking about the meanings of
*  words. Whereas philosophers are baffled about how physicists can continually use
*  words without knowing what they mean and I think it's a joke because when you put
*  it that way both positions seem kind of reasonable right like who cares about
*  the meanings of the words but then again how can you communicate if you don't
*  agree on what those meanings are. On that side of the divide the philosophers will
*  be very very patient about really nitpicking about the definitions of
*  every word and going deeply into it. They want to get everything crystal clear
*  right like no fuzzy bits that are will clean up later and for better or for
*  worse that means they can get hung up you know you can have philosophers
*  talking about questions that were hot topics thousands of years ago and they
*  still think is a hot topic now and that can be very frustrating to the
*  scientists because scientists physicists or whoever their strategy is to dig just
*  deeply enough right I mean obviously physicists do have to dig deeply when
*  they're doing their work but not too deeply if you've ever if you're a
*  physicist or you've been a graduate student in physics or whatever not only
*  quantum mechanics but statistical mechanics and most especially quantum
*  field theory these are areas of physics that are everywhere right there are used
*  all the time every day there's a lot of questions one can ask in these areas
*  that don't have clear clean answers within modern physics and the response
*  of physicists is just to move on get on with their lives say it works it fits
*  the data right. Richard Feynman won the Nobel Prize for understanding how to
*  renormalize quantum electrodynamics and he never thought it really worked he
*  thought it was kind of cheating and I think that a lot of modern physicists
*  post Ken Wilson etc. would say we understand why it worked and that's
*  better but you know they did fine in the 1950s with this this patchwork of things
*  that just you know kind of worked right what more do you want the good thing
*  about being a scientist or being a physicist is that since you are working
*  in an area where you can ideally propose a theory and have it tested by data on a
*  relatively short time scale nature helps you right if you're asking why
*  science tends to make more progress seemingly than philosophy does it's
*  because science cheats by having nature corrected when it makes mistakes that's
*  a very very good way of making enormously fast progress and you know for example
*  these days when we have something like the standard model of particle physics
*  that is completely compatible with the data progress slows down in physics
*  because the data are not helping us as much as they could anyway so this is
*  that is just to say that it does make sense why there are differences between
*  physicists and philosophers but there's also an overlap you know so often this
*  question of physics versus philosophy is phrased as what good is philosophy for
*  physics right why does do I as a physicist need to pay attention to
*  philosophy now that's a completely wrong way of putting it I mean who says that
*  the the usefulness of any other field is what it can do for your field that's not
*  necessarily the right way to do it we should ask what good is philosophy for
*  its own sake not just what it can do for physics we could equally well ask what
*  can physics do for philosophy and my view is that in both cases what can
*  philosophy do for physics and what can physics do for philosophy there is a
*  small but crucial overlap most physics can get by perfectly well without any
*  input whatsoever from philosophy most philosophy can get by perfectly well
*  without any input whatsoever from physics but it's pretty darn clear to me
*  that there are specific questions within physics that are also within philosophy
*  in fact the I do think that there's sort of a systematic mistake here that
*  people are making but when we think about questions that physicists care
*  about you know many of them are like I said no philosophy whatsoever if you
*  want to figure out the phase diagram of some new material philosophy is not
*  going to be helpful but in exactly the areas of physics that I care about in
*  cosmology and quantum gravity and fundamental physics there are questions
*  that philosophers understand at least as well if not better than physicists do
*  questions about what does naturalness mean how do you reason anthropically in
*  large universes what is the nature of the arrow of time and causality and
*  locality what are the issues and potential solutions to problems of the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics or statistical mechanics these are areas
*  where philosophers have thought deeply about them and physicists tend to gloss
*  over them because that's what philosophers do they think deeply now
*  they're not that great at coming up with solutions because they're
*  philosophers they're not scientists right it's not their job to come up
*  with solutions the philosophers are really really good at diagnosing the
*  problems they're much better than the physicists are physicists are good at
*  ignoring problems when they're not absolutely necessary for them to be
*  confronted but philosophers know that these problems are there and they you
*  know try to categorize what all the different possible approaches are etc
*  and what would really be great is if physicists and philosophers really worked
*  together at these intersection regions right and the truth is that they don't
*  there's a little bit of overlap you know there's there's some good
*  counter examples to this wild generalization I'm pushing right here
*  especially in quantum mechanics that's a the one area of physics slash
*  philosophy overlap where they're really both physicists and philosophers who
*  talk about it but it's not as if every physicist who does quantum mechanics has
*  any idea what the philosophers are talking about and and they could you
*  know I recently saw a paper that surveyed the opinions of physicists on
*  the foundations of quantum mechanics and it's just embarrassing how little
*  factually physicists know about the different approaches whether it's
*  Copenhagen or hidden variables or many worlds or whatever there's just very
*  very basic mistakes that physicists make because they don't know what's going on
*  some of them know they don't know what's going on like there's a substantial
*  number of people who say I don't know but there were too many people who
*  thought they knew and was wrong and philosophers likewise philosophers have
*  their own workshops conferences what-have-you and don't always talk to
*  physicists and so as a result of that the questions that are within the domain
*  of foundations of physics like I like I mentioned naturalness anthropics etc are
*  not necessarily the ones that philosophers are training their keen
*  minds upon because they don't move around as quickly as the physicists do
*  jumping from topic to topic so you know they'll have their favorite problems
*  they'll think of them for a very long time there's plenty of room for
*  improvement in the interaction between physicists and philosophers and probably
*  this is a paradigm right for interactions of all sorts of different
*  kinds of things between economics and history and literature and what-have-you
*  so that was where I was literally 24 hours ago as I'm recording this message I
*  thought okay I'll do a little holiday message talk about that for a few
*  minutes and then I came home I was remember I was in Boston I spent the
*  semester at Harvard at visiting the philosophy department it was a good
*  visit by the way in case you're wondering but it wasn't perfect because
*  we're in the middle of pandemic and I had things to do so it was a little bit
*  of piecemeal the extent to which I could interact with people you need to like
*  set up an appointment right rather than just bumping into people in the
*  hallways most people were staying at home for most of the time which makes
*  perfect sense to me and I do not begrudge them that and it looks like
*  maybe it'll be worse next semester I don't know so maybe it was good that I
*  semester but anyway I came home and I was exhausted so because you know you
*  have to pack up it's a whole big thing now I'm home in Los Angeles with the
*  wife the kittens it's all good but chilling a little bit right you know
*  trying to relax and for reasons that are not perfectly clear to me we now own two
*  very beautifully illustrated books that are about making cocktails that we
*  didn't have these books when I left for Boston four months ago and now we have
*  them one I actually do know because I ordered it from the Aviary in Chicago
*  now I've never been to the Aviary but it is the sort of cocktail bar spin-off of
*  a linear which is my favorite restaurant in the world which I've been to several
*  times in Chicago I love a linear to death very inventive top-notch modern
*  gastronomy I love going there whenever I can so the idea of a cocktail version of
*  that is fascinating to me and I haven't been to Chicago for obvious reasons for
*  a little while but I thought I could at least buy the book see what they're doing
*  that was fun and then there's also a book by this bar in New York called death
*  and company which I think is a great name but it's really just a cocktail
*  book and I don't know why we have it it's possible I ordered it it's possible
*  Jennifer ordered it it's possible as a gift from a friend we just can't remember
*  we get a lot of books between Jennifer writing for Ars Technica and me having a
*  podcast etc people send us books I don't think that anyone in the cocktail world
*  has us on their mailing list but maybe they could add it to it after this
*  anyway so I'm enjoying like leaving through these books it's a bad thing to
*  do to read cocktail books in the morning because you're inspired to want a
*  cocktail and that's not a good thing to have first thing in the morning but it's
*  been a lot of fun just sort of leaving through it's exactly what my brain
*  needed and they're not thinking about physics or philosophy or moving or
*  COVID or anything like that just you know reading some recipes about
*  cocktails I personally love cocktails it's a big source of enjoyment for me
*  although I cannot drink too many of them you know I know that alcohol is a whole
*  problematic difficult subject in many different ways I'm sure that many of you
*  don't drink alcohol at all some of you drink a lot of it okay I'm in between I
*  do like both wine and cocktails not really a beer person but in the right
*  circumstances that would be fine also different people of course react
*  differently to drinking and so let me just say a couple words just so it's on
*  the table there I'm the kind of person and Jennifer also is who could have a
*  couple drinks and then that's it like we don't want any more than that probably
*  Jennifer's at a level of two drinks in the over the course of an evening maybe
*  I'm at three but it's really not just that we have the restraint to then stop
*  you know once we have a certain amount of alcohol in our system we do not want
*  to imbibe anymore and that's a good thing and there's there's actually sort
*  of two different thresholds that people have and there is interesting research
*  on the genetics of this because in some cases you can pinpoint mutations in the
*  DNA that are responsible for these two different things so one thing is how
*  quickly you get inebriated right like how many drinks does it take before
*  you're intoxicated the second one is once you had a couple what is your
*  response and some people shut down like that that's enough other people want to
*  keep going there are things out there called alcoholics famous there's a
*  famous soliloquy by Leo on the West Wing if you if you're a West Wing fan where
*  he explains he's an alcoholic and it's a plot point on the show because that's
*  was considered bad and he says the problem is I don't want to drink I want
*  ten drinks to a non-alcoholic like me that's just crazy I can't even imagine
*  having that many drinks and there is a genetic lottery as Catherine Page
*  Harden would have explained to us that it comes into this because I actually have
*  plenty of alcoholics in my family you know my grandfather would literally have
*  a little glass of brandy that he would put on the nightstand by his bed before
*  going to bed so that in the morning he would get a quick drink and you know
*  never not be buzzed during the day it's very very different than me let's just
*  put it that way okay so I'm not drinking too much I mean by some people's
*  standards I drink a lot by other people's not that much but I love the
*  idea of cocktails and I love the artistry of it and the craft of it though
*  the crucial distinction we're drawing here is between a cocktail which is a
*  mixture of different ingredients versus you know just a drink of some
*  particular spirit right a shot of whiskey or a snifter of brandy or
*  cognac or something like that those are also great there's a place and time for
*  having a shot of scotch okay but a cocktail is a little bit more artistry
*  you know you have to pick and choose ingredients and you have to blend them
*  in the correct way and of course like any good craft the people who are truly
*  into it will get very very into it right they will get very very detailed and the
*  writers of these two books the one from the Aviary the other from death and
*  company they're into it so you know what kind of ice you use and whether or not
*  you should stir it or or shake it in a metal carafe or a glass one you know all
*  these things they matter a lot okay the quality of the water it all matters a
*  lot and I'm not nearly at that level of caring but I am at the level of
*  appreciating the care you know it's not just about cocktails that's why I'm
*  happy to talk about cocktails here even though many of you are not into
*  cocktails at all there's a bigger picture there's a bigger point to this
*  which is that all sorts of different crafts can be appreciated for their
*  artistry even if we don't actually appreciate the outcome maybe you don't
*  like oboe music you know I don't mind oboe music but I'm not exactly a fan of
*  it David Paulitzer my my colleague at Caltech loves the banjo literally just
*  loves the banjo writes papers writes physics papers about the acoustics of
*  banjos he's played banjo with Steve Martin who's another banjo lover I don't
*  love the banjo but I think it's wonderful and charming that he loves the
*  banjo that much okay that's what's going on here it's about the love it's about
*  the the care and the precision and the sort of experimentation with different
*  possibilities that trying to find some sweet spot that makes the perfect
*  cocktail the perfect banjo diddy etc and this does deserve you know it probably
*  deserves a whole podcast by itself because it gets wrapped up in the idea
*  of fitness landscapes I love fitness landscapes originally the idea from
*  biology of course I talked about this in the big picture I'm not sure if we
*  talked about fitness landscapes in great detail but they come up in the podcast
*  conversations that have game theory involved in them like with Kaylin O'Connor
*  and Herb Gintis and so forth the idea of a fitness landscape is if you have a
*  again comes from originally biology evolutionary biology so you have a
*  population of different kind of species different kind of individuals within a
*  species and they do evolution right so they sexually reproduce share their DNA
*  there's mutations so there's slow variations in the actual genomes of the
*  actual individuals over time some specific instantiations of the genome
*  will have slight advantages when it comes to surviving and reproducing
*  that's what fitness means fitness is just the ultimate of the ability to pass
*  down your genes to the next generation so you need to both survive long enough
*  to have offspring and then be both motivated and able to make those
*  offspring okay and the interesting thing about the fitness landscape so the idea
*  is that the you know a species will evolve to go upward and upward on the
*  fitness landscape over time until they hit some local maximum it's funny
*  because biologists think that high values of a landscape is where you want
*  to live physicists who think of potential energy think that low values
*  of a landscape is where you want to live but that very similar concept anyway the
*  thing about the fitness landscape that's always fascinated me is the fact
*  that the peaks of it can be isolated from each other it's not a smooth
*  monotonic function it's not like you can take two very different species who are
*  individually successful and find a species halfway in between that is also
*  successful right the specific things about a genome that works if it's one
*  kind of configuration wouldn't work if it's slightly different but if it's very
*  different you're in another peak of the fitness landscape and you can also be
*  successful likewise with cocktails or with novels or pieces of music or food
*  dishes that you're making there's a fitness landscape right you can easily
*  imagine different ingredients working together and half of those ingredients
*  with half of the ingredients from another dish being a terrible disaster a
*  certain kind of arrangement for a string quartet would not help at all if
*  you added some of those ideas to a heavy metal song okay so the the sort of
*  jaggedness of the fitness landscape is a fascinating fact to me I would I would
*  love to know more about the general theory behind why fitness landscapes are
*  jagged in the context of man of cocktails it's that you know certain
*  ingredients work well with each other and this is the whole point of cocktails
*  and why they're interesting I don't know if I yeah so a cocktail I was gonna say
*  I don't know if I defined it but a cocktail is just a mixture of different
*  ingredients different spirits and some other liquid ingredients right juices or
*  whatever maybe sodas garnishes you can have things like that and of course ice
*  so you want to have the right ingredients balancing each other the
*  balance is crucially important and so the only time I wrote about cocktails I
*  wrote a blog post that was complaining about the idea that is prevalent in
*  certain circles that the best martini is the driest martini okay so what does
*  that mean for those of you are not cocktail drinkers out there a typical
*  martini is mostly gin some dry vermouth and then maybe a garnish maybe a dash of
*  bitters or something like that but mostly it's you know gin plus driver
*  moose there's also of course vodka martinis which are vodka plus driver
*  moose in the same sort of combination and even though the vermouth is dry sorry
*  this is a counterintuitive lingo but you know the vermouth itself is dry the less
*  vermouth you have the dryer the martini okay so when you will hear in different
*  movies or TV shows or whatever people trying to out macho each other in the
*  dryness of the martini so like just a drop of vermouth or wash the vermouth in
*  the glass and then dump it out before putting the gin in or wave the bottle
*  over your glass of gin okay wave the vermouth bottle or you know just pour
*  the gin in and then nod in the direction of your bottle of vermouth so
*  it's like a kind of silly competition to be as dry as possible but that's dopey
*  that's not right that's not a good direction in which to improve your
*  cocktails because then you're just drinking gin or vodka which is even
*  worse I mean vodka is fine but vodka is more or less flavorless a shot of vodka
*  can be good because it's in some context where you're you know I don't know eating
*  dark bread in the Russian steppes or something like that and fermented fish
*  and a shot of vodka okay and then the very very delicate differences between
*  different kinds of vodka and the mouthfeel etc can matter but if you're
*  just pouring cold vodka into a martini glass and calling that a martini what's
*  the point that's not a cocktail at all it's not even very flavorful gin is
*  basically vodka plus botanicals mostly juniper but other sort of botanicals
*  that's why different kinds of gin are truly different from each other because
*  every gin has its proprietary mix of botanicals that lends some flavor some
*  herbaceousness or floral notes to the underlying vodka some neutral grain
*  spirit aka vodka roughly speaking so I wrote this blog post to say look drink
*  whatever you want I don't care what you drink you know bring whatever brings you
*  pleasure is great but there's no superiority in making a martini that has
*  only gin or only vodka in it that's just saying you like gin and you like vodka
*  that's fine but the elegance the beauty the point of a good cocktail is the
*  balance of the different ingredients it's not just that you have different
*  ingredients as they play well with each other in a particular way okay in fact
*  let me read to you so just so this podcast episode is useful to you in some
*  way you will come around you'll come away from it with recipes for cocktails so
*  let me read to you the martini and Manhattan recipes from the death and co
*  cocktail book so mark you don't want any recipes from the aviary cocktail book
*  they involve you know high-pressure machines and you know crazy dry ice
*  concoctions they're a little bit crazy but it's an aesthetic accomplishment
*  but the death and co cocktail book you can actually make these drinks so the
*  martini is two and a half ounces of London dry gin three-quarters ounces
*  Dolan dry vermouth one dash of orange bitters and you garnish with a twist
*  okay so the point there is two and a half ounces of London dry gin three
*  quarters ounces of dry vermouth about a three to one ratio not a hundred to one
*  as the crazy out there extremists would have you believe the Manhattan meanwhile
*  follows the same template there's a major spirit there's a minor spirit sort
*  of play off against it and then maybe a drop or two of something else so the
*  Manhattan recipe is two and a half ounces of rye three-quarters of an ounce
*  of sweet vermouth which is the red vermouth for those of you buying in
*  stores two dashes of bitters and garnish with a branded branded cherry
*  so what struck me here is two things number one the proportions are the same
*  in the martini and the Manhattan they're very different drinks completely
*  non-overlapping ingredients in fact but two and a half ounces three-quarters
*  ounces and a dash or two if you squint a little bit you could almost perceive a
*  power law in these proportions it's almost like you know a certain amount
*  and three times of that and three times as much as that right start with the
*  bitters work your way up to the gin and the rye some people will also by the way
*  use bourbon rather than rye in their manhattans just like people sometimes
*  use vodka rather than gin and the martinis whatever you like the point is
*  that there's a certain amount of complexity and interest here in the
*  Manhattan and the martini this is one of the reasons why they are classic
*  cocktails over many generations people have tried many different combinations
*  of the different ingredients and they've settled more or less in the good bars
*  they've settled on something like this three to one ratio for these particular
*  drinks other drinks will have two to one ratios etc it is rare to find a classic
*  cocktail that has equal proportions in different kinds of spirits the Negroni
*  is a classic counter example the Negroni is the one drink and Negroni is one part
*  gin one part Campari or Aperol and one part sweet vermouth it works very very
*  well but it's the exception it is not the rule most good cocktails have a base
*  spirit and then you complexify it a little bit by adding these others in
*  greater or lesser amounts that's the fun the artistry the science and the
*  aesthetics of making the cocktails and the aesthetics are very very important
*  here one of the things about both of these books is that they're richly
*  gorgeously sumptuously illustrated and just looking at the pictures of both the
*  bar and the cocktails when they're well made the different shapes of the glasses
*  is it pretentious or precious you know maybe I don't care I like it it's
*  beautiful and I I need more beauty rather than less in my life so while
*  thinking about this contemplating it while going geez this is 10 a.m. I can't
*  actually make myself a martini so I will contemplate the aesthetics of it from an
*  abstract sense I said you know the holiday message for the blog for the
*  sorry for the podcast the holiday message shouldn't necessarily be some
*  ponderous weighty idea like interdisciplinary collaboration or
*  something like that maybe the holiday message should just be kind of fun and
*  light-hearted maybe you should just talk about cocktails and I thought about it
*  and I'm like mmm you know I just don't know enough about cocktails probably you
*  would be alienating for a bunch of people like maybe you'll listen to me
*  babble about it for 10 minutes but talking for an hour about cocktails
*  might be too much for a lot of people like even the wine tasting I think more
*  people probably like wine than cocktails but the wine tasting episode we did even
*  though it's extremely good and successful it was not as popular as you
*  know category theory episodes for loop quantum gravity episodes so I get that
*  and you know give the people what they want maybe maybe someday we'll do a
*  mixology based episode but I thought that I didn't know enough to talk about
*  it in an intelligent way like I have my preferences but I'm not a professional
*  mixologist I don't have one nearby so I thought that you know okay maybe that
*  would not be as attractive as the idea first appeared to be but then I thought
*  and maybe this is because I had managed to intoxicate myself even without having
*  a cocktail I thought maybe I can do both maybe I can mix up as it were the idea
*  the interdisciplinary collaborations in academia with the idea of cocktails
*  after all in some sense it's about balance and about interaction right I
*  mean this is why you don't want to have a martini that is all gin because gin is
*  fine but it's just gin it's not interesting and it's not boundary
*  pushing it's not trying to do something right it's not having different elements
*  in communication with each other talking to each other bouncing ideas
*  pushing in different ways right that's what makes a great cocktail when there's
*  a little bit of sweetness a little bit of bitter a little bit of smoothness a
*  little bit of edginess there that's what makes the most successful cocktails as
*  any mixologist will tell you it's about balancing different kinds of ingredients
*  you don't want to mix together things that taste the same right having said
*  that there are some very provocative recipes in the death and co cocktail
*  book that mix mezcal with tequila which are often thought of as two different
*  versions of each other but are subtly different and they have also different
*  cocktails mixing different kinds of rum together so anyway every rule has its
*  exception but the point being there is some family resemblance maybe arguably
*  between the idea of disciplines and academia talking to each other and the
*  different ingredients in a cocktail talking to each other maybe physics
*  needs philosophy like gin needs vermouth to make a good cocktail not because you
*  want to be mostly vermouth or all vermouth but it adds that little twist
*  that really makes it special something not just run-of-the-mill and I think
*  that's you know that not becoming run-of-the-mill I think that's the
*  important thing here when we going back to the idea of disciplines and physics
*  and philosophy so forget about physics and philosophy particularly think about
*  disciplines within academia more broadly the real issue about disciplines is that
*  they become too inwardly focused you know herb Gintis on the podcast with
*  them he made this point very very loudly and very effectively it's part of what
*  makes academia successful what the the modern university system successful but
*  it also holds it back in certain ways okay if you think about a department at
*  a university whether it's physics or economics or sociology or whatever how
*  do they work how do these departments work and for various reasons historical
*  reasons and mostly for good reasons departments are governed by their own
*  faculty the administration of the university plays an important role but
*  a lot of times that role is you know fundraising recruiting new students and
*  and things like that usually the provosts and deans and presidents will
*  have some say over how much a new department can hire but to a very large
*  extent who they actually hire is in the hands of the existing faculty members in
*  the department Caltech's president literally told me like I'm the president
*  I know perfectly well not to tell the faculty who to hire not to tell the
*  departments who to hire and that's because you know this is a it's for
*  many reasons part of it is academic freedom right you don't want to be
*  governed from the top the reason why the modern intellectual academic project is
*  successful is because it bubbles up from the bottom and you want to be able to
*  judge for yourself as a department what are the areas you need to grow in what
*  are the good areas what are the areas that are a waste of time or a fad or
*  whatever you think you know that better than the president or the dean or the
*  provost does and for the most part universities say okay that that's right
*  you know we'll tell you how many slots you get you can roughly speaking decide
*  how to fill them so that works to some extent it works really really well
*  at that focusing in on the different discipline a physics department will be
*  pretty darn good at hiring new physicists biology department will be
*  pretty good at hiring new biologists etc where it fails is when the physics
*  department wants to hire a biophysicist or even worse when neither the physics
*  department nor the biology department wants to hire a biophysicist because
*  they want to both hire their own people right so it's as if you had a bar
*  where there's a set of bartenders who only serve scotch and another set of
*  bartenders who only serve gin and another set who only serve tequila etc
*  those bartenders who only serve scotch would get really good at choosing scotch
*  and it's actually not a perfect analogy here because the disciplines are really
*  good at answering the questions that they choose to focus on you know I don't
*  know what your opinion is but in my opinion modern academic university
*  research is really good at the research it chooses to be really good at doing
*  and likewise in the bar if you only served cognac you get really good at
*  serving cognac etc but you're missing out on a whole set of more complex
*  interactions and experiences the cocktails the mixtures of different
*  voices talking to each other in different timbers and different volumes
*  and a university has trouble with that the same system that makes it very very
*  successful at digging into the disciplines makes it very very bad at
*  doing being truly interdisciplinary and a lot of people will give lip service to
*  being interdisciplinary but lip service is not good enough it's hard being truly
*  interdisciplinary as herb Ginty said on the podcast you know the different
*  disciplines not only have different subject matters sometimes they even have
*  the same subject matter but they have different styles different paradigms
*  different ways of asking questions different valuations of which questions
*  are interesting and which are not okay it makes interdisciplinary conversation
*  and communication very very hard remember Jeffrey West one of the first
*  guests we had here on the podcast very successful complexity scientist at the
*  Santa Fe Institute he was raised as a more or less traditional particle
*  theorist did supersymmetric phenomenology he decided he wanted to
*  move into complex systems in particular biological systems he got interested in
*  these alimetric scaling laws why is it that the metabolic rate and the weight
*  of different kinds of animals different kinds of individuals scales with each
*  other in certain ways especially quarter power laws why is that true was the
*  question so he said I got to talk to some biologists I guess but the point
*  is he it it took time you know he tells the story of for weeks and months they
*  would just get together and talk the biologists and the physicists they
*  weren't giving each other instructions they didn't even decide ahead of time
*  here is the result we want to get or here's the problem we're gonna be
*  working on it's just let's listen to each other let's hear what each other
*  thinks are the interesting problems let's let's get to know our the common
*  knowledge we have inside our discipline that is not common outside what are the
*  assumptions we make what are the things that we think are important and not
*  important you can only learn that by talking to people going back to the
*  original point of the tweet that I made back then and you have to decide ahead
*  of time that that's going to be a profitable thing to do and it's just so
*  easy to not decide that you know like when you get your PhD typically you've
*  been very very well trained in your very very narrow specialty and it's work to be
*  trained in that specialty it took you years right and now you're good enough
*  once you've been trained with the PhD you're good enough in that specialty to
*  write papers in that specialty and get a job and do research to now at this late
*  stage learn another discipline it's gonna be just as much work and you don't
*  have to do it because you can just do the work you're already doing and this
*  is why most people most professors despite the fact that they're smart
*  people best of intentions good-natured always originally driven by some kind of
*  intellectual curiosity why most professors kind of do small variations
*  on the thing they started doing when they first entered academia it's it's
*  the path of least resistance and it's successful you do learn things you do
*  dig deeply into particular ways of knowing as it were but I would argue
*  that there's a downside to this and one of the downsides is because precisely
*  because not just the substance of what you know is different from discipline to
*  discipline but your normative orientations that is to say how you
*  judge different things is different the like I said the problems you think are
*  interesting the methodologies you think are legitimate just the vocabulary you
*  use from discipline to discipline can be very very different and what this means
*  is that you can be you know by nature intellectually curious and smart and by
*  the fact that you have been trained and honed within your discipline you can
*  become dismissive of other disciplines because they don't sound like yours
*  you've been trained at a certain kind of thing is right and good and virtuous
*  and those people are talking about something else and it becomes very very
*  easy to just dismiss them rather than to listen to dig in to understand what
*  they're saying you just say ah I want scotch they're trying to give me tequila
*  I'm not gonna listen to those people they're a waste of time it's remarkable
*  how much of academic discourse or academic thinking let's put it that way
*  is arguably anti-intellectual it's pro their own little kind of intellectual
*  endeavor but you become poisoned against the broader intellectual process because
*  you're so specialized in your own little area and I would argue that almost every
*  discipline almost every area has something of value in it whether it's
*  string theory deconstruction Austrian economics whatever whatever area of
*  specialization you have in academia most for the most part there's something
*  worthwhile in there even if there are other things that are not worthwhile
*  even if you think that the people in those areas are largely off the beaten
*  track not doing useful work there's a whole bunch of smart people who have of
*  their own free will decided that this is the area they want to dig into and
*  they're not evil they're not motivated by greed or whatever you know being a
*  professor even the best paid professors could be paid more doing other things
*  right likewise for fame and fortune they got into this because they think it's
*  interesting and it teaches them something about the world and so it goes
*  back to the idea that we should listen to people's own reasons for believing
*  whatever it is they believe we should take seriously the idea that every
*  discipline has something of value and we can't really judge it until we give it a
*  chance to work its way into our hearts and our brains so that we understand why
*  anyone would ever think that has value and that's hard that is hard to do and so
*  people don't do it generally it's much easier just make fun of disciplines that
*  you're not in whatever those disciplines maybe I've certainly heard philosophers
*  make fun of physics let's put it that way and again the whole setup the whole
*  scheme generally works pretty well progress is made in the individual
*  directions in which people are moving the problem the failure mode is when a
*  discipline becomes insufficiently self-critical or insufficiently engaged
*  with external reality when it becomes too inward looking when it starts
*  judging its own successes on criteria that only it understands right and this
*  can happen and I'm not going to pick out any particular disciplines that
*  different people will have different ideas about this but I want to pick up
*  the general phenomenon if you don't engage with very very different points
*  of view you can get stale you can pick up a certain set of things that you
*  valorize as successes and people within your field are very good at those things
*  and it becomes harder for you to say yes but are those the values that we should
*  care about the most right and it's it's understandable again I'm not like trying
*  to say bad things about people it's understandable why you would think this
*  because if you're an expert in some area it's really hard to trust the opinions of
*  non-experts about your area and I'm not talking now about you know epidemiology
*  or virology or other hot topics I'm talking like thinking about quantum
*  mechanics right someone says oh there's a measurement problem in quantum
*  mechanics and you're an expert in quantum mechanics and they're not are
*  you gonna listen to them economics right you're a macro economist and someone
*  macroeconomics is built on a flimsy chain of reasoning or whatever why would you ever
*  care what they think it's very very hard to take seriously criticisms from people who are not
*  inside the discipline and I think that this philosophy that I'm trying to promulgate here
*  this is this extends to bigger pictures I'm in academia so I feel it in that context but clearly
*  as I started saying this extends to political and social issues the idea of listening to each other
*  it can be hard people don't want to do it why should I listen to the wrong people that doesn't
*  sound like a good idea but let me point out that it's kind of crucial to the success of
*  the democratic project right part of the idea of democracy is that no one has the right answers
*  fundamentally like if there was a particular identifiable subgroup of people who had all the
*  right answers then just put them in charge that's what Plato wanted to do right with the philosopher
*  kings democracy comes from a different angle democracy says you know different people have
*  different interests different things they want to be the case maybe they have different expertise
*  and different knowledge bases remember the podcast interview I did with Henry Farrell where he talked
*  about democracy as a problem-solving mechanism and it goes back to the fitness landscape idea
*  problems can be hard to solve and very often it is good when you're trying to solve problems to
*  have a diversity of approaches tackling the problem if there's a localized peak in the fitness
*  landscape and you have a problem-solving technique that never points you in the direction of that
*  localized peak you're less likely to succeed than a group of people who are being more ecumenical
*  so I think that there is not just something to be done academically increasing our generation of
*  knowledge within the intellectual machinery that we have in our society by having more
*  interdisciplinary work I think it's also a model for our conversations more generally it's not you
*  know you can always be too extreme about this you know as I like to say on the podcast or when I
*  talk about people I invite on the podcast I want to invite diverse people I want to invite people
*  not only whom I agree with but I don't want to invite people who are a waste of time I want to
*  people who even if I disagree with them I think that they it's worth listening to them and my
*  personal judgment about what is worth listening to might not be yours yes why there's more than
*  one podcast out there but I do think that the general philosophy of listening to different
*  kinds of points of view opens you up to insights and solutions to problems that you wouldn't
*  otherwise have just like opening yourself up to mixing different spirits together leads to
*  the possibility of a better better cocktail look I know just as well as you do this is not the
*  world's best analogy okay but there it's the holiday message it's supposed to be fun it's
*  supposed to be light-hearted and I wanted to like have something substantive in there and also be
*  light-hearted so that served the purpose a little bit think of the discussion of being
*  interdisciplinary within academia as the base spirit as the gin in the martini or the rye in
*  the Manhattan and think about the talking about cocktails etc as the complementary spirit I don't
*  know if there's a word for that there probably is like I said I'm not an expert in mixology so
*  there probably is a specific technical word for whatever that secondary spirit is that adds some
*  extra color extra nuance to the whole concoction as a whole besides cocktails are fun and talking
*  to people is hard talking to people you disagree with sometimes it's not worth talking to them you
*  never know some people are the Ferne bronca of opinions other people get along a lot of times
*  but it's worth the effort you know as much as Steven Weinberg was a brilliant guy I do wish
*  that he appreciated a little bit more that it for certain questions within physics there's
*  something to be gleaned from the points of view that philosophers have to offer and likewise for
*  certain questions in philosophy there's something to be gleaned from what physicists have to offer
*  there's something to be gleaned between biologists and economists and linguists and the whole bit
*  computer scientists it's hard to do and I think that as a system we don't create mechanisms by
*  which it can happen we have a system that is really really good at the disciplines not so
*  focused on letting interdisciplinary work go that's not a cocktail bar that I want to go to I want
*  one that has fun combinations of different things that surprise me and lead me to places that I've
*  never been before maybe that's what I'll do right now who knows anyway as the point of the holiday
*  message thank you so much for listening to the mindscape podcast this has been going on you know
*  it's been a more regular thing than I thought when I started what two and a half years ago
*  mindscape I thought you know I said we'll start trying to do it once a week but I probably won't
*  succeed in doing that and here we are we're succeeding I have a whole bunch of podcasts in
*  the can that are really really good pretty diverse actually always trying to become a
*  better podcaster better questions better guests and things like that better audio quality I know
*  the audio quality comes and goes I do care about it I do try to make it good but there's a fundamental
*  constraint that the if I do a remote podcast then I don't control the room that the other person is
*  in even if I get them a microphone if they're an echoey room it can be very very hard to get good
*  audio quality just letting you know that I feel your pain when the audio quality is not up to
*  stuff I do try to make it good and it's been great for me you know it's been its work it's a certain
*  amount of effort especially when I had to like understand the point of view of someone talking
*  about some esoteric topic but that's the biggest single reason I do it so that I can be exposed to
*  these different ideas you know maybe every faculty member should be forced to have a podcast in which
*  they interview people outside their own domain of intellectual expertise because that would that
*  would lead them to appreciate what other people have to offer and you know that's a pretty good
*  holiday message right there thanks for listening here's hoping your 2022 is challenging and
*  rewarding in the best possible ways
*  you
