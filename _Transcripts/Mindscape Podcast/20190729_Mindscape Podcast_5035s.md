“Democracy may not exist, but we’ll miss it when it’s gone” — or so suggests the title of Astra Taylor’s new book. We all know how democracy falls short, in practice, of its lofty ideals; but we can also appreciate how democratic values are crucial in the fight for a more just society. In this conversation, we dig into the nature of democracy, from its origins to the present day. We talk about who gets to participate, how economic inequality affects political inequality, and how democratic ideals manifest themselves in any number of real-world situations.

Astra Taylor is a filmmaker, author, and activist. Her documentary films include Zizek!, The Examined Life, and most recently What Is Democracy? Her books include The People’s Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital age and the new Democracy May Not Exist, But We’ll Miss It When It’s Gone. She has taught sociology at the university level, and written for publications from n+1 to The London Review of Books. She was active in the Occupy movement, and is a co-founder of the Debt Collective.

# Mindscape 57 | Astra Taylor on the Promise and Challenge of Democracy
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 29, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_B3NC-C_w)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean
*  Carroll and several years ago I watched a documentary about philosophers called
*  Examined Life. There aren't that many documentaries about philosophers and it
*  was it was just a very enjoyable thought-provoking kind of experience. You
*  had these philosophers out there in the world. They weren't just behind their
*  desks in their offices or lecturing in a hallway. They were out there in cars on
*  the streets doing things and then talking about the relationship between
*  philosophy and practice and the real world. So I was interested to find out
*  that the documentarian who made this film, Astra Taylor, has recently been
*  working on the idea of democracy. She has both a new another documentary that just
*  came out called What is Democracy? and she has a new book that has just come
*  out called Democracy May Not Exist but We'll Miss It When It's Gone. I think
*  that's almost exactly right. You know as soon as you say well democracy blah blah
*  so many people say we don't live in a democracy either you know we live in a
*  republic or they try to say well we don't really have the voice that we
*  should to truly make it a democracy and so forth and so Astra is saying yes
*  that's right but there's still good things about democracy that we should
*  think about try to make them better rather than just despairing that it
*  can't be done. So she goes all the way back to ancient Greece you know Plato and
*  Aristotle our founding philosophers were notoriously against democracy. They
*  didn't really like the idea but Athens was definitely the touchstone for the
*  flowering of democracy subsequently in the Western world at least and Rome as
*  those of you who've listened to Mindscape know from my conversation with
*  Ed Watts, Rome was more of a republic than a democracy and it's interesting to
*  compare those and it's interesting to moving forward to the present day where
*  we have technology and we live in these huge societies where the relationship
*  between individual voters and what their governments do grows increasingly
*  tenuous. So democracy is on the one hand very very important to us on the other
*  hand it's taken for granted a little bit and we should promote democracy I think
*  but also we need to keep it on its toes we need to make sure that it is really
*  doing what it is there to do. There's good questions to ask about whether
*  democracy is the right thing to do from a philosophical intellectual viewpoint
*  we should always be probing whether we're on the right track. So I think that
*  democracy is a fantastically important part of our world yet something we don't
*  actually devote enough brain cells to really thinking about in a deep way and
*  I think this conversation helps us do that in a way that is also very
*  entertaining. Reminders of course this is a podcast so you're welcome to go on to
*  iTunes and elsewhere and leave reviews of it. We also have a Patreon account
*  where you can support Mindscape. We have ads coming up but the Patreon supporters
*  will certainly still get benefits for example you get ad free versions of the
*  podcast if you support on Patreon and also we get monthly ask me any things
*  where you can ask me any question and I will try to answer it in a special
*  podcast just for Patreon supporters. So there's still some motivation to go there.
*  With that I think this is a wonderful conversation that is both
*  philosophically provocative and very very relevant to how we live in the world
*  today so let's go.
*  Asher Taylor thanks so much for coming on the Mindscape podcast.
*  Thanks for having me. So I am familiar with some of your films back in the day
*  Zizek and The Examined Life and these were about philosophical topics
*  pretty straightforwardly right and here you are with a new book out and also a
*  new documentary about democracy so why don't you tell us a little about your
*  journey from slightly more abstract ivory tower philosophizing to a little
*  bit more down in the political mess kind of thinking and activism.
*  Yeah it is you know it seems like they might be unrelated but to me they really
*  are. I have always been someone who wanted to marry theory and practice so
*  you know I could never quite become a full-time philosopher myself only be a
*  scholar because I always wanted to experiment with my ideas you know and
*  especially if they relate to ethics and politics and the question that that old
*  Socratic question of how should we live well you can't decide that on your own
*  you can't really figure that out definitively on your own you know and so
*  then the question for me has been okay well how do I build this kind of
*  life where I get to engage with questions philosophical questions
*  theoretical questions have a kind of life of the mind and also you know the
*  life of a person trying to to embody those principles in some ways so I do
*  that through through organizing and I do that through through writing and I do
*  that through filmmaking so those films you know Zizek came out in 2005 so I was
*  25 exam life came out in 2008 and those were the tagline of exam life was
*  philosophy is in the streets right so what I wanted to do with that was to
*  show the way these abstract ideas are actually all around us they're built
*  into our environment they're they're in the space we inhabit and and and to
*  treat ideas with a bit of a reverence and playfulness so I have all these
*  philosophers sort of traveling through different places and even you know
*  rowing a boat or walking through a garbage dump and trying to also you know
*  in a way express my own enthusiasm for philosophy and to share it with people
*  you know and to share it in a way that didn't intimidate them I hope you know I
*  want to make it fun and engaging but then I I sort of felt after exam and I
*  came out like you know that well this isn't I didn't dream of being a
*  filmmaker you know I I again it's you know I want I want to bring these ideas
*  I wanted to kind of go the next step which for me was actually trying to get
*  more involved in politics and in organizing so that's so so when you look
*  at it that way then what is democracy which is the name of the documentary
*  film and the companion book democracy may not exist but we'll miss it when it's
*  gone it's kind of it it's actually a very clear kind of next step and I will
*  say this about it you know democracy in my mind as I understand it and I said
*  in the preface demands philosophy democracy is intellectually hard
*  that's a quote from Danielle Allen a classicist and who I interviewed and
*  and it's hard because at the center of democracy is an abstraction the people
*  right the people doesn't just exist like a fact out there in the world that we
*  can point to and so so already you have this abstraction and how do you have an
*  abstraction deciding things and making ethical decisions and governing itself
*  so you know philosophy is sort of part and parcel of democratic life and we we
*  hinted this in our media when we talk about deliberation or debate or even
*  this whole conversation happening now about facts truth but I think it's I
*  think it's like you know so so democracy is theory in practice always it's like
*  we have to reflect and act and reflect and act and and so the the film is an
*  attempt and the book are both attempts to just sort of bring that philosophical
*  dimension into into focus and I my my feeling is it can help us at this moment
*  yeah a political crisis but other people might not agree well that's democracy I
*  do think yeah exactly I think that because we're so most of us in this
*  country you know grew up in a democracy we tend to forget or at least
*  underestimate how philosophically radical this idea is and the idea that
*  just everybody has a voice or supposedly had a voice in how the
*  society is run certainly comes along with a whole bunch of presuppositions
*  about you know who deserves to have power and things like that so philosophy
*  should be part of that it makes sense to me yeah and you know but what's
*  interesting so the you know both of the projects go back to the founding text of
*  the Western philosophical tradition Plato's Republic yeah and it's it's a
*  founding text of Western philosophy and it's interesting because it's and it's
*  anti-democracy this moment when Athenian democracies in decline and Plato is
*  saying you know he's he's issuing a very powerful critique of democracy and in a
*  nutshell he basically says you know democracy marginalizes the wise love you
*  know his definition of a philosopher was someone who loves wisdom and and the
*  virtuous and he had reason to think that because the democracy had put his his
*  mentor Socrates to death right they said hey you can either be excelled or you
*  can drink the hemlock and he was too proud and he drank that hemlock so you
*  know there's always been this this concern it's it's a concern that's
*  ancient that that well the people aren't philosophical they aren't wise and so I
*  think you see this in my work again and again where I'm saying well we have to
*  create a philosophical public you know this is also you know the it's it's also
*  about democratizing not just access to knowledge or information or facts but
*  you know confidence that one can participate in a certain kind of
*  conversation and and be precisely because that abstract reflection is
*  demanded by the political system that we we say we have we say we aspire to so we
*  better do it yeah there's no other way there's no way around you can't have
*  democracy and not aspire to have a philosophical public because democracy
*  has no there is no barrier to entry right it shouldn't be based on the color
*  of your skin how much money is in your bank account or what school you went to
*  it's like sorry we can all be part of it right well you know you're preaching to
*  the converted here at Mindscape Central this is part of what I'm trying to do
*  with the podcast right is talk to people about big ideas in a way that is is made
*  possible by this new medium so just before I really do want to get mostly in
*  the democracy but I have to ask sort of a strategic question about writing books
*  versus making documentaries right you know what how do you visualize those two
*  very separate but related activities most people would do one or the other
*  but you try to get both going yeah and then I want to ask you a question
*  because that's what I always always like to do so I mean to me to me I think I'm
*  I'm medium agnostic and medium curious you know we have all these different we
*  have all these different mediums and you know I'm not a Marshall McLuhanite like
*  medium is the message and so each medium is but there is some truth to that like
*  different mediums have different affordances different capacities they
*  they conjure different affects well in different audiences right in different
*  audiences right so for me it depends you know I see organizing as a medium so
*  when you are building an institution that's a medium through which human
*  beings interact and and perceive the world so it just sort of depends on what
*  what has captured my attention film you know is more akin to a podcast in the
*  sense that it's you know it's it's direct it's it has an emotional quality
*  so you know because my films are mostly made up of interviews with people and so
*  there's the words that they're literally speaking but then there's all of their
*  their expressive aspects you know and and whether you empathize with them
*  whether you like them whether they're charismatic or not a lot of comments on
*  the podcast about the fact that it's audio only and I'm sympathetic to this
*  because it really does matter to see people talk but you know so far I don't
*  have the technological capabilities of that but maybe sometime in the future
*  that will happen well it's funny because I often think I podcasts are great
*  because you don't have to see someone so it's like what if the background is
*  ugly or what if you know it's raining outside right yeah you know brushing
*  their nose in an awkward way I mean you know then it's all that matters is what
*  said but you know even a film my film is an hour and 45 minutes or so and you
*  know but if you transcribed it it it wouldn't make rational sense because
*  there are these leaps that film allows and also it wouldn't be very long it
*  would be like a academic book chapter or something like that so the so the film
*  allows for me to give space to other people to honor them to be interested in
*  them to kind of actually focus kind of express to the audience my own curiosity
*  about other people which I think is important which is what kind of what
*  you're doing on this podcast you're saying hey you know I might be this
*  amazing physicist but I'm so curious about people I still want to ask
*  questions and I think asking questions and having that curiosity I'm almost as
*  like interested in having that be part of my propaganda like we should be
*  curious about others as the more kind of traditional political takeaways of the
*  film and then a book you know you get to you get to write at length you get to
*  have footnotes all of these things all these details that would just weigh a
*  movie down you know you can't stop and say hey check this page of this obscure
*  text Machiavelli or you know Madison or Marx or whoever so that's where I get to
*  be more didactic I also get to say more I get to kind of express my point of view
*  more so you know the mediums have different they're they're they're
*  different depending on what it is I'm trying to communicate I when I go speak
*  at colleges and young people come up to me and say you know I really want to be a
*  filmmaker I'm always slightly befuddled because to me it's like well that's just
*  a shell or a vessel what is it you want to communicate yeah yeah I mean it's a
*  good point right you know because it's like there's lots of terrible books in
*  the world there's lots of terrible movies it's like to me it's the message
*  the story the thing that you want to share with other humans yeah because I
*  think that at heart your your essence is not a filmmaker you're an intellectual
*  activist right and yeah I remember when because I'm a science consultant
*  sometimes for movies and so I got to meet Ridley Scott who was thinking of
*  making a movie of the forever war and I don't think it has happened maybe it
*  will never happen but so it's based on a novel already so there's some plot but
*  there have been there was no screenplay at the time when we met with him but he
*  clearly in his mind had certain scenes already perfectly mapped out visually and
*  it was very clear from talking to him that that's what he was about right
*  making these wonderful visual moments and then the plot whatever okay we'll
*  figure that out yeah what happens the movie comes second I think that's
*  perfectly okay but it's a very different thing than someone who is just about the
*  message or the substance and then finds different media in which to express it
*  yeah I think it's really different I mean you know there and I I'm very
*  charmed and interested in people who are visual first you know or say I had this
*  image of a girl walking through a field of sunflowers I mean a filmmaker friend
*  literally said that and was like wow that was enough but you know it's
*  beautiful and it's a beautiful thing to make other other to have other art forms
*  but again it's just it's not me I was interested in you you know because I
*  think you know I write about this a little bit in the chapter on education
*  in the book but you know there are kinds of expertise that you know you're you
*  know you're almost the cliche of a person with knowledge right being this
*  theoretical physicist right credentialed and so forth right right and yet and so
*  what what but yet you're still open to this idea of democracy as this as this
*  as an intellectual pursuit that needs to include everybody I mean I'm just
*  curious if that that just feels is that just something that is almost like an
*  instinctual sense of trust of other people or well yeah no I mean this is
*  definitely something that I want to talk about so let's talk about it yeah
*  democracy one of the radical parts of it is the idea that everyone not only has a
*  voice but is in some sense ideally equal right one person one vote of course
*  there are distortions to that from power and money and so forth but that's the
*  ideal and it it is there's clearly a worry that some people don't really
*  deserve as much of a voice if you're sort of these days we would call it
*  technocratic right if you think there's a right answer to what government should
*  do at all times isn't it the case that the smart people are more likely to find
*  the right answer but I always thought it is never very hard to me because I just
*  thought that was the wrong way of thinking about how a government works
*  and the purpose of democracy the purpose is to make sure everyone's interests are
*  represented right it I I feel bad because I'm very middle of the road
*  about these things I like the idea of a representative democracy in which people
*  vote and they express their interests by doing that and then the representatives
*  gain expertise in various ways and implement the policies the best way
*  possible it seems very you know bourgeois and so forth I think that if
*  when that system works very well it's the right thing to do and so I think
*  that the right place for expertise is at the level where we've already
*  recommended sorry we've already elected our representatives and those people
*  ideally will go to the experts to find out what's going on yeah I mean I'm not
*  unsympathetic I think I say something like I don't want to be involved in
*  every decision right I mean you know and and and that you know expertise is a is
*  an essential component I think when when that becomes abstracted to the level of
*  like okay well let's just let technocrats govern or the experts govern
*  it's not it's not then it becomes more of a problem right oh no absolutely they
*  become a self-serving you know a self-serving group and there maybe
*  there's no accountability so you know the you know it's funny I wouldn't
*  describe myself as middle of the road but I'm always trying to find the
*  complexities or find the balance and things or you know where where you know
*  so and I think expertise is a really interesting one because you know it's
*  it's and there's something undemocratic about it because absolutely yeah an
*  expert at everything and yet we desperately need it in a society as
*  complicated as well I think it's a huge worry I think that one of the sets of
*  people who reject democracy implicitly or explicitly are people or the masters
*  of the universe who think that they know what's best right and think that
*  basically they should have the voice and in some sense you know I had a
*  podcast interview with Yasha Monk about liberal democracy and how it's failing
*  and and his point was you know the word liberal is not just there to make it a
*  longer phrase it really means something it means a certain set of protections
*  for people and populist movements can be very democratic right as long as they
*  define democratic in the right way and and his theory is that a lot of the
*  attraction of populist movements is that democracy is seen to not be working in
*  places like Europe where the European Union has put so much power into
*  technocratic elites right so that the person on the street thinks nothing that
*  I do has any impact on what the government does and I think that you
*  know I'm not an expert and I don't know whether that's true or not but I do
*  agree it would be bad if that were the right case well I mean there's you know
*  to bring it back to the United States there does seem to code a bit of
*  evidence that regular people don't actually have any say over the policies
*  so there was the famous study that became known as the oligarchy study but
*  you know I think what is that I'm not familiar with the political scientists
*  were Gillan's and page it was I think this was maybe 2014 I feel like time is
*  speeding up I can't remember when things came up I can explain that they crunched
*  the numbers and they said you know regular citizens have virtually no
*  impact over policy you know it's yeah it's big donors I mean and again these
*  are things people know in their guts even if they haven't read the social
*  science research and you know I think that that's part of that's part of the
*  frustration you know Yasha Munk is an interesting example because I read his
*  book and I was very surprised to see my name mentioned as a populist what I had
*  written yeah I'd written a book I mean I'm sorry I'd written an article where I
*  said well hey part of the problem in it it was for the New Republic which is a
*  bastion of liberalism actually but but I said the point of it was basically that
*  there in the wake of the election Donald Trump there's a big anti-democratic urge
*  coming from elites actually right the sense that the people had made a
*  terrible mistake there was actually this resurgence of interest in Plato's
*  Republic you know maybe democracy does always devolve into journey and I'm I
*  understand why that was happening but but my sense was you know my point was
*  that you know the problem is in my view that we haven't democratized enough
*  right right that there's still there's still there's still work to be done
*  let's not let's not name democracy as the problem let's fight over what we
*  mean by democracy and democratization let's look at the concentration of
*  wealth and power let's try to look at the sources of people's frustrations and
*  address those and and so I I think I come at it you know from a from a
*  different angle because I still I I'm where some people are very worried right
*  now about what about a sort of populist threat and a sort of you know the the
*  question almost of like the tyranny of the majority right that the people in
*  their unruly passions so again the Plato thing I'm more I'm more concerned about
*  the points of minority veto power in our political system right now in the way
*  that progressive progressive desires are actually being thwarted because if
*  you look for example there is rising xenophobia I mean there's there's
*  horrible things happening right now at the border and there are very scary
*  scary trends not just in the US but in Europe and beyond and yet polls show
*  that actually Americans have more positive use of immigration they've had
*  Americans want gun control Americans want all sorts of progressive forward-looking
*  things and they're blocked because of these again these veto points structures
*  of minority power at the Supreme Court is going to be worse on this moving
*  forward the Senate is also a minoritarian sort of institution right in
*  the sense that less populous states have disproportionate power the electoral
*  college obviously is what really gave us Donald Trump as the president so that's
*  why I'm always trying to temper this this condemnation of the people and say
*  well hold on what are the structures that are actually yeah blocking the more
*  progressive will well it's interesting so I think that the what I got from
*  talking to Yasha was the idea that populism it sort of its self-conception
*  is very democratic but it's always at the cost of shrinking the circle of the
*  people who actually count as the ones who get to vote right so like excluding
*  foreigners and so forth or by an art yeah I mean it's interesting you know
*  this is you know all all definitions are unsettled you know and so for me I also
*  see again to go back to the question of democracy so what what you know we can
*  always joke because people bring up issues of populism and liberalism in
*  the Q&A is for my film especially and I was like okay yes I can my even my next
*  even more market unmarketable film will be what is populism but you know to
*  begin with the titular question of my film you know what is democracy and and
*  I'd like the I like to go back to the ancient Greek roots of the word and and I
*  think it's very important to be clear that the Greeks didn't give us the
*  practice of democracy or of people engaging and trying to have power over
*  their own lives but they give us this word and I think it's a really great
*  word and it's the demos the people have Kratos power or rule hold power grasp
*  power meant to sort of hold on to something and and so this question of
*  who the people are is constitutive of democracy itself it's not it's not a
*  populist aberration to be fighting over how we define this it's something that
*  we have to kind of face head-on it's a question that is bagged by the idea of
*  democracy right who are the people who have this will it's just it's just part
*  of our struggle and so it is true that there's this you know you can call it
*  small p populist tendency to say you know to do a kind of us or them and
*  exclude immigrants and foreigners but then you know the but as I said it's
*  also to the problem of democracy itself how do we define the demos how do we
*  define the polity how do you know how do we define the we and and make that we
*  accountable so I think there's you know this is a problem that that we have to
*  face and it gets really it's a really thorny thorny not just philosophical
*  issue because people's lives are at stake yeah we've shown that demos can
*  can radically expand and it can radically contract and and we have to
*  figure we I think the point is to recognize actually how things are today
*  are not set in stone and that's what we have to always remember to like have to
*  keep an imaginative flame alive yeah you know I mean you can't do democracy
*  without well this question of who counts right who is in the demos who's who's a
*  person you can't just say everybody right because there's no democracy ever
*  that has given people the right to vote the moment they're born for example we
*  exclude children historically we've excluded women and various groups I had
*  an interesting podcast interview with Ed Watts the historian about the decline
*  of the Roman Republic it was eventually replaced by an empire but it succeeded
*  very well for 500 years and part of its success was whenever Rome would conquer
*  another country they would very quickly give them the right to vote in Roman
*  elections and that seems a little weird to us today but it worked really well
*  for them at the time it just as a reminder there's no clearly right and
*  wrong way to draw these lines well it's interesting because the empires have
*  often done that right there at the method the Roman Empire's great example
*  was just like okay fine now you're a citizen yeah so now you're you are being
*  assimilated essentially by us and democracies do have an unappealing
*  tendency towards the opposite which is to exclude and so you know to contrast
*  Rome with Greece Greece was Athens was extremely exclusive because you had to
*  have two citizen parents at a certain point they said oh actually you know no
*  you see only have to have the one citizen parent than at a certain point
*  they made it that the mother also had to be a citizen so so made that bloodline
*  you know even more constrained and if you look at you know I talk about this
*  in the book in the chapter on inclusion and exclusion that for example Canada so
*  I'm Canadian but I grew up in the American South but when Canada was part
*  of the British Empire you know where that constellation it was more open to
*  immigrants and then when it separated itself and had control of its
*  citizenship laws it started to become more exclusive so there's some really
*  troubling yeah there's really and then they were like well hold on what is
*  Canadian this I mean yeah and so in this process of it even inventing what it
*  meant to be Canadian they started to close the door to people from other
*  parts of the world so this is it's it's it's definitely one of democracies least
*  appealing features my my point I think I think what makes it really hard is that
*  right now it's difficult just given the state of the world to imagine forms of
*  constructing a demos or people that aren't really negative because we're
*  living in a moment where the exclusions are founded on really troubling
*  histories of histories of racism histories of colonization you know you
*  know immigration laws designed to exploit labor forces right so then you
*  know we're not really in a position where we can ask well hold on when is
*  when is when is setting the boundary of a community actually ethical you know
*  when do people need to be involved in a decision or I mean because because when
*  we I mean on the one hand we have to do that but on the other hand it's hard to
*  separate the fact that we've been really nasty about these things going yeah like
*  right now exclusions are predicated predicated on terrible things like your
*  race this arbitrary fact of where you were born and you know or they were
*  based on gender and sexuality you know exclusion it does not have a pretty
*  history you remind us that Switzerland only gave women the vote in like 1971 or
*  something like that yeah right I mean this is and this is all really really
*  recent so I think the thing is you know under what and yet you know I agree we
*  can't imagine democracy including eight nine ten billion people because that
*  would be be incoherent so you know I think we but there has to we have to
*  wrestle with this fact that a certain point yeah you do you do have to have
*  you do have to have boundaries and and I think for me the solution is that we
*  have to create a more equal world where you know in a world that is so terribly
*  unequal where the thing that determines the quality of your life your life
*  expectancy is not what a hard worker you are or how smart you are but just
*  basically where you were born where you're born yeah right and your passport
*  right and you know and so we in a world like that exclusion is a matter of life
*  or death in a more equal world it would it would be a very very different
*  calculus and the fact is in a more equal world a lot less people would want to
*  move from where they are so one of the issues I wanted to ask about was the
*  relationship of democracy which we let's let's put aside the idea that
*  democracy is not a good idea okay there are people who think that but let's
*  agree that democracy is good but there's lots of things that are good
*  right equality and liberty and justice and economic freedom health care
*  whatever how do we do you include all those good things in a definition of
*  democracy or do we try to slice it so that we can consider all these virtues
*  separately I don't have a hard and fast answer to that I think that that's
*  something that you know every generation will have to reassess because we have
*  you know I think we have shifting expectations and shifting baselines so
*  you know I think democracy does demand by its definition by its minimal
*  definition of the people ruling a baseline of equality right of political
*  equality yeah and I think that you cannot have political equality under
*  conditions of intense economic yeah inequality I think that's a reasonable
*  claim that's one you have its work to establish it and really convince people
*  yes and you know it's so controversial to a lot of very powerful people and
*  maybe some less powerful people who aspire to having that kind of yeah I
*  think what is the phrase that's like you know every you know we all we all think
*  we're gonna be millionaires one day so we yeah I hold political ideals for
*  those incredibly fabulously wealthy future selves so I think you know I
*  think there is this I think there there are some minimum requirements you know
*  should we separate out these other values from from democracy I mean you
*  know I think we have to we have to decide is we have to disable what are
*  what are the values that we are we're we are oriented towards as a as a people so
*  yeah maybe they're separate but then they become part of the Democratic
*  project right like you know it becomes sort of implicit that well democracy
*  well you know in the phrase of the Constitution right is the pursuit of
*  happiness I'd rather have it be just like well-being her something like that
*  but flourishing yeah yeah our collective flourishing or something like this sort
*  of it's very hard to have to just separate the the ins from the from the
*  means from the the goal from the process and yet I do think that that again they
*  always those values always have to be assessed and reassessed yeah this is
*  something we might aspire to things we aspire to things obviously that you know
*  a hundred years ago people would have just been like well yeah what are you
*  what the hell are you people aiming at or which makes who are you people a lot
*  of you people are not supposed to be in the people and a hundred years from now
*  what will that discussion look like about us exactly the kind of thing I
*  like to think you know and you spend your life and in you know science physics
*  universe time but you know sometimes I want to say you know even in in our more
*  mundane conception of time but you know hopefully a hundred years from now there
*  will be new assumptions and new aspirations that that make us look
*  backwards yeah and that's part of why I like the word democracy in its vagueness
*  because who the people are is open for debate and how they rule is also open to
*  contestation and transformation so I like that this concept that we have this
*  word we can hold on to but we can also really radically reinvent it yeah this
*  was impressed on me actually believe it or not when I took a class in grad
*  school with John Rawls the political philosopher and oh wow I've never I mean
*  that's you know that he was yeah he was an amazing guy and actually I always
*  find it funny because he loved cosmology and physics so I really never got to
*  talk to him about philosophy because he always wanted to talk about cosmology
*  whenever we chatted but he had this he also you know his his motto was justice
*  as fairness and ordering a society on the basis of fairness to everyone and
*  happily because this isn't always true for great thinkers but he lived by what
*  he preached and he was the fairest guy I have ever met and one of his things was
*  he had an ongoing you know challenge if you can find a logical flaw in his
*  principles of justice then you know he gives you a hundred dollars or something
*  like that and no one ever did right he you know he he listened if you if you
*  had a proposal but one of the things was of course these principles are having to
*  do with you know don't allow inequality unless it benefits even the least off in
*  society you would you would come up with something well what if there was a an
*  epidemic and everyone was dying and you had to you know do something like that
*  and he but he was very clear that he meant his principles to apply to a well
*  ordered functioning healthy society right and that was all a precondition for
*  making any of this happen and I think that even if you're not a Rawlsian
*  there's an underappreciated aspect of democracy that that if not requires then
*  at least suggests that everyone should have some minimal both economic and
*  political resources I think I mean I think it does because you can't be again
*  if democracy is people engaging in ruling themselves if you are well you
*  know if you don't have them the minimum subsistence yeah not just to survive but
*  also so that you're you can't be sort of terribly coerced right then you can't
*  engage in those in the in the processes democracy requires and you know but this
*  is also this you know we take this as common sense but different at different
*  moments in history people looked at this in in different ways so for the ancient
*  Greeks you know there was a contempt of of labor they associated leisure with
*  democracy with that freedom that space to govern in fact they just learned that
*  the roots of the word school was actually also had to do with sort of
*  free time right so it needed that time to engage in the the learning to engage
*  in the sort of more elevated modes of life which included being able to go to
*  the assembly and stuff like that so you know and so there was a whole enslaved
*  laboring class and the United States was also it is you know is a democracy that
*  was founded on on freedom on slavery and there was also a sense that you know
*  working people just you know would were subject to coercion you're not
*  necessarily sort of like freehold farmers who had their own land that's
*  why that the yeoman farmer was this ideal but you know people in the
*  factories or or slaves so there's this sense that labor you know labor
*  laboring people didn't have what it didn't have what it takes yeah so yeah
*  you had this wonderful scene in the film where you're interviewing these school
*  kids in Miami I think it was and you asked them a you bring up the
*  possibility or the prospect that they could have a voice in how the school was
*  run and they point out that when they try to ask for things their privileges
*  can be taken away right their vending machines can be taken away and this
*  actually happens and part of that of course there's a surface of saying like
*  this is why kids don't get to participate in democracy but then you
*  think about it and go like oh wait a minute maybe I'm the kid in this in
*  this parable right like maybe all of us are subject to having our privileges
*  taken away in some way I really like that and I'm happy that's how you
*  interpret it because that's how I see it too I mean I think the the scene and
*  it's interesting because the film and the book are companions but they're not
*  it's not there it's not like the book is a transcript of the film and yet the
*  kids live in both mediums they got to be in the movie and the book and it
*  they're important because when we're thinking about the problem facing our
*  society right now you know when one solution we tend to hold on to and we
*  tend to focus education okay like okay democracy needs education and it's true
*  it does but then the question is well education to what end what what what are
*  people what are the lessons people are being taught about democracy and so by
*  going to this this public school in inner city Miami and so I spoke with kids
*  who were you know they're like middle school age so maybe they're 11 through
*  13 or 14 and what you see is that they're they are being taught lessons
*  about democracy but they're very dispiriting ones they're essentially
*  there's a kind of hidden curriculum right it's not hidden to them I guess
*  because they're they're they're gleaning its messages but basically they're being
*  taught to grin and bear it their place in the world yeah they're being taught
*  their place in the world so you know what I the thing about the vending
*  machine comes up because I asked them what they would change about their
*  school and they say well what they'd really like is for their food to be hot
*  like it doesn't taste good but at least it could be warmed up and then the
*  administrators come down on them just asking so much it's just unbelievable
*  they I mean it's just such a reasonable demand that they have right they just
*  want their their lunch to be hot and then the vending machine thing comes up
*  because this one girl you know and at first you think oh god right should
*  kids be eating junk food at their school but then what you realize is she's
*  saying it she's saying the kids don't have breakfast at home that's their only
*  chance to eat and so these kids are very astute they're so young they're very
*  astute and what I was struck by is that they don't blame their teachers for
*  their problems they have a they have an analysis of the power structure so they
*  understand the teachers are controlled by administrators who are controlled by
*  the state you know who also so they see the adults as powerless so this idea
*  that we are the children in the parable they it's because the children are
*  saying yeah we know the adults are powerless too and so I wanted that
*  seemed to be in the film so that we would have to ask okay well right what
*  kind of education and in the book I'm able to go more deeply into the the
*  battle for universal public education where that idea even emerged so you know
*  breaking with the ancient Greeks break breaking with the founding fathers and
*  saying well no we can't just have you know workers who don't get time who
*  don't get time to feed their minds and to and be full people and and in the
*  book I show that you know working class movements have always been at the
*  cutting edge for the demand for for for not just skills training but for for
*  education to be you know a whole thinking participant in public life and
*  sort of giving the people who don't usually get credit the credit I think
*  they deserve looking back historically and there's this wonderful other
*  powerful scene in the film where you're interviewing the barber who is an ex-con
*  who explains I forget what was his name remember Ellie Brett Ellie Brett and he
*  explains when he was in prison he's still a very young guy they the the
*  punishment for them misbehaving was that their library was taken away and
*  you know the prisoners actually went on strike to get their library privileges
*  and it was even maybe overly on-the-nose example of the power structures trying
*  to keep the people from learning things and I mean yeah preaching the converted
*  once again I certainly think that even though I would love I don't have a lot
*  of data about this I would love to see some more social science research but I
*  have this feeling that the more educated we make people the better off the world
*  is in some large-scale way yeah I mean you know that when Ellie told me that
*  story my jaw literally dropped because there was actually so it's 2000 it was
*  actually 2016 and the end of 2015 when I interviewed him and you know I thought I
*  knew a lot about criminal justice and what people go through but just the fact
*  that he had to be part of a struggle for something so basic as the right to read
*  right yeah and then it was very interesting because when the film was
*  released it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and there
*  was a wave of prison strikes happening around North America and there was
*  actually a strike in Nova Scotia Canada and the demands of the prisoners there
*  was we want the library they've taken the library away and this only makes
*  sense I mean if you look back on history this happened you know he says you know
*  it used to be illegal for people like me black people to read you know and it was
*  a crime to teach a slave how to read I was just reading a history of the labor
*  movement in the US books and reading materials magazines used to be banned
*  from factories you know and it wasn't it was it was not because they didn't want
*  people to take it was that they didn't want people yeah reading engaging in a
*  life of the mind so I think the thing is that you know there is something very
*  threatening about an educated public and I think that that feeds into the attacks
*  on public education and higher education today in this country and and and so you
*  know we're still you know history is not behind us we're still part of the
*  struggle and so the film aims to sort of give that sense of urgency of just how
*  how unjust things are right when when kids and even adults are having to fight
*  just for basic basic access to materials to dignity into you know having what
*  they need to learn but then also saying what does that actually what does that
*  say about the broader the broader structure and and what does it say about
*  those of us for whom education system has basically kind of worked out right
*  yeah something I've I've railed about for a long time to no end whatsoever is
*  just this weird idea we have in the US that we fund a public education through
*  property taxes right so it's sort of the most obvious way that the rich can get
*  richer in the poor can get poor right it's I see no justification on the
*  surface for thinking that if you were born into a wealthy family your public
*  schools could be better I mean not only could you afford to go to private
*  schools but if you just happen to be born into a really poor neighborhood
*  then you're going to get less resources from the start like this definitely
*  fails a John Rawlsian test oh yes right like this totally fails a Rawlsian kind
*  of like well how what kind of you didn't know what zip code you were going to be
*  into born into would you accept this as a principle for funding K through 12
*  education right no way in the original position you would never accept this
*  right it's a private from the original position would never make you right
*  this makes this makes a it makes a farce out of the idea of education but you
*  know as I point out in the book you know education is not a right it's not in the
*  of rights I mean it's something you know when we think about what our democracy
*  is and these values that might be attached to it I think education is a
*  good one it just like we said political equality feels required a baseline of
*  economic equality well also a baseline of education so you know I think that
*  that that's that in theory should be all right but it's not a right on paper in
*  this world yeah I mean and maybe it's I think it's in human rights law but not
*  nationally and that's something we almost forget because it's a it feels
*  like a shibboleth or something like that well yeah but I equalizing funding for
*  K through 12 education I think would be such a rational first step of it
*  education reform yeah all right well but when they elect us to be the
*  dictators of the world the benevolent dictators let us let us yeah make it
*  clear yeah I mean I have a more you know but I have a very odd educational
*  background because I was unschooled so I didn't go to school as a kid and I think
*  that that that you know to me I feel like we have to the horizon the
*  democratic horizon in terms of education and in creating this philosophical
*  public that I I believe could be you know is I think involves you know working
*  with the system as it is and imagining how to expand it and fulfill its promise
*  you know but but then I also think about what could go beyond that right so so
*  you know why I when I was a kid I didn't go to school the idea it was a very sort
*  of russonian romantic idea my parents thought human beings are naturally
*  curious and so instead of giving carrots and sticks and grades and yeah tests and
*  stuff just let let your kids do what to follow their curiosity and so I I don't
*  think that scales and I really do obviously as we've discussed believe in
*  public education but there's something for me the next level would be expanding
*  more of that trust the trust of okay letting people get in touch with what
*  their interests are and I think that because I think I think that trust is
*  actually really essential to democracy because it's again it's this idea that
*  we're gonna rule ourselves so you know that that makes no sense if you actually
*  don't have some trust in other people so I like you know it's like what would come
*  next if we could just you know make sure every kid had access to a decent school
*  and a hot lunch yeah and you know the supplies they need what would come after
*  that yeah no I think that well there's a really deep question here that I don't
*  think that we ever that I don't hear much discussion about on the one hand I
*  think that you know among the choices one as a responsible grown-up adult
*  should be allowed to make is I don't want to learn anything more right some
*  of us are just naturally gonna do it all the time right and that's it's fun as
*  part of who we are I don't want to force it on anybody right if that that's I'm a
*  big believer that we intellectuals need to do a better job of appreciating the
*  simple pleasures of people who are not interested in the kinds of things we're
*  interested that's okay but when you're a kid I would almost be on the flipside
*  of that I mean it worked out great for you previous mindscape guest Malcolm
*  MacIver also was a Canadian and self-schooled I don't know maybe there's
*  some connection there yeah and he turned out really really well professor at
*  Northwestern etc but I can imagine plenty of kids for whom that would not
*  work so I do believe that there should be some minimal requirements out there
*  where you know when you're when you're below a certain age you got to go to
*  school we got to teach us some stuff I mean I remember my love for philosophy
*  only came about because it was required courses when I was an undergraduate
*  right I had no idea that I would be interested in that and I was forced into
*  it and I fell in love no and I mean I I've had that experience too where I had
*  to take something and then I was like you know my mind was blown by it and
*  it's not something I would have found found before so I think again it's this
*  thing like how do you find that balance of sort of giving I write this in the
*  book but I think one thing that the unschooling experience gave me and again
*  it's sort of a thing with how do you institutionalize it was I I came to
*  really respect other people's intellectual authority because they knew
*  things I wanted to learn right and in so I didn't engage because I didn't have a
*  teacher right I wasn't sort of afraid of teachers I wasn't afraid of being
*  detention and or afraid of doing badly on or getting in trouble somehow so I
*  think there I think there is somehow a way to square the circle and to
*  cultivate a space where people we're learning just a more positive
*  experience too and and where where the the person introducing you to an
*  academic discipline for the first time isn't also like really they're also just
*  like this figure who's disciplining you yeah no I think so but you see with
*  these kids in that in the scene in the film is that you know they've got these
*  like harried teachers who are you probably have a classroom of 40 students
*  don't have the resources they need and so there's not there isn't the space
*  there just isn't the capacity to have that sort of you know that experience of
*  really learning and having that that that that introduction to a to a topic
*  that's that really compels them you know and I don't know so I but but who I am
*  and how I approach the world is so shaped by my very eccentric upbringing
*  and denying it have you seen did you watch the wire the TV show no I haven't
*  seen it season four of the wire is enough to convince you to despair of any
*  possibility of public education as it is currently constituted but we would like
*  to do better yeah you know and and I think that a big part of in science in
*  particular what you just said resonates extremely strongly the idea that the way
*  that we do teach science is here are some facts you should learn them and
*  then tell them back to us on the test the way that we do science is a constant
*  series of failures right of making proposals hypotheses testing them they
*  were wrong go back and forth and that simple paradigm is very helpful even if
*  you're not doing science it's a way of looking at the world that doesn't come
*  across in education and that's partly because the teachers are not really
*  scientists are not taught that way partly because they're harried and they
*  don't have enough resources and they have too many kids and certainly for you
*  know for a lot of I've met substitute teachers who worked in really bad school
*  districts and literally more than one person independently volunteered the the
*  goal is to have no one die when they're there right that it's not about the life
*  of the mind it's about just the physical integrity of the students in
*  their class and it's just like in the richest country in the world we can do
*  better yeah you would like to think that okay to switch gears a little bit because
*  you said something very important very provocative and that I've written down
*  here we haven't got a chance to get back to but the existence of structures
*  within the democratic process within government that are anti-democratic or at
*  least contra-democratic the Supreme Court the Senate the Electoral College
*  all of these things that prevent the democracy from being the unfiltered will
*  of the people and I'm a big believer in not having the unfiltered will of the
*  people do everything as someone who lives in California and is subject to
*  these weird ballot initiatives that I think are a terrible idea but there's
*  trade-offs right you know in some sense the minority that is being protected by
*  the Senate and the Supreme Court right now are not the minorities that deserve
*  protection the most so do you have you have either feelings about that or
*  something more programmatic about what we should do about that to be more
*  healthy democracy yeah I mean it's interesting I think you just said
*  something that's quite key right which minorities are being protected by these
*  institutions and so we when we talk about minority rights we often think at
*  least you know I'm speaking as a liberal person here protections of women even
*  minority we're just a minority in positions of power and influence but
*  traditionally discriminated against groups right traditionally discriminated
*  against groups right the disabled sexual minorities you know and and but we have
*  to remember is that the minorities that the founders of our political system had
*  in mind it was it was different I mean they were thinking about religiously
*  oppressed groups in some cases but they were also thinking about the opulent the
*  rich right I mean in this they were very direct about this and so another minimal
*  definition of democracy that I think is great is from Aristotle who also was not
*  a Democrat but he said so classically in political philosophy you know there
*  different systems are organized you know they say okay well there's the rule of
*  the one right which is the the monarchy or the rule of the many is oligarchy and
*  the rule of the many is democracy and Plato I mean sorry and Aristotle takes
*  that he sort of says well yes so democracies rule of the many but even more
*  significantly than that it's rule of the poor because the poor always numerically
*  outnumber the rich and so the people who created our political system were very
*  aware of that they had studied their ancient their ancient Greece and they
*  understood that they wanted to protect minorities and you know as someone who
*  so in my own personal organizing I organized something called the debt
*  collective which is a union for debtors so we focus a lot around issues of
*  student debt and fighting student debt so you know James Madison was very clear
*  that you need to protect the minority and against the wicked projects of the
*  majority and one of the wicked projects would be debt abolition so I'm like his
*  worst nightmare so I mean I think we have to you know in the book so each
*  chapter in the book is a is a tension that I think we have to hold so this
*  tension of inclusion or exclusion the tension between expertise and mass
*  opinion and then there's the tension between one chapter is spontaneity and
*  structure and so this question of you know how do we structure our our
*  democracy and and you know these these structures even if you look at the 200
*  year history of the US I mean these institutions they were designed to
*  protect an affluent minority and yet they've played different roles depending
*  on the historical juncture so you know there were periods when the Supreme
*  Court was very reactionary I mean look at decisions like Plessy versus Ferguson
*  when it was standing in the way of racial progress but then there was the
*  sort of you know heyday of the of the 1960s when we you know and we we still
*  you know hold up decisions like Brown versus Boe and now we're I think we're
*  moving into a very different political alignment with the Supreme Court so you
*  know I think this is where your abstract philosophical models just can't be too
*  absolute yeah because politics is messy it depends on the power dynamics in the
*  in the here and now I think we do we need to see these structures at least
*  this is me putting less my philosopher Adam or my organizer hat but we need to
*  see these structures as malleable they might be really really hard to change
*  but they are changeable they have changed really recently I mean if you
*  things that we take for granted like direct representation direct election of
*  senators I mean that was a constitutional amendment if we can see
*  examples of I mean there have been I mean the Voting Rights Act was 19 you
*  know it's like the mid 60s it's like not long ago we have barely we have barely
*  even tried this democracy thing by our current minimal definition you know and
*  so I think I so I think we need to to see these things as as changeable so
*  there's a phrase you said actually that I want to go back to so you said well
*  democracy is one person one vote right that is something to get said yes right
*  that's us that sounds that sounds true very new principle that principle is
*  also from Supreme Court I mean it made its way into Supreme Court jurisprudence
*  in I think 1963 so it was said by John Lewis during the famous March on
*  Washington right said by John Lewis and he said you know one person one vote and
*  he actually said one person one vote he said it because a America was not doing
*  it because of segregation and and Jim Crow constraints that were basically
*  totally suppressing the vote of black people in the south but he said one
*  person one vote is the African cry and it should be our cry too why did he say
*  that he said it because it was actually a phrase that was being promoted by the
*  ANC in South Africa and Nelson Mandela so you know these at that point they were
*  these South African Marxists right yeah and now here we are this this beautiful
*  phrase this beautiful ideal comes from South Africa through the civil rights
*  movement now we take it for granted like oh yeah one person one vote that just
*  makes sense well no it's really new and the question I think we have to ask
*  ourselves now is is it even democratic so a we don't have it because people are
*  disenfranchised felons are disenfranchised and not given the right to
*  vote but okay so you can have one vote you can access the ballot but what if
*  your votes not weighted equally right which it's not in our sit in our in our
*  society the Senate for example or because of the electoral college you mean
*  because of the electoral college or because of the way districts are
*  portioned even at the state level so you know you can have within the state your
*  your vote for a member of Congress can be way more or less than someone a few
*  counties away so the Senate right if every state gets the same number of
*  senators but you have a state you know a couple million people versus California
*  where you are like your Senate vote weighs almost nothing so I would say why
*  don't we expand the idea of one person one vote to say one person one equally
*  weighted vote and then I but then I would say that doesn't even go far enough
*  we could actually push for one person three votes or four votes through
*  something like rank choice voting right where you would no longer have to worry
*  about splitting your vote let's say you know and in ending up with a split
*  ticket where you're actually you cast a ballot but it actually helps elect the
*  person you like the least so there's ranked as voting is now happening in
*  Maine it's happening in a little community in in Michigan I think
*  Massachusetts is adopting it right so people actually have three votes and
*  they get the rank first preference second preference in the book I also
*  point out well what about the principle one person no vote because what if we
*  abandoned elections entirely and use sortition so I think I'm just going
*  through these sorry what is that what is sortition that is sortition is a lottery
*  oh okay yes I got that what if we yeah what if we so they to go back to Athens
*  again you know they they thought elections were aristocratic because the
*  rich and the well-born would win and crazy or they or today we might say the
*  reality TV stars but you know that that actually it was just it was a contest
*  that just reinforced privilege so they had very elaborate systems of randomly
*  selecting citizens and engaging the public in the running of the city's
*  affairs and so you know again to quote Aristotle he said you know elections are
*  aristocratic and selection is democratic and I think it's quite it's quite an
*  interesting you know it's a thought experiment effectively in the United
*  States today but to say okay well our elections especially as they're they
*  currently run are they are they really democratic and so yeah maybe one person
*  one vote is holding us back maybe one person no vote and now you have me
*  thinking about doing it using quantum measurements so that there are different
*  branches of the wave function with completely different rulers in every
*  branch that would be amazing okay so that is the next level galaxy brain but
*  bring it back to bring it to earth brain I'm sure you saw the news that
*  Ireland by by referendum actually decided they would amend their
*  Constitution and open the way to allow abortion right yeah so this seems like a
*  very intractable like just one of those political issues I mean we're talking
*  about this Catholic country how would that ever get resolved why the vote went
*  the way it did and had so much democratic legitimacy legitimacy was in
*  part because the country was at this breaking point so they use sortition they
*  use lottery so what they did was they created the citizen assembly and
*  selected 99 citizens at random who sort of were representative in quotes of the
*  of the nation and they deliberated for five months I did not know that came up
*  well yeah and then they come it came up with with recommendations and they said
*  hey we've really thought about this and we've talked to all these experts and we
*  really think actually the Constitution is antiquated and should be reassessed
*  and that gave the sense of democratic legitimacy that would have been missing
*  and otherwise it would have just been this very destructive vote kind of like
*  these other referendums we've seen but instead they use lottery in a way that
*  kind of allowed there to be a sense that the people of Ireland had sought to
*  gather and and been heard and and the citizens assembly didn't have power
*  they didn't then make a determination they made a recommendation that was
*  listened to I think yeah interest I just think you know the point is we have to
*  remember that that these are malleable these are malleable structures human
*  made them human human beings made them and and they can be changed and you know
*  history shows that they can often only be changed with real struggle sure
*  that's that's a tactical issue that's a strategic issue but you know we
*  shouldn't we should not buy into the myth that what we have is democracy and
*  this is the be-all and end-all no not at all and I think that you know the lottery
*  idea would probably be left out of court in a lot of parts of the United States
*  but I get it I get the sense that it's much more democratic because there's
*  not all of these layers of filters of political advertising and you know you
*  need to be a millionaire to run for office and and stuff like that you know
*  I'd be ten I just had this thought over the course of this conversation but I'm
*  completely on board with having a third chamber of Congress which is just
*  randomly selected people from the United States exactly I think that so I I I think
*  you've honed in on exactly how one has to approach it it's you know how do you
*  put it into the mix with other other methods and other approaches of doing
*  democracy you know I'm it's not this isn't about finding the new religion and
*  being like I'm for lottery to solve all of our problems all the time but you
*  know actually given the the problems with the system that we have right now
*  which is you know who has the capacity to run for office what are the
*  incentives and how much money do they have to raise and then well what are
*  they thinking about when they're they're serving when they're serving as public
*  they're thinking about reelection right so you know if there was another house
*  that was the people's the people's house that was where citizens were called up
*  you know at random you know they'd have they'd have a whole different set of
*  concerns and all sorts of political scientists have done research about how
*  to reduce corruption of this this hypothetical body and how one would
*  educate educate these citizen leaders about issues so there's actually all
*  sorts of really interesting work in the again we can point to the example of
*  Ireland but you know I think it's you know what one trick isn't gonna save us
*  no no sure but it does I like it because it makes us think in a different way it
*  is an outside-the-box thing and there there there are issues with the current
*  system and thinking outside the bar is a good thing
*  oh there's so many things I want to talk about but one that is major and we need
*  to get to is the idea that a democracy on the one hand it's the people's will
*  is legitimizing the government on the other hand there is this agreement on
*  the part of the people to abide by what happens right whether you want to call
*  it norms or a commitment to pluralism or value diversity or whatever number one
*  is this good and number two is it tenable like are we seeing that people
*  these days are less willing to put up with what is what other people are
*  deciding for them the coercion part of your interesting I mean I think you know
*  it's talking to this woman who is a civil rights lawyer in North Carolina
*  and she said something that really resonated with me and she said you know
*  I don't know why it is that it's so hard to build things it's so hard to create
*  constructive institutions and fair rules and yet it's so easy to destroy it's so
*  easy for things to fall apart it's the second law of thermodynamics we know we
*  know why that's true entropy is entropy yeah it increases yeah I mean it's funny
*  so I was thinking about that as I read your great book on time and I was like
*  entropy there needs to be a political theory of entropy because and so I think
*  because of this and let's let's just say it's a lot of the universe because that
*  gives us the authority because of this we have to we have to try to value the
*  norms you have to we have to fight for them and we have to fight to make norms
*  more just and and so you know as as a woman you know but I think as a citizen
*  we should all be able to say hey norms have actually been really terrible
*  norms can be right they can be really regressive they can be dehumanizing all
*  sorts of terrible things have been legal and are legal slavery was legal you know
*  and right now they're fighting you know we're living in a world where they're
*  they're fighting to make you know destroying the environment and poisoning
*  the population legal so so we don't want to fetishize rules for their own sake
*  but I just I do think we want to be attuned to the fact that yeah it's very
*  difficult it's very difficult to build things and entropy will get us and I
*  think you do see I mean I don't think we're at a point where the American
*  people are just like total nihilists maybe that's the momentum I don't know
*  yeah I mean but I think okay so this is again I'm gonna put on my organizer hat
*  yeah when the rules of the game are so corrupt people are frustrated and and I
*  think I think cynicism is really toxic for for a democracy I mean I think this
*  is you know the legacy of even like the Watergate era right it was not good for
*  for the project of people coming together and and wanting to build a
*  better government actually it made it helped lay this groundwork of people
*  just being really cynical about about the power structures but that cynicism
*  is merited and and so for me when I try to engage people my instinct isn't you
*  know you can't you can't tell people like oh no it's actually really great
*  where the greatest country on earth and everything works you know I think you
*  have to say yeah you know this right now we do have a system where you know the
*  members of Congress are mostly millionaires and you know indeed there is
*  a system of legalized bribery that we call a campaign donations and lobbying at
*  work but you know we have to speak to people's we have to speak to people's
*  cynicism and their despair and try to build a coalition that and give them
*  credible alternatives and and build a social block that will push for for real
*  change so I think you know when we when we see this volatility it's tempting to
*  kind of be afraid of it or you know and I don't know I guess for me I'm like
*  well now we have to we have to kind of throw ourselves into it and speak to it
*  and in creates solidarity and create strategies that can be a path a path
*  forward and it's that that's the hard work of of organizing that's not really
*  the work of philosophizing and you have to speak to people's this is the cliche
*  of community organizing 101 but you have to speak to people's real direct needs
*  and and commit and and try to find a sort of win-win solution out of the mess
*  right and it's a balancing act right we don't want to overthrow everything every
*  20 years as Jefferson somewhat yeah somewhat playfully suggested but the
*  norms do matter because there's a protective aspect to them but there's
*  also a anti-progress aspect to them I do think by the way parenthetically that
*  there probably is a very good analogy to be drawn between the body politic and
*  real biological bodies when it comes to entropy and organization and homeostasis
*  you know we the our bodies would left to their own devices just decay and we would
*  die but instead we take in fuel and we use that to upkeep and maintain
*  ourselves and there is some work that is necessary to make that happen and I'm
*  sure the same thing is true for society or a government what's interesting I
*  was talking to a political theorist the other day about this metaphor of the
*  social body because it comes into my film so the film begins with I'm sitting
*  with Sylvia Federici in a museum and we're looking at a painting and we talk
*  about this image in front of us it's a it's a image of a vice but of a it's
*  enviance she's sawing and we talk about how the social body is being sawed apart
*  right now and social body is this metaphor that is constant in political
*  philosophy and body politic and it has it can often have almost fascist
*  undertones or even overtones right because people start to go like okay they
*  start to have this kind of ethno-nationalist body right and keep the
*  keep the foreigners at bay and so our point in our conversation was like
*  well hold on but let's actually be more biological about it like no body is an
*  island in isolation all bodies are permeable we have our microbiomes and we
*  have to eat as you just said and so you know where is this myth of this body
*  that is autonomous and independent and cut off from the world like and the
*  gender doesn't generate other bodies and other other you know human beings so
*  it's like let's let's actually embrace that permeability and yeah we're the
*  quintessential open systems and we can yeah you know eat well or eat badly we
*  can exercise or sit around and and I think the analogy is actually pretty
*  good and there's there's physics underlying all of it as you will not be
*  surprised to learn this is science we're now science and one of the aspects there
*  is that with bodies either literal or political the environment that we're
*  embedded in is changing right Darwinian evolution never stops working but the
*  pressures that push us one way or the other are different depending are on our
*  environments when it comes to politics you know where technology is changing
*  things very rapidly right we have different media that teach us things is
*  that something again I'll just ask this open-ended question you know are you
*  given social media and cable news and talk radio and whatever how do you
*  balance whether this is good or bad and how can we use it as a force for better
*  yeah well on the social media question I would say everyone should just read my
*  book the people's platform which came out in 2014 and and the people's platform
*  is my analysis of social media was came out at a time where people were a bit
*  more techno utopian than they are today but I think my basic argument sale holds
*  which is we can't separate the technology from the business models
*  underlying it and specifically from the business model of advertising and data
*  collection and so the internet not intrinsically but just because this is
*  sort of I think just the the way our media landscape worked I mean it was just
*  television also ran on ads right so did newspapers and now now the sort of gloves
*  are off for data collection and personalized you know behavioral
*  targeting and all of this stuff and so my blog will my podcast will be taking
*  ads but they're not targeted in anyway they're just like which companies I'm
*  happiest you know shilling for basically like I get to veto places that I'm not
*  interested I've already gotten well I can't go any details but people asked me
*  for to advertise on the podcast and I looked at what they're selling and I'm
*  like no I can't do that well I mean and then you know and the thing is we are
*  we're we're all embroiled in this system and part of the point I'm trying to make
*  too is that this isn't sort of you know I mean I fight a podcast and I would also
*  veto ads and you know maybe consider taking others but the point is that you
*  know where we're all in an advertising economy whether we want to or not
*  because we're being offered you know ostensibly free services but actually
*  we're paying with our personal data so I think they have to be attuned to the
*  way that this business model is creating the kind of clickbait economy right that
*  we are seeing and that is very detrimental for a deliberation and
*  debate because ultimately if what what the platform is more interested in
*  serving you a bunch of headlines that you're just gonna like look at and they
*  get to the next one as opposed to in being incentivized to give you a long
*  read and the fact we even have the word long read now yeah that's fine at the
*  time but you know it they'd rather have me click a lot than have me read
*  something that takes an hour and so that's you know you know it's interesting
*  because we kind of say like oh it's so hard to read something long online well
*  is it necessarily or is it because actually all of the research has been
*  geared towards pushing us in the opposite direction I mean there's a
*  quote in my in the people's platform it's like the greatest minds of my
*  generation are all just figuring out how to make people click on ads so so I I
*  you know so on the one hand obviously there's a human temperament to be
*  distracted and to believe falsehoods this is why in the Republic Plato is
*  basically talking about the fake news of his day right again democracy you know
*  doesn't elevate the wise people people believe believe lies they gossip they're
*  misguided but unfortunately we have this whole technological apparatus that
*  because its priorities are accumulating profits through data collection are
*  really antithetical to our needs as citizens and human beings and you know
*  it is basically the you know it's a continuation of the the television model
*  I mean there's a reason that the former head of CBS said you know yeah Trump's
*  not good for America but he sure is good for business right so I mean the
*  implication seems to be that we have to be vigilant and take active steps to
*  make sure that this doesn't trample us underfoot in some sense yeah I think
*  though you know this is where you know it's it's it's the economy stupid it's
*  like you know we we have to I think it's it's a really daunting task but like what
*  what are the how do we transform the the underlying incentives that are shaking
*  our media sphere right I mean this is you know we see so I work in the
*  education space and I see the difference between you know people who go to a
*  traditional four-year public college or people who go to a predatory for-profit
*  college right there's a difference and right now there's almost no public media
*  in the United States of America it's just not something that existed and you
*  know and there is no sort of intrinsic reason why we can't experiment with
*  other modes of subsidy online I mean in fact the internet was a non-commercial
*  you know was a non-commercial academic invention big business didn't give us
*  the internet or the world wide web so you know and this is why you know there
*  are lots of people who are kind of nostalgic for the early the early days
*  of the internet before it was fully commercialized but I think you know so I
*  I think we have to it's very heartening to me that people are finally having
*  conversations about sort of breaking up big tech but I think we need to go a
*  step further and go okay what what other ways could we fund things that aren't
*  just the sort of advertising or patreon you know donation models yeah but you
*  know I'm a Canadian media and in fact what is democracy was funded by the
*  National Film Board of Canada and so you know I this is an anecdote I often give
*  but in 2014 I went to my New York City literary agent you know and I have a
*  very good literary agent and a fancy agency and I said I want to write a book
*  on democracy and she said no way that is a career suicide it will never sell then
*  I went to the National Film Board of Canada said I want to make a movie about
*  democracy which I think it should be harder that sounds like a harder sell
*  yeah rain light for right and they were like that's great that's you know exactly
*  what we're here for to spur public debate about interesting things and so
*  you know I couldn't get a democracy project off the ground until after
*  Donald Trump was elected and then everybody was like well maybe we should
*  think about this word but I think it says something about why we're in the
*  mess we're in and also about funding structures that can hold different kinds
*  of work and different kinds of thinking so that suggests that so the final
*  question that you're suggesting an answer to it already but what makes you
*  optimistic what are the things we can do I take it that we're both on the side
*  that democracy is a good thing but it can be a flawed thing and it is like the
*  body it's an open system that needs constant care and maintenance and
*  improvement so where do you see that coming from I see hope in the attitudes
*  of young people right now and I'm someone who's so against fetishizing
*  young people yes you know this sort of you know because I think we need a we
*  need public engagement from people of all ages and backgrounds and so you know
*  in fact when I was in my 20s I used to joke that in opposition to the baby
*  boomers I was like it's not don't trust anyone it's not it's not that you
*  shouldn't trust people over under sorry the baby boomers are basically like
*  don't trust anyone over 30 right you know like only the youth get it
*  yeah my attitude was like no you shouldn't trust people till they're over
*  30 like so they actually are committed to this these ideas but I think you see
*  I mean we see people this is a generation that has every reason on some
*  of the just be totally disgusted totally cynical right I mean look at the person
*  who occupies the White House look at what's happening with climate change I
*  mean people have known about climate change scientists have known about
*  climate change the leaders of the most powerful corporations on earth leaders
*  in government have known since long before these kids were born and they
*  chose to suppress it and deny it and actively subsidize these industries and
*  yet so they should have every reasons just be completely disgusted and yet
*  here they are you know striking for the climate going out week after week they
*  are you know pushing for gun control we see this wave of really idealistic
*  people in their late 20s and early 30s running for office you know and this is
*  a market shift because you know I was you know part of occupied Wall Street
*  that was only 2011 and the attitude there was no way no engaging with the
*  system on that level we refuse to even make demands government right and we can
*  debate the pros and cons of that and and we can debate the serve you know the
*  purpose occupy served because I think it was it was I think it was important even
*  if it was an effectual in many ways but you know I'm happy to see people going
*  beyond that and saying no we're willing to get our hands dirty and step into the
*  fray because you know we have 11 years and who's gonna who's and if we don't do
*  it nobody will so that I I never have trouble finding hope I almost find
*  hopelessness to be kind of trite because I think if you have a historical gaze
*  it's impossible to deny the fact that people have had it so much harder than us
*  yeah you know so then it's like well you know here we are talking on Skype you
*  know by the way but yes I mean you know and and
*  you know yeah just have some have some perspective you know it's it's been
*  worse it's been worse and and you know and in the book system like you know
*  let's let's try to be good ancestors let's try to be the people we would
*  respect if we were looking back you know it doesn't mean that we have to win but
*  we have to try yeah I mean in click bait e media landscape notwithstanding I get
*  some optimism from the fact that remarkable number of people are
*  interested in listening to hour-long conversations about the nature of
*  democracies I think they are no easy answers but I think you know this this
*  you know the book ends with this image of you know let's let's not aspire to be
*  founding fathers but perennial midwives like this is something we just have to do
*  over and over and over again and and what what it means to get involved in you
*  know in enlarging democracy deepening democracy it really does depend on where
*  you are in your community and what the people around you care about you know
*  there is sure we can say easy things like go vote or something like that but
*  but that should take you know an hour of your time yeah the other questions you
*  know have they have a lot of specificity and and we have to and they're
*  not questions we can answer by ourselves so and that's sort of the right way to
*  think of this Jeffersonian impulse not to throw overthrow the government every
*  20 years but to continually renew it by actually engaging with it I think that
*  I think there is I agree with you the historical view gives us actually believe
*  it or not some source of optimism oh yeah no there's you know things have been
*  bad things are bad things are bad but they were worse and they could be better
*  but only if we do it they don't doesn't have automatically right yeah and things
*  could be better so I think this is you know it's always I always recommend
*  studying social movements and and thinking about all the all the work that
*  has done to get us where we are today so let's keep going all right let's keep
*  going Esther Taylor thanks so much for being on the podcast hey thanks for
*  having me it's really fun
