As an experimental facility, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva has been extraordinarily successful, discovering the Higgs boson and measuring multiple features of particle-physics interactions at unprecedented energies. But to theorists, the results have been somewhat frustrating, as we were hoping to find brand-new phenomena beyond the Standard Model. There is nothing to do but to keep looking, recognizing that we have to choose our methods judiciously. I talk with theoretical physicist Cari Cesarotti about what experimental results the modern particle physicist most looks forward to, and how we might eventually get there, especially through the prospect of a muon collider.

Cari Cesarotti received her Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University. She is currently a postdoctoral fellow at MIT. Her research is on particle phenomenology theory, with an eye toward experimental searches. Among her awards are the Sakurai Dissertation Award in Theoretical Physics from the American Physical Society and the Young Scientist Award at the 14th International Conference on the Identification of Dark Matter.

# Mindscape 289  Cari Cesarotti on the Next Generation of Particle Experiments
**Mindscape Podcast:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELe3fvuTsdE)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. In
*  science, when things are going well, there is an interplay between theory and
*  experiment. Experimenters notice something about the world, theorists
*  rush to offer an explanation or many explanations for those phenomena, the
*  experimenters go out and test the predictions of the theory, they discover
*  even new things, the theorists are called in again, and it keeps going back and
*  But occasionally, in fact I would say almost never, but sometimes, one can be the
*  victim of one's own success, and that is the story of modern particle physics. In
*  the 50s, 60s, 70s, we were just splashed with all sorts of experimental results
*  that were very puzzling, very interesting, very intriguing, very hard to explain. We
*  put together a theory, the standard model of particle physics, and then something
*  happened that almost never happens in science, which is that we kept collecting
*  data, the experimenters have not slowed down, they've not gotten worse at their
*  job, they're probing the universe in regimes where we have not yet probed it,
*  but the new data is still in line with the standard model, with the theory that
*  we put together back in the 60s and 70s. The capstone of this, of course, was the
*  discovery in 2012 of the Higgs boson, something that was predicted to exist
*  back in the 1960s, with more or less the same properties that we had predicted it
*  should have back in the 1960s. Despite that success, there are plenty of reasons
*  to think the standard model is not the final answer. Of course, it doesn't
*  include gravity as a fully quantum mechanical theory, but also what is the
*  dark matter? Why are there so many particles? Why do they have the numbers
*  that they have? Why is there more matter than antimatter? A whole bunch of
*  questions that are looming over the standard model, or to think of it as a
*  physicist would think about it, there are clues that there must be deeper stuff
*  going on than the standard model of particle physics. And despite this
*  wonderful ability of experimentalists to come up with new experiments looking
*  beyond where they've looked before, it's hard to keep that project up in
*  fundamental particle physics. It's expensive, the time scales are very, very
*  slow, it's a different kind of problem. Every science has its own idiosyncrasies,
*  but in biology, if you're working with a little C. elegans roundworm, you can go
*  in there and change its genome and make it do something that has literally never
*  been done before, at least as witnessed by human beings. In particle
*  physics, it is very, very difficult to do an experiment that probes into a regime
*  where human beings have never probed before. You need a lot of money, a lot of
*  engineering know-how, and at this day and age, you need a lot of political will. It's
*  a more than one country kind of international collaboration to get this
*  going. So the question is, the Large Hadron Collider was super successful as
*  a machine. They found the Higgs boson, Nobel prizes were given out. I would like
*  one more Nobel Prize to be given out to the actual experimenters who were
*  responsible for that, but we'll see whether that happens. The question is,
*  where to go next? What are we going to do? We're in this weird position, a theory
*  that fits the data, but we know, or we strongly, strongly think that it's not
*  the final theory. So there's different programs on the board, different
*  proposals for what to do. The folks at CERN, which is the home of Large Hadron
*  Collider, would love to build a larger Hadron Collider or Electron Collider or
*  something like that on their site. There are people in China who want to build an
*  ultra-high-energy machine. We're not sure what we're going to do next. Today's
*  guest, Kari Cesarotti, is a particle theorist. So she works on building models
*  of new kinds of particle physics that could then go out and be tested, but she's
*  especially interested in literally the experiments you can do and figuring out
*  what are the best experiments possibly that you can do. So rather than sitting
*  back in the armchair and thinking about quantum gravity and the emergence of
*  space-time, as some people want to do, she wants to make predictions and then
*  go test them in a very, very detailed way. And the particular way that she is
*  most fond of is colliding muons together. Muons were discovered back in the 1930s
*  by Carl Anderson. There's a brief moment in the 1930s when Carl Anderson, a
*  physicist at Caltech, had discovered half of the known particles in existence,
*  because before Anderson there was only electrons, protons, and neutrons. And then
*  he discovered the positron, the antiparticle, the electron, as well as the
*  muon and the anti-muon. And the muon was the particle that led I.I. Robbie to say,
*  who ordered that? It was not clear what purpose it served. It was not part of the
*  atom or anything like that. Of course today there's plenty of things that are
*  not part of our everyday human existence, but they're there, out there as
*  particles. Muons are heavier cousins of the electrons, so they have a lot of
*  benefits that electrons have and protons have. They're kind of a happy medium in
*  between them. Massive like the proton, but easy to control like the electron. So
*  why not build a machine? Well sadly the muons decay in about a
*  microsecond. That causes some technological challenges and it's
*  plausible that we are right now at the verge of being able to address those
*  technological challenges, opening up the possibility of building a muon collider
*  and testing physics beyond the standard model of particle physics in a way we've
*  never been able to do before. Carrie's going to give us the sales pitch for
*  doing that. I hope you come away convinced that this would be a wonderful
*  idea. So let's go.
*  Carrie Cesarotti, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Hi Sean, thanks for having me.
*  So the standard model of particle physics, this is what people like you and
*  I think about a lot these days. Let me ask like a silly question to start. Do
*  you think that the standard model is beautiful or is it kind of an ugly
*  duckling as theories go? Ooh, interesting question. I've never had it quite
*  posed like that. I think in some ways it is quite beautiful in the sense that
*  there's a lot of patterns that we see and in physics really the thing that we
*  love to see is patterns. So we see that there are three generations of a lot of
*  things. We see that the gauge bosons kind of fit nicely in one bucket. We see
*  that there's the pattern of things getting heavier and things coupling more
*  strongly to the Higgs. So in that sense it is a very beautiful model, but in the
*  bigger sense of where did this thing come from, it's very ugly in the sense
*  that there's not really a fundamental explanation as to why particles look and
*  behave the way that they do. Well let's just be nice to our historian
*  listeners or whatever and explain what a gauge boson is and why you say they go
*  into a bucket. Fair enough. Yeah, so in the standard model there are basically
*  two kinds of particles. They're either fermions or bosons. So the fermions are
*  the things that tend to make up matter. Things like electrons are fermions.
*  Things like quarks, which are the particles that you find inside of
*  nucleons are fermions. And then the gauge bosons are the particles that
*  effectively tie everything together because they mediate the forces
*  exchanged between these particles. So fermions often we like to think of as
*  matter. If they live long enough to survive then they can be stable matter.
*  And then the bosons are the force carriers. So things like electromagnetic
*  fields, the particle description would be made out of bosons. And the standard
*  model is that's the label. It's such a boring label. I mean it gives you the
*  impression that it's just the model we had today and tomorrow we're gonna
*  change it. But there's a little bit more stability here. Yeah, I mean that's kind
*  of funny. Whenever I think of standard model I kind of think of like you know
*  like the most beautiful, you know, like the most beautiful model. Like the
*  standard model. Like the thing that you would think of when you consider a
*  beautiful person. It's like yeah okay. So interesting that you have that. But I
*  mean yes the model is inherently something that it's not supposed to be
*  a first principles object, right? It models the things that we see but it
*  doesn't come from a deep, you know, a core principle. So in the sense that yeah
*  it could move around if we find something that's in conflict with our
*  current model. That's true. But so far it's done an amazing job at actually
*  accounting for a lot of the physical phenomena we've been able to see.
*  Actually that's something worth amplifying on because maybe we don't
*  always make it clear to folks but the difference between a model and maybe a
*  theory or a framework, right? I mean we have quantum field theory as a very
*  broad framework and then this very specific thing of the standard model.
*  Yeah, I mean so this is a really subtle question that I feel like you kind of
*  roll your eyes at the first time you're taught this distinction in school. But
*  yeah a model is something that we use to account for phenomena that we observe. So
*  it's very empirical in nature, right? Like the standard model we don't
*  necessarily know why there are three generations of everything but we observe
*  them. So they go into the standard model versus something like grand unified
*  theory would be a way of explaining sort of why everything comes together in the
*  way they do. So certainly we can't talk about the details of grand unified theory
*  if we're gonna talk about other things. But yeah the difference is like you
*  mentioned that something is first principles to motivate where it comes
*  from versus something that's a way to kind of categorize empirical evidence
*  that we've seen. And the standard model of particle physics as we call it, it
*  does a pretty good job of accounting for what we see. It does a frustratingly good
*  job, Sean. Tell us, tell us what that exactly means. Why is that frustrating
*  and how good is the job? Yeah so I mean the kind of work that we do as particle
*  theorists, right, is we want to basically stress test the standard model and either
*  confirm very rare predictions that it can make and so sort of see very hard to
*  to see phenomena show up in things like colliders which is my personal specialty
*  and realm of interest. And then also we want to see where it breaks, right? We
*  want to see if there are pockets of predictions that are false or that are
*  just lacking or we see some phenomena that's unexplained by the standard
*  model. And that's where it's fun to be a researcher, right, is when you try to
*  come up with solutions to why this prediction isn't quite matching your
*  expectation. But we, it's a weird thing, right? I mean we have a theory that fits
*  so much data and yet we're convinced it's not right. Like why don't we just declare
*  victory and you know do biology? I mean fair enough and I think in fact a
*  lot of people have had that mentality but there are some pretty big holes in
*  particle physics and I think kind of the phase transition that we've gone through
*  as a field in the past few decades certainly in my career which has been
*  albeit not quite as prolific as you're Ashant. You're younger. But yeah I mean
*  there's big open questions that are becoming more and more sort of nuanced
*  versus like ah what the heck is this? Right? Like that's that that used to be
*  the state of affairs is that we'd turn on our little bubble chambers and we'd
*  look at something and be like oh what the heck is this? And that was a really
*  rich interesting time to be a physicist and a lot of theories came and went and
*  we were able to make an amazing amount of progress in such a short period of
*  time just from experimental evidence, right? And now I think we're in a much
*  more subtle phase of particle physics where the questions are not so much what
*  the heck is this but where does this come from? Why does this look like this?
*  What are the things that we're not seeing? You know like things that are
*  much more fundamental towards why has the universe taken on this profile? And
*  I think that you know in certain corners of the internet anyway there's it's a
*  big internet out there. There's a lot of corners to it but there are people who worry they would almost give you the
*  impression that the slowing down of discoveries in fundamental physics is
*  somehow physicists fault. Like you're not doing it right. And I try to explain
*  that's not really it. Do you have a favorite way of conceptualizing this?
*  Yeah I mean it's so funny that you say it like that because in some way I feel a
*  bit flattered to think that people think that you know my work is so important
*  that anything consequential could be the fault of mine. It's like well
*  thank you my goodness. But I mean yeah it's just it's physics is a field that I
*  think has always kind of suffered from you know being something that the public
*  really enjoys as much as something like astronomy or biology where people either
*  see or experience much more of it because physics requires as we are
*  already seeing in this conversation you and I are having right physics requires
*  so much lead-up to understanding sort of why it's surprising or exciting or
*  interesting or puzzling right. So I think that a lot of this rhetoric comes from
*  the fact that the LHC turned on and we just saw the Higgs boson and it's kind
*  of a ridiculous sentence to me to say oh we just saw the Higgs boson because
*  this was like the linchpin to making sure the standard model was even first
*  order correct. So yeah I mean like the answer is just that there's not new
*  particles showing up with sort of the unexpected frequency which they were in
*  sort of the 50s to 80s and who ordered that was kind of the motto of particle
*  physicists. But to say that that's a failure versus just the field has matured
*  a lot I think is underselling all the work that people have done for the past
*  70 years. But there still are looming questions and you used maybe the perfect
*  word here when you said there are subtle questions right. It's not like here is a
*  picture in our experiment that we can't explain it's like we have a feeling
*  there are deeper explanations and there are reasons to go look for them. Yeah
*  absolutely. So sort of the the jargon that you might hear people use in
*  particle physics is the hierarchy problem. And if you are not thinking about
*  it all the time it's kind of easy to write off as well is this really a
*  problem or are you just looking to keep yourselves relevant. But you know
*  effectively how I like to describe it is you know I loved all the sitcoms from
*  the 90s or whatever where it's like oh no like something is going to close
*  unless we find thirty five thousand six hundred and twenty nine dollars and
*  fifteen cents and then behind them you see the banner that's like talent show
*  grand prize thirty five thousand dollars six hundred twenty nine and thirteen
*  cents. I think that was the same number. But yeah like the fact that there are
*  numbers that can that for some reason are so big and yet agree down to such a
*  small accuracy is something that should be fundamental fundamentally puzzling
*  right. Good so let's let's be a little bit more explicit now you know we've
*  we've we've stopped to the historians out there now you know for the physics
*  enthusiasts what are the specific problems you mentioned the hierarchy
*  problem what is this that sounds like politics not physics. I mean these days
*  kind of hard to disentangle honestly. Yeah so the hierarchy problem is
*  something specific to understanding the mass of the Higgs boson which is one of
*  the bosons in the Standard Model and the Higgs is the weirdest particle in the
*  Standard Model by far. It is the only particle that has the properties that it
*  has so like I said earlier a lot of particles sit in three generations the
*  Higgs boson does not the Higgs boson stands as a very weird outsider that you
*  may have heard is responsible for giving particles mass and if you want to learn
*  all about that there's a beautiful book by Matt Strassler that you should
*  definitely check out. But the Higgs boson gives particles mass has different what
*  we'll call yeah intrinsic properties it's called the spin and specific that
*  doesn't match any other particle and because of that effectively we think
*  that the Higgs boson should have a mass 10 to the 18 times bigger than it does
*  and so this is the hierarchy problem and the hierarchy is just the mass scale
*  that we expect and the mass scale that we see everything else sitting at and the
*  fact that there is 10 to the 18 differences I mean really 10 to the 32
*  because it's squared and that's the real first principles number the fact that
*  something could be off by 32 orders of magnitude from our theoretical
*  predictions where did that come from right? Right but okay I'm gonna be a
*  little bit unfair to you I mean you use words like what the mass should be yeah
*  like that I mean how do you know what the mass should be? What gives us that
*  expectation? So this is definitely questions that when I was in high school
*  so I was in high school right when I was ending high school when the Higgs boson
*  was discovered so if you guys want to calculate how old that makes me please
*  don't but yeah I remember having this exact same thought when people were
*  like oh but is it the Higgs you know did we really discover the Higgs and I was
*  like well who cares you discovered a particle and it's right where you thought
*  the Higgs like why do you get to say oh is it the Higgs you know and the truth
*  is like you said earlier is that there are a lot of ways in which we can have
*  actual predictions using frameworks and not just models so the model is the
*  thing that the mass that we observe is plugged into versus the theoretical
*  framework is in how we make the predictions so given the properties that
*  we hypothesized of the Higgs that make it a particle that could in fact give
*  mass to other particles then we have the theoretical tools to make a prediction
*  of what the mass should be and so basically because the Higgs matched the
*  properties that we modeled it to have then we can actually use a theoretical
*  framework to calculate what its mass should have been if things were as
*  simple as we hypothesized to be so the fact that there is something going on
*  that we don't quite understand is one of the biggest open problems of particle
*  physics to me okay good so that's the hierarchy problem there's probably a
*  bunch of other problems there dark matter is the obvious one so you thought
*  matter is for sure and I feel like it's kind of unfair for particle physicists
*  to claim this as strictly a particle physics problem because it could be
*  astro it could be cosmology like there's a lot of different buckets in which you
*  could put the dark matter problem but certainly if dark matter has a particle
*  description that is also something that the standard model should try to should
*  try to sort out and do you worry that much about neutrinos and their masses
*  that is that is those are actual discoveries that we made over the last
*  25 years this is the biggest fight I've gotten to with my PhD advisor is
*  neutrino mass new physics or not because one could argue that there exists a way
*  account for neutrino masses in the standard model but my my response to that
*  is you can't do it with only fundamental interactions you have to have something
*  that happens a little bit more complicated so because there does not
*  exist a fundamental interaction term that we can write down for neutrinos
*  that give the mass because they can't it won't work the same way as the other
*  particles with the Higgs boson because that that's not true I think there that
*  is an example of new physics however I don't want to I don't want to start a
*  fight on that today so maybe another day I'd be happy to start a fight but yeah
*  neutrino oscillations inherit violation of lepton number something else is going
*  on there right absolutely well okay let's indulge ourselves then a little bit
*  and try to figure out if we can explain why you can't give neutrinos masses the
*  give electrons or quarks masses okay how do I say this without talking about
*  left-handed and right-handed fields okay so what's what we've seen in the
*  standard model is that there exists left-handed and right-handed fields and
*  this is sort of the fundamental difference between massless versus
*  massive particles is the amount of what we call degrees of freedom which you
*  need to have an object sort of propagate so for massive particles they have a
*  left and a right-handed component and you can think about this I think with
*  sort of relativity is the best way to sort of understand it so if you have
*  something that's got angular momentum let's say that it's turning to the
*  right if something is massive then you as an observer can boost yourself either
*  in front or behind of that object and if you are in front you see it turning one
*  way and if you're behind you see it turning a different way so you need to
*  have an object that allows to spin both to the right and to the left to be able
*  to describe that in nature however if the object is massless then it is
*  traveling at the speed of light and there does not exist a valid frame in
*  which you can boost to flip that spin so this is why you don't need both a left
*  and a right-handed spinning degree of freedom to describe these particles so
*  in our standard model we have left and right-handed degrees of freedom for all
*  of the quarks and the electron and the muon which is my favorite particle and
*  the tau but we do not have that for the neutrinos for the neutrinos we only have
*  left-handed field components so if they were to get mass you would need to have
*  either two neutrinos and two Higgs's interacting which is different from the
*  fermions which is just one Higgs and and two of the fermions but that presents
*  yeah that's something that we have not been able to verify if this is if this is
*  right so the neutrinos could be what we either call Majorana fermions where they
*  don't have to have this left and right-handed story or they can be Dirac
*  where they do have a left and right-handed story and we just haven't
*  found the right-handed component of the neutrino yet good so I don't know if
*  that was way too technical or not no I think well it was it was goodly technical
*  I like it but maybe we can boil it down so there's in the standard model for the
*  other particles for the other fermions we know they have a right-handed part and
*  left-handed part and then Higgs sort of glues them together and gives them mass
*  exactly for the neutrino we know they have a left-handed part yes and the
*  right-handed part is not necessarily there but you you need it to make mass
*  or you can be more tricky yeah so you if you want it to basically have the same
*  sort of mechanism as the other fermions in the standard model which would make
*  sense because again as physicists the thing that we say is beautiful is
*  symmetry if you want it to have a left-handed and right-handed component
*  then we just need to find a new particle that is the right-handed neutrino and
*  then it could get its math through the Higgs and things could be similar but a
*  bit different to the rest of the standard model the other option that I
*  said before to do perhaps what's my Rana for me on instead is that you don't need
*  the left hand the right-handed is that the neutrino you just need the one
*  degree of freedom in the neutrino and then if you have two of those degrees of
*  freedom put together stitched together with two Higgs's then you can also have
*  the same sort of mass giving mechanism but again that would look very different
*  from the standard model so the fact that you know all the particles get their
*  mass one way except for this one kind of particle which gets their mass a
*  different way that's still a very interesting question and to understand
*  how that came to be is something that would require further study right okay
*  So very good so along with the hierarchy problem neutrino masses we can come up
*  with theories that explain them but they're pointing toward things that we
*  haven't yet found this is what motivates people like you to continue on the
*  search for new particle physics yeah and we haven't found something that's we
*  haven't yeah we haven't found definitive evidence that a single fundamental
*  interaction could explain this and I think you know as particle physicists we
*  love when there is a functional description which again is the standard
*  model but to have a fundamental description that's really I think that's
*  really what we all chase good very good and the last thing I wanted to mention
*  were muons you've already mentioned them if this counts in your mind but the
*  muon is basically the heavier cousin of the electron and then there's the tau
*  which is a heavier cousin of that and one can ask why are there three copies
*  of all these particles is that one of the puzzles we worry about oh absolutely
*  yeah so this this puzzle comes in a bunch of different names I think to kind
*  of put all of them into sort of one area that we could describe it it's kind of
*  the question of flavor physics so you know I don't suspect particles have that
*  different of taste but what do I know so flavor is just sort of another name that
*  we give to particles to describe how properties are different so you know
*  charge is the one that we all learn in school and that we're most familiar with
*  because there's plus and minus charge but particles have a lot of properties
*  and we just kind of need names for them so flavor is the name that we tend to
*  give the different generations of particles so muons are a different
*  flavor than electrons again how they taste is not something I can comment on
*  but yeah so we call this sort of the flavor flavor physics is sort of the the
*  study of understanding why the different generations behave a bit differently and
*  so what's the answer all these questions I mean I know that supersymmetry was out
*  Sean if I knew you would reveal it on this podcast I'm pretty sure and the
*  Nobel prizes would come showering upon me I would be in your acceptance speech
*  you know I think we'd have to share it honestly but okay for a long time the
*  particle physics community was very excited about supersymmetry yes and they
*  were hoping to see it at the large hadron collider etc maybe enthusiasm has
*  cooled for that but not completely gone away what is what is your take yeah so
*  supersymmetry is a pretty well-named thing in particle physics it's like
*  taking the symmetries that we have but then more so it's supersymmetry and
*  basically it's adding one extra symmetry into sort of our description of space
*  time itself and then the the consequences of that tend to be in the
*  simplest description of it is that all the particles we've seen in the standard
*  model have what we call very cutely super partners and basically they're the same
*  particle with very similar properties except for fermions become bosons and
*  bosons become fermions so supersymmetry was an amazing idea for a lot of reasons
*  one because it introduced an extra symmetry which again we all love and if
*  there's if there's a way for symmetry to exist oh boy do we want it to exist and
*  the problem that it really famously addressed is exactly this hierarchy
*  problem is that if you want to understand why you have a very very big
*  number as a prediction but you see a very very small number experimentally
*  measured the easiest answer is there's a symmetry that cancels something right
*  symmetry is a fancy way of just saying that there's basically a copy of
*  something so the symmetry is a way of explaining why two big numbers should
*  almost exactly cancel so supersymmetry as we could have seen it before the large
*  hadron collider turned on would have been an amazing way of explaining why
*  the Higgs boson has a mass of around a hundred GEV instead of ten to the 18 GEV
*  so that was kind of the most exciting promise is that there was a fundamental
*  reason why this particle was so light and there was expectation of all these
*  new particles that we would hope to see and it was you know going to be an
*  amazing time and people were even worried that we couldn't find the Higgs
*  boson because there'd be too many of these other super partners and
*  unfortunately we turned on the LHC and we did not see the super partners so
*  supersymmetry as theorized in its most beautiful pure form of having the
*  maximal symmetry is not something that's probably realizable at this point
*  however there are versions of it in which you can sort of introduce new
*  particles or new interactions that sort of take you away from that perfectly
*  symmetric case and sort of break the symmetry so you know of course these
*  theories still exist and it's still worth looking for assuming that we have
*  the tools to do so but at some point you're not solving the fundamental
*  question that you asked or you have to introduce something that basically
*  replaces the fundamental question that you were asking so it becomes a bit of a
*  patchwork solution rather than a global solution and that's something much less
*  attractive so if we were having this conversation 20 years ago you might have
*  been very excited about your supersymmetric grand unified theory that
*  was going to predict that was gonna solve the hierarchy problem and give you
*  the right dark matter and explain neutrino masses and evidence for it
*  would be existing at the LHC and that did not happen yeah I mean it is it is
*  definitely something that really is is a marker of a very healthy theory in
*  physics I think is when it can sort of address many problems at once versus
*  just you know picking one problem and trying to like I said patchwork it so
*  yeah it was it was a really beautiful theory that had a lot of reasons to be
*  motivated could address a lot of questions that we had about the
*  standard model and yeah the fact that we didn't see it I think has put us into a
*  little bit of a crisis in terms of the theory world in the particle physics
*  community but it is it is you can see why it's a little frustrating I mean the
*  puzzles that you've talked about are sound like to me a very good motivation
*  for their the need for new physics out there and we could have found it all at
*  the Large Hadron Collider and we could have had it all and we didn't and it's
*  not that it's not that we disproved the theories right I mean super symmetry
*  could still be right or whatever it's just that they're hiding from us right
*  yeah and I mean it it is I think I think in particle physics you know certainly
*  if you look back at the history there's been a bit more of a give-and-take
*  between theory and experiment and so we were functioning for a long time before
*  the Large Hadron Collider came on we have the Tevatron at Fermilab which was
*  really you know did make important discoveries too but really going up to
*  that sort of energy frontier that we could have with the LHC was so
*  important for the field and we were really driven by theory for a long time
*  and we had this beautiful promise that there was going to be something at a
*  hundred GEV right we had we had many predictions that were just fundamentally
*  breaking down that told us there had to be something up there and we hoped it
*  was the Higgs but it could have been other things too but we knew that there
*  was something up there and now we just don't have that theoretical promise
*  right is that we just know things are broken and we haven't yet been able to
*  debug the standard model so yeah to me it kind of feels like now it's the time
*  to let experiment drive a little bit and see what see what's up there and maybe
*  as theorists we can look at data and then get inspired again for what might
*  be a good solution is there still room for the large hadron Collider itself to
*  discover new things I I am of the opinion that yes the large hadron
*  Collider is definitely still a machine that has some discovery potential I
*  think we have this kind of picture certainly people who know a little and
*  not a lot about Collider physics have an idea that you know the large hadron
*  Collider just turns on and then it's like this Boolean output like new physics
*  no new physics and there's just so many subtleties that occur between
*  colliding the particles and a physicist understanding what's going on right so
*  the way that we choose what events to look at the way that we analysis
*  analysis the way that we analyze the events the way that we interpret the
*  events like there's so many things in which you could introduce a bias that
*  would skew you away from understanding fundamentally what physics could be
*  going on I don't think that it's probable that we'll discover something
*  new at the LHC but is the question could there be hints of something new
*  absolutely and it's even possible following what you sort of alluded to
*  that the LHC has discovered something new but we haven't quite analyzed it in
*  the right way to notice yeah and this is this is kind of what I did my PhD on in
*  fact is the idea of how we can sort of robustly look for new physics effects
*  because again we're not gonna we're likely not gonna get at this point with
*  the LHC we're not just gonna see some beautiful new resonance just falling out
*  at a perfect sharp peak at like 2 TeV it's possible but it's probably pretty
*  unlikely so you kind of have to use more fundamental theoretical tools to say you
*  know where are inconsistencies possible to show up versus let me just wait for
*  the most beautiful evidence of new physics to fall into my lap good well
*  that's good this is gonna keep you employed for a little while that's so
*  let's allow ourselves then to be starry-eyed and optimistic and imagine
*  we're gonna build new particle accelerators to go beyond what the LHC
*  does maybe to soften us up could you explain sort of the fundamental
*  difference between colliding protons and other hadrons together versus
*  colliding electrons and other leptons together yeah so this is this is a great
*  question and every time as a certainly as a PhD student when I listen to it I
*  would hear someone describe one machine and be like well this is the best
*  collider and then I would hear someone describe the other one I'm like no this
*  is the best collider and the answer is they both have strings yeah so when you
*  collide something like an electron you're basically just colliding
*  electrons it's a fundamental particle so electron plus electron combines usually
*  particles and antiparticles so you have E plus E minus come in collide produce a
*  charge neutral state and all of the energy of these two electrons colliding
*  can be recombined into different massive particles different momentum particles
*  as long as the net energy momentum of the event is conserved however for
*  proton protons protons are actually a big bag of stuff and that bag includes
*  the three quarks that usually we talk about when you first take your nuclear
*  physics course or whatever in school right I don't know if many schools have
*  nuclear physics but chemistry let's say chemistry you have up and down quarks
*  basically are the primary constituents of protons at low energies but these
*  quarks are tied together with gluons and inside the quarks or sorry inside the
*  protons especially as you start cranking these things up to really high energies
*  is the bag becomes much more complicated and inside these protons we
*  have particles that are very cleverly named as partons because they are parts
*  and particles have to end in on so partons you go yes I think that's fine
*  this fault right well he did enough good things we can give a break for this one
*  but inside this proton all of these different partons which include the
*  those bosons that we talked about earlier and the quarks they kind of share
*  the total energy of the proton so at the LHC we collide protons of seven nish TeV
*  and no one particle inside that proton is going to have anywhere near 7 TeV
*  tends to happen that the gluons take most of the energy and then quarks also
*  take some of the energy so when you're really looking at a collision it's a
*  glue-on-glue-on collision or a quark-quark collision or even in the proton sometimes
*  you can have quark anti-quark pairs pop into the vacuum or pop out of the vacuum
*  and then disappear again and sometimes you can collide those so you can have a
*  quark anti-quark interaction and all of these things will share the energy of
*  the proton so in some ways that makes for a super interesting collider because
*  the opportunities of what kind of particles you can collide is much bigger
*  right you can collide not only up and down quarks but strange quarks or charm
*  quarks or gluons and some things more rare than others of course but it means
*  that you can see all sorts of interesting signatures come out the
*  downside is that you never know exactly what the energy of these things are so
*  that can make your analysis much much harder and of course you don't get that
*  full energy of the protons so even though the LHC runs at 14 TeV we don't
*  actually get to see any collision happen at 14 TeV it's usually much closer to
*  one or two whereas if we collide electrons together we can know exactly
*  how much energy that is going into them yeah often you'll hear these two machines
*  sort of described as electrons are the precision machine because you can get
*  very everything's very clean right like you you just have electron in electron
*  in and then you know the energy and the collision can be basically completely
*  reconstructed assuming what comes out versus for protons it's like smashing
*  cars together there's debris everywhere you don't know exactly what collided
*  into what and you know it's kind of like hitting something with a big hammer and
*  just a bunch of stuff can come out but knowing exactly where it came from and
*  how it came to be is a much harder question so protons are called yeah sorry
*  electron electron is precision and then proton proton is often called discovery
*  because you can have all that high energy available to you it would seem
*  that we're in a discovery kind of mood right now I mean precision sounds like
*  it's good for studying things we've already discovered but now we would like
*  to discover some new particles no yeah so that's that's a great point and maybe
*  the way that these things are named is kind of unfair to e plus e minus
*  machines so like we were talking about in the beginning with the standard
*  model part of understanding the standard model is knowing to what degree our
*  predictions are correct right because in science you never get to say
*  definitively oh this number is correct you can only measure it to a certain
*  precision and that's sort of the claim that you can make so with precision
*  machines precision machines are standard model machines in the sense that they
*  try to measure standard model things but they are also discovery machines in sort
*  of a roundabout way in the sense that if you were to discover something that is
*  not matching the standard model prediction that's a hint of a discovery
*  right so it's not you don't get to actually physically make the particle and
*  point to it and say look at this we did it but you get to say okay there's a
*  discrepancy in our data and this could be indicative of new physics so I guess
*  that's why you know we call it precision versus discovery because it can't make
*  it can't concretely define unambiguously that there is something new going on but
*  it can absolutely help us sort of know where to look when we go to the higher
*  energies so in other words there's so many predictions made by the standard
*  particle physics that you can test them all and if any one of them is discrepant
*  you determine that there must be new physics even though maybe you don't know
*  what it is but then the theorists will have a field day you know writing papers
*  about what it could be yeah absolutely and even if something's not new physics in the sense that
*  there's a new particle or a new degree of freedom that we haven't accounted for
*  the fact that there could still be new phenomena that we haven't understood is
*  still of course a super exciting discovery to make and are there plans
*  or at least sort of ideas on the drawing board for building either higher energy
*  proton colliders or electron colliders oh boy so this is this is the question
*  of the decade for collider physicists so there are a couple different ideas that
*  people want to get into so we can go as slower as fast through this part as you
*  want but to summarize quickly there are basically three kinds of machines people
*  want to think about making one is a linear e plus e minus collider so you collide electron
*  positron or electron anti electron at reasonably high energies so around a TV or so or maybe just
*  near the Higgs mass to make a bunch of Higgs bosons but you collide them in a line so you
*  don't get to circulate you just collide them in a line they either collide or they don't and
*  that's the end another option is to use circular colliders so this is what the LHC and the Tevatron
*  were is that you circulate these particles so if they miss their collision they still have another
*  chance and if you ever studied electromagnetism in school you know that putting things in a circle
*  is very different than putting things in a line so that comes with its own complications and we
*  can certainly get into that but in terms of circular colliders we either think about doing
*  a lepton collider so either electrons or my favorite muons which are certainly an immature
*  technology or doing protons so basically doing a bigger better version of what we can do at the LHC
*  if you were a betting person putting inside the muon collider we're gonna get to that's like that
*  that's the payoff here but what is the leading candidate for building the next collider other
*  than the muon collider so since these are pretty big scale projects and since we are kind of in
*  this exploratory range of particle physics I think that the attitude that a lot of these funding
*  agencies and lab directors and experimentalists who actually want to see things happen versus just be
*  like me and dream with a Mathematica notebook I think given this climate and the fact that we can
*  actually study a lot of Higgs physics with somewhat low-energy things I think the the current attitude
*  is to focus on lower energy circular electron colliders and sort of the two places in the world
*  that are presenting the most on-shell concepts of these projects would be China with the circular
*  electron positron collider and CERN with the future circular collider or FCC and then the FCC EE so
*  electron electron collider but of course one day it might not be future so we'll have to rename it
*  but that's what it is for now I love how you carry use the idea of being on-shell is just common
*  adjective that people would know I mean I talked to a lot of physicists okay I noticed that the
*  United States is not included in there have we basically dropped out I mean so for this next round
*  of experiments the thing that the US has chosen to invest in right now is neutrino physics so Fermilab
*  which is sort of our flagship particle physics laboratory near Chicago Illinois is committed
*  to doing a big experiment called DUNE and that's sort of measuring neutrino properties so the lab
*  will have to go through a lot of updates in order to make this experiment the most efficient version
*  that it can be and that leads us for a lot of possibilities for doing things like research and
*  development at Fermilab but I think that in combination with the fact that other big
*  laboratories in the world are willing to are willing to and have put a lot of time and effort
*  into sort of making a more concrete plan yeah the US is not going to be likely where we have the next
*  E plus E minus circular collider and just so for sort of cultural enrichment purposes Fermilab
*  which is the home of the Tevatron the which was for a long time before the LAC came on the highest
*  energy particle exciter out out there the Tevatron is now just shut down it's in mothballs right they
*  don't keep running it even though the next thing is turned on yeah that's right so I remember I
*  actually grew up somewhat near Batavia where Fermilab is so when I was in high school you know and I
*  was just a fan of physics I had this great t-shirt that was like the Tevatron like 10 years running
*  woohoo and then like the next year they announced like we're shutting it down for the LHC and I was
*  so I was so heartbroken like why would they turn it off like but I mean yeah these things are not
*  cheap to run right and the fact that some other experiment could be doing basically it's physics
*  program more efficiently and then also more means that yeah it's probably not great to have too much
*  repetition for these kinds of experiments the Tevatron did a lot for particle physics but now
*  that the LHC had turned on it just makes sense to sort of let it carry the torch okay and then we
*  have the possibility of a collider using muons which is kind of a compromise like muons are
*  heavier than electrons but they're simple unlike protons so is that a good way to go yeah so this
*  is to me what I think will be the future of particle physics so an e plus e minus machine
*  is very safe in the sense that we basically know how to build it and we think that we have all the
*  technology that we already would need to be able to get to work the way that we need it to work a
*  muon collider is a big risk big payoff kind of machine and of course as a theorist I get to just
*  say of course we should invest in this because because my whole life is dreaming yes but yeah
*  a muon collider is a really exciting new option because like you said it sort of combines the
*  aspects of being both a precision machine because they are fundamental clean objects you're not
*  colliding bags of stuff you're combining colliding two individual particles and because a muon is
*  heavier we can accelerate it to much higher energies than electrons so an electron circular
*  collider really can't surpass more than a couple hundred GeV even going up to more than 300 GeV
*  for electron electron is a big ask and knowing if we have the the magnet technology and even just
*  the power to be able to do that is not clear at this moment so with a muon collider is that you
*  can break that frontier of higher energies than we've ever been able to go you can do it in a
*  circular machine and you can do it in a somewhat clean environment given the fact that muons are
*  fundamental particles so when you hear this kind of stuff I don't know how you could not be excited
*  right it's it's such a beautiful promise of everything you could want put into one collider
*  well that's because you've not yet told the audience that the typical muon decays in about
*  two milliseconds yeah well that's kind of a bummer a microsecond sorry microsecond yeah so the thing
*  with these higher generation particles is that because they have all the same properties as the
*  lower generation particles if you want to be fancy we'll call them quantum numbers and they
*  have higher mass is that they have this really unpleasant tendency to want to decay which is why
*  atoms are made out of electrons and not muons because muons like you say live for ten to the
*  minus six seconds and then they decay away to neutrinos and electrons so one of the most
*  fundamental challenges that we would have to overcome if we were to make this amazing new
*  machine would be to accelerate particles that decay which we have never even tried to do on
*  this kind of scale before so you have a millionth of a second to make a muon to hope hopefully make
*  more than one muon gather them up and accelerate them around a ring that is kind of big and then
*  collide them together that's the challenge yeah and when you say it like that not so bad eh well
*  it's just be quick it's fine make no small plans as a famous one said how do you make all these
*  muons let's let's let's get in the nitty-gritty of pretending we're experimentalists we can do
*  that because we don't need to worry about all the details but that's right yeah so this is this is
*  already hard so what we would need to do to make all the muons we produce them as tertiary
*  particles so usually what would happen is if we have sounds scary already yeah I know with
*  protons or electrons right basically you just ionize things and there's all your particles
*  they're stable they're abundant but with muons what we do first is we need to accelerate protons
*  to some pretty low energies so order of a couple GEV and again for reference at the LHC we collide
*  things at TEV so a thousand times lower than what we do at the main collider but still with some
*  acceleration technology so we accelerate protons to a couple of GEV and then we just dump it into
*  some chunk of metal so sometimes lead sometimes tungsten the chunk of metal that we dump into
*  is in fact a very sophisticated field of research so my apologies to people who work on target tree
*  but you dump your protons into this material and then they scatter around and they produce
*  mesons so mesons are even simpler in some ways than then protons protons are baryons because
*  they have three quarks mesons have a quark and an anti-quark and they're lighter than baryons
*  most of the time because of you know they're made of less stuff so these mesons can be produced and
*  because they're lighter than the proton that's usually what they'll be producing in the scattering
*  process and you make a ton of mesons in this process and then the mesons are also unstable
*  and then they want to decay so a big way that mesons tend to decay is into muons almost primarily
*  they always decay into muons and a muon neutrino and so from there you have this big cloud of
*  muons that are being produced by this target but because your protons are slow particles aren't
*  boosted forward and because your mesons are even slower than your protons they're also not very
*  forward so you have this really huge cloud of muons that are not at all bunched together in the
*  pin tight way that we would need to collide them so that's just the first step and after this
*  already extremely difficult to engineer and optimize step you have something that couldn't
*  even begin to be accelerated but you have your muons at least and they're all negatively charged
*  so not only they in a puffy cloud but they're repelling each other yeah yeah so this is this
*  is something that we do need to worry about because of how tight we need that muon bunch to be
*  basically because you want to collide it into another bunch and if they're all big and puffy
*  that's never going to happen exactly right it's like colliding if you like bb pellets right it's
*  like the further away they get the more diffuse they are and the fact that you might collide
*  one bb pellet with another after they travel some non-trivial distance is getting to be even smaller
*  probability than what's reasonable to expect so yeah when you produce the muons like this of
*  course you get both mu plus and mu minus and you scoop them off into there are two different
*  ways to process them but yeah once you try to crunch 10 to the 13 muons into a a cubic
*  millimeter of space things start getting a bit tricky so is this something that we have the
*  technology to do or we have ideas to do it is this an ongoing research program yeah so this
*  this is basically the biggest open question that we need to resolve as a muon collider
*  collaboration and so this is called 60 cooling which sounds very cool it sounds like you know
*  you're in higher dimensional space and really what it means is the sixth dimension is three
*  dimensions for momentum and three dimensions for physical space because you need all these muons
*  to be traveling not only at the same momentum but also localized to a very small bunch and so
*  accelerator physicists have been working on this really for 30 years and they've made a huge amount
*  of progress certainly in the last 10 years but basically what they do is they design these
*  different ways that you have to have this process of basically taking momentum from the muons because
*  you can't just squeeze them together there's like it's like squeezing a one of those plastic dog
*  toys right you squeeze it in one direction it explodes in another direction so you need to lose
*  momentum from the system and then you can use magnets to crunch it back together so it's this
*  constant process of take momentum give momentum take momentum give momentum and they need to do
*  that basically a hundred and some times before you won't even decays and then you need to accelerate
*  it so this is just the process of getting it ready to accelerate and you have a millionth of a second
*  and you have a millionth of a second and then okay we're probably pretty good at the actual
*  accelerating i mean that's that's something that we have been doing for a while you would think
*  but even that's hard so accelerating particles that decay again are an entirely new challenge
*  because one everything in your detector is being constantly sprayed by the decay products so there's
*  all these other robust things that you need to to account for when you're designing this
*  and the fact that we don't have the same we don't have the time effectively to to do the same kind
*  of acceleration that we do at the LHC at the LHC we just kind of ramp things up and it takes 15
*  minutes to get those protons up to the speed we don't have 15 minutes don't have that time no we
*  have a microsecond so the kind of magnetic field that you need to set up to make this feasible is
*  also extremely different and the i remember this might literally have been before you were born but
*  i remember chris quigg talking about a muon collider many years ago chris quigg former
*  mindscape guest and as well as a physicist and there was something called the ring of death
*  because the muons once they're in the circle keep decaying and giving off neutrinos and other
*  particles which then go off and kill all the cows in the field i love how dramatic we are
*  sometimes accelerator is this something that i should be worried about or is that more or less
*  something we have under control all right well thanks chris for saying that jeez um yeah i mean
*  it really cracks me up because neutrinos when you talk about them in physics most of the time
*  it's just kind of like ah who cares who cares neutrinos like you don't they're not going to
*  get in your detector don't worry about them they go right through you um but now now that you can
*  attach the word death ray or death circle to them people are like oh my god neutrinos um so yeah the
*  the physics behind it is that yes neutrinos that are more energetic will want to interact more
*  and so we haven't had to worry about this in the past because we've never been producing tev
*  neutrinos in a large quantity um the worry that we would have is not that neutrino rays zap a cow
*  and then suddenly it's raining steak that's not quite the picture but what can happen is that all
*  of these neutrinos that are coming off from your muon uh being circulated is they'll they'll just
*  travel in a straight line they'll escape the experiment and they'll travel through dirt right
*  like they can just go through dirt and if they're high enough energy they might interact with some
*  atom in the dirt and they could excite the atom and then that could decay so it's the radioactivity
*  of neutrinos activating atoms in the ground um so if this stuff is either sufficiently underground
*  or we have ways of absorbing the neutrinos before they you know permeate too far or something again
*  this is accelerators accelerator physicists are really really great people um that think of all
*  kinds of wacky stuff that i would never have thought was reasonable but you can and this is
*  the this is the scientific term you can wiggle the beam um and then when you do that it's a diffuse
*  enough beam that you're not activating any one patch of ground too much and so the overall
*  radiation dosage i hate to be the person to tell you this if you don't know it but you're always
*  being irradiated there are always things irradiating you you just need a sufficiently small dose to not
*  notice so if you can do that then it is in fact well below any sort of legal limit and dangerous
*  limit that you might uh be approaching i mean there might be a public relations problem here
*  if you say don't worry we can wiggle the neutrinos so the deadly dose of radiation is spread out over
*  a wider area just wiggle it yeah okay i'm gonna the wiggles i'm gonna trust that osha is on top
*  of this um but all right so we i wanted to get the challenges on board and i think we've done a good
*  job with that unless there's any other secret challenges that that we need to yeah i mean there's
*  failure is possible at every step and i recently i actually just got back from firmy lab yesterday
*  um to to attend this really interesting workshop where people sort of get together and we're
*  talking about what we need to make this happen and someone showed this really beautiful um table
*  of basically all the ways in which we could fail and what impact that would have on the net
*  collisions um and so yeah the steps of failure are first we don't produce enough muons so this
*  target tree thing doesn't work we melt the target by just dumping constant protons on it
*  that could fail cooling it could fail we might not be able to in fact cool it quick enough to
*  actually have a sufficiently high a dense enough muon beam to get any sort of reasonable number
*  of collisions out so the cooling is by far the thing that could take us out the most and that's
*  the thing that we need to prove uh works before we actually make any sort of big steps to making the
*  full-scale collider so when people say muon collider r and d basically we're talking about
*  showing that this cooling and acceleration can happen right the cooling or the acceleration
*  around the actual ring is hard because again that requires an entirely new mechanism
*  for accelerating things quickly and then even just reconstructing the collisions is hard
*  because again you have all these decay products shooting off of it and how do you make sure that
*  your detector isn't constantly overwhelmed by the the electrons and neutrinos coming out of these
*  decaying muons you know how do you actually see the physics of the collisions and not just the
*  physics of muons decaying um so that's also hard and then of course yeah neutrino death beam um
*  let's stay away from that phrasing the neutrino radiation can be mitigated with wiggles well and
*  maybe again just for cultural enrichment purposes for the audience there's a kind of physicist
*  whose job it will be to figure out okay how do we build a detector that can distinguish the actual
*  muon collisions giving us new physics from sort of the background radiation and things like that
*  and then there's another kind of physicist who's in there with a soldering iron and building the
*  machine and there's another kind of physicist i think like you who is saying okay here's a
*  model that makes a prediction that we could actually test in a machine like this yeah and
*  there's also even a whole bunch of physicists that figure out how the magnets will bend the muons
*  right so like really every sort of difficult problem we have there's an entire specialty
*  dedicated towards solving the problem um that being said we definitely are a bit human power
*  limited at this point um so if you're out there and you say man the thing i would love in life
*  the most is to accelerate muons oh my god please call us well it will take a while to do it so we
*  can get the youngsters excited about this right yeah if you if you are 10 and you want to be a
*  part of the most exciting human experiment ever made please stay in school we need you and okay
*  but let's let's you know switch to why this is worth all of the hassle what's so great about a
*  muon collider yeah so i mean i think there's a lot of ways to answer this question and i think all of
*  them are are kind of equally valid um so i think the most obvious answer that you can have is we
*  are scientists and we want to know if you can do something right so this is a kind of collider that
*  we have theorized and there's no fundamental showstopper that would suggest that this is a
*  deeply impossible task to do so the fact that you know this is just a scientific challenge
*  to see if you can collide muons and this could open up the entire like an entire new generation
*  of colliders which are really effectively microscopes right for the fundamental interactions
*  the fact that this is a possibility to me is worth doing right like if you can really open up an
*  entirely new way to do a physics experiment that's awesome that's just that in itself is very cool
*  in terms of understanding sort of the fundamental problems that we talked about in the beginning
*  again what's exciting about muon colliders is this was kind of if if the technology can work
*  which i understand is a preposterously big asterisk to put on all of this but if the
*  technology can work this is by far the fastest way to take us the fastest and the most energy
*  efficient and compact way to take us to that energy frontier so given that we are kind of
*  stumbling in the dark right now in terms of understanding where the Higgs comes from what
*  dark matter is do neutrinos get mass from the same mechanism or a different one is there anything new
*  about the standard model are there fourth generation particles um that one's a little bit wacky but
*  the fact that there are so many open questions and no one beautiful theory like we had for
*  supersymmetry sort of explains them all to me means that we should just be explorers
*  and we should be kind of agnostic and just do experiments in which we can sort of get the most
*  return on our money in terms of just seeing new things so going to that energy frontier having a
*  clean environment getting high luminosity that to me is how we're going to get unstuck in particle
*  physics so muon colliders being the fastest way the cleanest way and a really novel way
*  to see things we've never seen before makes it something that i feel like we have to invest
*  and you use two words in there that sort of sound prosaic but are super important which is
*  compact and energy efficient maybe that's the words but uh you know compact who cares how much
*  space it takes don't you have space and energy efficient like can you just plug it in why is
*  that a big constraint i know i think so much of physics you know i there's like the meme that
*  they have the midwit meme right where it's like the bell curve and then you have like someone
*  saying something stupid on one side and then someone saying something a little bit educated
*  in the middle and someone saying something the same stupid thing but with a lot of wisdom
*  and that to me is physics in a nutshell right it's like when you first start physics you're
*  like oh my god like the detectors underground like what if the ground shakes and then you're
*  like no come on people have gyroscopes and there's so much engineering and the machine is so heavy
*  and then you're like oh no but the ground shaking does in fact cause problems and this to me is is
*  the same thing with like yeah space use and energy efficiency at at firmy lab they're literally trying
*  to plan what energy they can reach at a muon collider given the amount of space we have at
*  firmy lab because if you don't own the space you can't put a collider there it turns out
*  if you are okay with us tunneling into your basement and you live in batavia again please call
*  but yeah like you just if you you run into mountains you run into underground rivers you
*  run into state borders and so you just can't build an arbitrarily big machine expect that yeah like
*  you as a scientist are immune to property law so that's that's something silly and also just the
*  cost of building a tunnel tunnels are so expensive oh my goodness so the smaller you can get it the
*  cheaper it can be and again it's not we don't live in a fantasy world where every scientific
*  thing worth doing is funded so if you could have something with a smaller tunnel that gives you a
*  whole bunch of physics results that's probably the way to go you know and with energy i mean i
*  don't know how political we get on your podcast but there's i mean the whole russia ukraine war
*  that is zapping europe of all of its energy and the lhc is even having reduced run capacity
*  because there's just less energy to be had in europe and quite frankly if you need to
*  choose between warming people's houses and colliding protons i i understand i understand
*  that that tough sacrifice we have to make so yeah we we live in a world where there's global
*  warming and there's war and there's you know territorial issues and the fact that we are
*  scientists doesn't put us above any of these issues and we still have to be responsible
*  stewards of public money in space yeah that makes a perfectly good argument i noticed you didn't say
*  that you were actually in favor of shutting down or turning the lhc giving it less power and
*  to help the ukrainians but you understood why people would be which is that's good that's how
*  physicists have to think right because no one else is going to do it for us look germans use a blanket
*  yeah exactly so you mentioned fermilab there does this mean that the u.s. like i don't really
*  honestly care in some sense where it's built australia india these are all fine places
*  but is the u.s. one of the places that is contemplating building a u.n. collider
*  yeah so i think this is also something very exciting to me on a personal note again since
*  i grew up in illinois and definitely my my parents were not physicists but science supporters
*  generically is having fermilab close to your house just gives you an appreciation that things are
*  dynamic and it really you know it makes you feel much more energetic about the idea that oh i could
*  do research or that you know research is happening and it definitely gives you a sense of you know
*  excitement about it all so you know i also have this kind of agnostic approach that oh i don't
*  really care where it happens i just want it to happen but when you're close to it it really
*  you feel it you know you really feel it like oh wow like there's there's an energy in the air
*  that's not neutrinos and you get excited and it's it's just you know cool to be a part of it
*  so this is something that's really exciting as someone who's currently doing science in the u.s.
*  is the fact that the u.s. might want to re-enter the world stage of particle colliders is amazing
*  and i think i think this is very indicative and this might be the the spiciest thing i say so
*  i think the styles of doing physics in the u.s. and other places europe is kind of my biggest
*  benchmark because of the people i interact with the most but definitely the style of physics in
*  europe versus the u.s. are very different and i think in the u.s. for better for worse we tend to
*  be sort of the people that always want to make sort of wacky theories or just like make experiments
*  measure things that they were not made to measure and just kind of be yeah quite frankly a bit of
*  the dreamer is that yeah maybe we hand wave a bit and we don't worry so closely about the 15th loop
*  correction and you know we're a little bit sloppy but the fact that that you know then opens up the
*  possibility of like oh let's get weird with it in science i think is something that i really like
*  about the the u.s. atmosphere and physics so if a place like china or cern wants to go ahead and do
*  a machine that's like the fcc ee or the ce pc then that's great and the precision physics and really
*  measuring the standard model i think that that's very in touch with the science goals of those
*  communities but then doing the weird project that's like well can this even work do we know what we're
*  doing this is such a far-off shot and then maybe it'll happen to me is very in line with sort of
*  the american ideology towards doing physics especially looking for new physics so that to
*  me is kind of the ideal outcome of everything is that countries that are much better about keeping
*  track of factors of two and pi go for the precision machine and then the americans pool the resources
*  to put a to put a muon clutter on their soil but of course all of these projects are international
*  um and international collaboration is not only encouraged but required to pull any of this off
*  so where it ends up is not zero-th order but you know it definitely it it has an impact yeah i think
*  it's a very good point and it's not just that one style is better than the other but a diversity
*  of styles is very helpful and especially in a situation where we don't know exactly what we
*  will see at this next generation yeah i think there's a lot of push and pull that needs to
*  happen in the community right now is that you know we need we need precision but we also need
*  discoveries we need experimental evidence but we also need motivating theories and having sort of
*  the most diverse pool of ways that we can sort of approach these problems that we don't really have
*  a clear answer to or a clear way of proceeding on um i think that that's going to be the most robust
*  way to to find success and i remember seeing a an interview with a scientist from cern who you know
*  made the perfectly reasonable point that we're not building particle colliders that often we built
*  the lhc it's going to take a long time to build the next one and there's a very real danger that
*  we forget how to do it right that you know there's a lot of implicit knowledge that just sort of
*  ages out if we don't do this regularly oh absolutely um there is no textbook that you can buy
*  there's no ikea manual to how to build a particle collider um and so much of what's taught is just
*  passed down between groups um and and training individuals and things like that so i think
*  sometimes it's a little bit i go back and forth about how seriously i should weight this because
*  yeah part of it if you just kind of sell it like that then it feels like okay well you just want to
*  keep the field of particle physics alive so that you have a job um but it is just it is much more
*  profound i think is that if you want to keep particle physics alive so that there's the
*  possibility to have a collider if we make a lot of progress in one one area or another um then
*  you need to preserve the the knowledge and good let's bring it wind up sort of by bringing it
*  back to the physics goals here are there things that a muon collider would be specifically good
*  at discovering if they happen to be out there yeah so i think i think again this is something um
*  i've definitely become the person that i feel like uh wants to have a foot at least in both camps in
*  terms of understanding sort of where these machines lie in terms of likelihood and progress and physics
*  goals and things like that so a muon collider versus any plus c minus collider um can have
*  similar physics programs but there's definitely strengths for one versus the other so if you're
*  just comparing e plus c minus and not like a future lhc at a much higher energy um the energy
*  frontier is something completely new yeah so if you just want to see new physics directly produced
*  above you know a couple hundred gv you need a muon collider for that um and if you want to see it
*  produced with fundamental particles you can't even compare it to a proton proton machine
*  and just for comparison right if you were to build a 10 tev muon collider
*  which sounds less than the lhc because that's 14 but because protons are composite a 10 tev muon
*  collider would be comparable to the physics for the average collision that you can get out of
*  something like a 70 or 80 tev if not more a proton proton machine so that hundred tev number that
*  you might hear thrown around by china and cern um would be comparable to a 14 tev muon collider
*  so the fact that these are composite particles makes super makes a big difference in terms of
*  what energies are accessible um so the energy frontier you just need it and there's a million
*  theories that you can test um you can do things that have to do with suzy you can do things
*  that are just extensions of of the electroweak sector you can do things um that are just
*  completely new particles or dark matter related or things like that and a lot of the times you
*  just need higher energies to really see the effects of these particles show up um so the
*  energy frontier i think is really the most compelling reason to say that a muon collider
*  is something that we shouldn't invest in in terms of other physics programs um as we said in the
*  beginning the higgs boson is definitely the most mysterious particle and depending on exactly your
*  ideology you may or may not say that a that a higgs boson is new physics um but i'm not nema
*  so i'm not going to say that um but you can study a lot of higgs bosons um in a way that you can't
*  do at the lhc and you can do it in a much cleaner environment in some ways too so um attend to ev
*  muon clutter given the physics program that we hope to run you can produce 10 million higgs bosons
*  um and with 10 million higgs bosons you can study a lot yeah so if you really want to flush out the
*  story about how the higgs couples to itself how it couples to other particles um how the symmetry
*  is restored in the electroweak sector at higher energies a muon collider is also a very good tool
*  for that so while the e plus e minus machine is usually what's billed as the higgs factory a muon
*  collider could also have a lot of the complementary um and overlapping physics program of that kind of
*  machine too so studying the higgs and going to higher energies to give you the sound bite are
*  really what we want to do with a muon collider um but those are basically the only two things that
*  i i even know what to suggest in terms of trying to resolve things like the hierarchy problem or
*  dark matter or stuff like that your day job is writing papers uh thinking about models that's
*  what they tell me beyond the standard level we're recording this during the day so i guess this is
*  part of your job but uh so you know it's the end of the podcast we can let our hair down do you
*  have a specific favorite model that you have personally worked on or thought up that that
*  might be amenable to testing in some way just to give the like i want the audience to know what
*  it's like to be a working theoretical particle physicist okay well step one um have three cups
*  of coffee and two existential crises a day um but okay so my favorite model
*  i'll give you two answers to this there's one model that i just hope is right and i just hope
*  is out there just because it'd be nice so i really hope that there's a new um z prime or
*  vector boson out there um so i want some new spin one particle that looks like a massive photon
*  um we often will call that the dark photon or a z prime i just want that thing to be out there
*  um i think having the existence of that particle would just open so many interesting questions
*  and it could be the portal to dark matter it could be the portal to something else interesting it
*  could be something that mixes with the electroweak sector and you know there's all sorts of new
*  complicated stuff when we have to reinterpret everything so i really hope it's out there so
*  sorry the the we know of the good old z boson there's only one of them it's a neutral spin one
*  particle and you're saying a different neutral spin one particle with a different mass but doing
*  kind of similar things yeah um basically a heavy photon is is is what we're looking for um and the
*  reason that that's exciting is because whenever you have a spin one vector particle it couples to
*  something else it's charged under something else so it could be a portal into some whole new world
*  of physics um and so this is the second answer that i hope that we find is i hope that we find
*  just an entire new sector of physics you know it could be supersymmetry it could be all the
*  super partners it could be that dark matter is an entire sector and not just a single particle
*  that accounts for everything um i hope there's some new group of particles and i hope they're
*  strongly interacting because i just think that that would be super fun to work on for the next
*  50 years so in terms of what i think is out there well i have no idea truly um i think definitely
*  things will have to show up between the energies that we can see and the planck scale which is
*  that magic number that should set the higgs mass um something has to be out there i just i just
*  fundamentally can't reconcile a world where there's just 16 orders of magnitude that are empty you
*  know and i don't i don't think that this is an accident i don't think the universe is this way
*  because you know some supreme power fine-tuned some numbers and look where we are i think there
*  has to be some deeper explanation so whether or not this stuff shows up at sort of the tev to 10
*  tev range there are some predictions for that supersymmetry could be hiding in this range um
*  um there could be evidence that the higgs boson is also a composite particle that could pop up
*  at this energy um and really sort of the first the first real hint that we could see of new physics
*  that would affect the electroweak sector is really four pi times the vev so that sits right around a
*  couple tev around three tev um is that a guarantee absolutely not but it's a way to start um so
*  yeah i don't know i just want to see i want to see something that messes with the higgs that's what
*  i want to see and whatever it is who knows but i think something's got to be out there
*  so your your calendar for the working particle physicists that includes three cups of coffee two
*  existential crises it also has to include a sense of absolute grandiosity that we can
*  figure all of this out that it's something that is amenable to our understanding yeah i mean i think
*  yeah i mean i think i i got into particle physics at a very weird time um so i am finishing my first
*  postdoc which means that i've been in the field for about 10 years um and in that time i have
*  seen the higgs boson discovered and supersymmetry not discovered i have seen the tevatron shut off
*  and the lhc turn on and the plans for the high lumii lhc to go on and now you know i think people
*  have tried to convince me throughout this entire career that i've had that particle physics is dead
*  we don't know what we're doing um give up and do cosmology or biology as you suggested earlier
*  and i just think that can't be further from the truth because what amazing privilege i have as a
*  young person in this field is that i get to be part of the conversation of how we unstick ourselves
*  right is is how we decide what the next generation of experiments gets to be
*  and we get to shape this idea of well how do we look for new physics and you know to have my whole
*  career well most of my career in front of me as we go through this era of absolute you know change
*  and really first order changes and how we're going to approach particle physics
*  i think it's an exciting time to be a particle physicist i don't think that's a very popular
*  opinion um but it is what i have to tell myself every day to get out of bed and start my existential
*  crises and brew that first cup of coffee with very good reasons it sounds like carrie says
*  erotty thanks so much for being in the mindscape podcast thanks
*  you
