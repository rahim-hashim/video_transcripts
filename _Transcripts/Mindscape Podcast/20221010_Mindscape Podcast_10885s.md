Welcome to the October 2022 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). We take questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable number — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape AMA, Sean Carroll | October 2022
**Mindscape Podcast:** [October 10, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq7niQ8MH9Y)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the October 2022 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Delayed a little bit this month, usually we try to go for the
*  first Monday of the month with AMAs, but we wanted to hit last week with TMA Agonabuzz
*  podcast, the beginning of World Space Week, since we're talking about space and Timmy
*  is one of the former, I guess, directors of World Space Week or something like that. So
*  here we are with the AMA. Many things going on, just had a book come out, you may have heard,
*  the biggest ideas in the universe, Space, Time and Motion, volume one of the three volume trilogy,
*  the book launch has gone well. I'm teaching courses at Johns Hopkins and so forth, so there's a lot
*  going on. I don't want to waste too much time with a long introduction here. Just wanted to say a
*  huge thanks to everyone who has been donating to the Mindscape Big Picture Scholarship Fund.
*  This is a scholarship fund at bold.org that people can apply for if they're in high school
*  or university and will be still attending university in the future and going to be
*  studying to become someone who studies the big ideas, whether it's physics or philosophy or math
*  or biology, neuroscience, whatever, but the fundamental nature of reality in a deep way,
*  if that's the kind of thing that you want to study in college, you could apply for the Mindscape
*  Big Picture Scholarship. If not, you can always donate money to the Mindscape Big Picture
*  Scholarship. Go to bold.org slash scholarships slash Mindscape and the very good news is we're
*  giving away scholarships that will be $10,000 each. We have enough to fund two scholarships
*  and we're actually very close to having enough to fund three scholarships, which is amazing.
*  Huge thanks to everyone who's contributed. You're really, I think, trying to make someone else's
*  life better in a really interesting and different way. For those of you who are new around here,
*  these Ask Me Anything episodes are funded by Patreons or patrons, I suppose, of the Mindscape
*  podcast, people who contribute on Patreon. If you go to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll,
*  you can both get ad-free versions of the podcast and also ask the questions that I will go about
*  answering right now. So let's go.
*  I should start by saying that, of course, we have too many questions as usual. I try to pick ones I
*  think I can give interesting answers to. There are things called priority questions. Once in your
*  life, you're allowed to ask a question that I promise I will do my best to answer. But also,
*  apparently, this month, again, this happens sometimes, but Patreon cuts off some people's
*  typing or something like that. It seemed that there were a few questions that began but didn't end,
*  so I'm not answering them. But just make sure to check once your question is submitted whether or
*  not it's actually showing up before I go about trying to answer them. So to begin then, Ken Wolf
*  says, I've been reading The Weirdest People in the World by Joseph Henrich, former Mindscape guest.
*  One point he makes early on is how profoundly the spread of general literacy has changed the way
*  people think. Just one example is how it makes us lean heavily toward reductionist rather than
*  holistic thinking. Do you think that the spread of literacy has been something close to an
*  unalloyed good, or do you think that something important might be disappearing from the human
*  condition as we all move in that direction? I would say this is a very good question. Of course,
*  I'm not an expert in this, so this is just me giving my incredibly untutored personal take.
*  But I think that it's not an unalloyed good necessarily because most goods are not unalloyed,
*  but I think that literacy is an overwhelming good. Maybe there are some disadvantages. Maybe it has
*  made us lean toward being reductionist, but man, it's worth it. Literacy is one of the most
*  important things in the world. So how do you balance these things? How in the world do you
*  even answer the question, is it worth it overall if you have some disadvantages and some advantages?
*  But I think that for literacy, the ability to read, as someone who is literally reading this
*  question right now, and someone who writes books, someone who writes articles, all of these things,
*  of course, I'm going to say that literacy is overwhelmingly advantageous. If you don't want
*  to be literate, you don't have to learn, I guess, or you can forget. You can just stop reading.
*  That's okay, but I don't think that many people are going to be doing that.
*  Jimmy says, imagine you build a computer that tells you whether a number is prime. Outputting
*  a one if it's prime and a zero if it's not. Imagine then that you put in the number 13 and
*  receive an output of one. You can then ask the question, why were those particles that represent
*  an output of one in that particular place at that particular time? You could answer it by telling
*  a story from the Big Bang, blah, blah, blah, or you could say that it was a mechanism designed
*  to determine primes, the number 13 was input, so they represented an output of one. Both explanations
*  seem valid, but are they equal? The sort of reductionist going back to the Big Bang one
*  versus the higher level trying to get a prime number one. My intuition says that the latter
*  explanation is not just more useful, but in some way actually more accurate. What do you think?
*  I don't think that I quite agree with your intuition, but I get your intuition. I think
*  that there are two ways of talking about it. I wrote a whole book, the big picture, that talks
*  about poetic naturalism and the multiple levels at which we can think about the world, all of which
*  can be thought of as valid. I don't think it makes much sense. I don't see the argument for saying
*  that the higher level explanation, that you say that the reason why these things happen in a certain
*  way is because the number 13 is prime, is more valid. It might be more explanatory. You might
*  imagine that there is some sense in which we can rank the explanatoriness of different explanations
*  by some version of how much you get out versus how much you put in. For the explanation in terms of
*  the Big Bang and the physics of elementary particles and so forth, you really actually
*  have to put in a tremendous amount of information before you get out the prediction that the computer
*  will say one because 13 is prime. Whereas if you just think about abstract symbol manipulations
*  and the number 13, you don't need much input to say yes, this number is going to be prime.
*  But that doesn't make it more valid. Validity is just is it true or is it false, right? Or does it
*  work or does it not? That is not a measure of efficiency. I think maybe what you're looking for
*  is efficiency or something like that. And yeah, I absolutely think that levels of explanation might
*  have varying degrees of efficiency. And absolutely, it makes more sense if you're a computer programmer
*  to think of this level of prime numbers, not at the level of elementary particles and the Big Bang.
*  Elliot Specht says, the web telescope has recently been used to detect CO2 in the atmosphere of an
*  exoplanet. To use this result to calculate the probability of finding life there, we need the
*  prior probability. We can use other data to estimate the prior, but Bayes' theorem applies all the way
*  down. So any inference from observation ultimately depends on a credence developed with no data
*  whatsoever. So how can I defend as rational conclusions which depend on data free credences?
*  Well, I think there's two things. One is a small footnote. It's not that the credence is developed
*  with no data whatsoever. The credences that we develop as priors have something to do with who
*  we are in some very broad sense. Our biology, our psychology, our neuroscience, our education,
*  our upbringing, our intuitions, the evolutionary history that brought us here. We are embodied
*  creatures living in the world and that all counts as data in some sense, right? We have experience
*  with the world. We have a way of thinking about things and these are the ways of thinking about
*  things that seem natural intuitive to us feed into our priors. They're not completely arbitrary priors.
*  But that's a footnote. I think there's nevertheless a point here which is that
*  the primary worry about Bayesian reasoning is that people start with different priors. That's true.
*  And you're not going to get around that because people do start with different priors. There's
*  just no choice, right? I mean that's just how reasoning works. If you want to say what is the
*  chance that some theory I don't know is whether it's true or not, what is the chance that it's true?
*  Different people are going to have different ideas. That's not a bug. That's just a feature.
*  The rationality comes in when you reason from the beginning point of having that prior.
*  Having priors that are weird to the rest of us might be unreasonable but are not irrational,
*  if you know what I mean. The rationality has to do with the process that you use to make logical
*  deductions from those starting points. And Bayesian reasoning is just a tool that you use when you're
*  dealing in situations of uncertainty. There's no, again, there's really no choice about it.
*  So you can talk to other people about their priors and you can sort of hand wave yourself into
*  arguing in favor of a prior, right? You can say, well, you know, chemistry, I've learned certain
*  things, laws of physics, it's a big universe, whatever it is. And people may or may not agree
*  with you. But if you collect enough data, the word enough is going to be doing a lot of work here,
*  but if you collect enough data, good Bayesians will always converge on the same answers. So
*  that's ultimately going to be the true way to be rational about these things.
*  Chris Murray says, in one of the biggest ideas in the universe videos, you mentioned that one of
*  the things the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics does is allow P equals MV,
*  momentum equals mass times velocity, to be not the definition of momentum but a physical law
*  we might violate. Is there value in considering physical quantities other than momentum in the
*  same light? Well, maybe. I'm answering this question not because I have any brilliant insight
*  on it, but it's a cool question. So I think it's an insightful question. Do we know that certain
*  things that we define aren't actually better thought of as dependent variables that we should
*  think of as solving some equations rather than just being defined to have the values that they do?
*  I don't think that physicists usually think that way. Maybe they should, maybe that would be a
*  useful way to think. But physicists very often will take something they think is a constant and
*  say, well, what if it's a variable? That happens all the time. What if Newton's constant of gravity
*  is a variable? That's what Bronson-Dickey did a while back to invent Brons-Dickey theory of gravity
*  and so forth. There's more examples like that. In the particular case of momentum equals mass times
*  velocity, it is an implication of Hamiltonian mechanics. But sorry, the fact that that equation
*  is an equation of motion rather than a definition is an implication of Hamiltonian mechanics. But I
*  don't think that's the motivation that led Hamilton to invent Hamiltonian mechanics. I'm not
*  exactly sure what his motivation was, but I think that's a result that popped out. So the other
*  reason I want to answer this question is just to sort of highlight the difference between something
*  turning out to be true that we hit upon by some line of reasoning and using that kind of thing
*  as a starting point, a motivation. So it worked for momentum, turning it from a definition into
*  a free variable that we could then solve as an equation of motion, but maybe or maybe not,
*  it will work any other way. So I'm happy to let people try, but I don't think that we should be,
*  we should get the impression necessarily that that is a surefire way to get better laws of physics.
*  Nelita S says, the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is mind-boggling,
*  and it kind of makes one wonder about a mysterious phenomenon that some lucky ones experience often,
*  like seeing in one's head an event or person as an image only to be followed by the manifestation
*  of that thought in real life. How would you as a physicist and philosopher interpret those
*  mysterious events? Well, I personally would interpret them as having nothing to do with
*  quantum mechanics. I think that the brain and how the brain works is way more complicated and way
*  harder to understand than quantum mechanics is. There's enough going on in the brain that we know
*  that number one, we make mistakes all the time. We hallucinate things, we misperceive things.
*  When linguists study how we comprehend language, whether it's listened to or read on a piece of
*  paper, our brain is constantly filling things in. We're not hearing every sound or reading every
*  letter. Likewise, optical illusions are a great example of where we see things and our brain
*  forces them into a certain kind of pattern, even though the pattern might not be the right one.
*  That's why it turns out to be an illusion. Furthermore, retrospectively, we often give
*  greater weight to things that we think are surprising and cool and interesting and provocative,
*  rather than objectively collecting data in some numbers of times that something happens versus
*  how many times you'd expect it to happen like a good Bayesian. So given that, I think there's
*  plenty of reasons based on the laws of physics to think that quantum mechanics has nothing to do
*  with seeing things either that haven't happened yet or that are happening far away, I think that
*  I would blame the tricks of the brain for that rather than the rules of quantum mechanics.
*  Kavadin says, could you help me understand irrational numbers? Specifically, why do
*  mathematicians give importance to certain irrational numbers like i and pi, but not others
*  like x divided by zero? Or does the fact that the number is irrational tell us more than the
*  number itself? Why are these numbers so important in physics? So I think that we've missed the
*  definition of irrational number here. So irrational numbers to mathematicians or to physicists don't
*  just mean weird numbers or special numbers. That means specifically real numbers, so non-imaginary
*  ones like i and the square root of minus one, and actual numbers not like x over zero, which is not
*  even a number, but real numbers like pi or like the square root of two, but numbers that cannot
*  be expressed as a fraction of two integers, right? Pi is very, very close to 22 sevenths,
*  but 22 sevenths is the ratio of two integers, and pi is not the ratio of any two integers. That's
*  what makes it an irrational number. Irrational numbers are very, very important. If you have
*  some span of real numbers, like all the real numbers between one and two, almost all of them
*  are irrational. There are far, far more irrational numbers than rational ones. So why are they
*  important in physics and math? Just because they're a crucial part of making up the continuum of the
*  real line, not to mention the real plane or the real other things. Anytime you have a continuum,
*  irrational numbers are a big part of the game. Nicholas Sharovsky says, I've heard you say
*  several times that you're glad to be doing physics because it's much easier than other sciences.
*  However, I sometimes feel that natural scientists look down a bit on other social sciences like
*  psychology, sociology, linguistics, etc., because they have different methodological foundations.
*  How would you respond to someone who says sociology is not a real or genuine science?
*  Well, I think that they're very different activities, sociology and physics, but I
*  definitely think they're both science. I mean, to me, science is the attempt to explain the world
*  by developing models and testing them against data. That's what science is. Those models can
*  be about society or people or language, just as much as about chemistry or physics or whatever.
*  So someone who says sociology is not a real science is just not paying attention or just trying to
*  start a fight or whatever, I'm not going to spend a lot of time arguing with them. Now,
*  the reason why I say physics is much easier than other sciences is someone tug-and-cheek, of course,
*  actually becoming a physicist is not necessarily easier than becoming any other kind of scientist.
*  I would say that becoming a really, really good physicist is about equal difficulty to becoming
*  a really, really good linguist or psychologist or whatever, but that's because human beings have
*  certain capacities and in any one of those fields, you sort of push your capacities to the utmost and
*  see how far you can get. What's easier in physics really is not just becoming a professional
*  physicist but making progress. That's the real thing that characterizes physics. It's way easier
*  to make progress because physics very often deals with very simple systems, a pendulum rocking back
*  and forth, an electron field vibrating, whatever it is, very, very simple compared to society or
*  the human brain or the structure of language and so forth. So that's why physics seems hard because
*  we can learn a lot about it because we're able to make progress by studying simple systems,
*  which is not possible elsewhere. And for someone just to say that something that does aspire to
*  thinking about and hypothesizing and saying true things about very, very complicated systems
*  like psychology or sociology, etc., is just not paying attention, I think. Now having said that,
*  of course, it's always possible to say that a certain field of endeavor is on average not doing
*  nearly as well as it could at its own aspirations, right? You could say that there are just
*  methodological flaws in psychology or sociology, just like you can say there are methodological
*  flaws in physics. But if you want to say that, you got to say exactly what those flaws are and you
*  got to back it up by actually having some evidence in favor of that claim. I'm going to group together
*  two questions here because they're the same question and they just came out of somewhere.
*  Sugar Pine Press says, could you please spend a little time unpacking the fine structure constant?
*  Is it significant that it has no units? Does a theoretical multiverse and anthropic argument
*  truly reduce it to, you know, no big deal? Does it play any role in your thinking about what space
*  time emerges from? And then Nick G says, is there something unique or special that differentiates
*  the fine structure constant from the coupling constants of other forces? Seems like there's
*  one unique constant for each force, yet the fine structure constant gets all the hype. So the fine
*  structure constant is being implied here, part of a list of constants of nature that we have in,
*  let's say, the standard model of particle physics. All the constants of nature, I guess not all of
*  them, but it's weird how different they all are in some sense. You know, the fine structure constant
*  is interesting because it is dimensionless, so it's a number, which means that it doesn't depend on
*  what units you use to measure it. Everyone should agree that the fine structure constant, once you
*  tell me its definition, has the value approximately 1 over 137, whereas Newton's constant of gravity,
*  depending on what units you use, will have different forms, different numerical values.
*  It is not the only constant in the standard model of particle physics that is dimensionless,
*  but the others, you know, have different sort of statuses. So like for the weak interactions,
*  you know that the weak interactions are unified with the electromagnetic interactions, and there's
*  two more numbers that come in there. One is the expectation value of the Higgs field, and that is
*  a dimensionful quantity, and that's a puzzle. We don't understand why it has the value it does.
*  The other is what's called the weak mixing angle, or the Weinberg angle, and that is dimensionless,
*  but it's an angle, which means that it can only possibly take on values between, let's say, zero
*  and pi, because it wraps around and it's sort of equal to itself if it goes past pi. So it's a
*  little bit different than just the number, like the fine structure constant. An angle has a
*  constraint that the fine structure constant doesn't, but I do think that to actually get at the question,
*  there is a lot of historical analysis going on here. We figured out electromagnetism,
*  and in particular, we figured out quantum electromagnetism before we figured out any of
*  the quantum theories of the other fundamental forces. So it popped out that we had this
*  dimensionless number in QED, quantum electrodynamics, before we knew really what to say about the other
*  ones. I should also mention the strong interactions, which in some sense also have a dimensionless
*  number associated with them, but it's harder to tell you what that number is because in quantum
*  field theory, numbers that are coupling constants depend on the scale at which you measure them,
*  and for the fine structure constant of electromagnetism, you can just take the limit as
*  you're measuring it at zero energy and define that to be the number. At higher energies,
*  the number would change a little bit according to the renormalization group, but with the strong
*  interactions, the number seems to blow up at zero energy. So what you do instead is say, what is the
*  energy scale at which the strong interaction coupling constant becomes of order one, and that
*  is called the QCD scale, and it's a dimensionless, dimension full number. It is around a third of a
*  GEV, a third of the mass of the proton. So even though in some way of thinking classically at the
*  level of the Lagrangian, if you want to put it that way, the strong coupling constant is dimensionless,
*  you really need a dimension full number to specify what it is. So it's really the fine
*  structure constant that is the most obviously dimensionless of any of the fundamental structure
*  constants. I don't think that it means that it has any fundamental role in quantum gravity or
*  anything like that. It's about electromagnetism. I think that's the right way to think about it.
*  Okay, Nikkel, I'm sorry, it says here Nikkel, as if it were Michael, but with an N, so I'm going to
*  assume that is just correct, and this is Nikkel Kramer, says, despite reading all the popular
*  accounts of the Higgs field that I can find, I'm afraid I still don't quite understand how it adds
*  mass to the affected particles. Most of these accounts describe the field and how it interacts
*  with the affected particles, but then it seems that presto, the particle has mass. Can you help
*  me out here? Well, I don't know if I can help you out or not. I'm the author of one of those popular
*  accounts of the Higgs field, so I do my best, but and the problem is that I'm not sure what it is
*  about those accounts that is leaving you cold or leaving you unsatisfied. So I'm not sure that I'll
*  be able to patch up that particular hole, but here's a way of thinking about it that might be
*  a little bit different than what we normally think. You know, what is mass after all? So basically,
*  I think the right way to think about mass is what Einstein taught us, that E equals mc squared.
*  Mass is a kind of energy. It's the energy an object has when it's just sitting there not doing
*  anything, right? No kinetic energy, no potential energy, it just has existence energy, and that
*  energy is this mass times the speed of light squared, or rather what we call the mass is that
*  rest energy divided by the speed of light squared. So where does it come from? Why does a particle
*  in fundamental physics have energy when it's just sitting there? Well, if particles are
*  massless, one way, well, I guess the right thing to say is this. In modern physics, all these
*  particles come from fields. It's not just the Higgs boson that is a field, the electron is a field,
*  the quarks are fields, all of these things are fields, and they're vibrating fields,
*  and the vibrations have different kinds of energy associated with them. There's kinetic energy,
*  which means the field's time derivative gives you a kind of energy, how fast is it vibrating.
*  There's gradient energy, how is the field changing from place to place, that's a kind of energy,
*  and there's also potential energy. The potential energy is not how the field is changing from
*  place to place, but just what is the energy associated with the value of the field.
*  So you might think in your mind that the field has zero value, it has zero energy,
*  and if it has a non-zero value, maybe it does have an energy, okay. That's not always exactly right.
*  In fact, famously for the Higgs boson, that's not true. The energy is not zero at zero field value.
*  That's why the Higgs field takes on a non-zero value in empty space. The lowest energy state
*  is not at zero field value, but that story is true for all of the fields. So the photon
*  is massless, and it doesn't have any potential energy. At the field level, the mass of a field
*  comes from its potential energy, and this is not going to be very satisfying maybe,
*  but you can kind of see that connection. Einstein says the mass of an object is the energy it has
*  just sitting there. Quantum field theory says the mass of a field is the energy you get just from
*  having a value, not necessarily from changing. But for something like the photon, there's no
*  potential energy. There's no energy associated with the field having a value. In fact, the value
*  of the field, this is something that is wrapped up in what we call gauge invariance or gauge symmetry.
*  The value of the field doesn't matter, only how the field changes from place to place, and indeed,
*  when you get into the math, only certain aspects of how it changes from place to place is what
*  really matters. So the field for electromagnetism is not the electric field or the magnetic field.
*  It is what we call the vector potential field, which gives rise to the electric field, the magnetic
*  field, depending on how it's changing over space or over time. So because there is no actual energy
*  associated with the value of the field, it has no potential and it has no mass, and that's why the
*  photon is massless. The electron field in its low energy state has a potential energy, so if you just
*  try to push the field uniformly everywhere, that costs you energy, and that's a reflection of the
*  fact that at the quantum level, the associated particles are going to have mass. So if you
*  buy that, which you may or may not, then it all becomes very, very simple. There's a fundamental
*  way of thinking about the electron where it didn't have any potential energy, where the value of the
*  field wasn't giving you any contribution of the energy, but there's an interaction between the
*  electron and the Higgs field so that the value of the electron field does bump into the value of the
*  Higgs, and when the value of the Higgs was zero, that was just an interaction. There was a way for
*  the Higgs field to literally scatter off of electrons and so forth, but when the Higgs field
*  gets a non-zero value in the vacuum, what used to be an interaction now becomes a potential energy.
*  Because the electron field is interacting with the Higgs field, it now costs energy to change the
*  value of the electron field. So now there's a potential energy for it, and guess what? That
*  turns into a mass for the associated particle. You have to kind of take on faith that there is a
*  leap from quantized fields to particles, but that is a leap you better be prepared to make or
*  read one of the various things I've written about it in one of my books. Okay, I'm going to once
*  again group two questions together. Chris Shipton says, is it possible for a black hole to spin so
*  fast it would tear itself apart? And Johan Falk says, does a spinning black hole not have a
*  completely spherical boundary? So no and yes. Spinning black holes, well it depends even by
*  spherical, the boundary, the event horizon of a black hole has the topology of a sphere, but it
*  can look like a squashed sphere if the black hole is spinning. A spinning black hole will generally
*  have the geometry of an oblate spheroid, much like the earth, but much more perfect than the earth
*  because the earth is kind of lumpy. It is not so possible, it is not possible for black hole to
*  spin so fast it would tear itself apart, but there is a limit that you reach where it's the fastest a
*  black hole can spin and this is what is called an extremal black hole. So if a black hole starts to
*  spin there's a sort of an upper limit where it is no longer a black hole if you go past that limit
*  then you would get like a naked singularity or something bad like that. So in practice what
*  happens is you can't reach that point, right? You can start with an ordinary black hole and try to
*  add spin to it, but how do you add spin to it? You have to throw something into it that is spinning
*  and so you're adding not only spin to it, you're also adding more energy to it or more mass
*  and you never get to the point where the spin is more important than the mass and that's what
*  you would have to do to reach this extremal point. But really all I'm saying here is Google
*  extremal black holes. There are extremal black holes both in the case of spin where you say there's
*  so much spin it's almost trying to overcome the gravity and there's also extremal black holes in
*  the case of electric charge where you say you know there's an electric field that is pushing things
*  away that is almost ready to overcome the strength of gravity but in both cases you can't get there
*  that is part of the cosmic censorship conjecture which you could also look up if you're interested.
*  Dylan Hall says, I've watched several of your talks on finding gravity and space time in quantum
*  mechanics and also a few lectures from Leonard Susskind on space time being created by entanglement.
*  Could space time being created by entanglement provide any explanation of inflation or the
*  initial low entropy state of the universe? If we start with no entanglement and allow things to
*  start entangling what happens? You know they might be related but I don't think that there is any
*  immediate explanation from that because it's almost implicit in your second question. If we
*  start with no entanglement and allow things to start entangling, well we can do that but why did
*  we do that? Why did you start the initial state of the universe with no entanglement? There's also,
*  I think we're going to get to this later on, but whether a quantum state is entangled or not
*  is actually not a well posed question. You have to take a quantum system and you have to divide it
*  into subsystems and then you can ask whether those subsystems are entangled or not. That's
*  a well posed question but entanglement has to be between two different things. So if you talk about
*  the wave function of the universe which is only one thing and you say is it entangled that's kind
*  of a meaningless question. So this is just a footnote to say that you have to be a little
*  bit careful when you even say these statements. It's not that there is a statement with no,
*  a state with no entanglement. There is a set of substates that are not entangled with each other.
*  Now it's very possible that that is the correct way to think about the early universe and its
*  expansion. I've actually written a couple of papers that say exactly that. One on quantum
*  circuit cosmology and the other on decider space as a tensor network, a way of thinking about
*  entangled quantum bits. And it's an interesting possibility but it does not as far as I know
*  provide any easy ways or novel ways of addressing the fine tuning problems of the early universe.
*  Even if you are thinking of spaces created from quantum entanglement you still have to just
*  posit the fact that that entanglement had a certain structure at early times. Now that might
*  just be that none of us has thought of the right answer yet. So that's why I'm answering this
*  question. I'm hoping that someone out there thinks of the right answer. Then you can have
*  an acknowledgement or a citation in your paper talking about this podcast. Eli Graham says,
*  many of us who have personally suffered homophobia in our academic and professional lives
*  were quite moved by your comments in the last AMA regarding renaming the web telescope. In my own
*  case as recently as less than 20 years ago I brought to the attention of the director of the
*  school where I taught homophobic attacks against me by another teacher. The director not only
*  refused to help me he let me know I should be grateful the school even hired gay people.
*  That was some improvement over earlier years when I, we, expected it worse to go to jail and at best
*  to lose our jobs and professional reputations for being gay. The question is what realistically can
*  your listeners do to get the telescope renamed? So I'm sorry to hear about those experiences Eli
*  and I know that it's not just 20 years ago. Things like that still happen. Hopefully they're
*  becoming more rare but they're absolutely out there and it's terrible. It's not a good reflection
*  on us as human beings that we choose to be biased and discriminated and discriminating against people
*  in that way. So I do want to take it seriously. I do want to ask you know how we can make things
*  better and I think that we make things better not by ignoring the problem but by talking about it and
*  trying to actively improve the situation. However having said all that if your actual question is
*  what can we do to get the telescope renamed and you you did put the word in there realistically.
*  I think realistically there's almost nothing. I think realistically that ship has sailed.
*  I would I would like it so again as I said last month I am not a super expert on James Webb or
*  how he behaved. My very tiny experience with reading about the claims about him made it seem
*  perfectly plausible that he was a nasty person especially when it came to gay people and that he
*  either let them be discriminated against or actively participated into it and I think that's bad and I
*  don't think that we should be honoring that kind of person for with telescope names but you know
*  maybe there's history there that I don't know so I'm not trying to make new substantive claims about
*  that. My claim is that if someone is that kind of person we should not be naming telescopes after
*  them but we did name we the Royal We I had nothing to do with it but NASA named the telescope after
*  him and I don't see any realistic way to get it the name change just because bureaucracies are
*  bureaucracies and they're not easy to change. So what I would say is the telescope being named
*  after someone who was homophobic or anti-gay is not good but maybe we can make something good out
*  of it you know rather than trying to think the the best about how we can possibly get the name
*  changed which might be banging our heads against a wall we can just be noisy about the fact that
*  people like that should not be celebrated and it's still a problem right now and maybe the ongoing
*  name stuck to the telescope can continue to be a reason to talk about that and let people know
*  about it and not let the issue fade from popular view. Of course I could be wrong about this maybe
*  my you know judging of the political winds is completely wrong and NASA's going to change the
*  name tomorrow which would be great if that's what they decide to do but that is what my judgment is
*  right now. I don't think it's the best way to expend our energies to try to get the name of
*  this telescope changed. Brendan Hall says what do you think about the finale of Lost? I kind of
*  liked it but I know many didn't so yeah I know that not only not all of you have watched the TV
*  show Lost. I did all the way up to the finale so I wouldn't answer the question if I thought that
*  it was going to be completely meaningless to people who hadn't seen the TV show but Lost is
*  sort of a paradigm for TV shows not ending well and I think it's a very interesting question.
*  When you you know a TV show especially a long-running network show is kind of a unique
*  storytelling challenge because stories are very often shaped by how they end right the end of a
*  story is kind of an important thing but when you're in season three of a TV show and you don't know
*  how many seasons you're going to get and it's not just a sitcom where you just tell jokes every week
*  but there's supposed to be some dramatic tension and movement from place to place from moment to
*  moment from episode to episode from season to season it can be really challenging to set yourself
*  up for a successful finale especially because you often don't even know and sometimes you're
*  told that you're cancelled after you finished doing a season and there's no real finale at all
*  and especially for something like Lost where a lot of the interest of the show was a set of
*  mysteries right a mystery of all the genres that you can think of has to have a payoff at the end
*  and so I'm pretty sure if my understanding is correct I actually helped interview Carlton Cuse
*  and Damon Lindelof who did the show the showrunners and I think they didn't know
*  what all of the things that were going to be happening were like halfway through the show
*  running like they would set some things up and then try to come up with good explanations for
*  them after the fact that is not necessarily a bad strategy but it can backfire and I think that in
*  the case of Lost they just couldn't come up with a ending that would make everybody happy but you
*  know maybe there wasn't an ending that would make any everybody happy and another famous example of
*  a tv show not nailing the landing is How I Met Your Mother which is a sitcom but it kind of in
*  season one set up this big mystery you know who was the mother of the children and how did they
*  meet and it sort of promised an answer but that was in season one and things changed after season
*  one and they were stuck with that answer they felt that they were stuck with that answer and
*  couldn't wriggle out of it even though it was entirely inappropriate by the time they got to
*  the final season so anyway this is just interesting to talk about in my mind because I'm fascinated by
*  storytelling and I'm fascinated by the methodology of coming up with how to structure a story and
*  to best tell it and the cases when it doesn't work are just as important as the cases when it
*  works and you know look Game of Thrones is another example where I thought that the early seasons
*  were some of the best television ever made and the last season ruined it all which was really kind of
*  almost an accomplishment in itself so I would like to know if there is a better theory of making
*  finales for tv shows. Peter Bamber says with respect to dangerous evil and powerful people
*  who can make life miserable for many others should we always await arrest and trial before
*  deciding upon a sentence or is it sometimes better to save misery to save misery by means of
*  assassination? I think this question is both good and important and far too vague to be possibly
*  answered. It just depends enormously on what we're talking about here. I do think that in a
*  functioning civil society one should let the rule of law do its job. One should not take justice into
*  one's own hands but I also know that not every society is well functioning and it's when society
*  is not well functioning that sometimes you do have to take things into your own hands. For
*  an interesting case and one I'm going to I know I'm going to be in trouble saying this but I'm
*  going to say it anyway the January 16th riots right the insurrection the terrorist attack on
*  the capital of the United States January 6th people make a big deal out of that and I think
*  correctly so it was a terrible thing that happened but what if we are trying to be careful and honest
*  and say what the origin of the terribleness was and I think a lot of people would say well look
*  they attacked the capital of the United States that's a terrible thing but you know what if the
*  election truly had been stolen what if one party had just somehow managed to fix all the voting
*  machines to give themselves a victory that was not an actual reflection of what the voters had done
*  what if they had truly stolen the election now they obviously didn't in the case of the 2020
*  election but what if they had right what if one party had just set itself up for permanent rule
*  by not by campaigning and winning the votes but by controlling the voting machines then I think
*  that people would have some right slash obligation to protest maybe even violently against that right
*  so in some very real sense January 6th was a terrible horrible thing it should be live in
*  embarrassment and ill repute for everyone concerned for the rest of their lives but the origin of the
*  badness isn't the attack it's the fact that they promulgated and believed that lie about the
*  election being stolen that was the problem things follow from that that are terrible but that was
*  the beginning of it so anyway which is all just to say with respect to Peter's question if we did
*  live in a society which purported to be a democracy but was not really a democracy and all of the
*  votes were rigged then I think it'd be perfectly justified to go to non-peaceful means to try to
*  fix things the really sad thing of course at the end of this discourse is that someone has to make
*  that decision and often the people making that decision are not very good or smart or having
*  the best interests of everyone else at heart which is why so many extrajudicial actions are bad rather
*  than good all right let me uh speaking of controversial topics let me group together a
*  bunch of things these are all follow-ups to the AMA question I had last month about a clone of Alice
*  the criminal so Robert Ruxin-Drescu says in the last AMA you covered a case where Alice does
*  something terrible but dies before she gets the punishment you argue that if a new instance of
*  her is created she's basically the same person so she can serve the sentence but if that's the case
*  here's my proposal I get to do whatever I want murder steal etc for each of my crimes I create
*  an identical copy of myself and give the copy to the authorities this is an identical copy of myself
*  you can take this copy to prison to serve my sentence I propose this way I serve the sentence
*  for my crimes while I the original version can roam around do whatever I want Constantine Iannou
*  uh Iannou sorry says priority question during September 2022 AMA you answered positively in
*  the below question by anonymous although it is contrary to intuition as accepted by you my
*  question is whether you would maintain the same position in the possible scenario that multiple
*  accurate clones of Alice are created would they all have to be held accountable Johann Falk says
*  concerning the hypothetical Alice in the September AMA I would argue that convicting her for the
*  crime only seems wrong if one sees the conviction as a punishment or revenge if one sees the rule
*  of law not as a way of getting back at offenders but as a way of shaping society it makes perfect
*  sense to convict her it assures that people acting in the way Alice did are taken care of
*  in best case they are rehabilitated and helped to a better way of living their lives
*  do you see any benefits of thinking in terms of revenge or punishment apart from giving any
*  giving any victim some kind of satisfaction and finally Linh U Ms Yara says in the latest AMA
*  there's a question about a person who commits a crime dot dot dot now suppose the person who
*  commits the crime is still alive and is arrested if there are 10 identical clones of that person
*  who don't have the faintest idea that a crime is being perpetrated do you think these 10 people
*  should be arrested too so some preliminary remarks before tackling all these questions
*  which are slightly different questions about the same scenario remember the original scenario was
*  Alice is committed a crime she is killed with an identical clone of hers created should we be
*  able to punish the clone for Alice's crimes I chose to interpret the question and you can
*  interpret in different ways but I chose to interpret it as the clone of Alice is really
*  an identical copy of Alice before she died so not just a clone not just with the same DNA
*  but a person with exactly the same psychology and exactly the same memories basically an atom for
*  atom copy of what Alice was like I don't think the whole point of my answer was I don't think
*  there's any essence of self-identity that follows the actual physical atoms of a person that doesn't
*  make sense to me you know we're all exchanging our atoms with the environment all the time and
*  I think if I literally construct a copy of someone atom by atom there for all intents and purposes
*  they contain the same responsibilities and weight of history that the other person did so to Linnea
*  Miziara's question what if this these other clones don't have the famous idea crime has been
*  perpetrated that's clearly not what I was talking about I'm not talking about just clones who have
*  completely different memories then I wouldn't punish them that would be crazy I'm only talking
*  about punishing people who actually in their minds have the memories of the person who just
*  committed the crime you know in their minds they are the person who just committed the crime and
*  I think that all if if you think that anyone deserves punishment then all such people deserve
*  punishment so for Johan's question are we doing it for revenge or punishment versus possible
*  rehabilitation and deterrence purposes I think I'm very much in favor of consequentialism here we
*  should do it for deterrence and rehabilitation purposes we're trying to make the world better
*  not just getting some sense of revenge so therefore if we're trying to deter people from doing it and
*  we're trying to rehabilitate the people who do do bad things that's why I think that all the people
*  in exactly the same mental state as the criminal should be given that punishment there's no sort of
*  metaphysical correctness to which person deserves the punishment and then to Constantine's question
*  if the person is still alive and multiple accurate clones of Alice are created they all have to be
*  held accountable sure again they're all in their minds guilty of this crime they are the person
*  whose mental state caused them to do this crime and therefore if they're if any one of them is worth
*  having being incarcerated or whatever then they all are and then to Robert's question if I make an
*  identical copy of myself can I just say well punish them no the punishment should be every
*  person who has that mental state deserves the punishment it's not like if you punish one person
*  it's like you know you can't punish an identical twin and say that counts if the other person's
*  twin actually did the crime so the whole spirit of my answer which again you're free to disagree
*  with as always but the spirit of my answer was people do not have metaphysical essences okay
*  that sort of cease to exist when they die people are processes people are collections of matter
*  acting in certain ways and if I have a collection of matter that is indistinguishable in every
*  microscopic way from another collection of matter both of these collections of matter
*  look like people with certain memories then whatever way we should treat one of those
*  collections of matter we should also treat the other one that is the major point that I want to
*  make you can disagree about how we should treat any of them but they should all be treated the same
*  Nick Netshvolodov says why do scientists and interested parties such as myself
*  accept the findings of experiments using the Large Hadron Collider when the findings can't
*  be replicated with independent apparatuses well I think there's lots of reasons for one they can
*  to some extent be replicated because there's more than one detector at the Large Hadron Collider
*  there are two large general purpose detectors the CMS detector and the Atlas detector and this was
*  in fact historically crucially important to why we accepted the discovery of the Higgs boson so
*  quickly because both experiments saw it in exactly the same place doing exactly the same things so
*  they do in fact use the same source of protons in the Large Hadron Collider okay
*  but still they're doing different measurements of those protons and that's almost a completely
*  independent experiment but the other is you know even if there were only one of them you would have
*  less credence on the results if there were only one of them but still you would just be a good
*  Bayesian right your credences would depend on what your prior was the discovery of the Higgs boson
*  is something where everyone thought it should happen more or less sooner rather than later and
*  so we were ready to believe it faster than light neutrinos or something that no one believes so
*  people are very skeptical of even though it's also coming out of CERN so you just try your best to
*  say well what are the chances that these people would get it right get it wrong whatever are they
*  good do they have a track record have they convinced us that they're being honest with
*  their backgrounds all these things you can do for the more general question of how do people who are
*  not experts choose to have belief that a certain scientific experiment is wrong is on the right
*  track at all you know i think that you have to again use your judgment but we tend to trust the
*  the opinions of people who are experts i'm a believer in expertise experts are never 100
*  correct but they're more likely to be correct than non-experts are so i think that the fact that all
*  the particle physicists in the world more or less accepted that the LHC is on the right track should
*  be taken as evidence that not it certainly is but that it probably is aria biddle says it may be a
*  natural outgrowth of poetic naturalism that i often hear you remark that you don't like to debate
*  things you give an impression that you're perfectly fine with people believing whatever they believe
*  and just giving your take as you currently see it do you ever find a time where you think it's
*  appropriate to hash some disagreement out or dig deep into why you and someone else see things
*  differently is it only in private at dinners with a few drinks in you well i think there's a couple
*  things going on here in this question so i enjoyed being on the debate team in high school
*  and i certainly appreciate the reason why people like doing it and i do think it's also good
*  training both for public speaking and for logical thinking what it's not especially good at is a way
*  to find the truth it depends a lot on who's doing the debating what the format is all those kinds of
*  things when i participate in debates these days which is rarely but sometimes it happens
*  it's not really a fact-finding mission in trying trying to figure out how the universe works right
*  it's more entertainment and inspiration for the audience usually if i'm going to participate in a
*  debate it's because i think that i can get a message out to people who otherwise might not
*  hear that message under different circumstances but the what you're asking in the question is
*  sort of more about whether it's appropriate to hash out some disagreement i mean that's not
*  something that i'm averse to doing at all but that's not having a debate that i think that's
*  a huge mistake to conflate the idea of hashing out a disagreement or digging deeply into why
*  i and someone else see things differently versus having a debate a debate is very formal very
*  artificial you know it's it's again it's more entertainment than intellectual exercise i spend
*  my whole life hashing out disagreements and digging deep into why i and someone else see things
*  differently that's what academics do all the time every day so i do i do that you know quite
*  frequently now having said that you still have only 24 hours in the day you have to choose what
*  are the disagreements that you're going to dig into and i would just much rather engage with people
*  who i think are also acting in good faith trying to learn something trying to improve their own
*  understanding rather than people who are just trying to sort of demolish a debate opponent
*  okay so there are people out there who are already convinced they have the right answers
*  and their job is just destroy the other side and that's an exercise in which i have no interest at
*  all clied schecter says i'm confused about pulsars after the explanation in the chiara mingarelli
*  episode we see these objects because their rapid rotation oblique to the axis of their magnetic
*  field creates electromagnetic radiation but with this radiation going out the pulsar must somehow
*  lose energy my my first thought is that their rotation would slow but then their pulse intervals
*  would be progressive would progressively lengthen and they would not be the marvelous ultra regular
*  clocks they are i assume energy is in fact conserved somehow how does that happen
*  yeah this is a very good question but of course energy is conserved in this particular case you
*  know i'm well known as someone who appreciates that there are some cases in which it's not exactly
*  true but this is a very good case where it is and they do slow down it's a well-known fact that
*  pulsars slow down over time but two things the slow down is very very tiny so there's a quantitative
*  question here you can't just say well they slow down how come that doesn't ruin them their use
*  as clocks you can understand how quickly they slow down and take that into consideration when
*  they're when they're being used as clocks and the slow down is very very tiny there's a lot of energy
*  available in that spin of the pulsar and only a tiny amount of it leaks out through giving out
*  all of this radiation benjamin f says do you agree with david deutch's interpretation of why we see
*  interference pattern in the double slit experiment he claims we are observing a tangible photon from
*  our universe being interfered with by a phantom photon from a parallel universe that differs from
*  our universe only by the position of that single photon if deutch is correct is some kind of
*  communication between worlds theoretically possible you know this is an area it's a very
*  good question because it's an area where people who all agree that many worlds is the best way of
*  thinking about things like i do and david deutch does can nevertheless disagree about the best way
*  to attach words to what is going on in many worlds i say specifically attach words because
*  we all agree on the math there's no distinction no disagreement about how to use the equations
*  but how best to interpret them in terms of words changes from person to person and in particular
*  what i would say is you can have a quantum mechanical state representing a single universe
*  and then you say that a certain part of the universe a certain system within the universe
*  has a single quantum state and then it becomes entangled with its environment we call that
*  decoherence and then its wave function branches and now there are two different copies of it in two
*  different universes that is a way of talking but another way of talking is to sort of take the
*  system before it decoheres and talk as if it's already two different universes they just haven't
*  branched yet okay and that's more like the way that deutch is talking i don't think that's a
*  good way of talking because in principle things can branch in different ways for along different
*  axes when you when you look at a system that is not yet decohered that has not yet become
*  entangled with the environment there's no unique unique way to divide it up into a collection of
*  different universes it's just one thing is the way that i would put it but anyway i kind of don't
*  care like people this is a live and let live situation as far as i'm concerned because we all
*  agree on what the equations are telling us bill quirk says many believe that the expanding universe
*  requires a departure from unitarity in quantum mechanics do you think a departure from unitarity
*  is needed so what is being referred to here is unitarity is the quantum mechanical way of saying
*  conservation of information unitarity is the idea that you have a wave function it evolves
*  from one point in time to another point in time in a way that if you know where it ends up you
*  can figure out where it came from it's just reversibility in the quantum context so the
*  amount of information you need to specify is the same at early times and later times naively you
*  might worry that the expansion of the universe has some conflict or at least some tension with this
*  because the universe gets bigger there's more stuff for at least more room for stuff and therefore
*  maybe you need more information need more room to tell you exactly what is going on in that
*  particular quantum state so i think there's lots of things to say about this the ultimate answer
*  is we don't know at face value i think that that particular tension is overblown it comes from our
*  intuition not from the equations there's no necessary reason just because the universe is
*  expanding that you need to violate unitarity but that's not to say that you don't you know it's a
*  situation where you have quantum mechanics you have gravity there are mysteries here not only
*  quantum gravity and the emergence of space and time but as we already talked about the mystery
*  of the initial conditions and so forth so here is a case where i'm open to thinking outside the box
*  and thinking about ways to go beyond the standard quantum story and just but just to to mention
*  this would be a pretty big departure from the standard quantum story if unitarity were not
*  part of the story so you want to be really sure that you have a good reason to go beyond it or
*  at least a even better way of thinking lined up as an alternative if you want to go in that direction
*  jesse rimler says the russian invasion of ukraine is a horrific crime and russia is responsible i
*  believe the ukrainians are right to ask for aid and it is right for the u.s to supply ukraine with
*  aid i also believe it is right for the u.s to apply pressure to initiate peace talks critics call this
*  appeasement but i don't see many grappling with where this conflict is headed one expert who does
*  is anatole livin at the quincy institute under the current policy he sees a high chance for a decades
*  long conflict similar to pakistan and cashmere or an escalation to the brink of nuclear war neither
*  would be a good outcome outcome for ukraine to put it mildly do you think the u.s should use its
*  influence to step to help initiate peace talks well it depends on what you mean by peace talks
*  you know peace talks are always a good idea i think that peace is better than war but when
*  you have peace talks presumably you're trying to come to some agreement right you're saying well
*  we'll have peace if you do this and we do this that's where all of the hard part is what is it
*  going to take to have an agreement that both sides can agree to right now i see essentially
*  zero chance that ukraine and russia are going to agree on any peace uh um a peace agreement i'm
*  just saying the word agree over over again that's why i'm hesitating here but i think that their
*  differences are too large and and that just makes sense because russia invaded them to you know take
*  over them and it didn't work uh as i will say now what i always say here that the united states can
*  think whatever it wants what has to matter the most is what people in ukraine want they're the
*  ones who are being invaded okay so i don't see any ukrainians asking the u.s to negotiate a peace
*  settlement right now so i don't think that we really have the right to demand such a thing now
*  there is a footnote there which is of course that everyone's interests are in not having a nuclear
*  war that is absolutely true um so i do think that we should take action if we think that there is
*  something to be done to prevent a nuclear war that would otherwise have too high a probability
*  the problem with that is i don't feel that i have a good grasp on what that is what the probability
*  for nuclear war is or what the actions are that would decrease it if we set a precedent that
*  nuclear powers can invade other countries and get what they want uh i don't think that letting that
*  precedent be set necessarily decreases the chances for nuclear war down the line so i think you have
*  to think past this one conflict and think about all the possible ramifications obviously russians
*  know the russians in power know that if they launched a nuclear attack things would go badly
*  for them very quickly uh very soon and so in some sense we're still in the mutually assured
*  destruction phase of nuclear power although not exactly because we're not really thinking of
*  complete destruction of another country the russia is unlikely to attack the united states using
*  nuclear warheads for exactly that reason but they might think they can get away with it in ukraine
*  i don't think that they can i think that it probably is uh better for the united states
*  and every other country in the world just to emphasize the terrible terrible consequences
*  of anyone using nuclear weapons in a first strike for any reason that seems to me a more stable
*  long-term useful policy than trying to broker a peace agreement that the country that was invaded
*  is not in favor of paul says can science save us i have very low expectations the world will
*  effectively deal with climate change if you had the proverbial unlimited budget what technology
*  or experts would you recommend you know i don't have an unlimited budget i don't even have unlimited
*  or even very big knowledge about what technology would be the best when it comes to climate change
*  there's one very very obvious technology which is not even a technology it's just stop spewing
*  greenhouse gases into the air that's something we know how to do so i would prioritize that
*  that's not to say we can't do other things as well i'm entirely in favor of doing technological
*  and scientific development on ways that we can remove greenhouse gases from the air that that
*  sounds like a very obviously good thing to do but it's not a replacement for stopping putting them
*  in the first place so as far as what the technologies are i really have no idea some
*  combination of chemistry and synthetic biology and things like that might be of help but i'm
*  not the one to ask about it chris says if a telescope similar to the james webb space
*  telescope was at the other end of our galaxy or halfway across the universe and it was looking
*  in the general direction of earth would it be able to determine that life intelligent life exists here
*  um probably not is the short answer i'm not going to give you a detailed answer here because this
*  is a quantitative question at what distance from earth would the jwst be able to determine
*  that there might be life or intelligent life here so i don't know the answer to that question
*  it's really not something that this telescope is optimized for it so happens that as an infrared
*  telescope with very high resolution it turns out to be pretty good for thinking for measuring spectra
*  of atmospheres around exoplanets now that we know there are exoplanets that's a very good instrument
*  to have but specifically figuring out whether there is life on them requires a lot more knowledge
*  we don't know in general terms what kind of signature life we'll have we have some rough
*  ideas we have some guesses but look we had guesses about what kind of solar systems there would be
*  and those turned out to be half right half wrong if you go back to the john johnson
*  podcast that we did you know our expectations weren't completely on the ball so we don't even
*  know what exactly it is we're looking for i will say that if the telescope is literally at the other
*  end of the galaxy or halfway across the universe that is too far away that's why i can definitively
*  answer that especially because the other end of the galaxy you have to look through the entire
*  galaxy which is not transparent there's a lot of gas and dust and clouds in the way and halfway
*  across the universe is just too far away so i think that for nearer exoplanets jwst will be able to
*  tell us something but it'll be hints and indications it will not be anything cut and dried is my guess
*  david maxwell says are there aspects of eastern philosophy that you actively consider research
*  or teach i've re-listened to episode 160 with edward slingerland more than any other and would
*  love to see some more on eastern philosophy so roughly speaking no but on the other hand
*  you know it depends what you mean by eastern philosophy typically when you say things like
*  that eastern philosophy you kind of mean ancient eastern philosophy i mean i definitely read and
*  cite philosophers who are currently in china or japan does that count as eastern philosophy or of
*  chinese or japanese or other asian extraction indian etc but that's usually not what people
*  have in mind when they say eastern philosophy so as far as ancient eastern philosophy is concerned
*  i don't really actively consider research or teach it but i don't really actively consider research
*  or teach ancient western philosophy either i will sometimes refer to it for pedagogical reasons
*  thinking that people might be a little bit familiar with it or for historical reasons you know there's
*  a line of development from aristotle through gallileo etc that is interesting to talk about
*  but i don't search the works of the ancient philosophers in the west for wisdom for our
*  current era whether it's my at least i should say about that about my own personal research
*  in natural philosophy if you want to call it that or philosophy of physics now i do think that when
*  it comes to sort of human scale questions there's you're much more likely to get something out
*  useful and interesting out of ancient philosophy whether it be eastern or western that's just not
*  my personal area of interest or expertise so i don't lean in that direction sandeep chitale
*  says can you please explain why the low entropy at the big bang is the cause of the direction of the
*  flow of time or maybe that is not true i can see how the corollary is true entropy generally
*  increases in the direction of the flow of time but cannot see why the converse will be true
*  well this depends on what you mean by the flow of time at the level of fundamental physics there's
*  no thing called the flow of time you know the equations of fundamental physics just use time
*  as a label it's not something that flows any more than space flows the laws of physics relate what
*  happens at different points of space and time to what happens at other points in space and time
*  i would argue that the flow of time is an impression that we human beings have psychologically
*  and every psychological impression that we have ultimately comes down to the thermodynamic arrow
*  of time the fact that entropy is increasing this is a longer discussion of course i did have a
*  couple of podcasts about it one with jananne ismael my current johns hopkins colleague also dean
*  buonamano we talked about it and maybe a little bit with david eaglemann the psychology and
*  neuroscience of time and its relationship to entropy we know something about the past that
*  we don't know about the future ultimately because the entropy was lower we feel that we have causal
*  influence over the future but not the past again because entropy is increasing toward the future
*  all this is a very long story that i'm not going to answer right now but that's how it ties in if
*  it weren't for entropy increasing we wouldn't have any conscious experiences including the
*  conscious experience that time is flowing around us jim wade says does an entity have to be alive
*  to have intelligence i like this question because it confused me a little bit at first because not
*  confuse me in the sense of like i have no idea what the answer is but i thought i knew what the
*  answer was and i kept changing my mind so my first response intuitively was well of course like if
*  you're not alive then how could you be intelligent but then i thought about what about artificial
*  intelligence right so this is clearly where i was just being too naive i do think that um
*  there can very well be artificial things which we would not classify as alive but we would classify
*  as doing intelligent things now do we classify them as having intelligence at this point what i
*  would do in my i put on my philosopher hat and say that the right thing to do is not to insist on
*  trying to answer a question does an entity have to be alive to have intelligence but rather taking a
*  step back and thinking about what we mean by being alive and having intelligence so this is usually
*  the right strategy for these kinds of questions when it's confusing to think about these things
*  the mistake might be that we're assuming there is something univalent out there called having
*  intelligence and another univalent clear rigorous thing called being alive and we're asking do they
*  match up in some nice way but you know as we learned from uh stewart bartlett talking about
*  what it means to be alive there's more than one aspect that is involved in being alive and as we
*  talked about many different times in many different ways there's certainly more than one aspect to
*  being intelligent right so i would say that the better question to ask is what are the ways in
*  which the characteristics that are associated with being alive are or are not related to the
*  characteristics of having or not having intelligence if you have a computer that can play tic-tac-toe
*  and will always win is that having intelligence who cares it's an ability right the computer i
*  would not classify as alive just because it could win in tic-tac-toe but there's a relationship there
*  that is worth exploring but let's not be tricked into thinking these words have meanings even before
*  we start thinking about them bob polk says if i understand entropy correctly it is a relational
*  phenomenon entropy is high only in relation to where it is low somewhere else if this is correct
*  and following from this would it ever be possible to measure the total coarse-grained entropy of the
*  internal states of a whole human being as separate from its external states using a kind of markov
*  blanket approach a la carl friston's work with the free energy principle said another way could we
*  imagine one day having a star trek tricorder to scan the high low entropy reading of just one person
*  moment to moment so there's a lot going on here first and foremost entropy is not a relational
*  phenomenon there is for any given system you know for there's different systems of course but a
*  given system in a given coarse graining is just at high entropy or low entropy full stop the pause
*  there is because you need a coarse graining you need a pre-existing way of thinking about what are
*  what which states are classified as living in the same macro state or indistinguishable from each
*  other and as we've discussed many times this is something essentially everyone agrees on but we
*  have to agree on it okay that's it's not just given by nature there are reasons why certain
*  coarse grainings are chosen that nature suggests to us but ultimately we have to choose a coarse
*  graining and once we do that entropy is a number that you calculate and it doesn't have to be
*  related to anything else for the rest of your question i'm not quite sure where that question
*  intersects with the ability to build a tricorder that would scan our entropy i don't think that
*  entropy is the kind of thing you would want to scan what i what i think is true is that there
*  are macro states right so there's things we can measure you know if you had a tricorder maybe you
*  could see what configuration a person's heart or lungs were in or something like that and that has
*  some macroscopic shape right the heart is beating or whatever the lungs are breathing
*  but then there's a microscopic set of things going on and those things are going to be pretty close
*  to equilibrium right if they're if they're at a certain temperature or whatever they are maximum
*  entropy up to their macroscopic constraints to a very good approximation that's not exactly
*  going to be true that's an approximation it's a way of thinking about things but i'm not sure
*  what one would learn by thinking about the internal state of a person in terms of their
*  entropy let's put it this way i don't think the different people you meet on the street
*  have very different entropies inside them chris chattard says there's something chiara
*  mingarelli said that blows my mind that the very first black holes might just have been pure
*  curvature with no matter in them you even went so far as suggesting such animals might still exist
*  now i'm slowly coming to the realization that you don't need matter to create a black hole and
*  that the gr equations allow for empty pure curvature beasts but then pulling this thread
*  leads to weird questions would these black holes necessarily have a singularity and event horizon
*  a hawking radiation if the answers are yes then following the no hair theorem how would you
*  distinguish between matter-filled black holes from empty black holes seen from the outside of their
*  event horizon so yeah i mean it's absolutely possible to make black holes in general
*  relativity without having any matter because gravitational waves and similar kinds of
*  distortions of space time can effectively have energy right we know that because black holes
*  or other things that spiral into each other the system of the binary black hole is losing
*  energy to the gravitational waves that it's giving off so the waves are definitely carrying energy
*  and that means that if you get the right concentration of gravitational waves
*  intersecting each other they can collide and make a black hole that's something we can absolutely
*  imagine happening having said that gravity by itself is still a very weak force so the chances
*  that this happens are is very small the chances are very small it's not going to happen very much
*  in the real world the black holes that we have we can imagine they're being created completely
*  by gravity but we don't think it's going to be the most common thing having said all that
*  if it did happen you have zero way of knowing that they're the same outside that's the consequence
*  of the no hair theorems black holes look the same given a certain amount of mass spin and charge it
*  doesn't matter what they're made out of black holes are not solid objects inside they're just
*  space time inside so there's no difference between a black hole that was created by gravitational
*  waves colliding versus a black hole that was created by a star collapsing or something like that
*  gary upshaw says in your solo talking about parallel lines you said to launch two lines
*  perpendicular to a line segment at each end of the line segment and keep them straight
*  mathematically what is straight in a curved space straight means what we call a geodesic that is to
*  say the shortest distance path or the extremal distance path let's put it that way if you want
*  more i did write a book about this called the biggest ideas in the universe space time in motion
*  and i do talk about what these geodesics are one way of thinking about is the following which i say
*  this is literally right from the book if you take two trees and you tie a string between the two
*  trees and you pull it taut that will make a straight line okay everyone agrees also if you
*  take two trees and you stand at one of them and you point yourself in the direction of the other
*  one and you just keep walking forward you will also describe a straight line so mathematically
*  those are two very different procedures one the shortest distance path that's what you get by
*  pulling the string taut the other started a point and keep walking forward either one of them can
*  be used to define what you think of as a geodesic if the background in which you're moving is curved
*  itself to an outside observer neither one of them will look straight but they are the closest
*  analog to what we have as straight lines in euclidean geometry and that's what we mean in
*  general relativity etc jim watson says how do we think our biology evolution would be different
*  if the earth had significantly different frequency in its solar energy cycles e.g. tidally locked
*  with the sun or a day that was an order of magnitude longer or a year that was an order
*  magnitude shorter and how do energy cycles influence the goldilocks zone in the hunt for
*  life-supporting exoplanets this is a good question which i'm mostly bringing up because i don't
*  know what the answer is i think this is the kind of thing we should be thinking about when we're
*  thinking about life on other planets i think that it doesn't affect how we think about the goldilocks
*  zone very much but also i think that the idea of the goldilocks has been somewhat deprecated
*  in the thinking of exobiologists you know it used to be you would have a star and you would say well
*  if you were too close to the star in your orbit or too far away you'd either be too hot or too cold
*  on your planet these days we realize that even here in the solar system some of the most promising
*  venues for life appearing are places like the moons of jupiter or saturn which might be have
*  might have been considered in the old days outside the goldilocks zone so we're going to be a little
*  bit more open-minded about where life could actually be the thing that is relevant i know
*  why you're asking the question if you have a planet that is rotating with a fairly rapid day
*  then even though it will be hotter during the day and colder during the night they will both
*  be pretty close to each other astronomically speaking because the planet keeps moving
*  whereas if the planet is tidally locked then one side is going to get very hot and the other will
*  be very very cold there will therefore by continuity be a region in between where things
*  are more or less a similar kind of temperature as they are here on earth in fact there was a whole
*  science fiction novel written about this by charlie jane anders one of our former
*  mindscape guests so you're encouraged to look that up if you want to know more about it but
*  at this time it just is science fiction we don't have any hard data about it so we can speculate
*  about it i'm not very knowledgeable about whatever professional level speculations are actually
*  going on but it's fun to think about kathy seager says when gravitational waves are detected with
*  ligo or the pulsar timing method how do scientists gather information about the specifics and
*  localization of the system that produced them well this is a good question and it's a little
*  bit tricky because gravitational waves you know don't form an image that's not how we're
*  looking at them like we do with optical or other kind of electromagnetic radiation
*  but what we can do is have telescopes in different locations pointed at in different orientations and
*  so forth right you remember that ligo has two observatories one in louisiana and one in washington
*  state and they team up with the virgo detector in europe and hopefully soon some southern hemisphere
*  detectors and so as a gravitational wave passes by it will intersect the different detectors at
*  different times and you can use that information to kind of triangulate where things are on the
*  sky having said that it's not very accurate compared to optical or ordinary electromagnetic
*  things you can't pinpoint exactly where they are you get kind of a blob depending on what kind of
*  signal you have and we're trying to get better at figuring out exactly how to localize gravitational
*  wave signals on the sky i'm going to group two questions together joy colbeck says how do you
*  personally visualize the interiors of black holes and stevie cpw says do black holes have defined
*  edges and do the holes have a bottom or are they infinitely bottomless so i will answer stevie's
*  question first here because i think that this is stemming from a misapprehension that black holes
*  are holes they're really not you know we visualize a hole in the ground as something that has a
*  bottom but it's still sort of embedded in our three-dimensional space where we have holes and
*  things like that a black hole is a region of space time or it's okay to think of it as at each time
*  it's a region of space but it's a spherical region of space right there's a boundary around it the
*  event horizon you can see the black hole or you can you know notice it from all different
*  orientations and it looks round roundish maybe oblate and inside of it there will be whatever
*  made it a collapsing star or whatever that's you can't get there typically because you'll enter
*  and you'll be crushed by the singularity but if you hurry up maybe you can reach the collapsing
*  star depending on how things are but anyway from the inside to answer joy's question it looks the
*  same as it does from the outside if you pass by the event horizon of a black hole you wouldn't
*  notice at least within classical general relativity the prediction is you wouldn't notice you might
*  remember that there are debates about firewalls at the boundaries of black holes but most people
*  don't think that they're there we're trying to get rid of the firewalls in certain calculations
*  so if that's true once you enter into a black hole you don't even notice a black hole is defined as
*  a region of space time from which you can't escape but you notice that that definition is kind of
*  forward pointing right you cannot escape as you move into the future so at the moment when you're
*  inside the black hole you don't even know you know that you're following some trajectory and things
*  are space time is getting more and more curved and in your future probably relatively quickly you'll
*  be crushed as the tidal forces of the gravitational field rip you to pieces but it's still just space
*  time around you there's no sign saying you've now entered a black hole david boardman says how would
*  you distinguish scientific claims to knowledge from non-scientific ones you know i don't think
*  there's necessarily a single piffy motto that functions as a bright line between scientific
*  claims and non-scientific ones roughly speaking scientific claims are ones that
*  stem from thinking scientifically and doing the scientific process to establish your claims
*  you hypothesize things you come up with different conjectures that might be true whether you want
*  to call them theories or models or hypotheses doesn't really matter and then you test them
*  against experience against data right the primary so there's two primary things that go on there
*  both of which are highly non-trivial one is you hypothesize different things you don't assume that
*  you know it ahead of time right you don't just think you have the right answer you admit that
*  you don't have the final answer and you contemplate alternative possibilities and second is you judge
*  those possibilities on the basis of data whether it's observation or experiment or whatever in
*  other words once again you don't just think your way into the answer that's what really makes it
*  scientific the ability to maybe be wrong and the judging of whether you're right or wrong on the
*  basis of comparison with your experience of the real world harry eudenfriend says in a past episode
*  you mentioned that there was no conservation of energy in a changing space time and pointed us to
*  a paper that you wrote many years ago in episode 2001 secrets of einstein's equation you discussed
*  how an early version of the einstein equation for general relativity was incorrect because of an
*  error having to do with violating the law of conservation of energy can you please help me
*  understand this apparent inconsistency sure it just comes from the fact that conservation of energy
*  can mean different things in different contexts once we have general relativity on the scene
*  there is a rule in general relativity for how energy changes in response to gravity in response
*  to the curvature of space time the geometry of space time and that rule is sometimes called
*  conservation of energy but it's not simply saying that there is something called energy and you add
*  it up all through space and it's a constant okay it's rather covariant conservation of energy which
*  means that the energy might not be constant but it varies in a very very specific predictable way
*  in relationship to how space time itself is varying so we call it conservation of energy even
*  though it's not just energy is conserved i hope that that's accurate enough as to be illuminating
*  even though it might not make you very happy that is those are the words we use it all comes down to
*  the vocabulary we use again the ideas are perfectly clear once you know what they are
*  giles from melbourne says with judaya pearl from memory you both seem to dismiss the idea that
*  aristotle's causes were the same as those we were interested in in english can you expand on that
*  at all in particular whether the main difference might simply be the cause and effect in modern
*  english didn't don't exist at the same time whereas aristotle's examples can exist at the
*  same time father's children bronze statue etc yeah you know i think that it's a slight
*  misapprehension to think that aristotle's four causes are causes as in cause and effect relationships
*  that we have aristotle had a much more expansive notion and of course he also wasn't speaking
*  english he was speaking ancient greek so we have translated his idea into four causes but you know
*  one of his ideas is the reason for which things are built which is not really the kind of cause
*  that we have when we're talking about cause and effects as in the glass fell over because i swung
*  my arm and i bumped into it so it's just a vocabulary kind of difference you know but
*  aristotle was trying to understand change in a very general way he didn't have modern physics
*  he didn't have the idea that you know we have objects with locations that obey differential
*  equations he didn't have calculus so he didn't have differential equations so he just had a very
*  different way of thinking and he wasn't necessarily distinguishing between changes you know biological
*  changes and physical changes changes because we want them to happen changes because we push them
*  in some way changes because there are natural ways of things changing he wanted to distinguish
*  between them in the way that he found most fruitful but as i said before most ancient
*  philosophy is not of much use to modern physics and his classification doesn't really carry over
*  to the way that we think about modern physics casey mahone says whenever we put on the brakes in our
*  cars the energy has to get dissipated as waste heat do we have any idea how much processes like
*  this contribute to global warming rather than co2 emissions i think there's a couple things to say
*  you know again this is not my area of expertise so if you want quantitative relationships between
*  different contributors to global warming you've come to the wrong place but there's nevertheless
*  a few things we can say for one when we put the brakes on our cars that's not even the greatest
*  contributor of heat from our car right the engine and a typical internal combustion engine is putting
*  out a lot more waste heat than the brakes are but the other thing which is probably more relevant
*  here is that global warming doesn't mostly come from heat that it's a little counterintuitive you
*  might think that we're warming up the planet because we're burning a lot of things and therefore
*  raising the temperature but that's not really the problem you know we get the problem is that we get
*  energy from the sun that heats up us here on earth and then in equilibrium we give back the
*  same amount of energy to the rest of the world okay but the wavelengths of light are different
*  we get primarily visible light from the sun and we radiate back primarily infrared light to the
*  earth so that's the origin of the greenhouse effect is that you can put things gases into the
*  atmosphere that are transparent to visible light like co2 so the visible light from the sun that
*  is heating this up just comes right through whereas they are opaque or at least more absorptive
*  to infrared light so the infrared light that we want to radiate back to the sky gets caught in
*  the atmosphere if the atmosphere is transparent to both infrared and visible then you don't get
*  this warming effect but if you block in some of the infrared eventually it will get out but it
*  takes longer and in the process it heats up the planet so it's that change of transmittivity of
*  infrared light that is the single most important contributor here the whole atmosphere is very very
*  complex system and that is a cartoonish kind of version of it but it's the point is it's not
*  coming directly from us generating heat it's from not letting the radiation from that heat escape to
*  the outside world johan falch says considering utilitarianism and weighing outcomes against
*  each other it seems that putting numbers on how good or bad something is gives non-acceptable
*  consequences such as killing an innocent person is okay if it results in a million people getting
*  an ice cream or something what happens if we don't put numbers on outcomes but only have them ranked
*  as better worse or roughly equal to each other could that be a base for utilitarianism where a
*  lot of small good things never outweigh a single very bad thing to me it seems attractive but i
*  don't know philosophy well enough to know where such ideas would get stuck or can't start
*  contradicting themselves my feeling you know i'm not really utilitarian so i'm certainly not an
*  expert on the best way to be utilitarian but i think that the the feeling is that no simply ranking
*  good and bad things is not good enough because the whole point of utilitarianism is to try to
*  provide a way of comparing situations where you do have many little goods versus one big good
*  and the idea of utilitarianism is is very much sympathetic to the idea that in some circumstances
*  many little goods can be better than one big good so you need a way to be able to figure out
*  exactly how many little goods you need to overcome the joy of one big good right so therefore just
*  ranking the goods is not going to be enough you need a way to quantify them that's what makes it
*  utilitarianism now that might not be your philosophy that's okay maybe you're not a
*  utilitarian and you want to think some other way but i think that it's very plausible that there
*  are circumstances where an ordinary person would say yes i like these small goods in their collective
*  goodness better than this one singular good okay that's just a comparison people need to be able
*  to make one way or the other even if it's not simply from adding up some utility you have to
*  be able to do that comparison and simply ranking goods in some order is not going to be able not
*  going to be good enough to do that andrew goldstein says do you regard gender as a social
*  construct construct and do you think it is founded on a post-modernism view of reality adding little
*  to analytical or empirical knowledge uh yeah i absolutely think of gender as a social construct
*  almost everything that we talk about is a social construct tables and chairs are social constructs
*  you know the earth and jupiter are social constructs those are social constructs that
*  refer to something real in the world but before human beings there was no such word out there as
*  planet or table or anything like that these ideas these concepts are ways that human beings divide
*  up the world into stuff and those ways of dividing the world up into stuff might be
*  more or less helpful or useful for the purposes of human beings but they are nevertheless ideas
*  that people came up with they were constructed by society okay so social construct doesn't mean
*  made up or illusory or fake if you listen to the podcast we did with sally haslinger she will
*  explain exactly that so gender is absolutely one of the things that is a social construct
*  and that's that's not surprising it's the least surprising thing in the world so i don't know
*  what you mean by founded on a post-modernism view of reality adding little to analytical or
*  empirical knowledge i think that the if anything if you want to sort of really oversimplify the
*  idea of post-modernism which was sort of a collection of many different things and impossible to
*  simplify it was pointing out the fact that reality may or may not exist but our ways of talking about
*  reality are ways that we invent and that's an important distinction and one that should not be
*  elided because it gives people a way of manipulating reality and maybe you don't want to let them do
*  that but admitting that it happens when you invent language is kind of an important step to not
*  letting them do that so post-modernists were not saying at least sometimes they were not saying
*  that we can just say whatever we want that was never the idea of post-modernism but it was
*  appreciating the role that human choices make and human desires and goals have when it comes to how
*  we choose to conceptualize reality and i think that insight can be very very important when it's
*  used correctly michael koppelman says can you explain what you mean when you say we quantize
*  things it implies to me you make discrete in some way yet you say things like space and time are not
*  discrete so what's going on yeah this is a very good question that just arises from the fact that
*  the word quantize is a very very inappropriate word once again physicists using words in ways
*  that are not always immediately transparent so quantizing has nothing whatsoever to do
*  with making discrete quantum mechanics doesn't have anything fundamentally doing to do with
*  making things discrete and if anything it's the opposite quantum mechanics turns everything into
*  waves okay but then those waves find themselves under certain circumstances with certain discrete
*  set of wavelengths you know just like the waves that you make when you pluck a violin string or
*  guitar have a fundamental frequency and then overtones or harmonics same thing with the waves
*  that we find that are wave functions of particles and atoms or things like that so even though
*  quantum mechanics says the world is fundamentally mentally made of waves there are aspects of it
*  that appear quantize be quantized because of the specific shapes that those waves have so when we
*  say we quantize things we do not mean at all we make it discrete we just mean we take a classical
*  system and we correspond it correspond it it's not exactly the word we associate it with a quantum
*  theory it is not a very well defined procedure actually there's there are ambiguities there
*  but the idea is that we can start with a classical model and turn it into a quantum mechanical model
*  that's what a physicist mean when it says we quantize something. Dale Echo says I have health
*  anxiety that causes me to have panic attacks gives me hypochondria etc. I love physics but have noticed
*  it can be a trigger for me I was watching a video on null geodesics and I got a sense of existential
*  dread that led to a panic attack just from the enormity of space and limits of my mortality
*  when it comes to exploring it. Is anxiety something you've ever had and is there anything you can do
*  to come to terms with how we as humans fit into something that exists at such an immense scale?
*  Well I think it's a complicated question you know I don't want to get into advising other people on
*  their anxieties and things like that I think that's a personal thing that you should talk
*  with with professionals and loved ones and so forth. I'm sorry to hear about panic attacks etc.
*  That is a shame and I don't really have any great way of dealing with it. I have had much
*  milder than that worries sometimes about the existential issues that come up when one thinks
*  about the cosmos and its enormity and I've often told the story of when I was young trying to go
*  to sleep and eventually coming across the question while I was just thinking about physics or whatever
*  like what if the universe hadn't even existed and that would be it. That would make me worry and
*  feel like I was small and insignificant but that was a long time ago. I don't really feel like that
*  anymore. I think it is the universe we live in. I think that anxiety if we're get to the point
*  where we can be perfectly rational about it there is no rational reason to feel anxious because this
*  is our world. This is just what the world is. It's something that should be accepted. We are very
*  very tiny compared to the world. Our lifetimes are very very short compared to the world. That
*  shouldn't be a sense of anxiety. That should just be a source of anxiety. That should just be something
*  that we learn and I want to say that we sort of cherish and learn to appreciate but even that
*  is kind of a choice. If you don't want to cherish it that's fine but it is absolutely
*  something that we should accept one way or the other. I unfortunately don't have any great advice
*  on how to do that if you're struggling with it. Sorry about that. I wish I could be more help.
*  Nitin Dhananjayan says what do you believe is the biggest societal problem today? How do you go about
*  addressing the problem? What do you wish people did differently with respect to the problem?
*  I don't know. The problem with this question is that it depends on what you mean by a societal
*  problem. I'm kind of worried about nuclear war that we already talked about before or bioterrorism
*  or a giant sun flare that taking out the entire power grid on the earth. There's a whole bunch of
*  things that we can worry about not to mention global warming and things like that but those are
*  not specifically societal problems. I think if I have to say anything about societal problems,
*  remember the podcast with Brad DeLong where we talked about the changes in humanity due to the
*  long 20th century's innovations, one of which was globalization and the others that he highlights
*  are the modern corporation and the research laboratory. Globalization has had many,
*  many benefits. Brad's whole book is called slouching toward utopia because the irony that
*  he points to is the fact that we for the first time in human history in some sense gave ourselves
*  the capacity to create utopia but then certainly did not do it in very, very obvious ways.
*  I think that, I don't know if this is just cheap philosophizing or theorizing but again,
*  certainly not an expert in this, I think that people dimly perceive that as a human race,
*  we have generated an enormous amount of wealth over the last one or two hundred years and not
*  everyone is participating in this wealth. I'm not primarily talking about inequality. I think that
*  there's problems with inequality but I don't mind the existence of rich people. I mind the existence
*  of people who are not rich. I mind the fact that not everyone is rich. That's what I mind.
*  I wouldn't mind if some people were much richer than others if everyone were rich but not everyone
*  is rich. There are people in the world today who are super duper poor even in advanced societies
*  that should be able to do better and it's not even sort of total amount of material goods that is the
*  problem. It's the feeling of powerlessness that I think is the problem. If I had to pick a single
*  societal problem, it's the fact that we have arranged things in our society where too many
*  people feel there's nothing they can do to control their environment. They are subject to
*  forces that are much greater than themselves and either politically or economically or culturally
*  things are sort of out of their control and this is reflected in the fact that they maybe are not
*  doing so well off economically but also that they're in debt. It's not just that they're
*  not getting a lot of income but even if they get income it goes to paying off a debt whether it's
*  college student loans which hopefully we're getting rid of some of them here in the U.S. but then
*  we'll just get more generation later but other kinds of debt also mortgages and things like that
*  and it all feeds into this idea that when you're under debt you're beholden to other people and
*  you're not in control of yourself. Jobs are changing. I do believe that it's kind of inevitable
*  that when we have progress and economic growth the set of jobs that are available for people to have
*  will not be the same from generation to generation. That's inevitable and that's okay. We have to
*  learn to deal with it but dealing with it is hard and when you feel like you can't be gainfully
*  employed and make a career out of the kind of job that you grew up imagining you would someday have
*  that is an issue that we haven't done a lot of good in addressing. People get sick, they can't
*  control their health care, they lose a lot of money. I think you know there's just a lot of
*  ways in which modern society has figured out to suck the resources from a large number of people
*  and funnel it to a small number of people and again if that were in some John Rawlsian sense
*  if that process were to the better of everyone that would be fine but it's clearly not and so I think
*  that people's lack of control over their own lives in various aspects is probably the biggest
*  societal problem we have. It leads to things like less faith in democracy and I think that is
*  potentially super duper disastrous. James Acheson says does the ever at many worlds interpretation
*  have implications for practical reason and morality should I be more prudent if billions of future me's
*  will enjoy the future I make? Well so I don't think that Everett has many if any implications
*  for practical reason and morality so roughly speaking the way that I would put it is
*  quantum mechanics means that observers, agents, human beings, people cannot predict the future
*  exactly okay there is a lack of determinism in the real world there are certain things that are just
*  going to be probabilistic but it doesn't really matter for purposes of practical reason and morality
*  whether those probabilities come from many worlds or for some other interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  there is a metaphysical difference because in many worlds there will be worlds in which the different
*  outcomes all happen with probability one whereas in a single universe with stochastic laws there's
*  only a single universe and all you can say about it is the probability of certain things happening
*  in it but if you are either a deontologist or a consequentialist I don't see necessarily what that
*  metaphysical difference does to your moral or ethical or practical calculations I think that
*  you know in terms of the most obvious example is just being a utilitarian clearly it seems to me
*  if I branch the wave function in two I should not double the utility of the universe that would mean
*  that the most moral thing to do in the world is just branching the wave function of the universe
*  which seems completely silly because literally no one else would even notice it if I was like in a
*  lab measuring a lot of quantum mechanical particles or something like that clearly it would be smarter
*  to divide the utility in pieces and divide it up between the different universes just like we divide
*  energy or something like that in which case the total energy is conserved likewise the total
*  utility is conserved when you when you branch the wave function of the universe and to that extent
*  there's no effect that many worlds has on practical reason and morality and thought of it in another
*  way so I'm a little confused by the way James when you say billions of future me's I'm not
*  exactly sure what that means but I think I don't like it I think that this is saying you know in
*  again a single universe ontology you're thinking of your future self and many worlds has big
*  metaphysical implications it says there are many future people who count your present self as their
*  past self and but they're different people again this is what I always say about many worlds all
*  those people are different but they're all thinner in a very quantitative sense you know the worlds
*  they live in are tinier fractions of the net total of the world out there so I don't think it's a good
*  thing to think of them as billions of future copies of yourself in a way that is distinguishable from
*  many possible copies of yourself that have different probabilities of experiencing different
*  things in a single universe version of quantum mechanics having said all that as I say in
*  something deeply hidden if you want to try to cook up something to cook up a version of ethics
*  or morality for which many worlds does have an implication you can do that and the way that I
*  came up with is you know imagine that you you had some ethical principle that said a certain kind of
*  thing is just absolutely bad in the sense that it's not okay if it ever ever ever happens like this
*  is a completely silly example but what if when you measure the spin of a particle that would be
*  50 50 in conventional quantum mechanics you had an ethical principle that if anyone ever measured
*  spin up that would be an entirely impermissible moral disaster to measure spin up obviously this
*  is a bad example okay but keep that in mind the point is that if that were your moral principle
*  you would behave differently in many worlds versus a purely stochastic version of quantum
*  mechanics because in the stochastic version you would say there's a 50 chance this impermissible
*  thing happens and a 50 chance it doesn't so that's bad I don't want to do it but okay at least there's
*  a 50 chance that it doesn't happen whereas in many worlds there's a hundred percent chance that the
*  bad thing happens in one world and a hundred percent chance it doesn't happen in another world
*  but if your moral principle is if it ever happens that is an impermissible disaster then many worlds
*  says don't ever measure that spin okay whereas in the stochastic world there's only a 50 chance
*  that this really doesn't that this really happens this terrible thing again this is entirely cooked
*  up just to give you a way that many worlds could matter and that's why I think it doesn't matter
*  but maybe I don't know a future theory of morality lets us realize that it is actually like that
*  somehow and many worlds does matter Jessica Napier says what was your upbringing like you seem to
*  have an endless amount of curiosity and fearlessness about trying out ideas making guesses and adjusting
*  and so on without your ego getting bruised along the way I think my ego gets bruised all the time
*  but I do think it's important Jessica to make guesses and adjust and so on and she continues
*  as a primary school teacher these are attributes I try to encourage in my students but sometimes
*  they want to be told what to think or they're so afraid of getting the answer wrong their curiosity
*  shuts down do the adults in your life play a role in bringing out these great qualities
*  you know I don't know I had various great helpful adults in my life but I think of this particular
*  aspect of not being too afraid of being wrong as far as I know this was just my idea not anything
*  that I got as a particular lesson from anyone else but you know and I don't want to sort of
*  personalize it too much in the sense that I don't think it the right way to get out I agree with
*  the problem I agree that students are afraid of getting the answer wrong they want to be told what
*  to think etc these are absolutely true aspects of students and I think that it would be better if
*  we could somehow encourage them to do otherwise but I don't necessarily think that the right way
*  to conceptualize how to do that is let's get the right adults telling them to do it you know the
*  the system is kind of set up to make them think that way you know we give kids grades and those
*  grades can be very impactful they're high stakes so it's not wrong for the student to care about
*  their grades right and if they care about their grades they don't want to be wrong that's that's
*  what we train them to do when they're very very young they don't know any better and they're happy
*  to like say a lot of things and learn as Judea Pearl said babies are just out there making causal
*  maps of the universe that's what they're doing they're touching things and doing experiments
*  and learning about things and it that gradually becomes harder to do and a lot is it because we
*  don't reward them for doing it so what I would if if this were my goal in life to improve our
*  upbringing of kids in the way to make them more curious what I would do is not look for more
*  inspiring role models from adults but to adjust the system in ways that rewarded curiosity and play
*  without punishing being wrong as often and I and I say that you know without too much conviction
*  because I know that grades are important and they're motivating as well as fear inducing
*  and also you know not everyone can get into graduate school so we need some
*  GPA to look at and things like that right so there are roles for these evaluations it's okay to
*  evaluate people it's not okay to make them afraid of failure and I don't know how to thread that
*  needle perfectly well Tomas Gajos says I'm excited about the launch of the biggest ideas in the
*  universe I'm just reading the simple harmonic oscillator part where you start with a ball
*  rolling on a frictionless parabolic valley but by equation 3.8 you jump to talking about oscillating
*  particles and state that the initial velocity will depend on the mass of the particle represented
*  by the oscillator you could relate it to the initial position and potential by thinking about
*  energy conservation in our ball at in the valley system the maximum speed reached at the okay I'm
*  going to not going to read the whole question it's kind of hard to keep in your mind unless
*  you've read the book the point is I can give the answer very very quickly I'm just trying to help
*  out the book readers here there's a section in the book where I talk about a ball rolling on a hill
*  okay and if it's literally a ball rolling literally on a hill you calculate the potential energy
*  in terms of the height of the hill and there's a formula for the potential energy the potential
*  energy is the mass of the ball times the height of the hill times the acceleration due to gravity m
*  g h I got the order of those wrong but you know what I mean h is the height g is the acceleration
*  m is the mass of the particle and then the kinetic energy is one half mv squared so the total energy
*  has just an overall factor of m out there and it actually turns out not to matter so that's that's
*  where the origin of this question is coming from why should it depend on the mass but very often
*  physicists will change variables to something more convenient so rather than writing mgh mass
*  acceleration to gravity height they will just write v of x okay so they're absorbing the mass
*  and the acceleration due to gravity times the height into one thing called the potential at
*  every point and then the potential energy at every point itself doesn't depend on the mass
*  okay because we absorbed it in there so when you're writing in terms of those variables you cannot
*  simply take out the mass from the whole thing and treat it as an irrelevant external parameter
*  it will enter into your equations so you can choose to do it that way or not it's up to you
*  but depending on which variables you use the answer will or will not depend on the mass in some way
*  okay i'm going to combine two questions together nicolas chapman says why is the electron charge
*  quantized and francis day asks i listened to a podcast about the electron today that is great
*  people are listening to podcasts about the electron that's my editorial comment here
*  one of the physicists on it said that the question of why the electron has a negative charge that
*  exactly matches the positive charge on a proton is still a mystery and it struck me that the other
*  time this question is relevant is that the big bang where the matter anti-matter asymmetry problem
*  is not yet explained is there any chance that these two things could be related could positrons
*  have become quarks and balance things out well so let me answer first the why is the electron charge
*  quantized question because it depends on what you mean by quantized i mean obviously every
*  electron has the same charge that's one aspect of quantization and that's actually very answerable
*  it's because what electrons are is excitations in the electron field there's a famous story
*  about richard feinman and john wheeler where wheeler calls up feinman in the middle of the
*  night and says i know why all the electrons had the same charge it's because they're all the same
*  electron and this was the origin of his idea that you could think of positrons as electrons moving
*  backward in time people love to tell that story but it's not right wheeler was not correct it's
*  not all the same electron they're all vibrations in the electron field feinman and wheeler were
*  kind of wondering in the back of their minds these are still the early days of quantum field theory
*  whether they could do better than quantum field theory and replace it with a theory of particles
*  but these days no we know that it really is the field that is driving everything and the reason why
*  all electrons have the same charge because they're all part of the electron field but that is not
*  enough to tell you why the charge in the electron field is exactly equal in magnitude and opposite
*  in sign to the charge in the proton field or the combined charges of the two up quarks and the down
*  quark that go into making a proton that is something that we don't have the once and for all final
*  answer for in the 1970s and 80s when a lot of work was put into developing grand unified theories
*  where you would unify the electroweak force with the strong nuclear force
*  one of the nice things about those theories is they could provide an answer to why electrons and
*  protons have the same but opposite charges because they were part of a unified story to tell but we
*  don't know if grand unified theories are true maybe they're not so there's other possibilities
*  out there there are something called anomalies in the gauge symmetries of particle physics that seem
*  to give you give you relationships between the charges of different particles i'm not
*  i forget whether we that's enough i don't think that's enough to say that protons and electrons
*  have to have the same charge but there's a relationship between them if you want the
*  anomalies to cancel but that's only one sort of relationship so you could add new particles in
*  there and change it in different ways so i think that the answer is we're not sure yet about that
*  as far as matter anti-matter asymmetry i don't think that that's the same problem they may in
*  some way be related but only because they're problems that we don't know the answer to and
*  you know we don't know what the initial conditions were at the early universe both grand unified
*  theories and other theories of beyond the standard model particle physics like neutrino masses and so
*  forth may end up being very important for explaining the matter anti-matter asymmetry
*  and they may also be important for explaining the charges on the proton and the electron
*  beyond that i would not want to say very much specific larz says i listen to several popular
*  science podcasts and also follow a few youtube channels it seems to me that most of this content
*  is within the realm of physics and natural sciences with some philosophy and maybe ai research here
*  and there what do you think it is that makes these topics so appealing and interesting to
*  the general public i mean i want to say because they're really cool physics natural sciences
*  philosophy ai research that many things are cool of course if you look at youtube or podcasts
*  overall science of any sort is not dominating anybody's list right there's a lot more murder
*  or self-help podcasts out there than there are science podcasts i mean maybe the question is
*  different kinds of science biology or chemistry or material science versus cosmology big questions
*  kind of things and part of it is you have to give the people something interesting you can't just
*  complain that there's more of one than the other i know you're not making this complaint but there
*  are people who complain you know why doesn't my particular subfield of science get more attention
*  in the popular media so you got to kind of go out there and do it it might be true i don't actually
*  know that this is correct but it might be true that the kind of people who like those kinds of
*  science are also oriented or at least interested in popularizing it right sharing it broadly
*  that might be part of it i don't know the other part might just be that you don't need a lot of
*  background to appreciate questions like where did the universe come from or will a computer become
*  intelligent someday right those are easy questions to ask it goes back to physics being simple in
*  some way so i don't know i don't i don't actually complain about this kind of thing i don't i don't
*  worry about that especially because i think that in terms of getting new people interested in science
*  it almost doesn't matter what kind of science they become interested in you can ask a lot of
*  graduate students doing physics what first got them interested in science and even if they're
*  doing atomic physics or plasma physics or whatever it might very well have been the elegant universe
*  by brian green talking about string theory or just watching science fiction shows or something
*  like that it's the idea of science and chasing down these big questions and trying to answer
*  them that gets people interested almost irrespective of what the actual subject matter is douglas long
*  says we just rolled in to visit my son in pasadena just north of caltech this is the first time we
*  will walk across the campus for pete's without the possibility of running into you so i can now ask
*  this question just wondering if if that were to happen would you welcome a hello from one of your
*  patrons i always planned on just giving you a curt nod if it ever happened sure i'm very happy to
*  say hi to anyone who supports mindscape on patreon i'm even happy to say hi to those listeners out
*  there who don't support on patreon that's how generous i am i mean i'm probably doing something
*  and don't have a lot of time to uh chit chat or discuss one's favorite interpretation of quantum
*  mechanics but certainly very very happy just to say hi uh and you know look i greatly appreciate
*  that there are listeners and that there are supporters i think it's wonderful and i try to
*  do the best job i can so that you enjoy it and very happy to get feedback on that
*  olafur schoolie mcgneson says does anti-matter appear naturally here on earth yeah absolutely
*  i think that sometimes people get an idea that anti-matter is mysterious or uh hard to find or
*  something like that it's really not you know anti-matter was first discovered by carl anderson
*  in cosmic rays but the cosmic rays themselves were not anti-matter there were high energy protons
*  that are cosmic rays coming down and hitting the atmosphere and creating a shower of elementary
*  particles some of which were positrons anti-electrons and some of which were muons
*  and anti-muons also so that's one obvious source of course in some sense that's coming from the
*  sky but many kinds of radioactivity give off anti-matter particles there's the rare rare rare
*  event where you can give off a positron but it's extremely common for radioactive decays to give
*  off anti-neutrinos so yeah anti-matter appears here on earth all the time it doesn't last very
*  long any individual anti-particle if it's a neutrino it will just escape away if it's a positron it
*  will hit an electron and annihilate but they're definitely produced jason k says geduncan experiment
*  you are living you are a living being whose entire existence is within a black hole the
*  everyday reality of your universe is ruled by quantum physics would an equal equally civilization
*  like an equally advanced civilization i suppose this means uh as ours discover classical physics
*  and four-dimensional space time outside the black hole so two things one is as we said earlier
*  there's plenty of classical physics inside the black hole there's absolutely no reason to think
*  that somehow the world is more obviously quantum mechanical just because you're inside a black
*  hole you wouldn't even notice if the black hole were big enough you would have an end date you
*  have an expiration date much like you would if the universe were collapsing to a big crunch
*  but the other thing is you know in some sense would you be able to extrapolate to the outside
*  of the black hole well sure for one thing you can see it right light can come in from outside the
*  black hole and be observed by you and your telescope you are inside the black hole looking
*  to the external world and you can see outside the black hole no problem you just can't get there
*  before you hit the singularity the final thing is that you know in some sense this is what we do all
*  the time in science we discover local laws of physics and we extrapolate them to the regimes
*  that we don't see in some sense it's like talking about the multiverse or something like that we
*  have laws of physics equations that we believe and trust because we test them within the regime we
*  can test them and then we say if they continue to be true in other regimes that it implies this
*  other stuff right so four-dimensional space time outside the black hole would be part of that of
*  course again it's not exactly the same in this case because in the black hole you can just see
*  it directly but the idea of believing the laws of physics that you believe are true is one that
*  applies in many different sets of circumstances Jonathan Goodson says I've devised a different
*  quantum interpretation that in my uneducated opinion addresses the measurement problem explains
*  the two-slit experiment and cures world hunger okay maybe some exaggeration there I realize that
*  the odds are overwhelming that the interpretation is mistaken but I'm still eager to have it reviewed
*  by someone knowledgeable I have no personal contacts in the world of physics or academia
*  I'm not asking that you critique the interpretation since I don't think that's what you intend AMAs to
*  be but if you were me what strategy would you adopt to find a professional who'd be willing to
*  look over your idea honestly when people ask me questions like that I usually just point them to
*  the internet there are absolutely forums out there Quora is one there's certain forums on Reddit
*  there's just physics forums if you just go to google and look for physics forums there are people
*  who are interested in talking about physics of course it's the internet so you can't always
*  believe that your interlocutor is on the ball you'll get a wide range of people with different
*  levels of expertise but you might find people who are willing to talk to you and discuss the idea
*  but you know let me say the other thing and I hope this is taken in the spirit in which it's intended
*  what are the chances that if you're not an expert you have come up with a good quantum
*  interpretation that none of the experts have come up with right are you reading
*  foundations of physics in the British journal of the philosophy of science have you figured out
*  and learned about all the known interpretations of quantum mechanics whether it's many worlds or
*  pilot wave theories or cubism or objective collapse models or relational quantum mechanics
*  have you been reading the literature and listened to talks online about people debating the relative
*  merits of these things you know if so then it sounds like you are pretty educated and if not
*  then why are you asking experts to critique your interpretation right I mean you haven't done the
*  work to understand what is already understandable so you know I think that a lot of people faced
*  with problems in physics make a leap to saying well I'm going to solve this problem in physics
*  which is fine it's a good ambitious ambition to have but it's much more productive to first learn
*  everything you can right to really do the work if you're going to ask other people to do the work
*  to understand your stuff then your responsibility is to do the work to understand their stuff
*  first and so I think that once you do that you'll be able to critique it yourself which is much more
*  useful than asking random people on the internet to do it Keith says JJ Reddick's podcast has had
*  some great interviews with the 76ers stars Joel Embiid and recently with former star Ben Simmons
*  JJ pointed out that Ben Simmons despite the extreme criticism he has faced for his shooting
*  led the NBA by far in three-point shot creation for others on top of being an elite defender and
*  all the other things that are not specifically shooting what are some of the analogous phenomena
*  in physics research where some individual metric like citations is important but maybe overweighted
*  at the expense of other contributions mentoring good public communication etc yeah that's a great
*  question I think that the way that it would be more you you phrase it in a very clever and fun
*  way the sort of more standard down-to-earth way of phrasing it is what kind of academics are good
*  citizens not just producing their own work but helping other kinds of work and I think that that
*  extends like you mentioned mentoring and good public communication but even to the writing of
*  papers you know I remember once in there was a study that was done in astronomy it was this was
*  decades ago but it was who was acknowledged the most who was given thanks the most in the largest
*  number of papers published in the astrophysical journal right I do think that is extremely
*  important as part of the system that creates good scientific results I think that we far over
*  emphasize the specific contributions or achievements of this or that individual person
*  and completely forget about the huge support system that goes into doing this whether it's
*  having your own students in your group your postdocs helping you having colleagues that can help you
*  etc so I think that when it comes to promoting hiring acknowledging the work of scientists
*  and other kinds of academics it would be better we'd all be better off if more effort were given
*  or more consideration were given attention were given to being a good citizen being the kind of
*  person who not only does good work but makes other people's work even better having said that it's
*  really hard to quantify right I mean it's even hard to quantify research success but at least
*  citations are something it's not it's very far from perfect but at least it's a little bit of
*  a measure on how much impact you've had whereas helping other people to come up with high
*  citable papers is something is very very hard to quantify so I think that you just have to face up
*  to the challenge of that okay it's hard to quantify still you got to do it you got to try to do it I
*  think that that is very important and you know that is one of the reasons why when people are
*  hired or promoted etc we don't just look at their list of publications and their citations we also
*  ask for expert opinions letters of recommendation or letters of evaluation from people who are well
*  known in the field and they can say things like this person has been a good citizen making things
*  happen in various ways so I agree with the spirit of the question which is that helping others in
*  those ways is a crucial part of getting science done at the top levels Marco Tausser says as I
*  understand it decoherence is nothing more than entanglement run amok moreover little things
*  decohere all the time as they entangle with their environments and yet wise people yourself included
*  talk about entanglement being a precious resource usually in the context of quantum information
*  what gives how can it be precious and also common as dirt yeah this is a very good question I'm glad
*  you are asking it and the short answer is decoherence is not just entanglement
*  decoherence is entanglement with the environment okay so the background picture we have here is
*  that there are systems where we can actually exactly talk about what part of the system is
*  doing what thing and then there's the environment which is sort of everything else in the universe
*  that kind of is a the noise in the background that you keep bumping into the air in the room the
*  photons in the room you know various things would count as the environment it's a little bit
*  subjective what counts as the system what counts as the environment but I think the way to think
*  about it is for different problems you would be interested in you might be able to pinpoint for
*  this context here's the system I'm thinking about here is the environment so decoherence is not just
*  entanglement decoherence is entanglement with the environment and typically if you're doing things
*  in the standard way the environment has many many many degrees of freedom right the photons in a
*  room there's a lot of photons out there and what that means is that when you become entangled with
*  the environment that's usually an irreversible process there are too many moving parts in the
*  environment so that you can't undo it you cannot control it you've lost control it's like scrambling
*  an egg hard to unscramble the egg right and in fact literally the entropy goes up when you become
*  entangled with the environment so that's a kind of entanglement decoherence that is irreversible
*  and this is why in the many worlds version of quantum mechanics it represents a branching
*  of the wave function because different parts of your system are now separated from each other by
*  being entangled with their environment whereas the entanglement that is considered to be a
*  precious resource is entanglement between different parts of your system different parts that you're
*  trying to keep track of that you're crucially interested in so if you have a quantum computer
*  you have some qubits okay and you're supposed to be able to read out the qubits it's not avogadro's
*  number of particles just bumping into each other in some thermal state it's a specific set of
*  variables that you can measure and you want those to be entangled in a very specific way that you
*  can then control manipulate you know run an algorithm on the quantum computer and the one
*  of the deep issues here is that we don't generally get into talking about this but remember earlier
*  on in the ama i mentioned that uh what whether a state is entangled or not depends on how you
*  divide that state up into subsystems right and so it's not like there are entangled states and
*  unentangled states there are subsystems of states that are entangled or not and in fact it goes
*  beyond that if you have if you think of the environment as basically performing a measurement
*  okay which is again what many worlds would do and i think that what any other even if it's not many
*  worlds any sensible version of quantum mechanics would think of becoming entangled with the
*  environment becoming decohered as effectively performing a measurement then you can break
*  the entanglement that other subsystems have if you have once you do a measurement if you have you
*  know two particles that are entangled with each other okay uh and so let's say their spins are
*  anti-aligned so you don't know what either spin is but you know that the spin of one is opposite
*  the spin of the other but then you measure the spin of one so now it is not entangled with the
*  other one anymore you have broken that entanglement it's still correlated because you've measured the
*  spin of one and you know what the spin of the other one is but there's no entanglement because
*  the whole thing is not in a superposition anymore you just have one spin pointing one direction the
*  other spin pointing the other direction no quantum mechanical connection between them so that process
*  of becoming entangled with the environment actually breaks the entanglement between other
*  parts of your system and that can be bad if you're trying to keep that entanglement there as part of
*  a quantum computation or something like that. Tarun says congratulations on the recent launch
*  of your new book I imagine that this is this is perfectly suited to someone like me who wishes
*  to go beyond the popular science treatment of modern physics but did not study the subject
*  at university however I read the first two books in Leonard Susskind's theoretical minimum series
*  on classical mechanics and quantum mechanics and I'm currently working my way through the third on
*  special relativity and classical field theory how do your biggest ideas books compare and would you
*  still recommend them to someone in my position so unsurprisingly yes I would still recommend them
*  you know I know Susskind's books very well Leonard Susskind former mindscape guest I even
*  blurbed at least the first one maybe others as well yeah others as well I do I'm pretty sure
*  that's true and they're great I can highly recommend them Lenny is a master of the material
*  but the spirit of those books is a little bit different I mean they're similar to my books
*  in that they're trying to teach you physics from the ground up and they do the equations
*  but Lenny's is more like a conventional physics course just sort of softened up a little bit
*  for people who are not necessarily going to become physics majors or something like that
*  they're still teaching you a lot of the down-to-earth manipulations that you would need
*  to try to solve the equations and all that entails whereas my books are really just trying to get to
*  the good stuff just teaching the ideas not trying to teach you the manipulations you would need to
*  be a professional physicist and therefore we get to go much faster we can we can on the one hand
*  dwell on some of the deep philosophical issues and on the other hand just still get very far
*  very quickly so I think that Lenny has a new book coming out in the theoretical minimum series on
*  general relativity which is like book I don't know four or five in this in the series I'm not sure
*  but general relativity is in my book one because we can just go much faster and so there's only
*  going to be three books in mine there will be plenty of things in my book that are just not
*  going to be in his again because we can go faster so not dwelling on how to diagonalize a Hamiltonian
*  or anything like that in book two we're just going to do quantum field theory and renormalization
*  and in book three we're going to do complexity and emergence and it's really just giving you
*  a glimpse of the ideas of modern physics in the quickest and most digestible way so if you think
*  that's interesting I'd recommend buying the books Peter Galay says we hear a lot lately about the
*  dangers of human extinction but the world is rife with human anguish and agony if extinction would
*  mean an end to suffering for all time is there a case to be made that extinction might be the more
*  more moral choice you know there's always a case to be made but I think in this case the the case
*  is pretty terrible for one thing I don't agree that the world is rife with human anguish and agony
*  at least if that's the end of your sentence I think that the world is also rife with joy and
*  triumph and human accomplishment and furthermore there might be a lot more of that in the future
*  you know I have a good time making a podcast I don't want the world to end and human humankind
*  to be extinguished so that I can't make my podcast anymore that is one very very tiny consideration
*  but it's the kind of consideration that you multiply by several billion and I think there's
*  a very good case to be made that extinction would be bad if nothing else even if people really were
*  all miserable extinction removes the chance of any change in the future right so even if you
*  were much more serious about saying that humankind had just you know no joy in it whatsoever I think
*  that it would still be true that you should not extinguish it because maybe there that will happen
*  further down the road and you don't want to eliminate that possibility Sandro Stuckey says
*  if the large scale structure of the universe arose out of quantum fluctuations near the big bang
*  does that mean according to the many worlds interpretation that there's an infinite number
*  of universes each with a different large scale structure corresponding to a different quantum
*  eigenstate and if so what caused the superposition of all these states to deco here so I want to clean
*  up a couple things here it's a different quantum state it's not a different quantum eigenstate not
*  all quantum states are eigenstates eigenstates is a specific kind of quantum state that has a
*  definite value of a certain observable quantity so you can have an eigenstate of energy or an
*  eigenstate of position but the generic state is not an eigenstate of any familiar well-known
*  observable so that's one thing but yes but the basic answer is yeah oh sorry the other thing is
*  it may it might not be an infinite number of universes there could be a lot of universes but
*  whether the number of universes is infinite is a technical thing that we don't really know about
*  but the basic answer the question is yes if you believe in many worlds and you think that the
*  origin of cosmic perturbations is in quantum fluctuations in the early universe as it would
*  be true in the inflationary universe scenario but also in other scenarios then yeah there are
*  absolutely are other universes out there where the distribution of quantum fluctuations was
*  different so the distribution of specific galaxies and stars and things like that is completely
*  different from branch to branch of the wave function so what caused superposition to decohere
*  you know it's the same thing as always does the environment whatever you count that to be you
*  could just say all the photons in the microwave background there you go that's an environment
*  you're not keeping track of all those photons i actually wrote a paper with kim body and jason
*  pollock on the how this works out during inflation how things decohere with each other because
*  as usual lots of physicists are kind of slapdash in their applications of quantum mechanics so
*  in the discourse about inflation they often treat different regions with different values of quantum
*  fluctuations as sort of as if they were magically being measured by something right but they're not
*  of course being magically measured but they are decohering so you have to sort of sit down and
*  think about what is decohering and what is the environment and there's various things that act
*  as an environment you know modes of all the quantum fields outside your horizon can act
*  as an environment short scale modes of photons and things like that inside your horizon connect
*  as the environment so there's various things that will cause you to decohere at some point
*  and one should mention that there is something called the decoherent histories formalism that
*  was created by people like griffiths and omnis and hartl and gelman and what they try to do is
*  address this fuzziness that arises in thinking about decoherence as being entanglement with the
*  environment under conditions when you don't necessarily know what the environment is so they
*  give a more general and robust definition of what it means for different histories of the universe
*  to decohere that doesn't require a specific carving out of the environment versus the system
*  they will get the same answers in the cases where it works but it's a little bit more general high
*  powered formalism so it can be done if that's what you want to do frank layman says what is it
*  about the universe that the second derivative of position tends to be really important but the
*  third derivative not so much basically the moment you introduce me to jerk which is the third
*  derivative of position i wanted to know why i haven't heard more about this concept same goes
*  even more for snap crackle and pop those are the fourth fifth and sixth derivatives with respect
*  to time can you imagine a physical application of crackle that isn't trivial or designed just
*  to get a bewildered chuckle out of undergrads there's two different questions here but they're
*  both good so i'm gonna i'm gonna tackle them both um for the the latter question physical application
*  of crackle you know i i sort of make fun of snap crackle and pop and i did that in the biggest ideas
*  in the universe videos and several people chimed in in the comments and correctly pointed out that
*  even if physicists don't care about this engineers often do there's sort of different physical
*  effects in you know a train or an airplane or whatever depending on not just the acceleration
*  but all the higher derivatives of acceleration also so i absolutely can imagine physical
*  applications of these ideas now the deeper question about why the universe cares about
*  the second derivative of position namely the acceleration but not the third derivative
*  you know the cheap answer to that is the laws of physics as isaac newton handed them to us and more
*  or less we're following in his footsteps here say that the state of a system is given by the position
*  and the velocity so if you can have a formula that helps you figure out the acceleration you
*  know everything right and that formula for newton is f equals ma forces mass times acceleration you
*  don't need anything beyond that but you do need position and velocity and the reason why is because
*  there's no absolute position or absolute velocity right everywhere in the universe the laws of
*  physics are the same at any velocity relative to something else the laws of physics are the same
*  that is not true for acceleration acceleration is the first of these quantities where you can
*  absolutely measure it right you know whether you're being accelerated or not according to
*  traditional classical physics now you're still allowed to say okay why is traditional classical
*  physics like that that's a more subtle question and i think that the thing to say is here's the
*  way in which it is subtle if you have a set of differential equations so equations like the
*  equations of motion for classical mechanics you can always write them as purely first derivative
*  equations you never have to use the second derivative and in fact this is exactly what
*  hamiltonian mechanics does so rather than saying you have x for position and x dot is velocity and
*  x double dot is acceleration where dot means derivative with respect to time you can just say
*  i define y equals x dot and then rather than having x double dot is the acceleration y dot is the
*  acceleration and all of your equations for both x and y have no more than first derivatives in them
*  now there's no second derivatives anywhere so you can absolutely do that for ordinary classical
*  mechanics you never need second derivatives you can write them all as first order equations first
*  derivative equations but then the question is why is it also useful to write them as equations with
*  second order in derivatives and that's basically the question of why do we live in position space
*  not in momentum space why do we treat position and momentum so differently that's a highly
*  non-trivial question that nobody knows the answer to i have some ideas but it's one we usually just
*  take for granted rather than trying to solve saraj rajan says what are your thoughts on the
*  idea of humanity evolving into virtual minds proposed by hbo's westworld i haven't followed
*  westworld that much since the first couple of seasons so i'm not quite sure what is what is
*  happening there you know i'm i am a believer that consciousness can arise in all sorts of different
*  substrates so i have no trouble believing that artificial intelligence could become conscious
*  i do have trouble believing that humanity can evolve into it and that's not because of any
*  mystical specialness of humanity i think that once you are an artificial mind or a virtual mind
*  you will be different than what you and i think of as human i think that human beings are very very
*  not controlled but affected determined um embedded in the fact that we have bodies
*  okay having a body is crucial to being a human being the body not only embodies our our minds
*  and our various metabolic processes it also gives us motivation to do various things we get hungry
*  we get thirsty we get tired right if none of those issues are there in the virtual reality then we're
*  a very different thing than we actual human beings are so i really think that people haven't
*  thought very deeply about what kinds of minds there would be in the virtual world you can always try
*  to mock up a simulation of hunger and thirst and bodies etc and try to make it as human as possible
*  but would you want to do that i mean maybe you don't want to do that i don't know maybe that's
*  just a bad idea and you could come up with a better system so i am not sure that the tv
*  slash movie slash novel idea that we human beings are going to basically transport ourselves more or
*  less unaltered into a virtual realm is the right way of thinking about it paul has says do you
*  think there's a rock bottom fundamental makeup of the universe such as perhaps the quantum wave
*  function or some layer below that or do you think it's more likely that there is no most fundamental
*  construct and instead as the saying goes turtles all the way down well i do think that there is a
*  fundamental rock bottom makeup of the universe there's the universe whatever that is i don't
*  know that we're necessarily close to figuring it out or we might be it might be some kind of wave
*  function it might just be quantum mechanics is the right fundamental framework or it might not be
*  but there's something the universe does right and we might be close to figuring out or not
*  but in principle it's figure outable i think i think that the universe has given us no indication
*  whatsoever that it is somehow unintelligible exactly the opposite the universe has really
*  revealed an enormous number of its secrets to us so i think that whatever the description is i'm
*  not going to say when we're going to find it but i think it's out there lurking somewhere
*  Ezra Parzabok says not sure if you've discussed this important topic publicly but how did the
*  cats do with their move to Baltimore i'm pretty sure i have discussed this topic publicly so i'm
*  not going to dwell on it but you know the cats are doing fine Caliban the boy kitty uh adopted
*  right away he's very very chill Ariel the girl kitty is much more high strong it's taken her a
*  long time she was traumatized by the move and she hid under various blankets and things like that
*  for a long time but now she's almost completely back to normal sadly we're in an apartment and
*  we're going to move again into a house and so there's going to be one more bit of trauma but
*  the house is so nice and has so many big places to run around i'm sure that both kitties are going
*  to be very very happy once that move happens Rob Patro says if i am interested in trying to
*  popularize computer science and spread the good news to a broader audience than the students at
*  my university what advice do you have why do you think physics has been so successful popularization
*  while CS has paled in comparison so i guess i already did say a little bit about this just a
*  minute ago but i don't know i think that CS has been pretty good at popularization i think that
*  people are pretty aware of AI and you know various puzzles in computer science and things like that
*  i don't know how to compare them in any objective way if you're interested in trying to popularize
*  you know again there's a million different ways of doing it i don't think there's any one right
*  format i think that part of the trick to popularization is that different people will
*  respond differently some want to see things on youtube or whatever someone to listen on
*  podcasts someone to read someone to do demonstrations someone it's short and simple someone at long and
*  complicated and you need that kind of pluralistic approach to be successful i have no special
*  advice along these lines because you know i'm actually even though i do a lot of communication
*  etc i am not an an academic expert in the science of communication i think that that is a field that
*  someone can be an expert in i just kind of do what i like doing and hope that the chips fall where
*  they may so i'm not always very helpful to giving other people advice about how they can do it i do
*  think that you know maybe there's some reflection there you know do the things that you would have
*  found interesting right you know do what you want to do and your passion will come through and people
*  will catch on to it doug dougan says is there any area of research that you think should receive
*  more attention conversely do researchers spend too much time on any one topic e.g. the search for
*  subatomic particles i don't think people spend too much time on the search for subatomic particles
*  i think that if you go into typical physics departments that's a minority pursuit as we've
*  been talking about not every subfield within science gets equal publicity so you hear a lot
*  about the search for subatomic particles but that's not what most working physicists are involved in
*  i certainly do think that there are fields that should receive more attention namely all the ones
*  that i'm interested in whether they are foundations of physics or complexity theory or emergence or
*  whatever it is fluctuation theorems and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics i like all
*  those things i think other people should like them too but i get it that not everyone has the
*  same interests i do so again i'm interested in a broad ecosystem where everyone is enthusiastic
*  about their own stuff and we see where it goes now having said that those are all easy things to say
*  at some point the rubber hits the road you have to actually choose who to hire into your physics
*  department right as a member of a physics department that is going to be hiring people
*  i'm part of this conversation and we we the i don't know how clear it is from the outside
*  but the faculty members in the physics departments as in other departments take this responsibility
*  super duper seriously you know we talk to each other what are the fields in which we should grow
*  what are the possibilities of breakthroughs what are the growing young fields what are the fields
*  where we have strength and can do better all of these things are taken very very seriously by
*  grown-up faculty members and so they try to do their judgment as best as they can when it comes to
*  hiring new people etc having said that there is a kind of conservatism among academics right you
*  know there's certain subfields that have been successful and high prestige for a long time
*  and it's very easy to just keep doing those over and over again it is harder to see the value
*  in a field that is sort of a new upstart field right so that's why you know i pointed out when
*  the noble prize just came out for these people who were doing experiments in quantum entanglement
*  these experiments were not super duper high priority when they were originally done okay it
*  was like sort of a niche kind of weird thing and still many people many quantum many physics
*  departments don't have people working in those fields of quantum information quantum experiments
*  entanglement things like that so there is some effort that needs to be put into convincing a
*  bunch of people who've been doing things a certain way for a certain number of decades
*  that they should look at newer areas that are very exciting the the problem is that old areas
*  that are well established have well understood criteria for success right if you're doing
*  experiments in astronomy looking at the cosmic microwave background we know exactly how to do
*  that we know what we're looking for we know what would constitute a wonderful discovery if you're
*  doing experiments in fluctuation theorems and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that's a
*  much smaller area it has not been going on for as long and you have to do some sales pitch to your
*  colleagues in the physics department to say this will be really important someday right and that's
*  kind of okay that's how it's supposed to work there are some things people get enthusiastic about that
*  turn out to be completely useless so you have to make that sales pitch so i would i would like a
*  little bit more of openness to new ideas and young fields but i understand why the arrangement is
*  what it is right now yokim asks a priority question as i understand it each photon from the cmb has
*  been traveling billions of years before reaching us it must have been deflected by all the gravity
*  of the material and energy it came across during its travels i'm aware of the calibration of the
*  cmb effort by backtracking photons through the universe as we know it in light of the discoveries
*  of jwst of large previously unknown structures forming very early in the universe how can we be
*  certain that the distribution of the temperature fluctuation of the cmb is correct and that possible
*  features such as hawking points aren't scrambled by these displacements well this is a very good
*  question but it's a very quantitative question okay the numbers actually matter you know the
*  discoveries from jwst of larger than expected galaxies are still tiny tiny variations from the
*  overall picture right they're still quite compatible with the general idea that the fluctuations in
*  density at early times were very small and have grown over time it's not a major rethinking of
*  the way that we thought about the big bang model or the growth of large-scale structure
*  that's one thing to keep in mind the other is that there will be deflection of light from the cmb by
*  gravitational lensing and things like that in fact i wrote a paper here's an amusing mindscape attached
*  story i wrote a paper when i was a grad student or maybe when i was a postdoc with my grad school
*  colleague ted pine on second order gravitational perturbations of the cosmic microwave background
*  long before anyone had observed these things so by second order we mean there is some
*  grav there's some perturbation to start with and then you perturb it again for example you have
*  some perturbation at the surface of last scattering where you make the cmb and then you perturb it
*  again by traveling through an inhomogeneous universe so we presented one way of actually
*  calculating that maybe not the most computationally efficient way in retrospect but with you know it's
*  important to be first not just to be perfect and so the paper is cited and used and things like that
*  and an example of that is exactly what you're talking about the mixing up of the location of
*  different things by gravitational lensing that's one of the effects that we identified
*  and the mindscape connection there is the ted pine after graduate school he did not pursue an
*  academic career but rather started a band and his band euphonic is the band that whose song is the
*  intro and outro songs for mindscape so the mindscape theme music was composed by ted pine who i also
*  collaborated with on that cmb and isotropy paper but anyway to answer the question a little bit
*  more directly the kinds of deflections that you get through photons passing through gravitational
*  lensing from large-scale structure etc exist but are typically on very small scales so cosmologists
*  know this when you look at cmb fluctuations on very large scales it's irrelevant it's just not a big
*  deal large scales that is to say large angles on the sky most of the work that we've done
*  determining cosmological parameters from cmb observations take advantage of these large
*  scale fluctuations in the cmb the place where the gravitational lensing will be important is for
*  smaller scale perturbations and people know that that's important and they're using that that is
*  one way to learn about the distribution of density fluctuations throughout the history of the universe
*  you know you also even if the initial perturbations that jwst is looking at are
*  bigger than expected they're still not as big as the more modern more recent fluctuations in
*  density with galaxies and clusters and all that stuff so my impression is that most of the relevant
*  lensing happens at later times not at super early times slippery snake says i used to be a moral
*  constructivist but encountered david roberts's explanation for why he quit before finishing his
*  phd in philosophy the main idea being it's not moral principles but moral agents that matter most
*  are agents more important than principles and if so does moral constructivism
*  matter so i'm probably not going to give a satisfactory answer to this but i'll say two
*  things number one i have no idea what it means to be a moral agent unless you have some moral
*  principles like how do we know who the moral agents are i mean i presume a moral agent is one
*  that acts morally according to some principles right so i i just don't get the distinction here
*  and the other one is you know if so does moral constructivism matter again i don't quite see
*  what the relationship there is a moral agent is going to act in some way is that way objectively
*  figured out by reason or by the universe or is it constructed in some more subjective human way so i
*  think that moral constructivism can be completely relevant even if your focus is on moral agents
*  rather than principles now it might be true that there is some way of looking at morality and moral
*  guidelines that is more useful by focusing on moral agents than moral principles that might be
*  true but i just don't know i'm not exactly sure of what david roberts or anyone else
*  is trying to say about that but i don't think there's a deep fundamental distinction there
*  so it might be at best a practical kind of usefulness distinction spencer hargis says
*  darwin and others provided an explanation for how the fruitfulness of living things could have
*  emerged naturally over time without divine intervention now that space time seems to be
*  multiplying as well it seems natural to ask whether the fruitfulness of space time and the
*  conservation of its energy could also have been optimized over cosmological time by a process of
*  selection as a physics fan i'm curious to know how this concept strikes you is it the sort of
*  obvious question which you and your students and colleagues are already discussing over drinks
*  well the idea that laws of physics evolve over time is certainly one that has been discussed
*  by lots of people in lots of different ways you know in some very obvious way the cosmological
*  multiverse idea proposes that different parts of the universe have different laws of physics
*  and depending on your criteria for reproductive success maybe that is an example of this in a
*  more direct way lee smolin former mindscape guest proposed precisely a theory that he calls
*  cosmological natural selection or cosmic natural selection his idea was at the center of black
*  holes you would create a new universe and for some reason which is more or less magical
*  the new universe you create has slightly different laws of physics in it okay this idea never really
*  caught on for two reasons i think one is that the mechanism by which you made a new universe inside
*  a black hole and the mechanism by which that new universe has slightly different laws of physics
*  was just never specified like there's no known reason why physics should act that way we just
*  think that what happens in black holes is you make a singularity not a new universe that could be
*  wrong and people think otherwise but that's the usual way of thinking so this is just part of one's
*  setting one's credences in new theories and the other the other thing is that if at least naively
*  straightforwardly not thinking very hard what that mechanism would do would seem to optimize
*  for creating more black holes right using the analogy with natural selection you want to you
*  know you're not up natural selection doesn't optimize success you know in any sort of vague
*  way it specifically optimizes reproductive success sending your genome on to future generations
*  okay by having kids and having them survive so it would seem that the relevant laws of physics would
*  be the laws of physics that let you make new universes i.e. make lots of black holes and it
*  seems to me that our universe is nowhere close to optimizing the number of black holes that it
*  could make right we have black holes they exist but the number of black holes in our universe as
*  far as we know is way smaller than the number of stars or planets or whatever and it doesn't seem
*  that hard to imagine different laws of physics that would make it much easier to make black holes so
*  if anything the data seem to be against this particular idea having said that there's other
*  ways that laws of physics could evolve besides smallins theory and i'm actually thinking about
*  that myself these days in the concept in the context of quantum mechanics but you know it's
*  all very far from connecting with reality yet so i wouldn't hold out too much hope that this is going
*  to be something established very soon anytime soon dan o'neill says do you feel physicalism in
*  your bones for example when in conversation with another human being are you comfortably able to
*  think of them as a purely physical system or would you have to stop and remind yourself of this fact
*  well on the one hand yes i'm comfortably able to think of them as a purely physical system
*  on the other hand i don't feel any need to stop and remind myself of that fact because as a good
*  poetic naturalist i recognize that there's more than one way to talk about a system like a human
*  being in the universe human beings can be physical systems and they can also be human beings with
*  wants and desires and all that stuff i think all that is true i do feel it in my bones i feel no
*  objection to it at any intuitive level roux phillips says there's a great new documentary
*  on netflix called a trip to infinity complete with multiple mindscape guests there's a really
*  moving part where alan lightman talks about how as a young person he was very depressed and sad
*  about being a speck in an indifferent universe doomed to nothingness but then he found love and
*  his perspective completely changed it didn't change what was true but what was true for him
*  personally and gave him meaning in life for your listeners that struggle with this cosmic perspective
*  of being a speck in a universe that doesn't care what advice would you give any personable
*  personal relatable experiences you can share well you know again i i'm always feel inadequate trying
*  to give advice about these kinds of things because every individual person is different every person
*  is going to respond to different kinds of things i never really felt bad about being a speck in a
*  giant universe it's true the universe is very big doesn't really care about me that much that never
*  really bothered me why should i care about the fact that the universe doesn't care about me
*  very much my concerns are much smaller scale in terms of my everyday life than the great expanse
*  of space and time throughout the universe i care about the people i interact with and can
*  affect in some way whether it's through personal interactions face to face or through podcasts or
*  through books or whatever students in my classes that's what i care about right trying to make the
*  actual earth a better place is more important to me than the fact that most of the cubic
*  centimeters in the universe are empty and don't have life in them at all having said that you
*  know there's there it's absolutely a good question to ask you know how should we shape our lives what
*  does give them meaning what does matter i did a podcast about this i did a whole podcast on meaning
*  solo podcast a couple years ago so you can check out my ideas there and i you know tentatively
*  suggested that we can think about meaningfulness as arising from fighting against what is easiest
*  or just comes without any effort right what are the ways in which by exerting our agency we can
*  change the world from its course and to make it be something better and that might be as small as
*  making your children or nieces and nephews happy by giving them a present or something as large as
*  combating climate change or something like that there's various ways in which you can make changes
*  in the world in a positive direction they don't have to be cosmic scale that's okay i don't i
*  don't see why that should be the natural comparison much more human scale things are usually what
*  matter to people most like falling in love that's a perfectly good example j s says is complexity
*  observer dependent we say that a coin flip is simple because we allow ourselves to model it
*  probabilistically and the probability distribution of a coin flip is simple but to laplace's demon
*  who can model the dynamics exactly and presumably can predict specific outcomes exactly wouldn't a
*  coin flip in fact be very complex in general does the world appear more complex to a more
*  sophisticated observer so the short answer here is it completely depends on your definition of
*  complexity which is not something we have a once and for all definition for like life or like
*  intelligence as we talked about earlier complexity is something that has different aspects that will
*  be relevant under different circumstances having said all that you know there's absolutely a kind
*  of complexity that is observer dependent that involves a coarse graining but you don't even
*  have to think like weird things that are ill-defined like complexity just think about
*  entropy right entropy is pretty well defined and we know what it is and laplace's demon wouldn't
*  need it because the laplace's demon sees every particle and doing everything entropy comes about
*  by coarse graining by saying that a whole bunch of microstates for all intents and purposes form
*  the same macrostate they're indistinguishable from each other the laplace's demon every microstate is
*  indistinguishable from each other so they don't need to talk about entropy laplace's demon doesn't
*  see an arrow of time they just see different states at different moments that's all that they
*  see so to that extent yes in exactly the same way to an observer who only sees coarse grained
*  features of the universe then they will think about complexity in a different way than an
*  extremely hypothetical and in fact completely physically implausible observer who sees every
*  single microstate gregory kusnik says what's your credence on the feasibility of building a high
*  resolution neutrino telescope that could see beyond the cmb and what sorts of interesting things
*  would you hope to see there well i think that my credence is pretty low i think it would be awesome
*  just to detect the cosmic neutrino background which we've not been able to do so for those of
*  you who don't know there's of course the cosmic microwave background the photons from the big bang
*  and we can only use those to see back to the surface of last scattering the moment in the
*  history of the universe when the universe went from being opaque to being transparent about
*  380 000 years after the big bang there is also a neutrino background we're quite sure that it's there
*  we can sort of implicitly see the importance of those neutrinos to the cosmic energy budget
*  so it's got to be there but they're very hard to detect because neutrinos are just very hard to
*  detect and these are especially low energy neutrinos but we can imagine it you know what if
*  you could see the neutrinos and in that case you'd be able to see beyond the surface of last scattering
*  right because neutrinos were never in an opaque environment neutrinos were just freely streaming
*  so you would see way back to a much earlier time in the history of the universe but even though
*  that's true as a function of times you would see back to the first fraction of a second after the
*  big bang i think that what you would actually see is pretty much the same as you would see in the
*  microwave background because in terms of actual distance that you're looking further you know
*  you're looking billions of light years back to see the surface of last scattering and then a couple
*  extra hundred thousand light years from that to see what the neutrinos came from and i don't think
*  that physical conditions are going to be that different a hundred thousand years or three
*  hundred thousand years light years away from the surface of last scattering that we actually see
*  today so it'd be great to see it i love it i don't know how to actually technologically do it
*  but i wouldn't imagine any completely astonishing discoveries coming from it that are not already
*  implicit in our knowledge of cosmology simon carter says when promoting your new book how do you decide
*  which podcasts talk shows to go on i don't have a system really i will confess that i turned down
*  a lot of invitations since i started my own podcast you know i used to be i used to more or less try
*  to go on podcasts especially if they were you know young struggling new podcasters i would try to go
*  on and and help and things like that but i only have a finite bandwidth for doing podcasty things
*  in my life i have other things to do i have to teach and do research and write books and things
*  like that so now the fact that i'm both creating my own podcast and you know preparing for it and
*  all that stuff that is almost all of my podcast bandwidth there's a couple of exceptions for either
*  people who i know or if i have a new book coming out but even for the new book i have tried to i've
*  had to uh restrict it to you know the biggest hits you know the ones that would actually
*  do the most good for me promoting the book right um that's the basic criterion you know there's
*  some that i don't want to go on just because i don't like them i don't want to get involved
*  in arguments or anything like that i just want to talk about science but mostly it's just you know
*  what do i get the biggest bang for the buck because i just don't have too much time to do
*  other people's podcasts brendan says you and other cosmologists have stated it could be possible that
*  time is infinite in both directions past and future however i've heard some theologians try
*  to discredit this consideration by saying if there's an infinite amount of time in the past
*  you would never get to today because it would take an infinite amount of time to reach the present
*  to me this reasoning sounds a bit flawed although i'm having a little trouble articulating the
*  underlying issues would you be able to help weigh in on why it is not necessarily correct to say
*  that the present would never happen if the past is infinite in time yeah that's a real i've heard
*  that argument it's a really bad argument it's like saying the number zero can never be obtained
*  because starting from minus infinity would take infinitely long to count to zero the point is you
*  don't start from minus infinity you just start from whatever point you want and go in both
*  directions of time so the part of the philosophy behind imagining that time is infinite is that
*  time is not something that started right that's those those two ideas time is infinite and time
*  started are incompatible with each other so if time is infinite there was no starting point
*  that's the way to think about it and therefore the idea that you would never reach the present
*  starting from the starting point is just a mistake right from the start matt from sweden says it
*  seems to me like there have been few major theoretical breakthroughs within physics during
*  the last decades compared to the early 20th century if so could this be attributed to the
*  low-hanging fruits have already been picked or simply that we don't have another 21st century
*  einstein or mox planck so it's definitely not the latter it is definitely not that we don't have
*  another 21st century einstein or whatever both because we do have an enormous number of super
*  smart talented people right now and also because other people would have done what einstein and
*  planck did if they had not been around okay so it's not like they were just singular geniuses
*  back at the time it's much closer to the the other idea that the low-hanging fruit has already
*  been picked but let's emphasize it wasn't super duper low-hanging fruit things like the theory
*  of relativity or the big bang model or quantum mechanics okay i think that the way to think
*  about it is sort of a little bit backwards from the way that it is usually put it is not that the
*  last few decades have been slow it's that the first half of the 20th century was just absolutely
*  amazing and atypical in the history of science okay the idea that you would have multiple
*  scientific revolutions all during a few decade period which we did with relativity special and
*  general relativity quantum mechanics quantum field theory big bang theory modern particle physics all
*  of these things in a really short period of time you just can't get used to that like the history
*  of science has never been like that we really did get lucky or the people who lived at that time
*  were lucky to be living in that time that was so exciting in terms of physical discoveries
*  so the second half of the 20th century is was more or less in fundamental physics where i live
*  a story of coming to terms with the discoveries that were made in the first half of the 20th
*  century you know we already had quantum field theory but we had to figure out how to use it
*  we already had the big bang theory but we had to find the microwave background and figure out how
*  to measure the density parameter and things like that we already have quantum mechanics but we're
*  still working on getting the foundations right you know all of those things and that's just
*  perfectly natural that's that's normal science that's how things are it could change right away
*  right i mean at any time a big new discovery or idea could tip over the apple cart but i think that
*  the rate of progress that we've had in recent years is just much more normal and ordinary
*  than the one what we got spoiled with in the first half of the 20th century
*  okay i'm going to group together two questions george robinson says all of the beginning quantum
*  mechanics that i learned is based on linear equations like the schrodinger equation but in
*  many disciplines the physics becomes non-linear like in non-linear optics where or how does
*  non-linear behavior emerge and eric stromquist says what do you think of the apparent conflict
*  between quantum linearity and classical chaos for example a certain youtuber said that quantum
*  mechanics does not correctly reproduce the dynamics of classical chaotic systems my guess
*  is that within any given observer's branch of the wave function the observable quantum dynamics can
*  be consistent with non-linear chaos because the states observable within the branch are typically
*  mixed thanks to entanglement with things in other branches of the universal wave function
*  so i don't think it's exactly that but i think that you know there's there's something that is
*  on the right track here i mean the short answer to both questions is classical mechanics can be
*  highly non-linear quantum mechanics is linear but classical mechanics also emerges from
*  quantum mechanics it's a limit it's a limiting case so there's nothing inconsistent about that
*  you can have overall linear dynamics in quantum mechanics and so there's no chaos in quantum
*  mechanics if what you're doing is following the evolution of the wave function of the universe
*  everything is linear and it's actually pretty simple but we're not following that right we're
*  following the evolution of branches of the wave function which are little tiny particular slices
*  of the wave function and there is a limiting case there's a set of situations set of physical
*  circumstances in which you get a classical limit from quantum mechanics and then things can be
*  perfectly chaotic i can give you an example the uh the famous example is the tumbling of the moon
*  hyperion okay hyperion is a moon of saturn which has a very lumpy uh uneven shape and you can
*  do the math and figure out that the tumbling across the different axes of this moon is chaotic
*  classically chaotic okay you don't it's not not hard to create uh chaotic systems in classical
*  mechanics and so if you didn't know about decoherence and things like that and you did
*  the quantum mechanics of hyperion so you said well its orientation has a wave function and
*  that wave function will generally spread with time the quantum analog of saying that the classical
*  behavior is chaotic is to say that the quantum wave function spreads out by a lot so this isn't
*  the spread of the center of mass location of the moon a hyperion it's the orientation so you should
*  just see a big fuzzy spherical blob when you look at hyperion okay if all you were doing was
*  following the evolution of its quantum wave function in isolation but as Wojciech Zurek
*  and others have pointed out you're not doing that it is not in isolation it's in a quantum
*  mechanical universe where things decohere so the moon hyperion is constantly being monitored
*  by radiation from the outside world which becomes entangled with it and essentially decoheres the
*  wave function of the orientation and therefore when you look at the moon it is actually in some
*  orientation it is not a wave function all spread out all over the place but nevertheless if you
*  followed in our observable branch of the wave function the orientation of that moon it would
*  follow a chaotic trajectory again there's nothing incompatible about those two things
*  Jeffrey Sagal says in the podcast with Chiara Mingarelli she mentions that there is at least
*  one supermassive black hole the center of every massive galaxy does that mean that some smaller
*  galaxies don't have black holes at their centers and is there a correlation between central black
*  hole size and the size of the galaxy so interestingly yes there is a correlation
*  between central black hole size and the size of the galaxy and this is a bit mysterious people
*  don't completely understand the origin and evolution of central black holes as far as
*  smaller galaxies are concerned it's unclear it's unclear to me i'm not an expert maybe some expert
*  can chime in here but i think that the answer is you wouldn't necessarily know if there was a
*  central black hole at the middle of every small galaxy because maybe the black holes are there
*  but they're smaller so they're harder to find right but it certainly is an interesting topic
*  of astrophysical research and just so no one gets the wrong idea as Chiara said as we talked about
*  in the podcast the black holes of the center of galaxies are really really small compared to the
*  galaxies themselves it's not that the black hole somehow governs the evolution of the galaxy that
*  is not the way it goes it's the other way around it's the galaxy that is affecting the evolution
*  of the black hole in some way such that bigger galaxies have bigger black holes in them that's
*  that's what the research is okay the last question for this ama comes from Roman Leventov who says
*  is there's a sort of physics thinking that is widely useful for solving problems in business
*  and life not just in natural sciences if yes do you think physics thinking is reducible to the
*  knowledge of physics ontology plus logic plus solid epistemology or do you think there is still
*  something else to physics thinking did you attempt to teach read read to teach readers physics
*  thinking directly in the biggest ideas so yeah i do think that there's a sort of physics thinking
*  and i do try to teach it in the biggest ideas i somewhat jokingly talk about these spherical cow
*  philosophy philosophy ah it's getting late in the ama the talking is becoming hard
*  anyway um yes there's a way that physicists think and do their research and to me the essence of it
*  besides just being science obviously there's scientific thinking right but specifically
*  physics thinking as we've already mentioned earlier on it comes down to the search for the
*  correct simplifications right what are the features of the system that you can ignore
*  that you can get rid of and i think that the reason why physics works so well is that it's
*  often pretty clear in physics cases what you can ignore how you can model a system by some much
*  much simpler system and still capture some of the essence of its behavior for other systems
*  where things can be much more complicated that kind of thinking may or may not be useful so you
*  know when i'm thinking about the physics of democracy i'm certainly not saying that the
*  right way to think about democracy is all to think of it like a physics system what i'm saying
*  is that thinking of it like a physics system might give certain kinds of insights under the
*  right circumstances so think like a physicist by all means look for the simplifications try to find
*  simple toy models that give a lot of the behavior and then add in the complications later but don't
*  be surprised if that doesn't work if it works that's great if it doesn't work use some other
*  method that's a good lesson for life beyond physics thinking so that's a perfectly good
*  way to end this ama thanks as always everyone who listens to the ama especially the patreon
*  supporters who make it possible thanks for everyone to listening hope that you everyone buys the books
*  that's what i hope i think that that would make everyone's life a little bit better the holidays
*  are coming right you need gifts it's don't just buy one book for yourself don't you know bogart
*  all the books all the wisdom send gifts to all of your friends that would be great and uh talk
*  to you next month
*  you
