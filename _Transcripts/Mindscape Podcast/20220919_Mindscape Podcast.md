My little pandemic-lockdown contribution to the world was a series of videos called The Biggest Ideas in the Universe. The idea was to explain physics in a pedagogical way, concentrating on established ideas rather than speculations, with the twist that I tried to include and explain any equations that seemed useful, even though no prior mathematical knowledge was presumed. I’m in the process of writing a series of three books inspired by those videos, and the first one is coming out now: The Biggest Ideas In The Universe: Space, Time, and Motion. For this solo episode I go through one of the highlights from the book: explaining the mathematical and physical basis of Einstein’s equation of general relativity, relating mass and energy to the curvature of spacetime. Hope it works!

# Mindscape 211 | Solo: Secrets of Einstein's Equation
**Mindscape Podcast:** [September 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgLeym0XebQ)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and
*  today we're gonna get a special solo edition of Mindscape which we
*  occasionally do when we have a new book coming out at the same time as we have
*  the podcast ongoing. So I think this is the second time that this has happened.
*  We did this before for Something Deeply Hidden, my book about quantum mechanics.
*  The new book which arrives on September 20th 2022 is The Biggest Ideas in the
*  Universe, volume 1, space, time, and motion. The book is of course based on the video
*  series, the YouTube videos that I did at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020,
*  and it's a little bit of a departure both for me and for the world of physics
*  books out there. For me because usually in my trade book writing I'm trying to
*  make an argument about something that may or may not be true, trying to
*  convince people that there is a good way of thinking about something, whether it's
*  the arrow of time or naturalism or there are many worlds interpretation of
*  quantum mechanics. Whereas this time I'm trying to be entirely pedagogical and
*  we're sticking to what I mean by big ideas, ideas that are going to stick
*  around essentially forever, ideas that we think play some important correct role
*  in describing the world at least within some domain of applicability. Physics
*  ideas, there are also big ideas that are not part of physics. I don't have the
*  expertise to cover them so there's an implicit physics drop there into the
*  title, but the point is that I'm not trying to speculate. There's nothing in
*  there about the further reaches of quantum mechanics or the multiverse or
*  extra dimensions or dark matter particles or anything like that. This is
*  the stuff that we know and is established and in volume 1 we're doing
*  the classical physics stuff. But classical physics takes you pretty far.
*  It takes you not only through Newton and Galileo but up through Einstein and so
*  we do special relativity, general relativity and black holes. The other
*  special feature of this book is that the equations are in there. So there's plenty
*  of books trying to explain basic physics to you at different levels of depth and
*  interestingness. There are not a lot of books that sit in the gap in between a
*  trade book which tries to be nothing but words, analogies, metaphors, maybe some
*  diagrams trying to explain to you what's going on versus textbooks that assume
*  that you're going to spend literally years studying physics and eventually
*  try to become a professional physicist. I think that there is room to teach
*  people who don't necessarily want to become professional physicists what
*  physics is really all about and if you're really going to do that you need
*  to include the equations. You need to give the correct rigorous quantitative
*  formulation of the theory. This is very hard to do if you just kind of try to
*  water down an ordinary physics curriculum because an ordinary physics
*  curriculum has that assumption behind it that eventually you're going to be a
*  professional physicist. So they're trying to train you to solve problems in the
*  most useful areas of physics that a professional physicist might come across.
*  But if you don't want to be trained to solve problems, to literally solve the
*  equations, if you just want to understand the ideas then it's way easier and I'm
*  honestly surprised that more other books haven't done things like this. So we just
*  get to the good stuff in this book. You do have to understand the equations
*  and I try very hard to explain what the equations say assuming you know nothing
*  more at the beginning than maybe a little bit of familiarity with high
*  school algebra. If you know what x squared means you're in good shape as far as
*  this book is concerned. But then you really get to just home in on what those
*  ideas are and I think that the level of understanding you get is better if you
*  have those equations in front of you than if you're just being given some
*  words. There's plenty of words that sound good, you know the analogies work and so
*  forth, but the problem with analogies is you can't extend them beyond their scope
*  and if all you've done is hear the analogy you don't know what that scope
*  is. So really getting the correct formulation of the theory I think is
*  very helpful and it's part of my program to make sure that physics is
*  introduced into the wider cultural context so that everyone has favorite
*  physics theories and is talking about them all the time. So today in
*  the podcast what we're going to do is pick out one of the highlights of the
*  book which is Einstein's equation for general relativity. You might think of
*  Einstein's equation as E equals MC squared but that's not right. That is not
*  the equation that physicists call Einstein's equation. Einstein's equation
*  for general relativity is the equation that relates the curvature of space-time
*  to the amount of energy and momentum in the universe. So it is the equation for
*  general relativity not for special relativity. The equation tells us how
*  gravity works in a curved space-time background and the math that you need to
*  understand that is a little bit advanced. It's considered advanced by math
*  standards. For the podcast where I don't actually get to show you equations and I
*  don't even get to draw diagrams we're not going to explain in complete detail
*  what all the symbols mean but I will once again stick to the spirit of the
*  operation in that I will try to really explain what is going on even though we
*  will not be deriving anything or explaining how what the formulas are for
*  defining all these particular symbols I will tell you exactly what they mean as
*  well as I can in a set of words. So that's what this podcast is going to do
*  and we'll conclude with the payoff of understanding why we think that there are
*  black holes how we solve Einstein's equation to actually show that there is
*  something that nobody expected to find when Einstein and his friends were first
*  thinking about these issues. So it really is a payoff and I hope that you stick
*  around to get to the end and hopefully it makes some sense hopefully gives you
*  a little bit of a deeper understanding than you might have had otherwise. Don't
*  want to waste too much time but I do want to take this opportunity to mention
*  that the big-picture scholarship that is sponsored by Mindscape listeners is
*  going great guns. We've gotten a number of donations which I'm very very
*  appreciative of some big donations which I'm very very very appreciative of. I'm
*  not reading any anyone's name out loud or anything like that to thank them
*  because I didn't ask them if that was okay but rest assured if you're listening
*  I am very very appreciative and we've hit the $20,000 mark in donations to the
*  scholarship for those of you don't know this is a scholarship that we will be
*  awarding to students who are undergraduate college majors who are
*  trying to study the big picture the biggest ideas in the universe as it were
*  the nature of space and time and existence and meaning and life and
*  complexity and all those big questions. So if you're a college student who is
*  interested in those kinds of questions be sure to apply for the scholarship and
*  if you're past college but think this is a good idea be sure to donate you can go
*  to bold.org slash scholarships slash mindscape bold.org is B O L D so bold.org
*  slash scholarship slash mindscape and we're giving away ten thousand dollar
*  scholarships so the fact that we have twenty thousand dollars in donations
*  means that this year we'll be giving away two scholarships and if we get
*  more money in probably won't make it to thirty thousand but who knows you never
*  know but we'll just keep whatever money we have for next year we're not gonna
*  keep money and put it into our pockets we're gonna keep giving it away to
*  deserving college students so any that we have that is not a multiple of 10k
*  will be rolled over to next year and I'm very excited to sometime in early 2023
*  announce the winners of the scholarships scholarships plural now which is really
*  really good. Okay so with all that in mind don't forget to buy the book if you
*  are so inclined the biggest ideas in the universe space time in motion available
*  wherever there are books available there is a their electronic editions
*  Kindle editions and so forth there's also an audiobook that is narrated by
*  me the audiobook does come with a PDF that has a whole lot of equations in it
*  so don't feel left behind you'll be able to look at the equations even if you're
*  an audiobook consumer so with that let's go.
*  Our self-appointed task today is to understand the secrets of Einstein's
*  equation and as I said it's not equals MC squared it's the equation for general
*  relativity if you're curious as to what the equation is if you were to say it
*  out loud it is R mu nu minus 1 half R g mu nu equals 8 pi g t mu nu and if you
*  stick around for the rest of the podcast you will know what that means
*  even if you don't know what it means now secrets of Einstein's equation isn't
*  really necessarily the best way of describing it because after all it's not
*  a secret it's very easy to find Einstein's equation out there no one is
*  trying to keep it hidden from you but it's effectively a secret because if you
*  haven't learned a lot of physics and a lot of math you hear something like R
*  mu nu minus 1 half R g mu nu equals 8 pi g t mu nu and you're like that's just
*  gobbledygook right that doesn't really mean anything and I have no idea what
*  that means. E equals MC squared which is an equation that popped out of Einstein's
*  formulation of special relativity in 1905 at least you can say well what do
*  those letters mean and someone tells you E means energy and means mass C is the
*  speed of light and squared means you multiply the speed of light by itself so
*  energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. Now there's a subtlety
*  there because the physicists who talk about this equation know that it's a
*  specific kind of energy that is being talked about it's the rest energy it's
*  not the kinetic energy right there's other kinds of energy that objects can
*  have we know that they have kinetic energy if they're moving and this
*  equation equals MC squared has nothing in it about moving right but nevertheless
*  if it has a meaning and that extra meaning is that an object that is at
*  rest not moving has a certain intrinsic energy and it also doesn't depend on the
*  potential energy you know the height above ground or the electrical charge of
*  the object or anything like that so but nevertheless with all of these caveats
*  you can understand what that equation means it's just a bunch of things
*  multiplied together how hard can that be right I am by the way when I make when I
*  say things like that I know that I'm exaggerating a little bit even
*  equations that have nothing but things multiplied by each other can still be
*  hard I get that I'm just sort of joking about the fact as I will continually do
*  that we're pretending these equations are easy even though it does require a
*  little bit of effort but I do have a philosophy that it doesn't require an
*  arbitrarily large amount of effort you know it's just an equation there are
*  some equations that are perfectly transparent when you say 2 plus 2 equals
*  4 I don't think anyone really that many people anyway have trouble understanding
*  what that means and my philosophy here is that if you can understand 2 plus 2
*  equals 4 then you can understand equals MC square and for that matter you can
*  understand our mu nu minus 1 half Rg mu nu equals 8 pi g T mu nu they're not
*  different in kind they're just different in degree and sort of the degree of
*  abstraction and the complication and the generality that they're trying to
*  address but it's not like there's just a barrier that some people just don't have
*  it in them to grasp these equations I firmly reject that at least for most
*  people I mean there might be some people who are severely injured or whatever you
*  know or in a coma okay then maybe you can't do it but I think that almost
*  everyone who you meet in your everyday life and talk to as an ordinary person
*  could if they put their mind to it understand what Einstein's equation is
*  about that's really the motivating philosophy behind the whole series of
*  books the biggest ideas in the universe and in the biggest ideas we go through a
*  lot of pre-relativity things Newton and space and time and force and energy and
*  all those things leading up to general relativity at the end of the book okay so
*  let's motivate what we're doing here why are we interested in this other
*  equation if e equals MC squared was part of special relativity that Einstein put
*  together in 1905 r mu nu minus 1 half r g mu nu equals 8 pi g T mu nu is part of
*  general relativity which he put together in 1915 the difference and this is even
*  professional physicists sometimes get this wrong sometimes the difference is
*  that special relativity is a theory without gravity that's it that's the
*  difference sometimes you will hear that special relativity is about
*  unaccelerated particles and you need general relativity to describe
*  accelerated particles that is entirely nonsense general relativity is a theory
*  of gravity special relativity is a theory that says space and time are both
*  part of a single four-dimensional space-time and the speed of light is an
*  absolute speed limit within that space-time that's special relativity and
*  in principle you could try to describe any number of other forces in the
*  context of special relativity electromagnetism fits perfectly well into
*  special relativity and in fact was the inspiration for it
*  electromagnetism was put together in its current form in the mid 19th century
*  with Maxwell and Faraday and all those folks and it was realized that
*  electromagnetism a la Maxwell has a set of symmetries that is different than
*  what you might have expected from Newtonian mechanics and trying to
*  appreciate what those symmetries are and how they fit everything together led
*  people including Einstein to come up with special relativity Einstein was
*  really putting the capstone on a long process that led to that and equals MC
*  squared was a tiny little result that sort of came out as a bonus and then for
*  the next ten years from 1905 to 1915 Einstein thought about how to
*  incorporate gravity into the framework of special relativity and it turned out
*  to be a lot harder than he expected so that's the story we're going to tell
*  today so maybe a good starting point for that story is gravity before Einstein
*  right you've all heard of Isaac Newton apparently an apple fell from a tree and
*  he noticed this apple and that led him to invent a gravity now everyone knew
*  about gravity okay Isaac Newton did not invent gravity that's not the way that
*  you should think about the story and also apparently that story of the apple
*  falling was promulgated by Newton himself he this is part of his burnishing
*  his own self-image and he was very interested in making sure that everyone
*  else gave him credit for his genius ideas but the context of the late 1600s
*  was people were trying to figure out why planets in the solar system moved in
*  ellipses right Kepler had already described planetary motion using
*  ellipses very effectively but it was just sort of a guess you know so it's
*  like okay maybe they move in ellipses there was no underlying mechanism for
*  why it was supposed to happen and a lot of people understood that probably
*  gravity had something to do with it and in fact people even understood that you
*  could posit a law that said that the gravitational force got less and less as
*  you got further away as the inverse of the square of the distance an inverse
*  square law for gravity this was not original with Isaac Newton the two
*  things that Newton did number one is he showed how gravity could be thought of
*  as universal that's the point of the apple falling the point of the apple
*  falling is not oh there's gravity pulling apples down we knew that the
*  point was that a single law of physics Newton's law of gravity could explain
*  both the apples falling from the tree and that the planets moving around the
*  Sun the other thing that Newton did is he didn't just guess that an inverse
*  square law for gravity could explain the motion of the planets he derived it he
*  did the calculations that was unambiguously Isaac Newton's contribution
*  here and of course there's another thing he did which is he invented classical
*  mechanics which is very important to making that derivation so anyway this is
*  the context 1600s Isaac Newton Principia Mathematica was his book that he wrote
*  where he gave everyone the rule for gravity and derived the motion of the
*  planets in the context of his theory of classical mechanics and that theory of
*  classical mechanics was so good that people since the 1600s basically took
*  for granted that it was exactly right and would be right forever and it wasn't
*  until the 19th century and the beginnings of relativity and then the
*  20th century with the flourishing of relativity plus the invention of quantum
*  mechanics that Newton's system was really overturned so classical mechanics is
*  actually a good place to start sort of to warm us up for how to get to
*  relativity and Einstein's equation a classical mechanics is a subtle theory
*  that many books have been written about but there's one equation for it that is
*  by far the one that you need to know I mean physics professors joke about the
*  fact that if you know F equals MA you don't really need to know everything
*  else anything else for the exam you're about to take you could derive everything
*  from F equals MA F equals MA is an even more important equation a way more
*  important equation than E equals MC squared F equals MA is Newton's second
*  law of motion the first law just says that there's no forces acting on
*  something they will move in a straight line the second law of motion says if a
*  force does act on something what happens to it and the answer is that it gets
*  accelerated okay so that's a very logical sensible thing to say that if you push
*  on something if you act a force on it it will start moving its velocity will
*  change it will accelerate and it's even pretty sensible to say that the
*  acceleration depends on the mass of the object okay if you have two boxes sitting
*  on the floor and you push them with the same force if one of them is empty and
*  therefore relatively low in mass the same force will get it going much faster
*  than a heavy box full of books or something like that not just saying this
*  because I recently moved across the country and have many books many boxes
*  full of books I have been experiencing Newton's second law up close and
*  personal recently so it makes sense F equals MA the more force you have the
*  faster something accelerates and it's the proportionality constant is the
*  mass so that's part of why this equation is so great force equals mass times
*  acceleration the force you act on something is equal to its mass times its
*  acceleration or if you want to put it this way you could divide both sides of
*  that equation by the mass and say that the amount of acceleration the object
*  will undergo is the force you act on it divided by the mass that if you hear any
*  tinkling in the background that is Caliban a little kitty cat who is acting
*  a force on the mass of his little cat toy that which has a bell inside so
*  there are two things I want you to appreciate about F equals MA Newton's
*  second law of motion it's a it's a genuine equation right so this is as
*  good a starting point as any to appreciate why equations are so crucial
*  in doing physics this is almost a question we don't really ask but let's
*  think about it and one thing is that it is precise okay it goes without saying
*  so F equals MA is not simply translated into words as something like the more
*  force you push on something the faster it will accelerate it's saying that no
*  doubt but it is saying something absolutely precise and quantitative it's
*  not they're saying more force equals more acceleration it's saying twice the
*  force equals precisely twice the acceleration that's what it means to be
*  a proportionality F is one variable if you like it is the force that might be
*  different values depending on how you're pushing on it a the acceleration will be
*  different depending on how you push it and let's for the current purposes assume
*  that the mass is just a fixed quantity okay so then F equals MA is telling you
*  that as F changes a changes in lockstep with it they are always related by the
*  same quantity M F always equals MA they're proportional to each other that
*  way and then the other important thing about the equation is it's universal it
*  applies over and over again it's not just true for this box full of books
*  it's true for any box with or without books anywhere in the universe okay so
*  it's not just I it's not just stating I put a certain force on this box and it
*  accelerated by a certain amount it is saying any time that you put force on
*  any object it will start to accelerate and you can figure out what the
*  acceleration is take the force divide by its mass okay and that's really not so
*  much a feature of the equation as an equation as it is a feature of the fact
*  that this equation is a law of physics that's what makes the laws of physics so
*  powerful that they are rigorous quantitative relationships between
*  different quantities in the universe that become true over and over again
*  right so you can see how powerful that is the motion of the planet Saturn
*  around the Sun can be explained by saying there is a force acting on
*  Saturn the force due to gravity caused by the Sun and that explains why Saturn
*  does not go in a straight line or spiral around because we know how it
*  accelerates and the answer is it accelerates in such a way as to move it
*  on more or less an ellipse and that goes true for all the other planets all the
*  other things in the solar system to the extent that Newtonian physics is true so
*  F equals MA is a great example of an equation also a great example of a law
*  of physics there's one subtlety about F equals MA that might be glossed over if
*  you just heard about it in a trade book that was full of words but since we're
*  doing the equations here we got to dig into the subtlety the subtlety is that
*  if you see the correctly written out version of F equals MA there is a little
*  arrow over the letter F and a little arrow over the letter A there's no arrow
*  over the letter M okay so F with a little arrow equals M times A with a
*  little arrow that's really the equation what's going on with that well the
*  answer is that the quantities appearing in the equation are not all created
*  equal M the mass of the object that you're pushing on that's just a number
*  that's once and for all a quantity it is three kilograms or whatever it is but F
*  and A the force and the acceleration are both vectors they have both a magnitude
*  how much force or how much acceleration you have but they also have a direction
*  okay and it turns out that if you get into the rarefied land of super smart
*  mathematical thinking you will think of a vector as a vector that doesn't sound
*  very profound but what I mean is it's an intrinsic kind of geometric object in
*  its own right and you don't say that you know you don't write the vector in terms
*  of something else you just appreciate it for its intrinsic vectorness as opposed
*  to what you and I are going to be doing here today which is acting like down to
*  earth physicists and say well how do you use this we want some numbers that we
*  can plug in we don't want an abstract notion okay and what that means is we
*  think of the vector as a collection of components of the vector and this is a
*  this is an actual subtle move you know so far everything I've said should be
*  perfectly obvious and even sort of tediously boring but the idea of
*  components of a vector is a subtle and important one and we're going to
*  generalize it soon enough so I want this to sink in the idea is that because the
*  vector has not only a size but also a directionality if you want to express
*  the vector you want to write it down it's not as simple as writing down the
*  mass which is just like three kilograms you have to express both magnitude and
*  the direction and there's different ways of doing that but a simple and very
*  convenient one is to set up a coordinate system and this is again not a trivial
*  move so I don't want to act like it's no big deal but I'm hoping that it makes
*  sense when I say the words set up a coordinate system so at some point in
*  space you choose it to be the origin of your coordinates and then you make
*  axes you may coordinate axes like X Y & Z for example and X might be going left
*  right Y might be going forward and backward Z might be going up and down
*  three perpendicular directions in space okay and the components of the vector is
*  a way of saying that we can think of any vector pointing in any direction as
*  being a combination of some amount of pointing in the X direction plus some
*  amount of pointing in the Y direction plus some amount of pointing in the Z
*  direction okay so those are the components there's an X component to
*  the vector a Y component and a Z component if the vector of the force
*  that we're pushing on for example if it happens to be lining up in exactly the
*  same direction as the X axis so if the F vector is parallel to the X axis then
*  the Y component and the Z component of the vector will be zero they still
*  exist but their magnitudes are zero for a more generic pointing vector pointing
*  in some combination it will have a non-zero X component Y component and Z
*  component so that equation F equals MA isn't just an equation relating a number
*  on the left to a number on the right it's an equation relating a vector on
*  the left the force is proportional is equal to the mass times another vector
*  on the right the acceleration and the way to think about that in terms of
*  components is there are three numbers in three-dimensional space that are
*  telling you what vector you have there's the X component the Y component the Z
*  component okay so rather than an equation between two numbers F and MA
*  there's an there are three equations there's a relationship between the X
*  component of the force and the X component of the acceleration namely F
*  F sub X equals M times a sub X and likewise the Y component of the force is
*  the mass times the Y component of the acceleration the Z component of the
*  force is the mass times the Z component of the acceleration the mass is the same
*  in every single case but there's either you can think of it either way three
*  different equations one for the X component one for the Y component one
*  for the Z component of force and acceleration or if you improve just a
*  little bit in your sophistication you think of it as a single equation
*  relating two vectors written as sets of three numbers so the way that you would
*  actually write this on a piece of paper is a vertical column of numbers three
*  of them one of them is the X component of the force the second one is the Y
*  component of the force the third number is the Z component of the force you put
*  those in parentheses okay so a little column of numbers three numbers in
*  parentheses FX FY FZ and you write that equals M times another little column of
*  numbers AX AY AZ the X component of the acceleration the Y component of the
*  acceleration the Z component of the acceleration so that's F equals MA in
*  vector form and very soon you're gonna say well okay that sounds okay I mean
*  this maybe you wouldn't say this but this is a situation you'll find yourself
*  in is maybe I want to use a different coordinate system right that's perfectly
*  okay coordinates are inventions of human beings this is something that should be
*  pretty obvious I just invented them I put the origin down I put the X axis the Y
*  axis the Z axis the coordinates aren't really physically there they are a
*  useful construction to help us human beings describe the situation the real
*  physical things that are there like the mass and the acceleration and the force
*  okay I emphasize this because in general relativity in Einstein's theory of
*  gravity and curved space-time which he put together in 1915 it becomes harder
*  and harder to see through the coordinates to the real physical
*  situation underneath and Einstein himself struggled with this and many
*  many super smart people struggled with this in general relativity more than any
*  other coordinate when any other physical theory it's very very important to
*  physically real things from the coordinate artifacts if you want to put
*  it that way and part of the reason why that's so important is because even
*  though we set up X Y and Z coordinates and we say yeah we just invented them
*  we could have used different coordinates we could have used polar
*  coordinates or spherical coordinates or whatever nevertheless there's something
*  that seems very very natural about X Y and Z coordinates these are called
*  Cartesian coordinates after Rene Descartes okay in general relativity it
*  will very often be the case there are no natural coordinates to use you can
*  think that something is natural and telling you something is real but it's
*  really not all the coordinate systems are created equal okay so all of this is
*  to say to make our lives easier rather than writing F with a little vector sign
*  equals MA with a little vector sign or rather than writing a column of three
*  quantities FX FY FZ equals M times AX AY AZ we will often write the whole
*  equation in terms of its components with a little index so if you want to think
*  about that F equals MA equation as three equations one in the X direction one in
*  the Y direction one in the Z direction you can just write F sub I equals M
*  times a sub I where F sub I is any one of the three components the letter I is
*  an index that can take values X Y or Z so F I equals MA I is a way of saying the
*  X component of the force is the mass times the X component of the acceleration
*  likewise for the Y component likewise for the Z component so that's called
*  writing the vector equation in terms of components and that will turn out to be
*  very very useful that is in fact what is going on no reason to keep things
*  secret until the end right when Einstein's equation is expressed as our
*  mu nu minus one half RG mu nu equals 8 pi G T mu nu why are those mus and nus
*  appearing over and over again those are Greek letters the Greek letter mu and
*  the Greek letter nu and those are indices why are we using Greek letters
*  rather than I JK etc because they are indices in space time not in space so F
*  I the components of the force vector are components in space there's X and
*  there's Y and there's Z but once relativity comes along we're gonna need
*  space time coordinates so we have T X Y Z time and then the three components of
*  space and we group those four letters those four components those four
*  coordinates together and we give them the letter mu or nu or rho or lambda or
*  some other Greek letter we use Greek letters to denote coordinates on space
*  time just like we use Roman letters I JK to denote coordinates in three
*  dimensional space okay that was a little bit of a looking ahead so F equals MA
*  an equation between two vectors we can write it in components if we want to
*  what good is that this is Newton's second law of motion but by itself it
*  doesn't tell us what Saturn does moving around the Sun okay to understand that
*  we need another equation and the other equation is the equation that tells us
*  what force is actually acting on the object and that is Newton's inverse
*  square law so the inverse square law is the law that tells us how the force of
*  gravity stretches over space the direction that the force points in and
*  also its magnitude and we can write the inverse square law as F with a little
*  vector sign over it F equals G times M 1 times M 2 over R squared times E with a
*  little vector sign over it now what does all that mean G capital G is Newton's
*  constant of gravity capital G is a constant of nature that is telling us
*  how strong the gravitational field is M 1 and M 2 that's M sub 1 and M sub 2 not
*  components of vectors we use exactly the same kind of notation to denote labels
*  that distinguish different particles in the universe as well as different
*  components sorry about that there's only so many ways you can push symbols around
*  on a piece of paper so M 1 and M 2 are the masses of the two objects that are
*  exerting gravitational force on each other R is the distance between them so
*  it's GM 1 M 2 over R squared and then E with little vector sign is what we call
*  a unit vector it's just a vector pointing from object 2 to object 1 and
*  it points in along the exactly the line that is connecting those two objects
*  okay so it's just there telling us what direction we're pointing in it has no
*  size in and of itself it's a unit vector because its size is set equal to 1
*  so this equation F equals GM 1 M 2 over R squared times E vector this is another
*  vector equation it's another equation of proportionality is very much like F
*  equals MA in fact if you think about it if F equals MA and F equals GM 1 M 2
*  over R squared times E then if that M in MA is let's say M 2 okay let's say that
*  object 2 is Saturn object 1 is the Sun okay so we're pushing on Saturn the
*  force due to gravity from the Sun is pushing on Saturn and that's M 2 then F
*  equals MA which also equals GM 1 M 2 over R squared E vector that means you
*  can cancel out the M 2 there's an M 2 and F equals M 2 a and another M 2 in GM
*  1 M 2 over R squared so you cancel those out and what you get is an equation for the
*  acceleration a of object number 2 and it's very clear that's what is what you
*  use to figure out what the path of object 2 is this is how the Newtonian
*  paradigm works you tell me the initial position the initial velocity and I will
*  give you the force which tells you the acceleration from that you can figure
*  out everything you can use calculus we explained calculus in the book in the
*  biggest ideas book but I'm not going to explain to you right now but you can use
*  calculus to solve for the entire motion of Saturn around the Sun using that
*  input so that's how classical mechanics works you have the second law of motion
*  F equals MA that relates force to the physical acceleration of the object and
*  then you have some rule for what the force actually is if it's the force of
*  gravity it's Newton's inverse square law goes as one over R squared and it's
*  again proportional to the mass now I will parenthetically note because this
*  is going to be important in a second the fact that the mass canceled out is kind
*  of interesting and cool isn't it the there are two masses that appeared in
*  the law of gravity one for the Sun and one for Saturn and if the question we're
*  asking is how does Saturn move around the mass of Saturn appears both in that
*  expression and in F equals MA but they cancel out when you set those forces
*  equal to each other so the answer is that whatever the mass is of the thing
*  that gravity is acting on doesn't matter the acceleration of an object due to
*  gravity is independent of its mass the force on it is not the force on the
*  object is proportional to the mass but the acceleration is inversely
*  proportional to the mass and they exactly cancel out so this of course is
*  the idea that Galileo promulgated a long time ago that you can take two objects
*  with different masses and as long as you can neglect air resistance if you drop
*  them they drop at exactly the same speed contra the long-standing previous idea
*  that heavier objects fall more rapidly that's only because air resistance
*  usually doesn't affect the heavier objects more the intrinsic acceleration
*  due to gravity on any two objects is the same this is a special feature for
*  gravity okay if you have something like the force due to the electric field
*  it's absolutely not true that any two objects feel the same acceleration due
*  to the electric field a an electrically charged object will be pushed around by
*  an electric field whereas a neutral object will not be pushed around at all
*  so gravity is universal in a way that no other force is and that was a feature
*  of Newton's theory of gravity and Newton remarked on it but didn't really have an
*  explanation for it it will take center stage in Einstein's theory of gravity
*  so let's go there let's get there we have Newtonian gravity 1600s we can skip
*  ahead quite a lot of interesting physics is being skipped over but let's skip up
*  to 1905 1905 of course was Einstein's miraculous year he was still young not
*  famous working in a patent office but he published several papers on quantum
*  mechanics on Brownian motion and on also special relativity any one of which
*  should have won him the Nobel Prize he only won one Nobel Prize but he deserved
*  more than one so that year he did a lot of things one of them was equals MC
*  squared he was he was putting together this theory of special relativity which
*  as I said other people had already made important contributions to Lorentz and
*  Fitzgerald and Poincaré and others had said very important things along the
*  road to special relativity and what Einstein really did was take the final
*  step the maybe I should say the penultimate step the Latin second to
*  last step and that step which was a really crucial one was to say there's no
*  such thing as the ether what people were trying to do in that development of
*  special relativity was reconcile the apparent signal that they were getting
*  from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism that a special role was
*  being played by the speed of light with the fact that in Newtonian mechanics
*  there's no velocity that has any special role at all so they posited the
*  existence of ether of this invisible stuff through which electromagnetic
*  waves travel and they tried to detect it and turns out you can't detect it no
*  experiment was telling you anything so they kept tweaking the theory in
*  interesting ways to try to sort of make the ether less and less detectable and
*  they succeeded at doing that and it was Einstein's insight to say look the real
*  secret is there isn't any ether just get rid of it now to make sense of how to do
*  that you have to radically change your notion of space and time okay so that's
*  why special relativity is kind of a big deal and Einstein was very smart as you
*  may have heard so he appreciated this and that's where you get stories about
*  length contraction time dilation all of that stuff as you move close to the
*  speed of light that is what Einstein really talked about when he invented
*  special relativity but he didn't in 1905 take the very last step along the road
*  to special relativity the very last step was by Herman Minkowski probably should
*  be Minkowski but I'm gonna pronounce it using an American pronunciation
*  Minkowski had been Einstein's old professor I think in Zurich but I'm not
*  100% sure but Einstein had taken classes from Minkowski they weren't that
*  different in age but Minkowski was a little bit older unlike Einstein who was
*  a brilliant physicist Minkowski was a mathematician and Minkowski read his old
*  students papers and thought about them and it was Minkowski who came up with
*  the insight that really what Einstein had discovered was space-time okay
*  Einstein in 1905 never talked about space-time he never said that his theory
*  of relativity was a way of thinking of space and time as part of a single
*  underlying space-time that was Minkowski in 1907 so in 1907 Minkowski says the
*  right way to think about special relativity is space-time is the
*  four-dimensional world in which we live you could have talked about space-time
*  before relativity came along right you had space you had time they both existed
*  in Newtonian mechanics they both have a separate absolute reality to them but
*  Minkowski says no they don't not in special relativity instead there's only
*  four-dimensional space-time which you and I choose to divide up into space and
*  time and he has a great quote about it he says henceforth space by itself and
*  time by itself are doomed to fade away into mere shadows and only a kind of
*  union of the two will preserve an independent reality so this is the sign
*  of one of the various signs of being a good scientist you not only figure
*  something out but he understood the implications of it okay and he says
*  right up there right front and center there is no space there is no time there
*  is only space-time that is a better way of thinking about what Einstein had
*  established with special relativity now it's worth noting parenthetically one
*  person who was not impressed by this insight was Albert Einstein again he was
*  a physicist at heart not a mathematician and in fact in one of his papers soon
*  thereafter soon after Minkowski's paper Einstein says Minkowski's formulation
*  makes rather great demands on the reader in its mathematical aspects and then he
*  chooses then he goes on to ignore it basically so basically Einstein's first
*  reaction was this is just sort of mathematical abstraction fuzziness has
*  nothing to do with the real world but soon he will be hoist on his own
*  petard will show you that Einstein had to come around to the space-time way of
*  thinking so what did Minkowski mean what did he mean by saying that you should
*  think about space-time as a single thing rather than space and time separately
*  well let's think about space okay let's really get space straight in our heads
*  and then we will be able to generalize it to space-time the way that we thought
*  about space comes down to us all the way from Euclid right Euclidean geometry the
*  geometry of a tabletop or ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space around
*  us and there are rules in Euclidean geometry like Pythagoras's theorem and
*  so forth now in the 1800s people had already begun investigating non
*  Euclidean geometries but let's start with the Euclidean geometry okay flat
*  geometry the kind of geometry that works if you draw figures on a tabletop
*  and maybe arguably one of the central features of Euclidean geometry is as we
*  mentioned Pythagoras's theorem Pythagoras's theorem says if you have a
*  right angle triangle then the distance the length of the hypotenuse the long
*  side of the triangle is related to the length of the shorter side by long side
*  squared equals sum of the other two sides squared so c squared equals a
*  squared plus b squared if c is the hypotenuse the long side of the
*  triangle and a and b are the shorter sides why is this so very important well
*  it goes back to our construction of coordinates on space-time right sorry I
*  said space-time thinking relativity I meant space just think about coordinates
*  on space x y and z Pythagoras's theorem gives us a very easy way to think about
*  the length of any straight line in Euclidean geometry give me any two
*  points in Euclidean geometry okay in three-dimensional space what is the
*  distance between them well build a coordinate system around them and there
*  will be a a displacement of the two points in the x direction call it x a
*  displacement in the y direction y and a displacement in the z direction z and a
*  three-dimensional version of Pythagoras's theorem would tell you that
*  the distance d between the two points obeys d squared equals x squared plus y
*  squared plus z squared okay there's a three-dimensional right triangle that
*  describes the straight line connecting any two points in Euclidean geometry so
*  that Pythagorean theorem is sort of a souped-up way of thinking about giving
*  you distances of curves straight lines in particular but then using calculus you
*  could take any curvy curve and zoom in on it and the whole point of calculus is
*  that if you zoom in on a curve it looks like a straight line so calculus lets
*  you build up the distance along the curve by treating an infinitesimally
*  tiny part of that curve as a straight line calculating its distance as dx
*  squared plus dy squared plus dz squared the little infinitesimal coordinate
*  displacements adding them up and taking the square root okay so really
*  Pythagoras's theorem lets you calculate the length of any kind of curve in
*  Euclidean geometry it really can be thought of as serving as the basis of
*  all Euclidean geometry there are other features of Euclidean geometry like
*  the fact that you know the area inside a circle is pi r squared but you can
*  derive all that from the very basic formalisms that start with Pythagoras's
*  theorem and this is why Minkowski says you should think about space-time as a
*  single thing because he says you can re-derive all of the results of special
*  relativity by generalizing that formula distance squared equals x squared plus y
*  squared plus z squared by generalizing it to space-time but there's a clever
*  little switch that comes in there and I will tell you what that switch is so
*  think about the twin paradox I hate calling it the twin paradox it's not a
*  paradox it's a thought experiment the twin thought experiment and you've
*  probably heard of this before two twins so they're exactly the same age roughly
*  not exactly but they're roughly the same age because they're twins and one of
*  them stays home doesn't leave the earth just sits around lives their life the
*  other one hops in a spaceship and goes out near the speed of light and then
*  comes back okay and the prediction of special relativity which has been
*  verified in various indirect ways is that the age of the twin who goes back
*  goes out on the rocket ship and then comes back will be noticeably less if
*  they went out near the speed of light when they return then the age of the
*  twin who stayed behind in other words slightly more carefully the elapsed time
*  along the path that zooms out close to the speed of light and then zooms back
*  is less than the elapsed time of the person who just stayed behind now this
*  should maybe ring a tiny bit of a bell because you know that in good old
*  Euclidean geometry in space there is a maxim that says the shortest distance
*  path between any two points is a straight line if you give me any two
*  points in space I can construct all sorts of curves connecting them
*  literally an uncountably infinite number of curves connecting them but there is a
*  unique one that has the shortest distance along it and it happens to be
*  the one that we call straight so when you have two points in Euclidean space
*  when you say the distance between them you are implicitly meaning the distance
*  along the shortest path the straight line path but distances along other
*  paths are uniformly going to exist and be longer any non straight path has a
*  longer than the shortest possible distance so Minkowski is saying
*  something like that is exactly what's going on in the twin thought experiment
*  except there is a minus sign that sneaks in the right way to think about the twin
*  thought experiment is the twin who stays back on earth is more or less moving on
*  a straight line in the space-time the twin who gets in the rocket is not
*  moving in a straight line they move in a straight line and the first segment of
*  their journey but then they turn around and come back so their path as a whole
*  is bent there when they turn around and come back okay and they experience less
*  time and no matter what they do no matter what kind of path they took if
*  they like went in spirals or whatever did crazy different things the twin who
*  goes out and does not move on a straight line always experiences less time so the
*  time you experience is kind of like the distance along a curve the time you
*  experience in space-time is analogous to the distance of a curve the length of a
*  curve in Euclidean geometry except with the new rule that instead of saying the
*  shortest distance path is a straight line it's the longest time elapsed is a
*  straight line in space-time so the personal time that you experience what
*  relativists would call the proper time the time that actually clicks off on
*  your wristwatch or your smartphone or whatever is different in special
*  relativity than it was a Newtonian in the Newtonian world because the
*  Newtonian world time is just absolute everyone agrees on what time is and
*  everyone experiences the same amount of time but in relativity everyone
*  experiences their own personal time and that personal time will depend on the
*  path they take through space-time in our everyday world we don't notice because
*  it only becomes a noticeable feature if your velocities are differing from each
*  other at magnitudes that are close to the speed of light we move slowly with
*  respect to each other in the everyday world so we never notice that's why you
*  had to be Einstein to invent this theory but the idea is that what you and I
*  think of as the elapsed time is kind of like the distance on a curve except that
*  instead of being longer and longer the curvier your path is the shorter and
*  shorter the less and less time you feel and so Minkowski being a well-trained
*  mathematician was able to turn that into an equation so just as we had the
*  in Euclidean geometry that if you have two points in space separated by X Y and
*  Z the distance between them obeys distance squared equals X squared plus
*  Y squared plus Z squared Minkowski says take two points in space-time they are
*  now separated in time as well as in space so by an amount T as well as an
*  amount X and Y and Z because two points in space-time might be located at
*  different points in space and different points in time and he says if you travel
*  between them between those two events in space-time the elapsed time squared
*  because it's a Pythagoras like kind of relation so the elapsed time squared is
*  T squared minus X squared minus Y squared minus Z squared so it's kind of
*  like Pythagoras Pythagoras says X squared plus Y squared plus Z squared
*  Minkowski says T squared minus that minus X squared minus Y squared minus Z
*  squared and this is the Minkowski metric on space-time this is a way of
*  measuring intervals in space-time it's not the Euclidean way the Euclidean way
*  would be plus plus plus X squared plus square plus Y squared plus Z squared the
*  Minkowski way is plus minus minus minus plus T squared minus X squared minus Y
*  squared minus Z squared okay and from that simple idea that what you and I
*  experience as time elapsing is a geometric quantity that will depend on
*  the path you take through space-time that's the origin of all of special
*  relativity you can derive all that stuff about length contraction and time
*  dilation and all that kind of thing okay all from this single idea that Minkowski
*  had that you put a minus sign and otherwise elapsed times are kind of
*  like distances traveled but in space-time not in space so Einstein was
*  you know unimpressed he thought he understood special relativity pretty
*  well himself but you know okay Minkowski to the mathematicians had made a
*  great advance in a sort of conceptual way of thinking about special relativity
*  what Einstein cared about was a much more tangible problem to him which is
*  that gravity didn't fit into special relativity you know when Newton came
*  along with ordinary Newtonian mechanics the very first thing he did you know the
*  thing that made him money was using it to predict the planets moving around the
*  Sun under the force of gravity right when you have a new theory of mechanics
*  the first thing you want to do is figure out how gravity works in it and so when
*  you come up with relativity electromagnetism fits into it very very
*  nicely but Newtonian gravity didn't so you were going to have to change Newton's
*  theory of gravity a little bit okay how hard can that be right well turns out to
*  be really super duper hard and Einstein was sad he thought about it a lot he
*  used his brain and what he went back to was that feature of Newtonian gravity
*  which is that the mass cancels out the mass of the object that is falling under
*  the force of gravity doesn't affect its acceleration because it affects both the
*  force and the acceleration in the same exact way so gravity has this feature of
*  being universal and what Einstein did was he sort of generalized that fact
*  that two objects will fall at the same rate in a gravitational field to a
*  wider claim which he called the principle of equivalence and the
*  principle of equivalence says let's say that you were in a gravitational field
*  but you're in a sealed room so you can't see outside okay so you feel the force
*  of gravity because gravity stretches through the room you still follow the
*  floor even if your room is sealed and you can do experiments you can you know
*  drop objects and measure the force of gravity and you measured the charge of
*  the electron whatever physics experiments you want to do and Einstein
*  says imagine that you are in a rocket ship and the rocket ship is very very
*  quiet the engine makes almost no noise at all and the rocket ship is
*  accelerating at 1g at exactly the same acceleration as the force of gravity
*  and you're sealed inside a room in the rocket ship and you are also allowed to
*  do experiments you can drop objects you can time them you can measure the charge
*  the electron whatever you want Einstein says that there is no experiment you can
*  do at least in a small enough region of space-time that could possibly
*  distinguish being in a gravitational field versus being in no gravitational
*  field but accelerating and that's obviously only possible because gravity
*  is universal you could clearly distinguish whether you were in an
*  electric field or not because a charged particle and an uncharged particle would
*  respond differently to the electric field but everything responds to gravity
*  in the same way therefore you don't know if gravity even exists okay now you or I
*  had we come up with this thought experiment we'd be very proud of
*  ourselves we'd tell our friends but we would probably stop there Einstein being
*  Einstein went way further he said I know what this means I know what this implies
*  what this implies is the reason why gravity is not as easy to reconcile with
*  special relativity as electromagnetism was is because gravity isn't a force
*  like electric force or magnetic force are in the sense that gravity doesn't
*  live on top of space-time gravity is universal therefore says Einstein we
*  should think of gravity as a feature of space-time rather than as a force field
*  living inside of it gravity is different because it's something about space-time
*  itself so you can see he bought into this whole space-time idea the Minkowski
*  had right and said okay I guess I got a got under got a put up with this even if
*  it is sort of challenging and making demands on the reader in its
*  mathematical aspects so Einstein says okay I'm gonna say that gravity is a
*  feature of space-time they what you know what feature could it be well Minkowski
*  when he proposed his idea of unifying space and time into space-time thought
*  of it as basically geometry right you're modifying Euclidean geometry to be
*  something else to be what you might call Minkowski in geometry these days it is
*  more often called Lorentzian geometry but I think Minkowski should get the
*  credit for it honestly Lorentz also did other good things but he didn't really
*  think about the geometry of space-time anyway so in this Minkowski in geometry
*  you have a modification of Pythagoras's theorem with the minus signs in it and
*  Einstein thought about that and said yeah okay you know space-time is not
*  only a thing but it's a thing with a geometry and I am looking for features
*  of that thing space-time that could serve the do the work of being gravity
*  so the obvious thing to guess once you've gone through all these steps
*  which are not at all obvious the obvious thing is to say the geometry maybe
*  space-time could be curved not only have some minus signs in the metric that help
*  explain how space and time get involved in the distances traveled but maybe
*  that space-time could be curved in some interesting way in some non-trivial way
*  maybe the Sun acts to curve space-time around it and all Saturn is doing is
*  trying to move in a straight line the best it can but there are no straight
*  lines because space-time is curved and you and I experience and think of that
*  effect of space-time curvature as gravity this was Einstein's brilliant
*  idea you know I I've just stated it using usual sentences that physicists
*  say I don't actually know what was going on in Einstein's mind very well I mean
*  it's clearly quite a leap of imagination to get there it was very very impressive
*  that he put all that together the problem was Einstein didn't understand
*  anything about geometry not at the level that he needed to to do this kind of
*  problem he was not a mathematician remember that's not what he was a
*  specialist in he learned only the mathematics that he needed to learn in
*  order to do physics and the geometry of general curved spaces and space-times
*  was not one of the subjects that he ever needed to study the good news is he was
*  very good friends with a guy named Marcel Grossmann Grossmann was a fellow
*  student of Einstein's actually helped him get his first job and Grossmann was a
*  mathematician he did know all the newfangled work in geometry and so
*  forth and so Einstein sat down to learn non Euclidean geometry from Marcel
*  Grossmann and fortunately for him it was a few just a few decades earlier in the
*  1800s that that had all been worked out people had invented non Riemann non
*  Euclidean geometry I gave away the guy who did the most important work there
*  Riemann people had invented non Euclidean geometry and they'd been thinking about
*  it so the technology was there ready and available for Einstein to use he didn't
*  have to invent it himself so what do we what do we mean by the technology here
*  so Euclid it was Euclidean geometry that serves as the basis for Pythagoras's
*  theorem and the areas pi r squared and all that stuff okay you might remember
*  the story of Euclid and his postulates the great advance of Euclidean geometry
*  wasn't Pythagoras's theorem because Pythagoras had already come up with his
*  theorem they already knew that the thing that Euclid really did was to write
*  geometry as an axiomatic system he said if you believe this and this and this
*  these so-called axioms you just postulate them their postulates or
*  axioms same thing if you postulate these things you can derive all these results
*  like the areas pi r squared like Pythagoras's theorem all those other
*  things and that that's sort of set a way to do mathematics that we still use
*  today you have some postulates or some axioms you derive some theorems from
*  them and for the most part Euclid's postulates for geometry were pretty
*  straightforward right through any two points you can draw a line things like
*  that things that you really wouldn't argue with through any one point you can
*  always draw a line I think was one of the postulates but there was one
*  postulate the fifth one Euclid's fifth postulate which is called the parallel
*  postulate that just seemed a little bit more specific than others it was like
*  a little bit less obvious and for many many years people thought well maybe
*  it's not supposed to be an axiom or a postulate maybe it's supposed to be a
*  theorem maybe you could derive it you can't as it turns out so what is the
*  statement of the parallel postulate basically the rough idea is parallel
*  lines remain parallel forever that's the idea okay remain the same distance
*  apart to be a little bit more specific what do you mean by parallel lines right
*  so think about a two-dimensional plane that we're working on so forget about
*  three dimensions for a second so you're working on the tabletop or something
*  like that first draw a straight line segment a little tiny straight line
*  segment okay and then at the ends of the line segment draw two lines
*  perpendicular both perpendicular to the original line segment and those two
*  lines move off in the same direction and we call those initially parallel
*  lines hopefully you can visualize this visualize this in your head one little
*  line segment is the base and then there's two straight lines going off
*  infinitely far at right angles initially to the first line segment so those start
*  out as parallel lines and the parallel postulate is just the statement that
*  they remain parallel forever that is to say if you take the distance between
*  them on a straight line that is perpendicular to both that distance
*  remains the same distance they remain the same distance apart that's a very
*  sensible thing to believe and you could wrote it down and a postulate but no one
*  could ever prove it so it remained a postulation it took a long time for
*  people to realize that the reason you couldn't prove it is because it doesn't
*  have to be true that is to say and this was really the beginning of a lot of
*  what mathematicians still do to this day they say what happens if I replace this
*  postulate with a different postulate so in particular a couple of
*  mathematicians Lobachevsky and Bolyai and also arguably Karl Friedrich Gauss
*  who was the most famous mathematician of the time but he didn't like to write
*  things down so he didn't write this one down so he doesn't get credit for it
*  Lobachevsky and Bolyai said look what if I replace the postulate that these
*  initially parallel lines stay the same distance apart with a new postulate that
*  says these initially parallel lines gradually diverge they grow further and
*  further apart turns out you can take that new postulate add it to the other
*  existing postulates of Euclid and get a perfectly good version of geometry it's
*  not the version of geometry that you and I know and love in this new version in a
*  triangle the sum of the angles inside is always less than 180 degrees you know
*  that in Euclidean geometry the sum of the interior angles is always
*  exactly 180 degrees in the new geometry that Bolyai and Lobachevsky invented it's
*  always less than 180 degrees the area of a circle is not pi r squared it is
*  always greater than pi r squared etc there's slight changes to everything
*  that you knew and loved about good old-fashioned Euclidean geometry and this
*  geometry that was invented is called hyperbolic geometry and there's another
*  geometry you can invent which is to say that instead of the lines diverging
*  maybe they converge that's another kind of geometry and in that geometry with
*  the converging lines initially parallel the area of a circle of radius r is
*  always less than pi r squared the sum of the triangles inside is always greater
*  than 180 degrees etc so you change in little interesting ways all of the
*  usual things about geometry and you might say well you know spherical
*  geometry that's called spherical geometry when the lines are coming
*  together that makes sense to me it's like what happens on the surface of a
*  sphere the hyperbolic geometry is harder to visualize but it's kind of like what
*  is on the surface of a potato chip Pringle or also on the surface of a
*  saddle there's a subtlety here because you can make a perfectly good sphere
*  inside three-dimensional Euclidean space that's why I think spherical geometry
*  was not invented first because people didn't think of it as a different kind
*  of geometry they just thought of spheres as being embedded in good old
*  three-dimensional Euclidean space but it turns out that the hyperbolic plane that
*  a two-dimensional surface that obeys the axioms of hyperbolic geometry cannot be
*  embedded inside three-dimensional Euclidean space so this was really an
*  example of mathematicians inventing a geometry based on axioms that you
*  couldn't make you couldn't construct it exactly the Pringle or the saddle are
*  approximations to it but they're not exactly the same thing this exists only
*  in the minds of mathematicians this hyperbolic plane which is very
*  interesting so people got excited by that Gauss got excited by it even though he
*  claimed to do it first but he knew that it wasn't the end of the story because
*  for a couple reasons I mean even though hyperbolic geometry was different than
*  good old Euclidean geometry it was still very limited and specialized right it's
*  still only two dimensions and even more importantly that there's a single kind of
*  curvature going on and the difference between Euclidean geometry and non
*  Euclidean geometry is that in a Euclidean geometry space is flat there's
*  no curvature anywhere that's kind of what it means to say that initially
*  parallel lines remain parallel the height this hyperbolic plane or the
*  sphere are curved and that curvature pushes the lines together or apart and
*  you can see how this is kind of suggestive for Einstein who wants the
*  curvature of space-time to push objects around and we call that gravity okay but
*  the assumption of hyperbolic geometry was that there was only one way in which
*  the lines diverge and that they diverge at the uniform rate no matter what
*  direction you go in so it was very very specific very very generalized and
*  Bernard Riemann around 1854 was a student of Gauss and he'd already gotten his PhD
*  but the Germans you know they have another degree you need to get before
*  you're able to teach in universities and so Riemann goes to Gauss and says what
*  should I work on for my next degree and Gauss said well come up with a list of
*  possibilities and I'll pick one so Riemann goes back and he comes up with a
*  list of possibilities and Gauss picked what Riemann thought was the most boring
*  one which is the foundations of geometry okay because Gauss knew that you know we
*  now had non-Euclidean geometries but we weren't done yet figuring out how
*  geometry worked and furthermore there was one looming crutch that Gauss wanted
*  to remove from the whole system which is that we think of this sphere or this
*  hyperbolic plane we always look at it from the outside right we're not talking
*  about the intrinsic geometry of a space we're looking at it from the point of
*  view of someone who is not embedded inside and so Riemann set himself the
*  task of thinking about how would you talk about the geometry of a surface or
*  even a higher dimensional space if you had to live inside it you were not
*  allowed to refer to it from the outside in any way well the idea that he came
*  up with was the metric that is to say Riemann says if you are able to tell me
*  the length of any curve that I can draw then you know everything there is to
*  know about the geometry of the space there might be other ways to specify the
*  geometry but he says if if you can tell me the lengths of curves in a perfectly
*  general way then I can figure everything else out that was his brilliant idea
*  and so that harkens back to what Minkowski did of course when Calcie did
*  after Riemann did it and Minkowski did it for space-time Riemann did it in
*  perfect generality so what does that mean what does it mean to be given or
*  be able to calculate the length of every single possible curve well we already
*  gave away half of the answer which is calculus okay you don't need to says
*  Riemann you don't need to literally draw every curve and tell me its length
*  what you need to do is to give me every little tiny bit of curve so at every
*  point in space I can imagine drawing a little line segment very very very tiny
*  and Riemann says give me the formula for the length of that line segment give me
*  the generalization of Pythagoras's theorem it's not just gonna be x squared
*  plus y squared plus z squared it might be something more complicated because my
*  coordinates might be different space itself might be curved he wasn't thinking
*  about space-time just space so x y z he says give me the formula for the length
*  as a function of x and y and z for every infinitesimal line segment at every
*  point in space from that I can build up everything I can build up the entire
*  geometry of the space so what does that mean like what are the actual pieces of
*  information you need to calculate the length of a little tiny line segment
*  well if you think about Pythagoras so the distance squared is x squared plus y
*  squared plus z squared what that's saying is you give me x twice there are
*  three coordinates x y and z you give me x and x to get the x squared part y and
*  y to get the y squared part and z and z to get the z squared part but in a
*  perfectly general coordinate system you know think about it this way what if you
*  drew just x and y coordinates but they weren't perpendicular to each other
*  what if you drew the y coordinate at an angle compared to where you usually draw
*  it then the formula for a little length would also involve not only x squared
*  and y squared but x times y there'd be a contribution that would sort of change
*  the overall distance from crosstalk between the x and y coordinates because
*  x moves in a direction that is not perpendicular to what y does okay so what
*  Riemann says is what you're gonna have to give me is for every pair of
*  coordinates there will be a number so for x comma x there's a number for x
*  comma y there's a number for x comma z there's a number for y comma y etc if
*  you have three coordinates there are nine numbers and you give me these nine
*  numbers and I can use those to construct the generalization of Pythagoras's
*  theorem so instead of distance squared is x squared plus y squared plus z
*  squared distance squared is some number times x squared plus some number times x
*  times y plus some number times x times z plus some number times y times x plus
*  times y etc okay a nine a three by three array of numbers that encodes all of the
*  information about the distance of any curve you might ever want to draw and
*  this is where it's harder to do an audio because you can't see me draw it but
*  basically you have three coordinates and for each pair of coordinates you give me
*  a number so that forms a little matrix as we call it a little three by three
*  array of numbers and these arrays of numbers are what tell you how to
*  calculate distances in a completely arbitrary geometry with a completely
*  arbitrary set of coordinates and that array of numbers is called the metric
*  tensor metric for measurement right you're measuring how long things are and
*  tensor because it is a generalization of a vector remember we said that vectors
*  can be thought of as a little column of three numbers so rather than just
*  working with single numbers like mass and so forth sometimes in geometry you
*  have to work with vectors that have three numbers required to specify them
*  like the force like the acceleration the metric in Riemann's way of thinking
*  about it you need nine numbers to specify it in a three-dimensional space
*  in an n-dimensional space you need n numbers and sorry n squared numbers to
*  specify the metric so in four-dimensional space time we're gonna
*  need 16 numbers four by four to specify it and instead of thinking as little
*  column of numbers you think of it as a square array of numbers that would be
*  the three by three metric in three-dimensional space the metric tensor
*  okay and I'm not gonna fill in all the details but Riemann he actually let me
*  let me back up on that a little bit I was gonna say Riemann tells you that you
*  can do everything with that metric and it's true he did kind of tell you that
*  but he didn't actually tell you how to do everything if you read Riemann's
*  original paper it was a little sketchy and Riemann very tragically died at a
*  fairly young age but his task was taken up by a bunch of other people Ritchie
*  and Christoffel and Levi-Civita and other people and they developed all of
*  this beautiful tensor analysis for curved surfaces and curved spaces and we
*  call it altogether Riemannian geometry even though it was not all there in
*  Riemann's original paper anyway so where are we the idea is that Riemann says
*  that in any geometry not just Euclidean geometry not just hyperbolic geometry
*  not just spherical geometry but any geometry so you can have arbitrary bends
*  and wiggles anywhere in space doing different things he says I can
*  completely characterize that by giving you the metric tensor by giving you this
*  three by three or four by four in space-time array of numbers that tells
*  you how to calculate the length of a curve and that's really good because
*  that's exactly what Minkowski said you need it in space-time except it's a
*  space-time metric so there's some minus signs scattered around there but
*  otherwise it's exactly the same it's a four by four array of numbers the
*  space-time metric and there's some minus signs in there because it's space-time
*  not space but it's the same basic idea okay so this is what Grossman taught to
*  Einstein and Einstein knew about the principal equivalent so he's like yes
*  we're on the right track but there is a little bit of a distinction here between
*  the metric which is sort of telling you what the geometry is and what you want
*  to know about the geometry okay you know in principle all the information about
*  the geometry is implicit in that metric it is it is embedded in there if you
*  give me the metric at every single point in space or every single point in
*  space-time in principle I can figure out what it is I want but maybe I just want
*  to characterize what it is I want directly maybe I don't want to do all
*  that work so in particular maybe what I want to know if I'm Einstein is how is
*  space-time curved so the metric is enough to determine the curvature of
*  space-time but it's not quite so simple as telling you the curvature of
*  space-time directly why because the metric by itself could be any numbers
*  that just depends on the coordinate system and we've already emphasized that
*  the coordinate system isn't important the coordinate system is not physical
*  okay there are other things that are physical and so we want to take that
*  metric which depends on what coordinates you use maybe not XYZ maybe
*  r theta phi if you have spherical coordinates or something like that okay
*  you want to extract from that metric what the curvature is and also the
*  curvature depends not on the metric at any one point but how the metric is
*  changing from point to point the warping is the bendings that's what the
*  curvature is so it's a different kind of thing okay how do we specify the
*  curvature of an arbitrary space-time says professor Riemann and his
*  successors well if you think about it the parallel postulate of Euclid said if
*  you have a little line segment and you start two lines perpendicular from it
*  initially parallel they will stay parallel Bolyai and Lobachevsky and
*  Gauss said well what if we let them diverge or converge we would get
*  non Euclidean geometries so maybe and in fact yes what if I told you at every
*  point in space for every line segment I could draw and for every set of two
*  lines I could send off perpendicular to that line segment how would the distance
*  between them and the orientation between them change okay there's a lot to say so
*  I'm going to try to say it again I draw a little line segment I take two sides of
*  the line segment the two points at the end I take two vectors that are pointing
*  perpendicular to the line segment at each end and I follow the curves that I
*  get by moving straight as straight as I can away from the initial line segment
*  there will be some distance between them some other vector that tells me how I'm
*  connecting one parallel initially parallel line to the other one and that
*  can get bigger or smaller and it can twist around and do all sorts of things
*  that will be a manifestation of curvature all the ways in which those
*  two initially parallel lines fail to be equidistant at all times are
*  manifestations of curvature so that's okay that's good I mean this is you know
*  we're glossing over a lot of things it took people a long time to get here okay
*  this is not immediately obvious stuff but the point is that that's a lot of
*  information you're telling me for every line segment you can draw and then for
*  every line segment you can draw for every direction perpendicular to that
*  line segment because there's gonna be a lot of different directions you could go
*  in a space that is more than three-dimensional or more than
*  two-dimensional rather so for space-time if I give you a point and a line segment
*  there's a lot of other line segments that are perpendicular to the original
*  one so for every line segment I can draw for any orientation of it for any
*  other orientation perpendicular to it there is yet another vector which is how
*  the two initially parallel lines are moving apart or moving together or
*  twisting right so it's a lot of information so it turns out that all
*  this complicated information is summed up in yet another tensor but this tensor
*  is not four by four like the metric tensor in space-time is four by four array
*  of numbers because it's four dimensions of space four components okay the Riemann
*  tensor is four by four by four by four that is to say we write it as R capital
*  R for Riemann and then it has four indices and they're Greek indices
*  because we're working in space-time so we might write it as our lambda rho mu nu
*  rather than just g mu nu for the metric our lambda rho mu nu four indices four
*  times four times four times four numbers components 256 components all told in
*  the Riemann tensor in four dimensions and who says you have to be in four
*  dimensions right you could be in more dimensions than that you could be in any
*  number of dimensions and there would still be a Riemann tensor and they could
*  still have more and more components but to mathematicians this is nothing like
*  once you had the idea of making tensors by adding on new indices having four
*  indices rather than two indices makes no difference whatsoever it's just a tensor
*  with more slots to it now to graduate students taking general relativity who
*  have to calculate the Riemann tensor that's harder work because a lot of
*  components to calculate 256 of them in principle happily there's not really
*  nearly that many because many of them are very very simply related to each
*  other or some of them are exactly zero automatically but still it's a lot of
*  work the good news is what do you mean to calculate the Riemann tensor well
*  remember the setup the setup is the geometric information is contained in
*  the metric so for every little tiny line segment at every point you tell me how
*  to calculate its distance that's a tensor g mu nu four by four array of
*  quantities from the metric you can calculate the Riemann tensor even though
*  the Riemann tensor has a lot more components you take derivatives of the
*  metric to see how the metric is changing from point to point the rate of change of
*  the metric from point to point and from those in all the different directions you
*  can move you calculate the Riemann tensor okay so it's much like if you want
*  to know on a landscape that you're going to walk on how what is the angle at
*  which you're walking right up a hill or something like that well you could be
*  given the data of the landscape in terms of the height above ground at every
*  point and you would have to calculate the slope of the landscape at every
*  point so you could do that that's what it means to take a derivative how much
*  is the height changing from place to place that's the relationship between
*  the metric tensor and the Riemann tensor the Riemann tensor it turns out is just
*  a compact way of thinking about how the metric is changing from place to place
*  and that characterizes the curvature okay all that is the story that was told
*  by Marcel Grossman to Albert Einstein and so Einstein who's the physicist here
*  his job is to turn it into physics we did a lot of math there's a metric give
*  me distances there's the Riemann tensor give me curvature Einstein wants the
*  curvature to reflect the force of gravity how is that going to happen how
*  is that going to lead us to Einstein's equation well think back harken back to
*  Newton Newton had a theory of gravity after all and for him the source of
*  gravity was the mass of the object right the source of the gravitational pull due
*  to the earth is the mass of the earth if the earth were heavier there'd be more
*  gravity it's also dependent on the distance but it's the mass that is
*  causing the initial gravitational pull likewise the Sun has a lot more mass so
*  it has a lot more gravity but Einstein knew better you know you might say okay
*  so mass is going to be the source of gravity so mass causes space-time to
*  curve but Einstein had already invented e equals MC squared right so that
*  equation equals MC squared is an example of unification it's an example where in
*  physics we take two different ideas and we learn that they're different aspects
*  of a single underlying concept and the way to think about equals MC squared is
*  that what mass is is a form of energy it's one of the forms that energy can
*  take there can also be kinetic energy potential energy whatever but one form
*  that energy can take is mass namely when the object is just sitting there not
*  doing anything its energy is its mass times the speed of light squared but
*  there are other forms that energy can take and so energy is more fundamental
*  than mass in that sense but there's more unification that comes along equals MC
*  squared is not the only equation in special relativity as you unify space
*  and time you also unify energy and momentum you know momentum is a quantity
*  that refers to how fast you're moving in the simple Newtonian way of thinking
*  momentum is just mass times velocity whereas the kinetic energy is one half m
*  the velocity squared but in relativity they're related to each other energy is
*  kind of like the time like version of momentum which makes sense because
*  there's one dimension of time three dimensions of space one number of energy
*  three numbers for the momentum because momentum is a vector and that's only if
*  you have a single particle if you have a bunch of particles or if you have a
*  fluid or a solid or the Sun you write the interior of the Sun there's also
*  going to be you know pressure and there's going to be strain and stress
*  inside the object and it turns out all of these are related to each other in
*  relativity so you know again Einstein knew this he knew his physics very very
*  well the right way to think about the generalized version of mass that Newton
*  would have used is something called the energy momentum tensor in relativity and
*  it is a tensor with two indices that is to say a four by four array of numbers
*  so what that means is the energy momentum tensor has components there
*  since it's a four by four two index tensor it has a TT cool component where
*  T is for time and has a T X component a T Y component TZ component and then you
*  know an XT component X X X Y you know the whole bit those are the four by four
*  array of numbers and they all have meanings the TT component of the energy
*  momentum tensor is the energy density the amount of energy per cubic centimeter
*  the spatial components the XX component YY component the ZZ component that's
*  the pressure inside the object and the what we call the off diagonal components
*  the ones that mix in T to X etc those are the stress and strain and flow of
*  heat inside the object so it's all familiar quantities from pre-relativity
*  physics but relativity bundles them together into a nice compact form a
*  tensor with two indices good great we're on the right track so if we want a rule
*  an equation for relativity for gravity that generalizes Newton's equation on
*  the right hand side of Newton's equation there's capital M or M1 if you want the
*  mass of the object that is doing the pulling of the gravity so on the right
*  hand side of our relativistic equation for gravity we will put the energy
*  momentum tensor that's a good thing to put there and on the left hand side what
*  do we put well we want the curvature right we know what the curvature is it's
*  the Riemann tensor but there's a problem there's a problem right out of the box
*  the energy momentum tensor has two indices it's a four by four array okay a
*  little square matrix the Riemann tensor for the curvature has four indices it is
*  a four by four by four by four array of numbers you can't set them equal to each
*  other they're different geometric quantities you can't even set them
*  proportional to each other just like you can't set a tensor proportional to a
*  vector you need to set things proportional to each other that are the
*  same kind of geometric object and the Riemann tensor sadly is just not a two
*  index tensor like the energy momentum tensor is so what can you do are you
*  stuck are you you know is it a hopeless quest well no there are ways that
*  mathematicians have worked out in this case professor Ritchie actually
*  professor Richie's last name was not Richie Richie is spelled R I CC I his
*  real name was I forget his first name but his last name was Richie Kerbostro
*  Richie dash Kerbostro that was his last name it was the compound name for some
*  reason when Richie Kerbostro wrote his famous article where he explains how to
*  do this he didn't put the second half of his last name on the paper he just wrote
*  it as G Richie rather than G Richie Kerbostro I don't know why but from
*  doing that the thing that he invented is now called the Richie tensor so
*  basically there's a way to boil down the Riemann tensor whenever you have a
*  tensor that is many indices like the Riemann tensor has there are ways to
*  compress it to contract it into something smaller and for the Riemann
*  tensor in particular there's a natural way to extract from this four index
*  tensor the Riemann tensor to extract it to index tensor called the Richie tensor
*  R mu nu and now from the Richie tensor now we're on the right track in fact we
*  can go further you can go from the Richie tensor contracted again to get a
*  single scalar quantity which is called the curvature scalar so you have the
*  four index tensor the Riemann tensor two index tensor the Richie tensor zero
*  index tensor which is just a scalar quantity called the curvature scalar and
*  since what we want to do is to set some quantity characterizing the curvature
*  proportional to the energy momentum tensor the very obvious guess to make
*  is that the Richie tensor is proportional to the energy momentum
*  tensor R mu nu is proportional to T mu nu T mu nu being the energy momentum
*  tensor and in fact this is so obvious that Einstein did it this is what this
*  was his guess turns out not to work so Einstein guessed this and he thought
*  that maybe he had it maybe he had the right equation for general relativity for
*  gravity as a feature of the curvature of space-time it turns out not to work it
*  turns out that if that were the equation it would violate energy conservation in
*  a very subtle way and so Einstein was racking his brains about this and he
*  eventually figured out that what he needed to do was to combine in a clever
*  way the Richie tensor R mu nu the curvature scalar R and the metric
*  tensor G mu nu so that is why the right way to do it he eventually figured out
*  was to set R mu nu minus one half R G mu nu equals 8 pi G T mu nu that T mu nu is
*  the energy momentum tensor that capital G is Newton's constant of gravity 8 and
*  pi are familiar numbers that you know and the left-hand side R mu nu minus one
*  half R G mu nu is a four by four matrix a two index tensor that characterizes
*  part of the curvature of space-time part of the Riemann tensor you might ask well
*  what about the other parts that we got rid of that we sort of evaporated away
*  when we contrast contracted down the Riemann tensor to the Richie tensor
*  they're still there and in fact those parts of the Riemann tensor describe the
*  propagation of gravitational waves so gravitational waves don't need matter
*  energy around to exist they can just float through space-time all by
*  themselves so they are described by the rich by the Riemann tensor but the
*  Einstein tensor is telling you how the curvature of space-time responds to
*  matter and energy and so that is the final wonderful answer so the
*  understanding that you have of R mu nu minus one half R G mu nu is that it is a
*  four by four array of numbers constructed from another tensor the
*  metric tensor all by itself another four by four array of numbers by taking
*  derivatives of it very carefully cleverly and that metric tensor tells
*  you the distance along curves and the correct way to take the derivatives
*  tells you the curvature so this is the curvature of space-time proportional to
*  the energy and momentum in space-time small footnote there we don't know
*  whether or not Einstein actually got Einstein's equation first we know that
*  Einstein came up with the idea that gravity is the curvature of space-time
*  we know that he proposed first that it was R mu nu proportional to T mu nu
*  before he eventually said R mu nu minus one half R G mu nu proportional to T
*  mu nu but while he was struggling with that last step he was invited to visit
*  the University of Gertigan by his friend the brilliant mathematician David
*  Hilbert and he said yes and Einstein visits Gertigan he gives a series of
*  lectures and at night over dinner he and Hilbert talk about general relativity
*  because again Einstein I think was really super duper smart but he also you
*  know had things he cared about and what he cared about was physics he didn't
*  care about mathematics for the sake of mathematics he learned just enough
*  mathematics to get by Hilbert was one of the world's great mathematicians
*  Hilbert space turns out to be very important in quantum mechanics for
*  example and Hilbert listened Einstein talk about you know this R mu nu blah blah
*  and he thought to himself he could derive the right answer for the left-hand
*  side in a very slick mathematically high-powered way and so when Einstein
*  went back to Berlin Hilbert stayed behind in Gertigan and Hilbert used what
*  is called the principle of least action to derive the correct left-hand side
*  of what we now know as Einstein's equation and we don't know who got it
*  first because what we know is that Einstein said it in public first but
*  there were letters that went back and forth from Einstein to Hilbert they were
*  friends and also there were papers that were written but those papers were then
*  revised later on and we don't know if the versions that we see are the first
*  versions or the last versions or whatever so it's possible that Hilbert
*  was the first person to get Einstein's equation right but that's okay it still
*  makes perfect sense to give Einstein the credit for it it was all his ideas
*  that went into it even if Hilbert did in fact do that last step before Einstein
*  did okay so hopefully this has given you some intuition for what it means when
*  people write down R mu nu minus one half Rg mu nu equals 8 pi g t mu nu this is
*  an equation between four by four matrices the one on the left is
*  derivatives of the metric tensor which is a way of characterizing the
*  curvature of space-time with a very definite formula relating them the one
*  on the right is the amount of energy mass heat momentum all that stuff also
*  in space-time so what do you do with it let's close the story by giving you a
*  little payoff for being so patient listening to this what do you do with
*  this equation well the way that I would say it is it's it's a four-part process
*  if you like it but part zero is think of a physical situation you want to
*  describe right like the curvature of space-time around the Sun the thing
*  that Saturn moves in to describe its orbit or the expansion of the universe
*  or a gravitational wave passing by or two black holes spiraling in whatever
*  you want to specify okay then given that step one is you look for a general form
*  of the metric so the metric is going to be a set of four by four numbers right
*  but they're not really numbers they're functions at every point in space there's
*  a different number the metric depends on where you are in both space and time
*  okay so you might guess that the metric has a particular kind of dependence like
*  oh this component of the metric depends on the x-coordinate and this one doesn't
*  something like that or you know if you look at the universe which is uniform
*  you're gonna say well in the X Y & Z directions the metric is doing the same
*  thing there's no difference between X and Y & Z that kind of thing is step one
*  step two is you use that hypothesized form of the metric and you calculate
*  the Riemann tensor and then you boil it down and you calculate what is called the
*  Einstein tensor I didn't say that yet but this combination r mu nu minus 1
*  half r g mu nu is called the Einstein tensor you can calculate it or you can
*  have your computer calculate it you know there are there are programs out there
*  they weren't around when I was doing this but these days people rarely
*  calculate their Einstein tensor anymore it's very sad but you could calculate it
*  or you could have your computer calculate it for you then you ask okay
*  for this physical situation what should be the right-hand side of Einstein's
*  equation what should be the energy and momentum and stress and all that stuff
*  and then finally you solve you set those two things equal to each other
*  proportional to each other the Einstein tensor and the energy momentum tensor
*  and then you solve for these functions that are still lurking in your form of
*  the metric gxx is a function of y or whatever it is that you're trying to
*  solve for and this is all very complicated because the Einstein tensor
*  is part of the Riemann tensor the Riemann tensor is very very complicated
*  and Einstein himself thought it was basically an impossible task he thought
*  that basically his equations were so ugly that you could approximate it so
*  you know he did approximate solutions for light being deflected by the Sun or
*  Mercury being precessing because of general relativity and all that stuff but
*  he thought an exact solution would be too hard to get but not everyone was so
*  pessimistic including one Carl Schwarzschild Schwarzschild was another
*  German physicist like Einstein but unlike Einstein this is all remember
*  Einstein put forward general relativity in 1915 so World War One is going on at
*  the time and Schwarzschild was actually serving in the German army but because
*  he was a trained physicist and astronomer he wasn't out there with a
*  bayonet he was calculating trajectories of missiles or of artillery right of
*  firing artillery across the front but they did you know occasionally give even
*  people working at the front some shore leave as it were some vacation time so
*  during his vacation Schwarzschild went back to Berlin and sat in on lectures by
*  Einstein on the general theory of relativity and Schwarzschild was
*  thinking like this is awesome I love this stuff and so he goes back to the
*  front and he sits down and tries to calculate and try to solve Einstein's
*  equation for a very simple problem namely the gravitational field of the
*  Sun so he said look let's idealize the Sun is perfectly spherical and let's
*  look at not what happens inside the Sun but what happens outside so the great
*  thing about outside the Sun is that there's nothing there there's no energy
*  or anything like that so rather than R mu nu minus one half Rg mu nu equals 8
*  pi g T mu nu T mu nu is zero in the absence in empty space so you can just
*  solve R mu nu minus one half Rg mu nu equals zero and that's easier to do and
*  furthermore he said look I'm looking at a situation where nothing is moving I'm
*  just trying to solve for what the Sun is doing not for what the planets are doing
*  at this point so there's no dependence on time and furthermore the only
*  dependence on space is spherically symmetric so the metric whatever it's
*  doing it will depend on the distance from the Sun but it won't depend on the
*  angle won't depend on the orientation where you are will be completely
*  spherically symmetric so everything just depends on R the distance from the Sun
*  to wherever you are and those guesses were enough to make the problem tractable
*  and simple enough that he could solve it so he did so he wrote down an exact
*  solution to Einstein's equation called the Schwarzschild metric and you can go
*  look it up I will even tell you what it is so it's g mu nu what is what does it
*  look like when you say you have a solution to Einstein's equation you have
*  a metric so that means you have a four by four array of numbers that depend on
*  where you are in space and time the Schwarzschild metric is static so it
*  doesn't depend on time at all and it doesn't really depend on the angle
*  either so it only depends on R and in fact as it turns out the only components
*  of the Schwarzschild metric that physically matter are the TT component
*  remember because g mu nu the mu and the nu range over the four coordinates in
*  this case our four coordinates because we're using spherical coordinates are
*  t r theta phi rather than t x y z the only components of the metric that
*  matter are g TT and g RR and they try to be reciprocals one over inverses of each
*  other g TT is 1 minus 2 gm over R where M is the mass of the object and R is the
*  distance and g RR is minus 1 minus 2 gm over R to the minus 1 power why am I
*  telling you this you're not gonna remember this right you don't you don't
*  care what the actual details are I will tell you why because it's actually kind
*  of amazing this is the payoff this is what you get for sitting through all
*  this the point is that you now have in your hands a well-defined algorithm for
*  posing physical metrics and then plugging them into Einstein's equation
*  and solving them for what the actual physical metric would be that's what
*  Schwarzschild did he sent it to Einstein Einstein was very impressed he agreed
*  with it instantly and they set about trying to understand it and they
*  realized that you know yes it fit what we know about the Sun and the whole bit
*  okay but let's think about the physical meaning of what Schwarzschild did so g
*  TT what is that that is the component of the metric that's in the upper left
*  corner of this four by four matrix right the very first thing that appears when
*  you write the metric as a little array and the value is 1 minus 2 gm over R
*  where R is the distance to the object so what is that doing does the TT
*  component of the metric tells you the relationship if you think about it think
*  about what Minkowski said right what is the metric telling you the time elapsed
*  along your clock that's what you calculate using the metric that's the
*  space-time equivalent of the distance in Euclidean geometry is the time elapsed
*  along a clock and that component of the metric is telling you the relationship
*  between the time elapsed on your personal clock and the time coordinate T
*  right that's what g TT does the time elapsed if you just move in time if you
*  don't move in space at all the interval that you denote on your clock that you
*  measure the space-time interval the proper time along your trajectory is
*  just the square root of g TT times the time coordinate elapsed so look at this
*  function 1 minus 2 gm over R as R is big if you're very very far away from the
*  Sun you expect that the gravitational field of the Sun is irrelevant right
*  you're very very far away from it and indeed when you're very far away from
*  the Sun R is large 2 gm over R becomes close to 0 because R is very very large
*  so 1 minus 2 gm over R is approximately 1 so what you're saying is if you're
*  very far away from the Sun in the Schwarzschild metric the personal time
*  that you measure on your watch is 1 times the time coordinate which is another
*  way of saying you're just measuring the time coordinate as we usually do that's
*  what we think we're doing if we think as a Newtonian person would think we would
*  think that is the universal time that we measure fine that's good that's like a
*  consistency check a sanity check we're on the right track but as R gets smaller
*  and smaller you know if you start out at large R 1 minus 2 gm over R is just
*  approximately 1 but then as you come closer and closer to R equals 0 you hit
*  a point at R equals 2 gm right when R equals 2 gm so in the radius the radial
*  coordinate equals 2 times Newton's constant times the mass of the Sun which
*  by the way in the real world never happens it never happens because the Sun
*  itself has a radius that is much bigger than 2 gm so that's what people thought
*  back in the day a Schwarzschild and Einstein they knew that and they're like
*  who cares about this weird thing that happens at R equals 2 gm because it's
*  inside the Sun where the solution doesn't apply the solution only applies
*  outside the Sun but we can imagine we can ask like what if you squeezed the
*  whole mass of the Sun down to a really really tiny object smaller in radius
*  than 2 gm what would happen what happens is as you get closer and closer to R
*  equals 2 gm that quantity 1 minus 2 gm over R gets closer and closer to 0 at R
*  equals 2 gm it would be exactly 0 and what that means is that if you go hang
*  out near the radius R equals 2 gm the time that elapses on your clock is
*  approximately 0 times the time coordinate in other words you feel
*  almost no time passing compared to the people who stayed out far away from the
*  Sun so if you did that if you went back close to R equals 2 gm and then you hung
*  out and then you came back and you've been hanging out for a couple days the
*  people you left behind have been experiencing years or more of time and
*  that is time dilation that is gravitational time dilation and what's
*  going on is that you've been hanging out near the event horizon of a black hole
*  and this is the lesson this is the payoff that Schwarzschild's solution to
*  Einstein's equation implies the existence of something called a black
*  hole nobody appreciated that at the time they didn't appreciate it really
*  until the 1950s or 60s they didn't know what was really going on because they
*  didn't really understand how to ask questions about the metric that weren't
*  dependent on the coordinate system they were using this lesson about the
*  coordinates being human inventions hadn't quite sunken in so they they
*  didn't really know what to say about the coordinates they thought that time
*  slowed down to zero at R equals 2 gm and they didn't know what to say beyond that
*  these days we know you can pick better coordinates and you can go past R equals
*  2 gm and you can go into the black hole but the point is there's very many
*  interesting things to say about black holes but my philosophical point is a
*  different one the black holes were lurking there inside Einstein's equation
*  as soon as he wrote it down this is the beauty of an equation this is why we're
*  going through all this podcast why is it so important to understand not just the
*  equations because Einstein could have said words like gravity is the curvature
*  of space-time principle of equivalence blah blah blah until he was blue in the
*  face it's only once you had that equation that you could solve that
*  equation and ask what are the features of the solution including features I
*  might not have anticipated even though I wrote down the equation in a very real
*  sense the equation knows more than you do Einstein's equation certainly knows a
*  lot more than Einstein did about solutions to Einstein's equation and so
*  Einstein never wanted black holes he never even heard the term it was it was
*  coined I believe by John Wheeler after Einstein passed away he went to his
*  grave not knowing that his own theory predicted something called black holes
*  much less that they would be crucially important in modern astrophysics and we
*  could see their pick take pictures of their vicinities and see the
*  gravitational waves they they made and on all this stuff that's why the
*  equations are so important as well as interesting because if you take them
*  seriously they predict things that you yourself would not have been able to
*  predict that's the beauty and the power of expressing the laws of physics in
*  precise and universal quantitative terms that's why equations are more than just
*  intimidating symbology they're a crucially important way of thinking
*  about how the world works and it's also a testament to the power of the laws of
*  physics because there are mathematical equations but the fact that the laws of
*  physics take the form of such equations is amazing and the fact that these
*  equations can be extended so far past the realm of our experience when we
*  invented them Einstein's equation also describes the Big Bang or right after
*  the Big Bang it actually doesn't describe the Big Bang itself the moment
*  of t equals zero but one minute after the Big Bang Einstein's equation makes a
*  prediction for how fast the universe should be expanding and that prediction
*  turns out to be right on exactly right Einstein didn't even know there was such
*  a thing as the Big Bang much less that he was trying to predict it so that's
*  why the equations are special that's why I think it's worth doing a little bit of
*  effort which I do believe that almost everyone can do successfully to really
*  appreciate what those equations are trying to tell us in general relativity
*  and in physics more generally there are more equations than that to be found in
*  this nice little book that I wrote the biggest ideas in the universe FaceTime
*  in Motion it's volume one there'll be two more volumes coming up I hope you
*  all enjoy it and even if you don't I hope you enjoyed this podcast bye bye
