Everybody talks about the truth, but nobody does anything about it. And to be honest, how we talk about truth — what it is, and how to get there — can be a little sloppy at times. Philosophy to the rescue! I had a very ambitious conversation with Liam Kofi Bright, starting with what we mean by “truth” (correspondence, coherence, pragmatist, and deflationary approaches), and then getting into the nitty-gritty of how we actually discover it. There’s a lot to think about once we take a hard look at how science gets done, how discoveries are communicated, and what different kinds of participants can bring to the table.

Liam Kofi Bright received his Ph.D. in Logic, Computation and Methodology from Carnegie Mellon University. He is currently on the faculty of the London School of Economics in the Department of Philosophy, Logic, and the Scientific Method. He has worked on questions concerning peer review and fraud in scientific communities, intersectionality, logical empiricism, and Africana philosophy. He is well-known on Twitter as the Last Positivist.

# Mindscape 95 | Liam Kofi Bright on Knowledge, Truth, and Science
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwrjHMKieXE)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  And as you know, we are not afraid here at Mindscape
*  about getting deep into things.
*  And today we're gonna get deep
*  into some of the most profound ideas in philosophy.
*  You know, we've talked about philosophy before,
*  we've talked to philosophers about pretty darn deep ideas,
*  about realism, about consciousness, about physics.
*  Today we're gonna talk about truth.
*  And truth is one of those things you think,
*  well, you know, maybe it's a pretty straightforward idea.
*  Some things are true, some things not true.
*  Anyone marginally acquainted with modern philosophy
*  should know better than that, right?
*  Of course things are gonna get really, really complicated.
*  The analogy that I have in my brain
*  is Gödel's theorem in mathematics.
*  Kurt Gödel proved that if you have
*  a sufficiently strong formal system,
*  a system where you can like prove theorems and so forth
*  using logic and math and deduction,
*  then there will always be one of two choices.
*  Either there are true statements in that system
*  that you can never prove,
*  or the system itself is somehow incomplete,
*  somehow internally incoherent, it's not consistent.
*  And this is a surprising result, right?
*  You might think, people did think,
*  you could prove everything that was true
*  in a formal system, not true.
*  And in fact, that lesson generalizes
*  to other ideas that we might have about truth.
*  It's very, very hard to be formal and rigorous
*  and careful about what you mean by the word truth.
*  So today we're going to an expert, Liam Coffey-Bright,
*  is a professor of philosophy in the department
*  of philosophy, logic, and scientific method
*  at the London School of Economics.
*  If you wanna know why the department's called that,
*  Karl Popper was a influential person
*  back at the London School of Economics back in the day,
*  so things Karl Popper was interested in
*  became an entire department,
*  philosophy, logic, and the scientific method.
*  We're gonna talk about all of those things
*  today.
*  Liam is an expert not only on the formal aspects
*  of what truth is, you know,
*  there's a lot of simple manipulation and proving things
*  and being very, very careful and rigorous
*  that goes into this kind of game,
*  but also the down and dirty,
*  how do we figure out what is true?
*  So not only what is true, but how do we figure it out,
*  right, the game of epistemology.
*  So we can go from this crystal clear set of theorems
*  and axioms and so forth,
*  to really difficult real world questions.
*  You know, when you say how do you figure out what is true,
*  you might say, well, use the scientific method.
*  Okay, well, what's that, right?
*  What not only do we say the scientific method is,
*  but how does it actually play out in the real world?
*  How do we decide who gets published in journals?
*  What is the role of refereeing?
*  How do different kinds of scientists
*  bring different perspectives to the questions
*  of what is true and what is false?
*  Even if we all think that the universe is real
*  and it's out there and what is true about it
*  is going to be objective for everyone,
*  the ways that we get to that truth might depend a lot
*  on who we are and what we bring to the table.
*  So there's a lot going on here.
*  It's a wonderful, fun conversation.
*  This is the last holdover from what I got to do
*  when I was visiting the UK a little while ago.
*  Liam was nice enough to let me delay this
*  while other podcasts got into the queue.
*  So I think we're gonna have fun here.
*  It's a little brain teaser.
*  Let's go.
*  ["Swinging London"]
*  I'm Steve Copeybright.
*  Welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Hi, Sean.
*  I do wanna mention for the listeners
*  that we're in swinging London and at a university.
*  So there is construction going on outside.
*  Yeah, sorry about that listeners.
*  That's okay.
*  Listeners are a flexible bunch by now.
*  They've learned to accept things.
*  I thought that we would talk about the nature of truth
*  and the nature of knowledge and the nature of science.
*  And then with all the extra time we had left over,
*  we figured that things to say.
*  Well, once you settled knowledge, truth and science,
*  you know, we'll still have about an hour left.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  We'll have to fill in the time.
*  Okay.
*  Oh, so truth.
*  Let me, maybe the good way to get this is to sort of say,
*  look, there's a way that scientists think
*  about what they're doing.
*  You know, they come with a model.
*  Maybe there's words like particles and forces
*  and fields involved.
*  And if the model works, if it fits the data,
*  they will say, look, I have found some truth.
*  The truth is reflected in the relationship
*  of my model to reality.
*  So what do sophisticated grownup philosophers
*  think about that picture of truth?
*  Sophisticated grownup, you asked me what the no class is.
*  So there's a kind of interesting feature
*  of the way philosophers think about truth,
*  which is as far as I can tell,
*  it diverges from how everyone else in the world
*  thinks about truth.
*  And yet philosophers tend to think of themselves
*  as only explaining the common sense view.
*  For what it's worth, my experience of talking
*  with scientists has actually been very different.
*  The scientists tend to be very averse to describing
*  the results of their inquiry as truth.
*  And partly because I think they're working
*  in the background with a more loaded vision
*  of what truth is or would have to be
*  than philosophers tend to be.
*  Let me explain what I mean.
*  So philosophical thinking about truth as it's done nowadays,
*  there's a kind of sort of classic dialectic,
*  which for instance, we teach undergraduate students.
*  I teach a first year course,
*  and this would be how I would introduce them to it.
*  Where there was in the early 20th century,
*  late 19th century, a debate between these kind of stylized
*  positions, which we nowadays remember
*  as the correspondence theory of truth,
*  the pragmatist theory of truth,
*  and the coherence theory of truth.
*  According to the correspondence theory of truth,
*  truth consists in a relationship of correspondence
*  between judgments of some sort,
*  be it utterances or written sentences
*  or something like that.
*  And the facts, where the facts are these
*  metaphysical composite entities out there.
*  So for instance, if I say, understand examples,
*  the cat is on the map, then that is true,
*  just in case there is this thing, a fact out there,
*  which is this structured complex of a cat, a map,
*  the relationship on that, on the cat actually being the thing
*  which is bearing that relationship to the map.
*  And that's the correspondence theory of truth.
*  This seems like a not crazy theory so far.
*  I think that would probably,
*  that's the view which especially philosophers
*  tend to think of as the correspondence theory,
*  as the common sense theory of truth rather.
*  The pragmatist theory of truth,
*  and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go through them,
*  then I'll go back and talk about the problems.
*  The pragmatist theory of truth
*  has many different iterations.
*  There's not like one canonical formulation,
*  there's a sort of famous slogan is,
*  truth is what's good by way of belief.
*  And there the idea is something like,
*  truth, true beliefs are those which one expects to work
*  for you in the long run or something like that,
*  where belief has a certain purpose,
*  which is helping us orient ourselves
*  and act successfully in the world.
*  True beliefs are those which consistently
*  and systematically help us achieve those purposes.
*  They allow belief to fulfill its function successfully.
*  The cash value of ideas was the slogan that I was taught.
*  But they go right, it's the same thing.
*  It's like the things which like in the end,
*  how does this belief play out in my life, in my actions?
*  What good is it for me?
*  What good is it for me?
*  In the scientific context that will often be seen
*  as sort of linked to empiricism,
*  where the idea is that true beliefs are those
*  which sort of bear out experimentally,
*  which when I try and test them,
*  they don't end up being wrong.
*  And so that would be the pragmatism of the theory of truth.
*  And the coherentist theory of truth is a bit different
*  from both of those,
*  where the coherentist theory more or less has it
*  that true belief is a belief which sort of fits
*  into the maximally coherent theory of the world.
*  So imagine you had a sort of fully worked out theory
*  of everything, which was able to accommodate
*  all of your observations of everything you come across.
*  A belief is true just in case it would fit
*  into that sort of very, very complex,
*  no doubt will always be hypothetical,
*  but hypothetical totality of beliefs.
*  So I said this is sort of classic dialectic
*  with these stylized positions,
*  because more or less all of those have now been abandoned.
*  Like you wouldn't find you very well.
*  I was just gonna say that I've gone through believing
*  in all those different theories
*  and I've landed at the coherent theory
*  more than anything else.
*  So now you're gonna tell me
*  that I've spent my life being wrong in different ways.
*  Yeah, and that's just everything.
*  You're wrong.
*  Yeah, I get you.
*  You, Sean, and you listeners are wrong about everything.
*  But, and me, I guess.
*  Except for the claim that you're wrong about everything.
*  I was right about that.
*  Okay, so the issue is, of course you'll find sort of people
*  who have more sophisticated versions
*  of the initial formulations, and so nothing ever dies.
*  It just gets reborn and rebuilt.
*  But there are sort of big problems with each of these,
*  which make people a bit wary of assuming any of them
*  are going in reverse order.
*  So for the coherentist theory,
*  typically the worry is just there's no way
*  of specifying a unique best theory under that.
*  The problem is that multiple, very consistent,
*  very coherent, for what we can tell,
*  theories can be formulated,
*  which would allow contradictory beliefs in.
*  And now I have no fact of the matter as to which of those,
*  well, I either have to endorse true contradictions
*  or I have to find some way of deciding
*  between the maximally coherent well views I can formulate.
*  And that doesn't seem quite right
*  because the natural way of deciding
*  between a very, very consistent fairy tale
*  and a very, very accurate description of the world
*  is that one of them is true and one of them isn't.
*  But that's now being denied to me.
*  I mean, the reason why it took me so long
*  to even entertain the coherence theory
*  is that it seems obvious to me
*  that there's different coherent theories
*  that are completely different.
*  And what sort of broke the tie for me was thinking that,
*  well, one of the things that your theory
*  needs to be coherent with
*  are your observations of the world, right?
*  And so it's not just they're internally coherent,
*  there's some external coherence as well.
*  Yeah, I mean, I should say,
*  I probably don't endorse the coherence theory,
*  but I'm more sympathetic than most.
*  This is just kind of the standard objection to it.
*  That said, what I think people would say
*  to things like what you just said
*  would be that there are always lots and lots of ways
*  of explaining my immediate experience, right?
*  So, you know, it's a sort of classic example
*  of brain in a vat, demon deceiving me in the matrix,
*  whatever.
*  Boltzmann brain.
*  And so the worry is that whatever things I try and bring in
*  to shore up my coherent theory
*  and introduce constraints on it,
*  a sufficiently clever story weaver can find a way
*  to weave those in and yet still come up
*  with a fundamentally wacky view of things.
*  Okay.
*  So that's kind of the classic problem.
*  Of course, you know, there are things we said
*  in the favor of the theory and some people still defend it,
*  but most people I think don't accept it
*  and they don't accept it on board to those grounds.
*  For the pragmatist theory.
*  So the worry for the pragmatist theory
*  is roughly that the thing it just said
*  has almost nothing to do with truth.
*  So.
*  It all sounds good, but we're looking for truth.
*  Yeah.
*  And so you can formulate that in a couple of ways.
*  Firstly, depending on how sympathetic you are
*  to the ideas like this,
*  if you did insist on the kind of empiricism interpretation,
*  then it seems to many people that there are candidates
*  for truth or falsity, which don't look like
*  they're gonna have any experimental predictions at all.
*  So classically, is there a God?
*  Tell me some properties of that God.
*  Whether you're an atheist or a theist, it seems like,
*  or even an agnostic in some sense,
*  you're committed to there being some truths,
*  whether or not we know them and what they might be.
*  And if you interpret the pragmatist maxim
*  in a way which is sort of experimental validation
*  is what it means to work out for me.
*  I just did air quotes.
*  You can't see me doing air quotes.
*  The air quotes are very helpful.
*  Yeah, no.
*  Trust me, if you watch me, it'd be very good.
*  So the experimental validation looks like
*  it's just gonna miss out on a bunch of things
*  which do seem like candidates for truth.
*  And the other worry is, is it just looks like
*  you can have kind of useful lies, right?
*  So if I-
*  Well, usefulness is relative to a goal,
*  and you could have different goals.
*  It's sort of the same thing as coherence, right?
*  It's like there's this indeterminacy.
*  Right, exactly that, right?
*  So precisely because you can imagine sort of,
*  now I have another parameter to play with
*  in deciding something's true,
*  like what I believe, how the world is,
*  and what I'm trying to do.
*  And now it looks like I can worryingly make things true
*  or false by varying that third parameter,
*  and that just seems irrelevant.
*  It wasn't like what we were initially trying to do.
*  We want truth to be univalent in some way.
*  Right, in some kind of sense.
*  And so that puts a lot of people off the pragmatist theory.
*  I mean, it also, it was unpopular for a while because,
*  in a way which a lot of people don't think is fair,
*  after the war, Bertrand Russell sort of alleged
*  it was complicit with fascism in some kind of way,
*  because he was the more-
*  I heard that one, yeah.
*  So I mean, the line being that like,
*  well, if anyone gets to pick the goal-
*  Oh, okay, I get it, okay.
*  And so you end up with some kind of like,
*  what's useful is what's useful to the valk.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And so then we're, and then we're in a very bad place.
*  Yeah, then we're in this old facts world.
*  And so, you know, that was another thing
*  which I think which contributed to its unpopularity.
*  And then the correspondence theory,
*  which is probably still of those three,
*  the most popular of them.
*  And the most common-sensical.
*  And the most common-sensical, yeah.
*  It's more or less viewed by a lot of philosophers to-
*  It has a kind of dilemma it faces,
*  where either it seems a bit trivial,
*  it doesn't really explain anything.
*  It's like, okay, I want to know what truth is.
*  You told me that truth is consistent
*  in correspondence to reality.
*  Well, you've just used a lot of other fancy words,
*  which sounds kind of like describing what I-
*  What's reality with correspondence.
*  Yeah, and so if you just leave it at that
*  or something not much more sophisticated than that,
*  then people worry that, well, it's not really informative.
*  You haven't told me anything about truth at all.
*  On the flip side, and this is where you feel sorry
*  for the correspondence theory,
*  they get that complaint,
*  but then whenever they fit in the details,
*  philosophers start to worry
*  that it's kind of crazy metaphysics.
*  It's most trivial and wrong.
*  Yeah, so it somehow manages to tell us nothing
*  and also tell us things which are certainly false,
*  which is something which I feel
*  only my students could achieve.
*  I've been accused of that many times.
*  And so there the worries,
*  if you really start taking seriously the idea that, okay,
*  it's not just that there are cats and mats
*  and sometimes they sit on each other,
*  but also in the world, there is this ordered complex,
*  which isn't quite any of those things individually,
*  but which is the unity of them out there in the world.
*  And there is this relationship you can form
*  between your utterance and that thing,
*  apparently instantaneously,
*  reaching out to this ordered complex
*  and obtaining and failing to obtain.
*  And people just like, what on earth are you talking about?
*  Like it becomes people's worry that there's like,
*  there's no way of spelling that thing out,
*  which won't end up invoking mysterious entities.
*  Which is difficult.
*  And so for many people that was,
*  while some people do still endorse that,
*  I mean, philosophers aren't that averse
*  to wacky metaphysics,
*  but that is off-putting to some people.
*  And so it has suffice to put many people
*  off the correspondence theory of truth.
*  Okay, what are we left with?
*  Well, so one thing I said,
*  you can always argue about those forever,
*  but the other-
*  No, I'm not necessarily giving in.
*  I'm not necessarily accepting,
*  but clearly if people are rejecting those three.
*  So what I'd say is,
*  and this is kind of what I initially was getting at
*  when I said it was distinct about philosophers,
*  because this is, I'd say the follow-up
*  I'm about to outline is the view most distinctive
*  to contemporary analytic philosophy.
*  I never hear it anywhere else.
*  And I think it's a large part of why scientists
*  and philosophers end up differing so much on truth.
*  So the last view nowadays,
*  which I think is more popular,
*  I don't think it's the most popular,
*  is what's called deflationism.
*  According to deflationism-
*  It's not a great sales pitch, honestly.
*  It's really, really not.
*  And as I explain it to you,
*  it's gonna sound really boring.
*  But you know what, it's your podcast.
*  That's kind of your problem.
*  So according to deflationism,
*  to say something is true is almost just to repeat it.
*  It's like truth is just a kind of a linguistic device,
*  which helps us streamline certain conversations,
*  but does nothing more than that.
*  So there's this sort of classic schema,
*  which is X is true if and only if X.
*  So snow is white is true just in case snow is white.
*  And if snow is white, then snow is white is true.
*  So it's sort of leaning into the objection
*  to the correspondence theory
*  that it's just trivial sizing.
*  Yes, indeed, right?
*  It's trying to make a virtue of that.
*  And it's saying that having that schema,
*  the truth schema available to us,
*  it allows us to do some things
*  which we might not otherwise be able to do.
*  You have to clean it up a bit.
*  Technically, if you just run out on that schema,
*  you end up with a contradiction.
*  Consider the sentence, this sentence is false.
*  If I'm allowed to say this sentence is false is true,
*  then I'm gonna be in trouble
*  because this sentence is false is true
*  if and only if this sentence is false and oh.
*  So you have to clean it up a bit.
*  But if you clean it up to avoid contradictions,
*  then a theory like that,
*  technically it allows for some mathematical results.
*  You can speed up proofs.
*  You can show that proofs can be made shorter
*  if you're allowed to invoke that kind of thing.
*  And linguistically allows to do
*  what people call blind descriptions
*  where I can do things like say,
*  whatever Sean said last night was true.
*  Well, I don't need to know what you said.
*  I can kind of affirm it in a convenient way.
*  So it's not the only linguistic way of doing that task,
*  but it's one linguistic way of doing that task.
*  So there's a bunch of kind of tasks truth does for us
*  in terms of expressing agreement
*  or doing some mathematical work,
*  but there's nothing more to truth than that.
*  There's no deep metaphysics here.
*  There's no kind of interesting theory
*  of what this amounts to.
*  It's kind of, it's as if you're having sort of,
*  I was just about to say an interesting theory of pronouns,
*  but actually that's super debated nowadays.
*  It's not a good example.
*  Yeah, no, it's hard to come up with things
*  about which there are no interesting theories.
*  Right, so truth is like uniquely uninteresting.
*  And so that's a view which is very popular
*  in analytic philosophy,
*  which as far as has no uptake anywhere else.
*  The relevance of this, I think, is very often
*  when people outside of philosophy,
*  but I think especially in the sciences,
*  hear talk of something being true,
*  then truth has, I think in ordinary language,
*  often has a kind of, has connotations
*  which are sometimes moral,
*  like being a truthful person is a good thing to be.
*  And sometimes a bit mystical,
*  the Christ says he is the truth.
*  And so that seems to sort of imbue
*  of a degree of religious significance.
*  And also unrelated to this, in fact,
*  this would be something which almost all of the theories
*  I just named to project,
*  but also is often taken to be related to certainty.
*  So if I say something like is true,
*  I'm kind of like really backing it up.
*  I'm affirming it in a strong way.
*  And all of those things are totally separate
*  for philosophers, philosophers, especially, I mean,
*  not just, but especially if you have that deflationary view,
*  it doesn't have any moral significance.
*  It's just like a means of summarizing things.
*  It doesn't have any connotations of certainty.
*  It's unrelated to that.
*  And it doesn't have any sort of spiritual
*  religious significance.
*  But if I say something like the universe is expanding,
*  how do I categorize that within a deflationary theory?
*  Do I say, I mean, is it possible to make sense
*  of the statement that's true?
*  Well, so on a deflationary theory,
*  you have whatever you wanna say
*  about the universe expanding, presumably,
*  as someone who's very educated in physical theory,
*  like yourself, when you say that thing in the background,
*  there's a kind of, there's a theory of what it means
*  for university to be expanding.
*  There's a sense of like what kind of things
*  we should expect to observe.
*  And there's a whole bunch of statements connected with that.
*  When you say those things,
*  that licenses me to now make predictions on those grounds,
*  to ask, to assume that you're gonna affirm
*  the consequences of that claim and stuff like that.
*  But it being true doesn't add anything to saying,
*  like saying the universe is expanding
*  or saying it's true the universe is expanding
*  doesn't add anything new to all of those
*  entailments which will be there.
*  It makes it very, I don't wanna say subjective,
*  but it's from the point of view of people talking,
*  rather than from the God's eye view.
*  Like scientists would like to say that,
*  when they discover the universe is expanding
*  rather than contracting,
*  that would have been just as true
*  if there were no people around talking about it.
*  Can I still say that in deflationary?
*  Well, that's a bit complicated.
*  I mean, in some sense, yes, right?
*  Because you can just say,
*  for instance, you can say the exact sentence you just said,
*  even if no one had discussed it,
*  the universe would still have been expanding.
*  And that has certain, actually it's rather complicated,
*  but perhaps that makes certain predictions.
*  I mean, maybe that's for instance,
*  affirming that there aren't any sort of causal dependencies
*  between our words and the rate of expansion,
*  anything like that.
*  And those are all things we can test
*  and we could bet them out,
*  we can agree with them or disagree with them.
*  But saying it's true sort of doesn't do the work
*  of affirming that thing.
*  To get that out, you need to sort of make additional claims
*  and make your argument for those claims.
*  For instance, that there aren't these causal dependencies.
*  So I think what a deflationist would like to say is,
*  anything you were inclined to say
*  by means of using the predicate truth,
*  you can still say onto their theory,
*  it just won't be the case that like the property
*  of being true is ever doing any work for you.
*  I think I'm finally getting it.
*  And so that's why it's deflationary, right?
*  They're not, so to speak, deflating
*  what claims you can make about the world.
*  What they're deflating is what the role truth plays
*  in those claims.
*  So it's not a theory of objective reality
*  or it's not denying realism,
*  it's just that this truth relationship
*  is nothing so special.
*  Yes, that's exactly right.
*  And so this view, it's sort of the common objections
*  to this view are firstly, I made that sort of glib remark,
*  clean it up to get rid of the contradictions.
*  You can get that.
*  Yeah, there are then sort of multiple things
*  you're left with and you have to decide
*  which of the ones you prefer
*  and then that ends up being controversial.
*  And the other thing people object,
*  and I think this goes back to Michael Domett,
*  but nowadays a lot of people make this objection,
*  is that it just misses out a key part of what truth does,
*  which is that we want true beliefs.
*  The point of inquiry is to get true beliefs
*  rather than false beliefs.
*  And the deflationists, while they of course
*  have things to say in response to the objection,
*  they seem to be sort of missing out a key role
*  of truth in our conceptual mental lives
*  if they don't have that.
*  So Domett rather describes it as if you explain to someone
*  the rules of chess, the nature of the pieces and whatnot,
*  and then decline to mention that the point of chess
*  is to check the opponent.
*  You really haven't explained what chess is
*  unless you also give people that detail.
*  And so the worry about deflationism is kind of,
*  it's a count of the role of truth in our lives,
*  these communicative roles, these technical roles,
*  is missing out a key thing and explaining that key thing,
*  you'll have to invoke something a bit more substantial
*  about what truth is to explain why we care about
*  getting it in the first place.
*  Let me pause for a second to talk about policy genius.
*  We all know that something like life insurance
*  is the kind of thing where responsible grownup people
*  have it and know what they're doing,
*  but we also know that it's kind of a pain
*  and kind of intimidating.
*  I mean, how much do you need?
*  What's the best policy to get?
*  Policy genius makes that all a lot easier.
*  What they do is they offer a marketplace
*  which shows you quotes from all the top
*  life insurance companies all at once
*  so you can compare what they have to offer.
*  It saves you a lot of legwork.
*  You can save up to $1,500 or more a year
*  by using policy genius to find the policy
*  that's right for you.
*  Once you apply, the policy genius team
*  handles all the paperwork, all the red tape,
*  all that stuff is free.
*  They're in contact with life insurance companies every day,
*  monitoring developments and helping customers
*  navigate every step.
*  So if you're one of the many people
*  looking to buy life insurance right now,
*  but you're not sure where to start,
*  head to policygenius.com.
*  They'll find you the best rate
*  and handle the process completely.
*  You can stop worrying about life insurance,
*  get back to baking your own bread,
*  adopting a furry friend,
*  or just being a kind and considerate human.
*  Is part of the motivation
*  for considering theories like this?
*  There's this bit that Tarski established, right?
*  About he was thinking, I guess he followed Gödel, right?
*  Gödel showed that there were certain statements
*  that I would say are true in a formal system
*  that you can't prove them.
*  And Tarski basically proved that there were statements
*  that sounded like they should be true,
*  but you couldn't prove them.
*  I'm not sure exactly how to say it.
*  Like the statement P is true if and only if P is true
*  is not a theorem, something like that.
*  So listeners, you can't see, but I'm also nodding.
*  I do air quotes and nods when I'm on podcasts.
*  So do I, they're used to it.
*  I'm gonna get more complaints
*  because I don't have video on my podcast now,
*  but okay, yeah.
*  I just love creating problems for you.
*  That's really why I came on this.
*  So broadly, yes, there is a relationship
*  between Tarski's work and Gödel's work,
*  and deflationism was kind of one of the big props
*  or supports for it was that people were able
*  to sort of take Tarski's work and say,
*  once you have Tarski's work,
*  that's really all you need from a theory of truth.
*  So what Tarski did more or less was find a way,
*  the first rigorous and consistent way
*  of retaining a lot of that, you know,
*  phi is true if and only if phi formula
*  without running into those contradictions.
*  The way he did it was by saying what you need
*  as a kind of hierarchy of languages
*  where in the base level, there's no truth predicate at all.
*  Then a level above that,
*  you can speak about formulas in a level
*  below that as being true.
*  And then you can have sort of another level
*  of truth predicate where you could also affirm those ones
*  and so on and so on.
*  And you just live with the infinity of levels.
*  You live with the infinity of hierarchy, yes.
*  So that's kind of one way of trying
*  to get a consistent theory out of this.
*  There are other ways of doing this.
*  There are also people who try and avoid the hierarchy.
*  So like there's now a lot,
*  this sort of thriving technical field of mathematical logic,
*  which is looking at how to do this.
*  Yeah, it's pretty firstly technical
*  if you look at these papers, right?
*  It quickly gets.
*  It's gibberish really.
*  And gibberish, how very dare you, sir, how dare you?
*  And there's also a thriving theory
*  of trying to give sort of axiomatic theories
*  where you have axioms governing the truth predicate
*  and see how they behave.
*  So there's kind of, you know,
*  there's a thriving technical field,
*  which is related but not as closely related
*  as you might think to those philosophical theories
*  I just mentioned.
*  Like Tarski for instance, in his work,
*  at various times suggested he was doing something
*  kind of like a deflationary theory
*  and also something kind of like a correspondence theory.
*  And it's not really clear that he knew.
*  What the correspondence is.
*  Yeah, he certainly sort of didn't seem to know
*  or care that much, which exactly these was.
*  And I have just guaranteed you a bunch of angry emails
*  from scholars.
*  Forward them to you, no worries.
*  No, okay, well, done.
*  But so good, now you convinced me
*  that I have little idea of what truth is,
*  but also given the history 100 years from now,
*  no one's gonna accept any of these theories.
*  We haven't settled yet anyway, right?
*  Yes, it does look like.
*  Equalbrated.
*  Yes, well, as far as I can tell,
*  philosophy only ever knocks things out of equilibrium.
*  But I mean, yes, right now, I'd say,
*  if I was to make a prediction about where this is gonna go,
*  is there will eventually have to be some kind of unification
*  of the advanced technical work
*  with the more traditional theories
*  of what truth amounts to.
*  There has already, there are some logicians who are now
*  in a sort of building on Tarski's initial suggestions,
*  to be serious, he was a very good scholar, obviously,
*  and who are trying to claim that in some sense,
*  you can see this technical work
*  as a vindication of deflationism.
*  But like, all I need to do is lay down kind of sparse
*  or fairly minimal rules.
*  So you're starting to get that.
*  There are other people going in other directions too,
*  but I predict that as time goes by,
*  we'll get more of a sense of how the technical, logical,
*  mathematical, more scientific work relates
*  to the sort of traditional high level philosophical work.
*  And that will give us a sort of better understanding
*  of what truth is and what kind of role it plays for us.
*  Okay, good.
*  I wanna sort of go back to moving this
*  to connect with science once again,
*  but I think there's still some more philosophy
*  that we need to get out of the way.
*  You know, when we talk about true statements,
*  or when we talk about statements,
*  different kinds of truth, right?
*  There's things that you can imagine proving logically,
*  things that you have to go out
*  and experimentally verify, right?
*  So, and I know that, let me try to say this in my words,
*  and then you can fix it.
*  There's the notions of the reasons why things are true.
*  Some things are true in virtue of themselves
*  or the definitions of their words,
*  and we call those analytic.
*  There are things that are virtue of true of, you know,
*  because that's how the world is,
*  but it might have been otherwise,
*  and we call those synthetic.
*  There's also how we know that things are true.
*  There are things we know just from reason alone a priori,
*  and things we know by going and doing experiments
*  a posteriori.
*  So these are two very similar sounding things,
*  but a little bit different.
*  Do they get it mostly right?
*  That's, yeah, a reasonable summary
*  of the sort of traditional distinctions you're drawing.
*  Yeah, and so to me, and I guess to David Hume,
*  it sounds like there's this very close connection
*  between a priori truths, ones that are true,
*  that you can sort of show just by logic,
*  and analytic truths, ones that are true
*  just by virtue of their definitions,
*  whereas there's another relationship
*  between a posteriori synthetic things that you, you know,
*  go out and, well, how did I define synthetic?
*  I forget, but synthetic sounds like a posteriori,
*  analytic sounds like a priori.
*  And do people basically buy that?
*  I know that Imani will count,
*  try to argue there was wriggle room there.
*  Yes, so Kant famously argued that
*  there's a category of things which are sort of synthetic,
*  making substantial claims, not just about,
*  not just given in their definitions,
*  but really making claims on the world,
*  but which are nonetheless a priori,
*  which are things you know by means of reason, reason alone.
*  And as far as I can tell,
*  and this is another one where there's scholars,
*  eventually I'm just gonna have to say scholars still a bit,
*  like you can't get me fired, I'm safe now.
*  That's right.
*  And so, you know, subject to correction from scholars,
*  Kant seems to have been kind of thinking about
*  then relatively recent Newtonian science
*  and thinking like he was very confident,
*  like finally we've achieved knowledge,
*  like we know something about nature,
*  which is that it works on broader Newtonian lines.
*  And it's sort of the dominant epistemology,
*  coming from many sources,
*  primarily Locke on the European continent,
*  was that this is kind of experiential knowledge.
*  We know this because we've done the right kind of experiments,
*  gained the right kind of experiences,
*  and it sort of validates our claims.
*  And we sort of just finally worked out how to do that.
*  And Kant saw that that couldn't quite work.
*  And the reason it couldn't quite work, he thought,
*  and I think many people agree with him,
*  is that some of the claims that seem to be necessary
*  for Newtonian physics didn't seem to admit
*  of those kinds of tests.
*  For instance, it seems to people at the time,
*  although we would now disagree with this,
*  but it seems to people at the time
*  that that space has something like Euclidean structure.
*  It was something we presupposed when we did our experiments.
*  We didn't test that,
*  rather when we were making other testing claims
*  about the distance between things
*  or the speed at which things moved,
*  we were then presupposing it.
*  And so Kant worried that this seems therefore,
*  like there's this worrying fact
*  that a bunch of really foundational claims to this science,
*  which he really wanted to validate
*  as like achieving knowledge of the world,
*  were just not supported by the means
*  that we had to support things.
*  And so Kant built a sort of a philosophical apparatus
*  to explain how there could be some claims actually,
*  which were substantial, for instance,
*  that space has Euclidean structure,
*  while at the same time, not requiring empirical validation.
*  We could know that just by reflection.
*  And so that was for Kant,
*  it was he called the synthetic a priori.
*  Okay, and that sounds wrong,
*  especially because it's not even exactly true
*  that space has an Euclidean structure, right?
*  So that might've been a little premature on Emmanuel's part.
*  Yes, and now, right, so it's a little bit complicated
*  what the relationship is between what Kant said
*  and what eventually became refuted.
*  I mean, it did seem in the end.
*  He is not a famously clear writer.
*  Not quite, no.
*  And in particular, the issue is,
*  it's not like what happened was
*  we stopped having apparently a priori roles
*  for some kinds of geometric structure.
*  We may not use the particular one,
*  which Kant thought we had to use,
*  but still there's something playing a similar,
*  some people might argue,
*  there's something playing a somewhat similar role.
*  I, to be frank, have no real opinion about this.
*  And-
*  Yeah, those people are wrong.
*  Just so you know, yeah.
*  So, but some people claim that like,
*  at a sufficiently high level of abstraction,
*  you could maintain Kant's claim.
*  He was just too specific in saying,
*  this is particular structure space has to have,
*  but he wasn't wrong that space does to have,
*  that we need to a priori attribute to space
*  some kind of structure in order to do our reasoning.
*  But there, you said,
*  this is where we're getting back into truth, right?
*  I mean, I'm open to the idea that there are preconditions
*  for us making sense of the world,
*  but that's different than saying
*  those preconditions are true, right?
*  You can then say, and I have made some sense of the world,
*  therefore empirically I've verified
*  that this particular presupposition works.
*  Well, I guess, you know, this does actually,
*  this might be a point where which of those theories
*  of truth we endorse makes a difference
*  to how you wanna understand what's going on, right?
*  So more or less, you know, for the deflationist
*  to say that, you know,
*  it's true that space has such a structure
*  is more or less just to repeat the space
*  has such a structure.
*  So once you've told me your theory,
*  you're not adding anything to it by telling me it's true.
*  And to that extent, kind of, there's not really,
*  if you disagree, I mean, I say he is an,
*  I'm the deflationist, I would just disagree
*  with the claim that like,
*  to say that space has a structure
*  is different from saying it's true
*  that space has a structure.
*  On the other side to a correspondence theorist,
*  maybe there might be more involved,
*  because maybe when you say that it's space has a structure,
*  there's something extra involved in saying,
*  and that corresponds to some external thing.
*  Maybe some claims are like different
*  and they don't need to have that correspondence rate.
*  This would be a version of what people call truth pluralism,
*  where they have that,
*  there's kind of more to the correspondence relation
*  because different claims corresponds to the world
*  in different kinds of ways.
*  And so I need to tell you not just that space
*  has a structure, but what kind of correspondence relationship
*  you need to be looking for
*  in order to bear this kind of claim out.
*  And that would make it such that there is like
*  a little bit of extra work to be done,
*  at least in explaining exactly what you mean
*  when you say space has a structure.
*  And so this might be a point where like,
*  which of those theories of truth seems tempting to you,
*  at least makes a difference to what kind of things
*  you think you need to do to fully explain what you mean
*  when you make things about structure of space.
*  That's fair, but it does sound like at least provisionally,
*  I'm okay in making my naive statements about,
*  there are mathematical and logical truths
*  and there are scientific truths and they're different.
*  No, I just didn't get to that yet.
*  We have all the time, don't worry.
*  In the 20th century, this is kind of associated with quine,
*  eventually Kant's this division
*  between analytic and synthetic truths,
*  truths which are true in virtue of their meaning
*  versus truths which are true in virtue
*  of something about how the world is
*  independent of language,
*  came under quite stern criticism within philosophy.
*  And more or less the criticism was that like,
*  so to speak, it's a little bit arbitrary
*  how you categorize things on one side of this
*  versus the other.
*  Okay.
*  So the thought being that,
*  you know what, I'm not quite sure what the thought is
*  because I've always thought the attacks were just silly.
*  We can categorize whole regions
*  of philosophical debate as silly, that's okay.
*  Oh, I'm on Twitter, I do that all the time.
*  But I mean, I guess it's just the thought being
*  that this notion of sort of an analytic truth,
*  something true in virtue of meaning,
*  when you try and cash it out,
*  it's kind of similar to the place
*  where the correspondence theory.
*  When you try and cash it out,
*  what you will find is it depends on notions
*  which are themselves quite mysterious
*  and we don't have a theory of it.
*  That you have to sort of invoke notions of synonymy
*  or necessary equivalence,
*  which themselves aren't well theorized.
*  And once you try and like really think about this
*  or really make sense of it,
*  eventually what you're left with is something more like,
*  well, there are some claims which I'll do more to defend
*  than others in terms of you really have to do a lot of work
*  to make me give up on the claim
*  that all bachelors are unmarried men.
*  Like that's something which really, really, really
*  requires a pretty drastic change in my well-view,
*  but you could do it.
*  Like you could, it's just, so to speak,
*  I haven't yet found the circumstance
*  where it would be convenient for me to give up that claim,
*  but you could do it.
*  Other claims are sort of like closer to being revisable
*  in light of my experiences.
*  And so what a lot of philosophers came to think
*  was this notion of analytic versus synthetic
*  was a sort of bad way of making theoretical sense
*  of the difference between how entrenched beliefs are for us.
*  And like really all there is is this entrenchment
*  and that's a sort of much more that comes in degrees.
*  So quite is trying to give us a spectrum
*  rather than just a two options.
*  Yeah, more or less that they think
*  to be more or less central to our belief structure.
*  And-
*  But are you advocating this or mentioning
*  that there are people who advocate it?
*  Cause it does not sound very convincing to me.
*  I think that all bachelors are unmarried men.
*  I am mentioning it rather than advocating it.
*  I tend to think that, you know,
*  it's one of those things where it relies
*  on a crucial points argument is that
*  there are these sort of somewhat mysterious notions
*  we just can't make sense of.
*  Quine, the person who most influential on this attack
*  was making it in the fifties.
*  Just before there were a lot of developments
*  where we developed tools where I think we can just make sense
*  of those notions.
*  And so I think it was a sort of sensible
*  in light of the state of theoretical development
*  at the time, but I don't think it really bears out.
*  And so it sort of entered philosophical law
*  that this was refuted.
*  But I think it was sort of that decision warrants
*  re-examination in light of data developments.
*  Yeah, I have this vague feeling
*  from a completely unqualified perspective
*  that if we fix some things up in our use of language
*  and logic and things like that,
*  there would be a clear distinction.
*  And maybe it has to do with possible worlds.
*  And if something is true in every possible world
*  or something like that, that's different than being true
*  in some possible worlds, but not others.
*  Well, that's like some of the technical machinery
*  which philosophers use to analyze a bunch of concepts
*  will be in terms of what's called modal logic,
*  which is the logic of possibility and necessity.
*  Well, how philosophers tend to think about that
*  is they will have possible worlds,
*  which depending on how you describe them,
*  are either kind of like concrete, real, existent worlds,
*  just not ones we can physically reach.
*  Yeah, that's what scientists don't care about.
*  Yeah, right.
*  But yeah, there are philosophers who buy that, yeah.
*  Or sort of more sensitively,
*  just like sort of complete descriptions of the world,
*  which you could like, which may or may not be actual,
*  which may not endorse, which may not be true,
*  but you can sort of give their descriptions of the world.
*  Sorry, I really need to, before I forget,
*  mention that Max Tegmark, previous podcast guest,
*  really does believe in all the other possible worlds also.
*  He's a mathy version of David Lewis.
*  Well, you know, one of the genuine,
*  and I mean this like genuine joys of being in academia
*  is whenever I think something's just too wacky
*  and no one could believe it,
*  there are always like people 10 times smarter than me
*  who like have passionate defenses of that.
*  And you know, I'm just left in awe
*  of what the human mind can do.
*  But yeah, sorry, so you could view possibilities
*  as just sort of erstat things,
*  descriptions of how the world might be.
*  And then the sort of the apparatus of modal logic
*  is a way of reasoning about like,
*  well, given it, you know, if we think of ourselves
*  in this space of possibilities,
*  what follows, what's necessary from here,
*  what's only possible from here, et cetera.
*  And some of that machinery can be brought in
*  to try and make sense of the notions required
*  to make sense of an analyticity.
*  You know, I don't wanna give anyone the impression
*  that this is settled.
*  Like I happen to think you can do it,
*  but like, you know, there are reasonable
*  and intelligent people who don't think you can do it.
*  But like those are exactly the developments I have in mind.
*  And that just kind of, it's a sort of nice illustration
*  really of, you followed a story, right?
*  There's the beginning of kind of already
*  in the early modern Europe appears
*  sort of a kind of interaction between like philosophy
*  and scientific reflection,
*  where you have philosophers and scientists
*  trying to think about like, how can we be confident
*  in what seems like a very well-grounded theory.
*  From that, we get new sort of technical mathematical machinery
*  designed to try and like help us make sense
*  of those notions, which philosophers then use
*  to sort of problematize some of the initial notions
*  that our theory then was built on.
*  But then that itself spurs new technical developments
*  and we are like getting better at being able to validate this.
*  And it's a really nice sort of virtuous circle
*  of critique and response to critique in a way,
*  which is to very much new tools in our minds
*  to make sense of things
*  which were hard to make sense of before.
*  Good, and I think this leads us right into
*  the sort of scientific practice
*  that I was hoping to get to, right?
*  I mean, the system you just described
*  is what science would ideally like to be like
*  with a little bit of data thrown in, right?
*  I mean, we come up with theories, we compare them with data.
*  We still unfortunately teach kids, at least in the US,
*  but there's something called the scientific method
*  that Francis Bacon laid down and all scientists follow.
*  And a little baby hypothesis grows up to be a theory
*  and then finally graduates to being a law.
*  None of that is actually true in scientific practice,
*  but there is some sort of, the give and take
*  between hypothesizing and collecting data is certainly there.
*  I mean, what is your read on a better way
*  that we might teach high school students
*  how science is done than the Baconian scientific method?
*  Yeah, right, like I think this is a really fascinating topic
*  and it's actually something
*  that I think about professionally.
*  Where exactly as you say, I mean, it's the same in the UK.
*  People are taught this kind of stylized vision
*  of scientific method and it really just doesn't correspond
*  to how I think science in practice works
*  and even how it should work.
*  It wouldn't be good if we tried to make science work like that.
*  And the irony is very thick, right?
*  Okay.
*  It's a theory that has no relationship to experiment.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So I think, right now I think the best that I could have
*  for how to reform scientific practice,
*  scientific education, would be to base it actually
*  on some ideas from a different philosophy.
*  This would be Dewey from the American Practitioners' Generation
*  where Dewey was this kind of famous educational theorist.
*  He was actually one of the places
*  where they had most influence.
*  And he had sort of learned by doing was the philosophy.
*  And he really actually kind of modeled
*  his whole theory of education on what he took to be
*  kind of a more realistic model
*  of scientific inquiries done.
*  And the idea would be you sort of give people problems,
*  materials with which to solve those problems
*  and space to reflect on what they're doing
*  as they're doing it.
*  And so, you give people some materials and tell me,
*  how can I make this chemical do that?
*  To turn this color, whatever it might be.
*  They then get some space to like play around
*  with the materials they got.
*  And then afterwards they've got to tell you
*  what did you do and why.
*  In the process of doing this,
*  you're gonna learn a bunch of facts about scientific inquiry
*  because in some sense science is that kind of activity
*  but scaled up and in much more communication with people.
*  And so for instance, a classic example,
*  here's something which doesn't tend to feature much
*  in stylized descriptions of scientific method,
*  but it's actually super important
*  and is the subject of much debate now
*  around the replication crisis.
*  At some point when you're testing a claim,
*  you have to stop testing it, stop seeking new evidence
*  and decide I have enough evidence to write this up.
*  How do you do that?
*  What are the rules which decide how you do that?
*  That doesn't feature a tool in the normal picture
*  of the stylized picture of scientific method.
*  It's sort of, they sometimes people talk as if
*  at one point nature rings a bell.
*  As if it's binary, like you got it or you don't.
*  Right, exactly.
*  If you set children that task,
*  they would have to discover that problem
*  because you have to at some point work out
*  like now you've done enough to be confident
*  this is the way it's done.
*  And in so doing, they could reflect on like
*  what kind of features of the scenario made me think
*  that now was the time to do that.
*  When what would have made me think we need to do more
*  or if it means to do less.
*  And so by engaging in scientific research,
*  they'll learn kind of key features
*  of how the practice is done,
*  how these decisions can be made in a way
*  which don't fit the stylized method,
*  but aren't arbitrary either,
*  are responding to features of your investigatory situation.
*  And we do so in a way which is kind of fun, right?
*  Way more fun than learning all the elements.
*  This is the kind of thing which I'd be really interested in
*  there being much more experimentation around.
*  But I think the part that is valuable or important to me
*  that maybe you didn't mention there is this idea
*  that we are comparing different possible worlds.
*  We have hypotheses.
*  Going back to the previous discussion,
*  like a big part of the scientific method is saying,
*  I don't know which world we live in.
*  Like there's different theories
*  that might describe the world.
*  They're all theories that describe some world,
*  which one do we live in?
*  So we're gonna collect more data
*  and maybe it's not binary, but at least as good Bayesians,
*  we will increase our credence in one of these hypotheses
*  and decrease in the other.
*  Well, I mean, actually I would hope
*  that a good process of doing education
*  would help people do that.
*  Because like one of the things
*  one wishes to learn is what kind of experiments
*  are worth doing.
*  And eventually you need to learn that like
*  some experiments don't differentiate between hypotheses
*  because in either of these possible worlds,
*  you would expect the same given this test.
*  And so in learning about like,
*  well, how do I do an experiment which decides
*  or at least gives me evidence relevant to deciding
*  between these hypotheses,
*  you're having to think about in the better process
*  of doing that, like you sort of have to hold in your mind,
*  well, what would be true if this hypothesis
*  and what would be true if that hypothesis,
*  listeners should be aware of now doing very helpful
*  hand gestures for each hypothesis.
*  So what would be true in each of those hypothesis
*  sort of do the sort of work out what the consequences would be
*  and how they'd apply for the materials you have available.
*  And that is a sort of baby version
*  of something like hypothetical deductive reasoning,
*  which is if not the be all and end all of science
*  is at least part of it.
*  And that is also a type of reasoning
*  which necessitates you thinking
*  about different possibilities.
*  And so again, like throwing people into scenarios,
*  so long as they have the time to communicate
*  and reflect with each other,
*  really I think actually teaches in practice
*  a lot of these things as long as you sort of guide them
*  to like point out features of like,
*  well, here's what you've just done, right?
*  And so yes, like I certainly agree that like a core feature
*  of any scientific reasoning is like in some sense,
*  it's a counterintuitive,
*  but it's actually important to be reason
*  about what's not actual.
*  Like science requires that you reason about possibilities
*  which aren't true,
*  which aren't accurate descriptions of the world.
*  And that's kind of interesting in many ways.
*  I also come back to things that you first said,
*  like there's a core reason why you said like,
*  I have my model, isn't that true?
*  Like almost all models in fact involve false claims, right?
*  So that can't quite be right.
*  And so there are all these times in science
*  where kind of another thing people would learn
*  really by doing this is in some sense,
*  science doesn't just consist in like saying true things.
*  There's a bunch of like non-true stuff you have to deal with,
*  but that doesn't invalidate it either.
*  And so one of the advantage-
*  Validates it.
*  Exactly, that's how in fact we gain reliable knowledge.
*  And so one of the advantages which philosophers
*  like Heather Douglas or Philip Ketcher
*  often claim for citizens or young people
*  being able to do this kind of more engaged duty
*  and education is that a lot of attempts
*  to undermine public trust in science
*  involve pointing to these features,
*  which people aren't aware are a typical feature
*  of scientific practice,
*  but which is just part of how we do things
*  and like pointing out like, you know,
*  well, did you know that these models involve
*  a bunch of false assumptions?
*  How can you really trust what the climate scientist is saying?
*  If you knew how science works, like,
*  yeah, the models involve false assumptions.
*  That's not, it's how we do modeling, right?
*  And so, you know, by giving people practice
*  and seeing for themselves that like,
*  oh, you know, like I made some simplified assumptions,
*  that wasn't a problem,
*  that's what allowed me to get the answer.
*  It would immunize them in some sense
*  to certain kinds of spurious skeptical attacks.
*  Right, right.
*  But the idea, I really just,
*  I was repeating myself,
*  but the idea that we could be wrong,
*  you know, that we're not simply purely reasoning our way
*  to how the world works is very crucial to me in science.
*  I remember hearing a talk by an unnamed
*  evolutionary psychologist who was founding an institute
*  or something like that.
*  And, you know, they made it very clear
*  the purpose of our institute is to show
*  that blah, blah, blah is true.
*  And I wanted to raise my hand,
*  it's like, that's not really very sciencey there.
*  How about to find out whether or not it is true?
*  There's a slightly, there's a slight
*  but important distinction.
*  Well, I mean, I'm an employee
*  of the London School of Economics.
*  This department was founded by Karl Popper.
*  So, you know, I'm legally obliged
*  to agree with what you just said.
*  But there are some philosophers, heretics,
*  who might think it's at least a bit more complicated.
*  Now, I mean, you know, jokes aside,
*  I honestly am actually pretty sympathetic
*  to a broadly falsificationist view
*  of what we're up to in science.
*  It doesn't always sit so easily with the baseness,
*  let's say for now.
*  But-
*  Well, sorry, I'm much more basian.
*  I'm not very falsifiable.
*  Like, I think I got in trouble by writing a paper saying
*  the title is Beyond Falsifiability, right?
*  And to point out that, look, this was,
*  Popper put his finger on some things
*  that were really, really important,
*  but it's not the final solution to the demarcation problem.
*  And I think that basianism helps get us closer
*  to a more nuanced view.
*  Right, okay.
*  I mean, in that case, I think we're probably sympathetic.
*  Like, I think there's something to be said
*  for the falsificationist picture,
*  but I agree it's not the be-all and end-all.
*  Either way, you have this idea that you could be wrong.
*  Yes.
*  But what I was gonna mention is, you know,
*  there's a vision of scientific practice,
*  which is, in some sense, dependent from Kuhn,
*  although I'm quite sure Kuhn would probably not want
*  to be associated with some of the people
*  you perhaps have in mind.
*  Wherein, like, the way science works, right,
*  is by setting up paradigms.
*  Those paradigms involve kind of not unquestionable,
*  but at least relatively unquestioned assumptions.
*  And it's sort of legitimate to go forward.
*  Like, the way I do science is, like,
*  in light of those assumptions,
*  I'm now gonna draw out the implications and test
*  for other things you can make sense of in light of those,
*  but not necessarily test those.
*  I mean, we're in the Lakatos building right now,
*  and so Lakatos is famous for saying, you know,
*  scientific theories have a protected or hardcore
*  in the center, and that, you know,
*  eventually that can be penetrated,
*  but it's a reasonable procedure to begin with assumptions,
*  but you are less willing to give up.
*  In some sense, that actually relates to the client input
*  you were saying earlier, where many people do think
*  a sort of reasonable vision of how rational inquiry goes
*  is you have some beliefs which are much more central,
*  which are much less willing to give up,
*  and it's okay to do things by first trying to swap out
*  the less core beliefs and seeing how you can do things.
*  And of course, you can imagine a sort of
*  quasi-Basian justification.
*  Well, this is why, you know,
*  one of the issues with falsifiability
*  as a solution to the demarcation problem
*  is there's plenty of examples where I have a theory,
*  it's very well established,
*  an experimental result comes along
*  that is in contradiction to that theory,
*  and everyone in their right mind says,
*  oh, don't worry, that result will go away.
*  No, you don't.
*  I still think light goes fast,
*  you know, something's,
*  because you're fast in the spirit of light, yeah.
*  You know, it would be an example, yes, that's right.
*  Yeah, I mean, scientists, you know,
*  they have their preconditions,
*  they have their, what we call, cherished principles,
*  this is what we like to call them, right,
*  and you don't wanna give them up,
*  but eventually you end up doing it
*  if you get enough evidence against it,
*  and to me, that kind of fits in
*  with the correspondence theory a little bit.
*  Sorry, with the coherence theory,
*  I wanted to say a little bit.
*  Can you say more about how?
*  To be coherent is to be coherent
*  amongst a bunch of beliefs,
*  and like some of them will be more switch-outable
*  than others, right?
*  Right, so this-
*  Some of them will be more foundational,
*  some of your beliefs.
*  So the thing about both the primatist
*  and the coherence theories of truth
*  is they clearly pick up on aspects of our mental lives
*  which are important.
*  Like, we do in fact have goals,
*  and beliefs do help us fulfill those goals,
*  and there's some reason to prefer a belief
*  if it helps you fulfill your goal.
*  Our beliefs can be more or less coherent,
*  at least in the sense of being self-consistent
*  and not being self-consistent,
*  and you may prefer to be self-consistent.
*  I think there are two contradictions,
*  I don't know if I-
*  But like, you-
*  That's another podcast.
*  One may prefer to be self-consistent.
*  And in that case,
*  and so for that reason,
*  the coherence theory must be picking up on something
*  because it's more or less just saying
*  that particular virtue of your belief system
*  being coherent,
*  like that's the one which makes a difference for truth.
*  So what non-coherent theorists are gonna say is like,
*  we have a way of recovering within our theory
*  the importance of coherence.
*  So for instance, the correspondence theorists
*  will tend to have a metaphysical theory
*  about what the facts are,
*  and just say like,
*  it turns out that the facts can't be such
*  that they're inconsistent with each other.
*  And so if your theory is incoherent
*  in the sense of being inconsistent,
*  we know it's false
*  because we know that the facts aren't incoherent.
*  That's fair.
*  Everyone wants to be coherent
*  just whether or not that's the same one on.
*  Yeah.
*  And so, right.
*  And so what you'll find is that theories of truth,
*  and this is, I think, one of the reasons why
*  theory of truth tends to like,
*  something which kind of attracts maybe people to deflationism
*  is it tends to be the case that you can like recover
*  whatever nice things you wanna say about one theory of truth
*  within the other theory of truth.
*  And without just being a justification for deflationism,
*  it can sort of prompt the thought that like truth,
*  it doesn't really matter what you end up saying about truth.
*  You always find a way of saying the nice things
*  you wanted to be able to say anyway.
*  And so like truth isn't really doing much there.
*  You just have some additional principles
*  you're able to bring in,
*  which get you the goods you want.
*  Is it sort of a dirty little secret of philosophy
*  that so much of it is driven by things
*  you want to be the case?
*  And then finding ways to make the things
*  you wanna be the case be the case?
*  Or maybe that's a virtue, I don't even know,
*  but certainly when I think of moral philosophy,
*  that often it's a virtue.
*  But I'm inclined to.
*  Maybe even epistemology.
*  I'm not sure it's either dirty little or a secret.
*  So, but that's a secret.
*  But other than that.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's dirty.
*  So, it's certainly the case that,
*  so is it a secret?
*  I mean, people say mean things to me on the internet
*  all the time, which suggests that they think
*  this is philosophy.
*  Many of people apparently know this about philosophy.
*  Is it little or dirty?
*  And it's a bit more complicated because,
*  yes, it's true that philosophy as a field,
*  precisely because it's kind of relatively unconstrained
*  by direct empirical data or relatively unconstrained
*  by sort of rigors of proof,
*  mean that if you come in with like,
*  I'm really committed to keeping this principle,
*  you can find a way of constructing a worldview
*  which retains that principle,
*  but which has other desirable features.
*  And some philosophers more or less just think,
*  and that's the game.
*  That's what we're doing.
*  The game is you come in with the things
*  you're really committed to.
*  You're my commitments.
*  And you have to then,
*  the world will no doubt still present you with puzzles.
*  So, I just mentioned,
*  I believe there are true contradictions.
*  Suppose you don't.
*  What do you wanna say about sentences
*  like this very sentence is false?
*  So, you do believe there are true contradictions?
*  Yes, I do.
*  So, I more or less think what we wanna say
*  about this very sentence is false
*  is that it's both true and false.
*  And so, if you don't,
*  and I'm not gonna defend it right now,
*  but if you don't think that,
*  you have to tell me something
*  because it turns out there are sort of pretty minimal
*  and apparently plausible things you might say about truth,
*  which will get you that sentence is both true and false.
*  And so, it's not-
*  Roughly the alternative must be that it's meaningless
*  or unsayable out of bounds somehow.
*  So, you can out of bounds somehow.
*  You can have it sort of like not well formed
*  because you're applying a truth predicate to itself
*  in a wrong kind of way.
*  Or you can have it such that it gets no value.
*  Like it just fails to be evaluated.
*  But in any case, building a worldview,
*  which gets you either out of bounds or meaningless
*  or not well formed or whatever, that requires work.
*  And so, the thought is, it's not a trivial game,
*  even if you do come in with your strong commitments,
*  like to build a theory which does that.
*  And in the process of building those theories,
*  you often are forced to do things
*  which are themselves intellectually quite valuable.
*  And so, some people will say that this activity
*  of kind of elaborating upon
*  and defending one's core commitments
*  is actually in the end intellectually very valuable
*  because if you take that game seriously,
*  you'll find it's really difficult
*  to say it well is just a real driver of innovation.
*  Okay, some of my best friends are philosophers.
*  I don't want to.
*  No, I just, you know, I'm perfectly happy
*  with being self-loathing.
*  There you go, that works.
*  But the speaking of self-loathing,
*  let's not let scientists off the hook.
*  You already mentioned the replication crisis.
*  I wanna get a little bit down and dirty
*  into the difference between the pristine way
*  in which scientists maybe think of their own pastime
*  and the ugly truth of how it gets done.
*  And because the ugly truth always becomes
*  a little bit prettier when you really face up to it.
*  I thought you were being self-loathing.
*  I'm not self-loathing at all.
*  Like someone's gotta love me.
*  Why not me is my attitude.
*  It's certainly not the YouTube commenters.
*  I know that.
*  I love you, Sean.
*  All right.
*  So the replication crisis,
*  I think most people have heard of it,
*  but why don't we say what it is?
*  Sure.
*  So in social psychology especially,
*  but not just in social psychology,
*  it's in relatively recent years been found
*  that a bunch of results which people took to be secure,
*  which were featuring in textbooks
*  and which public interventions were being based on,
*  in fact don't replicate,
*  which is to say when we try and retest the experiments,
*  which initially validated that those phenomena were real,
*  we find either that we can't get the effect at all
*  or it's much reduced in its strength
*  or degree of influence than we initially thought.
*  So the sensing that's just replication failure.
*  What made it a crisis were in a sort of ill-defined sense,
*  this happened so many times to so many results
*  that people felt that there was
*  a sort of systematic problem here.
*  I raised that explicitly because I'm often a little bit
*  underwhelmed by the arguments for that second part.
*  Like what is the rate at which we should expect
*  true ideas in science?
*  I think people are at least blasé about assuming it's a crisis,
*  but nonetheless in the course of the fact
*  that this prompted a kind of panic reaction is too strong,
*  but this prompted quite a strong reaction
*  from the scientific community
*  in the social sciences and statistics especially,
*  and nowadays as well actually in philosophy of science,
*  led to a bunch of problems being uncovered
*  with the way science was done,
*  or at least things which people were pretty clear
*  could be improved upon.
*  And so now there's a sort of quite broad reform movement
*  sweeping through to social sciences,
*  which is trying to address the problems that's identified.
*  And presumably part of it,
*  part of the worry that it was really serious was that,
*  like you say, it's not just random,
*  but reflects systematic biases in the field.
*  When you get an exciting result,
*  that's where you publish it, right?
*  When you just get a null result, no one is gonna care.
*  Yes, I mean, one of the fascinating things
*  about the replication crisis is that a lot of the things
*  we're sort of now responding to it in light of,
*  but all of these problems,
*  people were aware of them in some sense for a long time.
*  And so there's the kind of,
*  the classic one is the file drawer problem, right?
*  Where if I get a positive result
*  suggesting there is an effect, that's exciting,
*  especially with the new thing,
*  I can go and publish that in a high prestige journal,
*  which lots of people will read and become aware of.
*  If I fail to find anything,
*  and even if I just replicate that, that's not exciting,
*  it's much hard to get published.
*  And often that information will only be available
*  to the particular scientist who did the third experiment.
*  And so there's a massive bias
*  in what kind of information
*  is transmitted to the community at large.
*  Now, that has certainly been a thing
*  which people have discussed a lot
*  in light of the replication crisis,
*  but there's no way that people only became aware
*  of this possibility inside of publishing in 2015, right?
*  Like, that's a thing people have worried about
*  for a long time.
*  And so I think one of the things
*  the replication crisis has really done
*  is like the replication failures were dramatic
*  and drew people's attention to problems,
*  but what we're actually now doing in light of that
*  is really cleaning up house
*  in ways we probably should have done a long time ago.
*  And so right now, of course, there's a lot of anger,
*  some ways people sort of argue with each other
*  about what should be done.
*  Some people are feeling defensive,
*  they feel like their life's work is under attack.
*  But in the long run, I'm actually very optimistic
*  that what this is is like only doing
*  what we should have been doing for a long time,
*  and hopefully it will lead to a much stronger,
*  much improved scientific process in the future.
*  But once you do admit that even scientists have biases,
*  then maybe they have other biases as well, right?
*  I mean, this becomes a problem of much wider scope
*  and we can start questioning,
*  I mean, people take it seriously, right?
*  It sounds like you're questioning their integrity,
*  although you're really not,
*  you're just doing epistemology in some sense.
*  Yeah, I mean, so there are all sorts of other biases
*  besides just sort of the bias towards publishable
*  or fancy or more exciting results.
*  And I've wanted to, of course, get much attention
*  as sort of like demographic,
*  like gender biases, for instance,
*  in who can get published and where.
*  We don't have those in physics,
*  but I've heard that you have those in other fields.
*  Yeah, like the gender utopia, which is physics.
*  I don't know.
*  But certainly that's like one source of bias,
*  which is really negatively affected
*  a lot of people's lives if you're being serious.
*  And so other kinds of biases you might see are,
*  for instance, towards not just things
*  which the scientific community will find exciting,
*  like in terms of publishing and fancy journals,
*  but also, and this is kind of very worrying
*  in light of what we do with science,
*  there might be biases towards like the kind of thing
*  which the media will pick up on
*  or which policy people will pick up on.
*  And so you get some cases of what look like outright fraud
*  and the outright fraud being driven basically by the sense
*  that there's a way to sort of clout with the media
*  and with policymakers.
*  And so like, yeah, all of these things
*  do influence how scientists behave.
*  They can have the social biases, which are very common.
*  They need to get published in order to advance their career.
*  In fact, most of my research is about the effects
*  those career incentives have on working scientists.
*  And also, like anyone else,
*  they wanna change the world
*  in ways they view to be desirable.
*  And so that desire to influence policymakers
*  or people who are gonna make a difference
*  about that can really affect their behavior.
*  And like, yes, like some of these seem like they admit
*  of relatively simple fixes.
*  Like it's not exactly clear
*  how to check the file door problem,
*  but they're above technical statistical,
*  actually Bayesian methods.
*  Which is statistics better.
*  These statistics better.
*  And you can also reform how journals publish
*  or like what kind of things get given uptake
*  in such a way that we can mitigate
*  at least the effects of the file door problem.
*  But like, do you have a solution for gender bias?
*  Like, and do you have a solution for the subtle influences
*  of wanting to be influential in the world?
*  Like, you know, like these things.
*  So there are a bunch of things here
*  which are gonna be like much harder
*  to really fully correct for,
*  but which are seem to be part of the phenomena
*  we know as the replication crisis.
*  I think that what we have to do kind of, so to speak,
*  is do our best to fix these things.
*  But also in some sense, it's just quite right
*  for people to decrease their trust in this institution
*  in so far as their trust was previously based
*  on a image of scientific researchers or scientists
*  the social process, which made it immune from those things.
*  It's not immune to those things.
*  And so a well-calibrated agent trusts it
*  to the degree that they've taken into account
*  the real presence of these biases.
*  Sadly, there are no well-calibrated agents, right?
*  People either think it's infallible
*  or completely untrustworthy, right?
*  That's the problem.
*  I mean, I'm not so pessimistic about that.
*  But the reason I'm not so pessimistic
*  is just because I think I encounter people quite frequently
*  who are, you know, of course not perfectly well calibrated,
*  but much better calibrated than just
*  like unthinking deference versus total skepticism
*  of the climate scientists rule in on it too,
*  style reasoning.
*  And those are people who are familiar with it as a practice.
*  I find that both philosophers of science
*  and also working scientists don't tend to have
*  this kind of attitude except about their own work, right?
*  And then that's just all you self-loathing
*  or wildly overconfident in those two options.
*  But so then relating then to that previous book on education
*  is kind of women by immunizing people.
*  I do think that like, it seems that familiarity
*  as a practice being engaged with science
*  tends to actually give you a sense of like,
*  there really is something unusually reliable about this
*  as a way of reasoning.
*  It's not just like any other way of reasoning about the world.
*  It really is something special about it.
*  But at the same time, it's not magic either.
*  And you know, it's only as good as, you know,
*  lots of smart people repeatedly failing,
*  but maybe failing a bit better could be.
*  And that's about right.
*  And so I hope that actually by sort of in some sense,
*  by bringing more people in, by giving more people
*  an experience of the practice of scientific research
*  much more calibrated to how it's actually done
*  rather than the sort of quasi-authoritarian vision
*  where it's just like, there are some laws we've discovered
*  and you have to believe these laws
*  and the test consists of you repeating these laws to me.
*  Rather than that way of doing things,
*  you give more proof of what this enterprise
*  actually involves, that would actually really help.
*  That would create those calibrated systems.
*  So I think there are some people who have it now
*  and I kind of, I'm optimistic
*  that there's a reasonably exportable method
*  of creating more people who are calibrated
*  in that kind of way.
*  It is, I would like to be optimistic also,
*  but before I become optimistic,
*  I do want to emphasize there's even more ways
*  to be pessimistic.
*  I think that, you know, when it comes to biases,
*  like gender biases and racial biases that exist in science
*  just as much as in society, sure.
*  But then there's these softer biases,
*  which probably also exist in society where, you know,
*  people who have idiosyncratic ideas will find
*  that they just don't get paid attention to
*  or they don't get jobs or they don't get grants
*  and it's not like anyone is banning them,
*  but they're just choosing not to pay attention to them
*  and their ideas can wither on the vine
*  or not get paid attention to for that reason.
*  And of course they will say,
*  it's because the system is biased against them,
*  maybe they're right or maybe their idea
*  just isn't very good, right?
*  And do we have any objective way of telling these things?
*  No, I mean, I think that one of the things
*  a well-categorized agent,
*  with regard to their trust in science,
*  just has to kind of learn is that, you know,
*  and this is a thing which I do think which Popper,
*  even if he wouldn't put it exactly as I would put it,
*  was he really had like the fundamentals of this idea
*  and to be quite specific.
*  Science is, so to speak, a quasi-evolutionary process.
*  There are lots of people throwing up lots of ideas
*  lots of the time.
*  Most of those ideas don't survive.
*  A lot of them for good reason.
*  Occasionally we'll miss one,
*  which we should have paid more attention to.
*  But so to speak, we haven't got anything better
*  than just having lots of people try their best
*  and throw themselves at a problem,
*  come up with the ideas they come up with.
*  And as long as there are incentives
*  to pay some attention to new ideas,
*  which they usually are in science,
*  we'll talk about that in a second,
*  like we can reasonably hope that eventually we will catch,
*  we will catch good, valuable new ideas
*  and we will actually have something,
*  we will eventually be able to build on them.
*  And I think those incentives to take new ideas seriously
*  do exist in science because if a new idea
*  really does work out, then I can use it to bolster my ideas.
*  The thought being that if I have access
*  to some new experimental technique, which actually works,
*  some new mathematical theory,
*  which allows me to make inferences
*  I couldn't otherwise have made or whatever,
*  then suddenly I can do a thing
*  to bolster the support for my ideas.
*  I at least have some incentive to be trying
*  to searching the field and looking out for things
*  which other people have missed,
*  which might give me an advantage
*  in the race to get my ideas taken seriously.
*  And so the incentive structure of science
*  does provide at least some push
*  towards taking those ideas seriously.
*  I'm not Pollyanna-ish, like I feel a lot of my work
*  is about how I think we can try and do this better,
*  but these are features of the present system
*  and they just need to be built upon and strengthened
*  rather than be not starting from nothing here.
*  You did propose the radical sounding idea
*  of getting rid of pre-publication peer review.
*  Is that right?
*  Yes, I did.
*  It's funny, I am someone who spends too much
*  of my life on Twitter.
*  And I'm always getting into political arguments
*  about the hot button issues of the day on twitter.com.
*  And yet nothing I have said has drawn me
*  as much controversy as the claim
*  we should get rid of pre-publication peer review.
*  So this was in co-authored work
*  with my friend and colleague, Graham Colhason.
*  And the pair of us have this paper,
*  which was kind of in some ways a summary
*  of the last few years of both of our research.
*  We'd sort of, we realized that we were sort of both
*  coming to similar conclusions.
*  We put our, put our heads together
*  and co-authored this piece.
*  And what we argue in there is that most of the things
*  which are pre-publication peer review
*  is meant to do for us,
*  there's either no evidence that it does it
*  or some evidence that it fails to do it.
*  And so-
*  So just to be clear,
*  the words pre-publication are important here.
*  So tell the audience what you,
*  how you're defining the thing that you wanna get rid of.
*  So, you know, right now, how do many fields,
*  not in all fields actually,
*  it's already changing in some fields,
*  but in many fields, the way new ideas get taken up
*  is sort of not privately, but in relatively small groups,
*  a scientist or group of scientists produce a manuscript.
*  They maybe share it with some of their friends,
*  get feedback, and then eventually
*  they will submit it to a journal.
*  The journal will have an editorial board,
*  some editors, that is to say, and reviewers.
*  And the editor will send it to reviewers,
*  the reviewers will decide whether or not
*  they think it's a good paper.
*  In light of the review's advice,
*  the editor will publish or not publish.
*  So up to that point, the people who sort of decided
*  whether or not this idea is worthy of more attention
*  from the scientific community
*  are whatever the scientist's immediate peer group,
*  the editor, and whatever the reviewers think.
*  This then decides what claims are put out there
*  to try and garner more attention or not.
*  Our point about this process is it's very labor intensive.
*  It takes a lot of time from a lot of scientists.
*  It's actually also,
*  this is not really relevant to our point,
*  but it's a fairly extortionate business.
*  Like the scientific publication houses
*  are like the most profit-making entities.
*  They're crazy.
*  Yeah, because they just get a bunch of free labor
*  from PhDs.
*  Yeah, so a small group of people have put in a lot of effort
*  to decide whether or not an idea is worth sharing.
*  It then gets out there and gets what a rough take it takes.
*  It gets once it's in a journal.
*  More or less, our question is all of that labor
*  in deciding whether or not something is worth putting out
*  to the broader community and having them assess it,
*  what does that achieve?
*  Is there anything, is there any firm evidence
*  that that's doing something good for us
*  rather than just directly having,
*  putting it out on some kind of archive,
*  which is actually increasingly the case in physics and math
*  that this is how things done.
*  Actually, economics is kind of moving this way.
*  Some fields are going this way,
*  but just putting up on some kind of publicly accessible space
*  and having going directly to the stage
*  where the community are able to assess it as a whole.
*  Philosophers often have this idea of a working paper
*  where there's a draft that for years will be on their website
*  and people comment on it before they submit it to a journal.
*  Yeah, like in some sense, kind of,
*  we want to make all of science work,
*  operate more like working.
*  More like philosophy.
*  I often think that it would be better
*  if it was more like how I think it is.
*  How I'm familiar and comfortable with it.
*  Yeah.
*  So yes, what people claim in defense of peer review
*  are a number of things and sort of the paper
*  really consists in us going through the various rationales
*  that have been offered for it
*  and trying to assess the empirical evidence for it.
*  Now, the paper is called
*  Is Pre-Publication Peer Review a Good Idea?
*  And that's partly to reflect the fact that right now
*  we think the evidence isn't always as strong
*  as we'd like it to be before making a clear assessment.
*  So we are trying, we are clear that to some extent,
*  what we want to do here is just prompt people
*  like the tradition has given us this expensive,
*  very large bureaucracy we all spend a lot of our time on.
*  Don't just inherit it and pass it on.
*  Do we want to have it and what's it doing for us?
*  And you're not even necessarily questioning peer review
*  but the idea of not letting anyone read the paper
*  until it has been peer reviewed.
*  Exactly, right?
*  We're questioning pre-publication peer review.
*  In some sense, you can say this in the paper,
*  in a sense we want more peer review, right?
*  We want more people to be able to access
*  and evaluate the paper and for the opinions
*  of the scientific community about the merits of a paper
*  to affect the judgments of more scientists, right?
*  So that's in some way what we want.
*  We kind of link it to the open science movement
*  as a sense we want open peer review.
*  In fact, open peer review though is a word
*  for a different kind of thing,
*  but related to what we're proposing.
*  Whereas the claims that for instance,
*  peer review helps us sort the good ideas
*  from the bad ideas or sort false claims from true claims.
*  There's really not much evidence
*  that peer review is achieving that.
*  And in some sense it's because science is hard, right?
*  And two people-
*  I don't think it's that hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, it's actually very hard, yeah.
*  Just kidding.
*  Two or three people deciding- Just kidding, audience.
*  No, Sean Carroll is actually winking at me now.
*  He tells me he's not kidding.
*  He means it.
*  He just thinks you're incompetent.
*  But like-
*  Irony, irony is everywhere here.
*  You never know whether I'm serious or not.
*  Like in some sense, the judgments of a couple of people
*  who just happened to have got it first,
*  they're not necessarily gonna be great at deciding
*  whether or not this really is an idea
*  which was worth-
*  We all have examples of bad papers
*  that have gotten through peer review
*  and good papers that have been stopped.
*  Yeah, and there's a kind of,
*  you don't wanna lean too much on this kind of
*  flashy but one-time experiment, but illustrative,
*  there's this kind of famous experiment
*  where people anonymized and sort of lightly changed
*  non-essential identifying details of classic papers
*  that are incredibly highly cited.
*  We submit them for review and I think it was like half
*  were rejected on grounds of serious technical flaws.
*  Well, in fact, there's another study,
*  I think that most highly cited papers were rejected
*  in one part of the real world
*  because the super highly cited papers
*  are gonna be a bit more daring, right?
*  A bit more, it's way easier as a practicing physicist,
*  I can promise.
*  And I should say parenthetically,
*  I love refereeing in peer review.
*  Like it's, I appreciate the effort that goes in
*  to making papers better,
*  both from referees and from editors.
*  I do not and I want future editors assessing my work
*  to know I don't value you.
*  I don't value what you do.
*  Having said that, if you write a paper
*  that is boring but true,
*  it's way easier to get it published
*  than if you write a paper that is interesting and daring.
*  Right, no, and that is one of the things
*  we address in the paper.
*  There's a real reason to think that
*  there's a kind of small C conservative bias in peer review.
*  Precisely because, and this is so to speak, inevitable.
*  Like whenever we assess a new idea,
*  we're assessing it in light of what we already know,
*  what we already believe, that's inevitable.
*  But the problem is, is you're preventing other people
*  from being able to engage in that practice
*  unless a relatively small number of people
*  decide it meets their standards.
*  And I think that on net,
*  this is just a disadvantageous procedure.
*  As I said, we are clear,
*  and I wish to be clear on this part, Kastat,
*  when I'm not being cheeky, my real opinion is,
*  like, there are plenty of times in the paper
*  where we say, like, what needs to happen here
*  is rather than assessing things
*  according to people's intuition about what this is doing,
*  there needs to be proper sociological work
*  on what's actually happening.
*  And very often, people don't do that.
*  They just have a sense that, you know,
*  well, surely this is the sort of thing
*  which peer review must do.
*  It must be selecting for high quality work, right?
*  Otherwise, why would we do it?
*  You know, no, look at the evidence.
*  It's not clear it is. Yeah, look at the evidence.
*  Like, it's just like the teaching of the scientific method.
*  I mean, there is this idea
*  that we can just think our way into the truth,
*  but sometimes you have to look at whether it worked.
*  Right, no, exactly.
*  And peer review is something
*  which I think is intuitive to many people,
*  that it surely can't hurt, and yet.
*  It does filter out a lot of truly bad stuff, right?
*  That is a true fact. Yes, yes.
*  It's the edge cases that we could improve.
*  Yeah, I mean, even that is kind of complicated, right?
*  Because what's the importance
*  of filtering out truly bad stuff?
*  Because people put truly bad stuff on the internet anyway.
*  I've heard.
*  So I hear, if you go to the wrong bit of the internet,
*  there are people with false opinions
*  just putting them up there.
*  They allow that.
*  Yeah, who knows?
*  The government ought to do something.
*  But in the meantime, please don't.
*  In the meantime, you know, the only different,
*  the reason it's kind of important,
*  so just scare quotes to filter things out,
*  is the sense that being put in a journal
*  kind of is in some sense a stamp of approval.
*  It's a validation of that opinion.
*  In a world without journals, what does it matter
*  that one more person puts up a wacky,
*  not very well-validated opinion on the internet?
*  What we say, the one thing where this is one of the points
*  where we acknowledge most problems for our work,
*  is we think if you really think about the world
*  of our journals, this is that thinking through
*  the hypothesis, the possibility kind of thing.
*  If you really think about that world,
*  precisely because there's no apparent authority figure
*  saying this is worth taking seriously,
*  a lot of the things which peer review is meant to do,
*  we don't lose anything by not having it.
*  That said, there is something valuable
*  about having a means by which non-scientists
*  who might be interested in science
*  can know where to look for the decent ideas.
*  Now again, that peer review should-
*  Or even scientists in a different field.
*  Yes, yeah, oh yeah, exactly,
*  or people who just not expert in the topic matter.
*  Now of course, that peer review is a good way of doing that,
*  kind of depends on you thinking it's selecting
*  for good ideas, which we previously argued against.
*  But even if peer review isn't doing that,
*  it's probably a good idea for something to be doing that.
*  And so to speak, right now peer review
*  is de facto how we're doing it.
*  Maybe a good thing to invest time and mental effort
*  into doing would be thinking about
*  how to do that in a better way.
*  Okay, so that's one example of the bomb throwing.
*  Maybe to wrap things up,
*  we should talk about standpoint epistemology.
*  I was just wondering, one example of the bomb throwing,
*  what's the other?
*  Oh.
*  You know, I think that, look,
*  I think the case that has been made indubitably
*  over the course of this podcast is
*  gaining true knowledge of the world,
*  whatever that means, is hard, right?
*  Is sticky and it's not quite as algorithmic
*  as our high school educations
*  might have led us to believe.
*  And once you admit that, it opens up
*  a whole bunch of things like who decides
*  and how do we decide where the truth is once we found it?
*  I mean, is this kind of consideration,
*  I mean, maybe you'll tell us
*  what standpoint epistemology is,
*  but how serious is the connection
*  between this sort of social sciency
*  or even philosophical sounding idea
*  and the real practice of science?
*  All right, well, this is a big one.
*  So standpoint epistemology is a sort of idea
*  which comes out of, actually comes out of Marxist theory,
*  but sort of gets more famously taken up
*  in feminist theory in the late 20th century.
*  And which nowadays in the early 21st century
*  for future listeners is-
*  You're an optimist at heart.
*  Yeah, I think climate change-
*  Like 23rd century listeners are gonna be like,
*  oh, thank you.
*  I just think climate change isn't gonna kill us
*  quick enough for that to be irrelevant to people.
*  So which nowadays is kind of like becomes
*  sort of a heated topic of dispute
*  outside of just the academic circles where it began.
*  The broad idea stated very generally,
*  very loosely of standpoint epistemology
*  is something like who you are,
*  what social position you occupy makes a difference
*  to who, like what you can know
*  and how reliable you're gonna be
*  at certain kinds of reasoning tasks.
*  So is it really what you can know
*  or how you know it or both?
*  Depending on formulation can be either or both.
*  Okay, because what you can know,
*  that's a really radical claim.
*  Well, funny enough, I was gonna say
*  that what you can know is the easier one to defend.
*  I mean, so I have, insofar as I've waded
*  into this debate at all, it's from an old blog post
*  where I argued that if you look at kind of
*  some of the precise formulations
*  or the more detailed formulations of standpoint epistemology
*  which exists in kind of internet philosophy,
*  excited pedes or places where people are trying
*  to define it clearly for public audience,
*  then it looks more or less just like the,
*  it looks to be so long as you believe that
*  what kind of experiences you've had in your life
*  make a difference to what kind of things
*  you'll be a reliable informant about,
*  then some kind of standpoint epistemology
*  is gonna be true, right?
*  So if you assume that in a very segregated town,
*  but where the, say in the 1950s America,
*  the black people are gonna be the janitorial
*  and the maid staff, the white people,
*  then the black people are gonna know
*  both about the black quarter and the white quarter.
*  But the white people aren't gonna go
*  into the black bit of town.
*  And so if you're asking people about this town,
*  its layout, where things are,
*  and you've got limited time and resources,
*  concentrate on the black people.
*  Especially sort of the black working class people,
*  they're more likely to know about the time
*  and layout of this, the structure and layout of this town,
*  just because they experience more of it.
*  And that's a kind of, that's a very basic example.
*  I'm not saying that that would be the most efficient way
*  of finding about this town,
*  but there is some reason to think that if you are
*  picking an informant in that kind of way,
*  a thing, a reasonable correlate for you to look out for
*  is the demographics of who they are,
*  what kind of social position they occupy.
*  I mean, it's kind of inarguable that there are correlations
*  between one's identity markers and one's knowledge.
*  Right, exactly.
*  And so in some forms, like standpoint epistemology
*  can more or less just be trying to think
*  through the implications of that fact.
*  And so, okay, in that case, that might make a difference
*  if you're doing certain kinds of ethnography
*  or certain kinds of anthropology or sociology of this town.
*  And so already, while the kind of, at a high level,
*  it's sort of obvious point, like in practice,
*  it might make a difference to how you carry,
*  your research design, who you wanna ask things.
*  And so even that apparently trivial point
*  can have implications.
*  And what's more implications, which is sometimes forgot.
*  There are classic examples,
*  which I'm not gonna remember quite right,
*  but I'm gonna get you the broad structure of
*  for early 20th century anthropology,
*  where you'll find that anthropologists
*  were literally only interviewing the men in town
*  because they had some sense,
*  it wasn't just their own biases.
*  They did have some sense that the men were the important ones
*  who knows what's up.
*  I think partly-
*  I think you've gotten rid of that.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So partly based on their biases,
*  partly based on what informants
*  were telling them about the town,
*  except there were times, you know, the male informants.
*  But there were-
*  Coherence theory, true.
*  But there were times in some of the rituals
*  they were interested in when the men and women
*  would go into different places.
*  And then of course, if you only interview the men,
*  you literally just can't find out
*  about some of what's going on here.
*  And so it sounds trivial, but there have been times
*  when people, even that simple correlation point
*  has been forgot.
*  And it has been forgot in ways which track
*  people tending to trust more of those
*  at the top of social hierarchies.
*  And that just doesn't, it doesn't always work like that.
*  And so I think even it's very simple form,
*  standpoint epistemology can be contentful and important.
*  I actually think another more controversial,
*  but I would defend it as the same instance,
*  is actually the Me Too movement.
*  A lot of the, like the slogan, believe women,
*  I think there's a very reasonable explanation of it.
*  Well, there are lots of reasonable explanations of it,
*  but one reasonable thing it's picking up on
*  is like, if you were going to a workplace
*  and you want to know who's going to like reliably say
*  who's a sexual predator, who's dangerous here,
*  then you have to think of who has the authority
*  to get away with things and what's the distribution
*  of hetero versus other kinds of sexuality.
*  And it's going to be like just many heterosexual men
*  have power in office places.
*  And so it's mainly going to be women
*  who are going to be the ones with the relevant knowledge.
*  And so there's some strong reason to like believe them,
*  to trust them, they're the ones who know.
*  And so again, that seems to me to fall out.
*  That's a very contentful point,
*  but it falls out of the quite basic thing.
*  Now, let me say, that's the point
*  where I think standpoint epistemology is non-trivial,
*  has implications for scientific and social life
*  and which we could afford to take more seriously.
*  There are other versions of standpoint epistemology
*  which apparently do want to be saying a stronger thing.
*  And so often the slogan would be a standpoint
*  is an achievement.
*  And this is again, goes back to the original
*  Marxist formulation, but has some of the other
*  more modern formulations also have this feature.
*  Wherein the idea, like the idea of your social position
*  gives you access to certain kinds of knowledge
*  isn't just meant to be sort of an empirical fact that,
*  well, these kinds of people tend to have
*  these kinds of experiences that have so a high rate
*  of chance or something like that.
*  But rather there's something which is a more substantial
*  thing, which is like the proletariat standpoint,
*  which is seeing things from the perspective of like
*  a worldview properly attuned to those people's interests
*  or something like that.
*  And seeing things from that worldview
*  will tend to be producing more accurate
*  or more informed worldview.
*  I think with that one,
*  spelling out the content of that standpoint
*  in that sense that the achievement,
*  the property proletariat or women's or whatever standpoint,
*  I think that becomes philosophically much more difficult
*  because like, you can just imagine, right?
*  Like what is the true woman's standpoint?
*  Like-
*  And it becomes a little normative also in a different way
*  than simply epistemologically.
*  You what I mean, it's meant to be, in some sense,
*  epistemology just tends to be normative, right?
*  Like we're trying to say, when we say what knowledge is,
*  usually knowledge is taken to be a good thing.
*  And so if I tell you what knowledge is,
*  I'm in some sense saying you have to succeed by way of belief.
*  And this is only, it's just kind of trying to do that as well.
*  Like I'm just, people who sort of have this stronger version
*  will say like the proletariat standpoint
*  or the standpoint of oppressed women or something like that,
*  that standpoint is more successful
*  at knowledge gathering and producing.
*  So there's an empirical claim that could be tested.
*  Well, I mean, I'm not a good spokesperson for this view
*  because I don't believe it.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  But like, they might not want to agree to that, right?
*  Because it depends what you mean by empirically test it.
*  Because if these standpoints can come apart,
*  what kind of things are going to count
*  as methods of validating knowledge,
*  then it might look, you might worry that any test you do
*  is gonna potentially.
*  It has to be relative to that.
*  It has to be relative to the thing.
*  And it'll either be circular or biased against it.
*  Okay.
*  And so.
*  Well, then it becomes less interesting to me.
*  I mean, if it's just true by construction
*  or irrefutable, I guess.
*  Oh, my part's going to be.
*  So.
*  But just to make it super duper clear,
*  none of this is going to claim that
*  whether you're black or white or male or female
*  or cis or trans affects whether the universe is expanding.
*  Oh, no.
*  Or whether you know the universe is expanding, right?
*  It's not like who your identity is
*  affects the truth about the world.
*  That's just not.
*  No, right?
*  So I guess some brave soul might wish to argue as much,
*  but typically the kind of claims people are concerned
*  over the sort of things I had to talk about.
*  So it's going to be about power relations in the workplace
*  or.
*  Human experience.
*  Like where's safe to go in this town
*  if it's a sundown town, you know, that kind of stuff.
*  And so usually if you look at.
*  This is the thing for all of the kind of cultural controversy
*  around it, often not always,
*  but often if you look at the kind of claims standpoint
*  that the epistemologists are interested in,
*  it's usually sort of independently plausible
*  that like the sort of people they're saying have an advantage
*  of some sort in knowledge gathering
*  would have an advantage about knowledge gathering in that case.
*  I in no means wish to say that's in all cases
*  uncontroversial, in many cases there are gonna be controversies,
*  but there's a kind of sort of core set of examples
*  which people will tend to find plausible.
*  And then it's just how far can you expand that
*  rather than whether or not there are any.
*  People don't usually expand it all the way
*  to like the fundamental forces of the physical,
*  the cosmos or something like that.
*  Well, I think that I bring that up intentionally
*  because I guess my first exposure to ideas in this universe
*  was as an undergraduate taking philosophy courses
*  for the first time.
*  There's sort of two extremes that are equally silly.
*  One extreme, silly in my view anyway,
*  one extreme is that super radical view
*  where like who you are literally changes
*  the physical truth of the world.
*  And the other is that must be what you mean to be claiming
*  if there's any relationship between who you are
*  and what you know about the world.
*  And I think that so the lesson of all that we're saying here
*  is that there is a difficult but good place to be
*  in the middle of these claims.
*  Yeah, and I know that that way of phrasing things actually,
*  and I think you're quite right that that is often
*  how the debate is carried out.
*  And that way of phrasing things actually comes back
*  to something we discussed right at the beginning,
*  which is a thing which I think philosophical reflection
*  tends to get one to be more careful about
*  is separating out claims about how you know
*  and claims out what's true.
*  And so very often some of the most heated debate about,
*  about for instance, standpoint epistemology,
*  people attribute to standpoint epistemologists
*  who are saying who you are makes a difference
*  to what you know,
*  the claim that who you are makes a difference to what's true.
*  And those are very different claims.
*  And one of them is far more plausible than the other.
*  I mean, and so to speak,
*  standpoint epistemologists are paying a special attention
*  to social positions, especially social positions
*  in hierarchies of relationships of oppression.
*  But in some sense, everyone's gonna be a kind of standpoint
*  of epistemology, something like presumably having received
*  a PhD in physics puts you in a better position
*  to understand and reason about.
*  I probably know something.
*  Yeah, exactly, right.
*  So everyone thinks that some life experiences
*  are gonna be pertinent here.
*  The standpoint epistemologists are just drawing attention
*  to a class of experiences of being oppressed
*  in certain kind of ways,
*  which they say makes some different differences
*  in these areas.
*  So sort of the basic idea behind standpoint epistemology
*  is should be sort of no more foreign to you

*  the universe is expanding depends on whether
*  you have a physics PhD, right?
*  And it's the same thing.
*  Well, this is good because it makes it sound like
*  I had an organization in mind when we started talking
*  and that always makes me look good,
*  even if it's just kind of random.

*  All right, Liam Kofiebryde,
*  thanks so much for being on the podcast.
*  Thanks for having me, Sean.
