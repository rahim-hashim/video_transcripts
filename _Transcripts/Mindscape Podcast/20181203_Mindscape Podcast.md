The "Easy Problems" of consciousness have to do with how the brain takes in information, thinks about it, and turns it into action. The "Hard Problem," on the other hand, is the task of explaining our individual, subjective, first-person experiences of the world. What is it like to be me, rather than someone else? Everyone agrees that the Easy Problems are hard; some people think the Hard Problem is almost impossible, while others think it's pretty easy. Today's guest, David Chalmers, is arguably the leading philosopher of consciousness working today, and the one who coined the phrase "the Hard Problem," as well as proposing the philosophical zombie thought experiment. Recently he has been taking seriously the notion of panpsychism. We talk about these knotty issues (about which we deeply disagree), but also spend some time on the possibility that we live in a computer simulation. Would simulated lives be "real"? (There we agree -- yes they would.)

 David Chalmers got his Ph.D. from Indiana University working under Douglas Hoftstadter. He is currently University Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science at New York University and co-director of the Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness. He is a fellow of the Australian Academy of Humanities, the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among his books are The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory, The Character of Consciousness, and Constructing the World. He and David Bourget founded the PhilPapers project.

# Episode 25: David Chalmers on Consciousness, the Hard Problem, and Living in a Simulation
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 03, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myl_gnRxh94)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. If any of
*  you have read The Big Picture, my most recent book, you know that one of the things we have
*  to think about if we're naturalists trying to come to terms with the world of our experience
*  is the phenomenon of consciousness. Actually, most of you probably know that even if you haven't
*  read that book, it's a pretty well-known fact. The question, of course, is what is demanded of us by
*  the fact of consciousness? Can we simply hope to explain consciousness using the same tools we
*  explain other things with, atoms and particles moving according to the laws of physics, according
*  to the standard model and the core theory, or do we need something else somehow that helps us explain
*  what consciousness is and how it came about? So I'm someone who thinks we don't need anything else.
*  I think it's just understanding the motion and interactions of physical stuff from which
*  consciousness emerges as a higher-level phenomenon. Our guest today is David Chalmers,
*  who is probably the most well-known and respectable representative of the other side,
*  the people who think that you need something beyond just the laws of physics as we currently
*  know them to account for consciousness. David is the philosopher who coined it the term the
*  hard problem of consciousness, the idea being that the easy problems are, you know, how you look at
*  things and why you react in certain ways, how you do math problems in your head, the hard problem
*  being our personal experience, what it is like to be you or me rather than somebody else, the
*  first-person subjective experience. That's the hard problem and someone like me thinks, oh yeah,
*  we'll get there, it's just a matter of words and understanding and philosophy. Someone like David
*  thinks we need a real change in our underlying way of looking at the world. So he describes
*  himself as a naturalist, someone who believes in just the natural world, no supernatural world,
*  not a dualist who thinks it's a disembodied mind or anything like that, but he's not a physicalist.
*  He thinks that the natural world has not only natural properties, not only physical properties,
*  but mental properties as well. So I would characterize him as convinced of the problem,
*  but he's not wedded to any particular answer. David Chalmers is a philosopher who everyone
*  respects, even if they don't agree with him. He's a delight to talk to because he is very open-minded
*  about considering different things. Like I said, he's convinced of this problem, but when it comes
*  to solving the problem, he will propose solutions, but he won't take them too dogmatically. He will
*  change his mind when good arguments come along. So he's a great person to talk to about this very,
*  very important problem for naturalists when they try to confront how to understand what it means to
*  be a human being and where consciousness comes from. Also, David has developed a recent interest
*  in the simulation hypothesis, the idea that maybe we could all be living in a simulation running on
*  a computer owned by a very, very advanced civilization in a completely different reality.
*  So we'll talk about the hard problem of consciousness. We'll talk about various
*  philosophical issues, and I won't pin him down on anything. I'm not trying to argue with him.
*  My point here is not to convince David Chalmers in real time that he's wrong,
*  but rather to let you, the listeners, hear what his perspective is on these issues,
*  and then hear what my perspective is on these issues, and decide for yourself. Maybe you'll
*  change your mind either right now or sometime down the road. So this is a fun conversation.
*  I'm sure you'll like it, and let's go.
*  David Chalmers, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thanks. It's great to be here.
*  So I've discovered in my brief history of having philosophers on the podcast that there's a lot
*  to say, that we have a lot of ground to cover. I know that you especially have all sorts of
*  interests. Let's just jump right into the crowd pleasing things that we can talk about. You're
*  one of the world's experts on the philosophy of consciousness. I believe we're the one who coined
*  the phrase, the hard problem of consciousness. So how would you define what the hard problem is?
*  The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how physical processes in the brain
*  somehow give rise to subjective experience. So when you think about the mind, there's a whole
*  lot of things that need to be explained. Some of them involve our sophisticated behavior,
*  all the things we can do. We can get around, we can walk, we can talk, we can communicate with
*  each other, we can solve scientific problems. But a lot of that is a level of sophisticated
*  behavioral capacities, things we can do. And when it comes to explaining behavior,
*  we got a pretty good bead on how to explain it. In principle, at least, you find a circuit in the
*  brain, complex neural system, which may be perform some computations, produces some outputs,
*  generates the behavior, then in principle, you've got an explanation may take a century or two
*  to work out the details. But that's roughly the standard model in cognitive science.
*  And you've wrapped this together as the easy problem.
*  Yeah. So this is what 20 odd years ago, I called the easy problem slightly tongue in cheek of the
*  mind and of consciousness in particular, roughly referring to these behavioral problems. Nobody
*  thinks they're easy in any ordinary sense. The sense in which they're easy is that we know that
*  we've got a paradigm for explaining them. Find a neural mechanism or a computational mechanism.
*  That's the kind of thing that could produce that behavior. In principle, find the right one,
*  tell the right story, you'll have an explanation. But when it comes to consciousness,
*  to subjective experience, it looks as if that method doesn't so obviously apply.
*  I mean, there are some aspects of consciousness which are roughly speaking behavioral or functional,
*  you could use the word consciousness for the difference between being awake and responsive,
*  for example, versus being asleep, or for maybe just for the ability to talk about
*  certain things I can talk about the fact that, hey, there's Sean Carroll.
*  There are some books over there and I'm hearing my voice and those are some reports.
*  Explaining those reports might also be an easy problem. But the really distinctive problem of
*  consciousness is posed not by the behavioral parts, but by the subjective experience, by how it feels
*  from the inside to be a conscious being. I'm seeing you right now, I have a visual image of
*  colors and shapes that are sort of present to me as an element in the inner movie of the mind.
*  I'm hearing my voice, I'm feeling my body, I've got a stream of thoughts running through my head,
*  and this is what philosophers call consciousness or subjective experience.
*  I take it to be one of the fundamental facts about ourselves that we have this kind of subjective
*  experience, but then the question is how do you explain it? The reason why we call it the hard
*  problem is it looks like the standard method of just explaining behaviors and explaining the things
*  we do doesn't quite come to grips with the question of why is there subjective experience.
*  It seems you could explain all of these things we do, the walking, the talking, the reports,
*  the reasoning, and so why doesn't all that go on in the dark? Why do we need subjective experience?
*  That's the hard problem. So sometimes I hear it glazed as the question of what it is like to be
*  a subjective agent, to be a person. That's a good definition of consciousness actually first put
*  forward or at least made famous by my colleague Tom Nagel here at NYU in an article back in 1974
*  called What is it like to be a bat? His thought was, well we don't know what it's like to be a
*  bat. We don't know what a bat's subjective experience is like. It's got this weird sonar
*  perceptual capacity which doesn't really correspond directly to anything that
*  humans have, but presumably there is something it's like to be a bat. A bat is conscious.
*  So most people would say on the other hand there's nothing it's like to be a glass of water.
*  Say if that's right then a glass of water is not conscious. So what it's like way of speaking
*  is a good way at least of serving as an initial intuition pump for what is the basic difference
*  we're getting at between systems which are conscious and systems which are not.
*  And the other word that is sometimes invoked in this context is qualia, the experiences that
*  we have. There's one thing that is to see the color red and a separate thing if I get it right
*  to have the experience of the redness of red. Yeah this word qualia, my senses have gone a little
*  bit out of favor over the last say 20 odd years, but maybe 20 years ago you heard a lot of people
*  speaking of qualia as a word for the sensory qualities that you come across in experience.
*  And the paradigmatic ones would be the experience of red versus the experience of green. You can
*  raise all this familiar questions about this. How do I know that my experience of the things we call
*  red is the same, maybe it's the same as the experience you have when you're confronted with
*  the things we call green. You know maybe your internal experiences are swapped with respect to
*  mine and people call that inverted qualia. That would be your red is my green or pain would be
*  another example of a the singular in latin is qualae. So the feeling of pain would be a
*  qualae. I'm not sure that these qualities are all there is though to consciousness and maybe that's
*  one reason why it's gone out of favor. There's also maybe an experience to thinking and to reasoning
*  and to feeling. It's much harder to pin down in terms of sensory qualities but there's still
*  you might think something it's like to think and to reason even though it's not the same as
*  what it's like to sense. I want to just for a little bit talk about this question of whether
*  or not you and I have the same experience when we see the color red. I'm not sure I know what
*  that could possibly mean for it to be either the same experience or a different experience. I mean
*  one is going on in my head one is going on in your head. In what sense could they be the same? But
*  maybe when I say that it's just a reflection of the fact that there's a hard problem. Well we know
*  some people for example to pick a much easier case some people are colorblind. They can't they
*  don't even make a distinction between red and green. They're red green you know most people have
*  a red green axis for color vision and a blue yellow axis and something like a brightness
*  axis. But some people due to things going wrong in their retinal mechanisms don't even make the
*  distinction between red and green. So I can I've got friends who are red green colorblind. I'm often
*  asking you know what is it like to be you? Is it like you just see everything in shades of blue and
*  yellow and you don't get the reds and greens or is it something different entirely? But we know
*  what it's like to be them can't be the same as what it's like to be us because for example
*  reds and greens which are different for us are the same for them. So there's got to be some
*  difference between us as a matter of logic. My red can't be the same as their red and my green
*  can't be the same as if my red was the same as their red and my green was the same as their green
*  and their red was the same. We know their red is the same as their green then my red couldn't be
*  different from my green but it is. As a matter of logic there has to be some difference there.
*  But isn't so one way out is just well everybody who is different from everybody else their
*  experiences are different. I guess the question then is in what sense could they ever be the same?
*  What is it what is the meaningfulness? And I can imagine some kind of operational sameness right
*  like you say the word red when you see the word red in that behavioral sense but that's exactly
*  what you don't want to count. Yeah so I guess intuitively most people think that we can you
*  know at least grasp the idea that my red is the same as your red and then it's an empirical open
*  question but they are in fact exactly the same. I mean you're saying well it is unclear how you
*  could operationalize that matter. Now you might say I'm a scientist I want an operational test
*  on the other hand I'm a philosopher and I'm very skeptical of the idea that you want you can
*  operationalize everything that you know a hypothesis has got to be operationalizable to be
*  meaningful. I mean there was a movement in philosophy in the first part of the 20th century
*  logical positivism or logical empiricism where they said the only meaningful hypotheses are the
*  ones we can we can test and for various reasons that turned out to have a lot of problems not
*  least because this very this very philosophical hypothesis of verificationism turned out not to
*  be one that you could test. So there's a a renaissance of logical positivism on philosophy
*  Twitter these days. Oh is that right yeah Rudolf Karnap who was one of the great logical positivists
*  is one of my one of my heroes personally I read a whole book called Constructing the World that was
*  partly uh partly based around some of his ideas nonetheless verificationism is not one of the ones
*  okay and I think when it comes to consciousness in particular we're dealing with something
*  essentially subjective yeah I know I'm conscious not because I measured my behavior or anybody
*  else's behavior it's because it's something I experienced directly from the first person
*  point of view I think you're probably conscious but you know it's not as if I can give a straight
*  out operational definition of it if you say you're conscious then you're conscious it's like who's to
*  say that doesn't most people think that doesn't absolutely settle the question maybe we'd come up
*  with an AI that says it's conscious and okay well that would be very interesting but would it
*  settle the question of whether it's having subjective experience probably not well so Alan
*  Turing tried right the Turing test was supposed to be a way to judge what's conscious from what's
*  not what are your feelings about the success of that program I think it's not a bad I mean of
*  course no no machine right now is remotely close to passing the Turing test say what the Turing test
*  is yeah so the Turing test is the idea that uh it's basically a test to see whether a machine
*  can behave uh in a manner indistinguishable from a normal human being at least in a verbal
*  conversation over say you know text messaging and uh and the like and Turing thought that
*  eventually will have machines that pass this test that is they're indistinguishable from say another
*  human interlocutor over hours of conversational testing then he didn't say at that point then
*  machines can think what he said was at that point the question of whether machines can think becomes
*  basically meaningless right and I've provided an operational definition to uh to substitute for it
*  so once they pass this test he says that's good enough for me yeah he talked in the paper about
*  the consciousness objection you might say that it's just mimicking consciousness but not really
*  conscious and he's as I recall his response is well who cares I can't possibly test that therefore
*  it's not meaningful but it turns out the consciousness is one of the things that we value
*  a it's one of the central properties of our of our minds and two many of us think it's what
*  actually gives our minds gives our lives meaning and value if we weren't conscious we didn't have
*  subjective experience then we'd basically just be you know automata for whom nothing has any
*  meaning or value so I think when it comes to the question once we develop more and more sophisticated
*  ai's the question of whether they're conscious is going to be absolutely central to how we treat
*  them to whether they have moral status whether we should you know care whether they continue to live
*  or die whether they get rights and so on I think many people think if they're not having
*  subjective experiences and they're basically machines that we can treat the way we can
*  we treat machines but if they're having conscious experiences like ours then it would be horrific
*  to treat them the way we currently treat machines so yeah I mean if you just simply
*  operationalize all those questions and there's a danger I think that you lose the things which are
*  really the things that we really care about and just so we can get our sort of um background
*  assumptions on the table here for the most part neither you or I are coming from a strictly dualist
*  perspective we're not trying to explain consciousness in terms of a Descartesian disembodied immaterial
*  mind that is a separate substance right I mean we want to at least as the as the first hypothesis
*  say that you and I are made of atoms we're obeying the laws of physics and the consciousness is
*  somehow related to that but not an entirely separate category interacting with us is that
*  right so fair yeah although there's different kinds and different degrees of of dualism I mean
*  my background is very much in mathematics and computer science and physics and all of my
*  instincts my first instincts are a materialist to try to explain everything in terms of ultimately
*  in terms of the processes of physics and we explain you know biology in terms of chemistry
*  and chemistry in terms of physics and this is a wonderful great chain of great chain of
*  explanation but I do think when it comes to consciousness this is the the one place where
*  that great chain of explanation seems to break down roughly because when it comes to biology
*  and chemistry and all these other fields the things that need explaining are all basically these
*  easy problems of structure and dynamics and ultimately the behaviors of these systems when
*  it comes to consciousness we seem to have something different that needs explaining and I think that
*  the standard kinds of explanation say that you get out of physics derived sciences physics chemistry
*  biology neuroscience and so on just ultimately won't add up to an explanation of subjective
*  experience because it always leaves open this further question why is all that sophisticated
*  processing accompanied by consciousness by subjective experience that doesn't mean though
*  we suddenly need to say it's all properties of say a soul or some religious thing which has existed
*  since the beginning of time and we'll go on to continue after our death people sometimes call
*  that substance dualism maybe there's a whole separate substance that's the mental substance
*  and somehow interacts connects up with our physical bodies and interacts with it yeah that that view
*  is much harder to connect to a scientific view of the world but the direction I end up going
*  is what people sometimes call property dualism the idea that there are some extra properties
*  of things in the universe I mean this is something we're used to in physics already people have you
*  know maybe around the time of Maxwell we had a we had physical theories that took space and time
*  and mass as fundamental and then Maxwell wanted to explain electromagnetism and there was a project
*  of trying to explain it in terms of space and time and mass so now turns out it didn't quite work you
*  couldn't explain it mechanically and eventually we uh we ended up positing charge as a fundamental
*  property and some new laws governing um governing electromagnetic phenomena and that was just an
*  extra property right in our scientific picture of the world so I'm inclined to think that something
*  not exactly analogous to that but at least analogous to that in some respects is what we have to do
*  with consciousness as well basically explanations in terms of space and time and mass and charge
*  and whatever the fundamentals are in physics these days are not going to add up to an explanation of
*  consciousness so we need another fundamental property right there as well and you know one
*  working hypothesis is let's take consciousness as an irreducible element of the world and then see if
*  we can come up with a scientific explanation of it good I think this is uh I mean we should absolutely
*  be open to that I don't go down that road myself I don't find it very convincing but maybe you know
*  in the next 45 minutes you'll convince me so I do want to get there but let's lay a little bit more
*  groundwork first so one of the things that a lot of the statements I'm going to be making over the
*  course of the chat are of the form I think this is right correct me if I'm wrong so I think one of
*  the things that makes the hard problem hard is just the fact that you can't even imagine looking
*  at neurons doing something and saying aha that explains it is that fair to say yeah um I would
*  say that what we when you appeal to neural activity and explaining phenomena there's a
*  paradigmatic way that works we see how those neurons serve as a mechanism for performing
*  some function ultimately generating some behavior that is the paradigmatic appeal to
*  to uh to neurobiology in explanation and it just looks like any explanation of that form
*  is not going to add up to an explanation of consciousness it explains the wrong thing it
*  will explain behavior but those with easy problems explaining consciousness was something
*  distinct that's the hard problem so you think that even if and this we're very far away from
*  this but even if neuroscientists got to the point where for every time that a person was doing
*  something we would all recognize as having a conscious experience even if it was silent you
*  know experiencing the redness of red they could point to exactly the same neural activity going
*  on in the brain you would say yes but this still doesn't explain my subjective experience
*  yeah that's in fact a very uh very important research program going on right now in neuroscience
*  and people call it the program of finding neural correlates of consciousness the ncc uh for short
*  hand we're trying to find the ncc that neural system or systems is active precisely when you're
*  conscious and that correlates perfectly with consciousness which i say it's a very very
*  important research program but it's really as it stands a program for correlation not for
*  explanation so we could know that say when a certain special kind of neuron fires in a
*  certain pattern that that neural pattern always goes along with consciousness but then the next
*  question then is why explain that fact why is it that this pattern gives you consciousness
*  and as it stands nothing that we get out of the neural correlates of consciousness program in
*  neuroscience comes close to uh explaining that matter and i think a lot of people
*  once they start to think about this thing we basically need some further fundamental principle
*  that connects the neural correlate of consciousness with consciousness itself i mean
*  julio tannoni has developed a theory integrated information theory where he says consciousness
*  goes along with a certain mathematical measure of the integration of information that he calls phi
*  and the more fire you have the more consciousness you have and phi is a mathematically and physically
*  respectable quantity very hard to measure but in principle but you can define it could be measured
*  i mean there's questions about whether it's actually well defined in terms of the details of
*  physics and physical systems but it's at least you know halfway to being something something
*  definable but even if even if he's right that phi this informational property of the brain correlates
*  perfectly with consciousness there's still the question of why why i mean prime aficionado looks
*  like you could have had a universe with all of this integration of information going on and no
*  consciousness at all and yet in our universe there's consciousness how do we explain that
*  fact well i think the what i regard is the scientific thing to do at this point to say okay
*  well we bought in science we boil everything down to fundamental principles and fundamental laws
*  and if we need to postulate a fundamental law that connects a fire with consciousness
*  then that's great and then that will maybe that's going to end up being the best we can do just as
*  in say in in physics you always end up with some fundamental laws whether it's a principle of
*  gravitation or a grand unified theory that unifies all these different forces you still end up with
*  some fundamental principles and you don't explain them further something has to be taken as basic
*  and the question of course we want to minimize our fundamental principles and minimize our
*  fundamental properties as far as we can but you know occam's razor says don't multiply entities
*  without necessity every now and then there's necessity maxwell had necessity and if i'm right
*  there's necessity in this case too and you hinted at or you you sort of alluded to an idea that is
*  one of your most famous philosophical thought experiments just there where you say you can
*  imagine a system with whatever file you want but we wouldn't call it conscious so you take this idea
*  to the extreme and say there can be something that looks and acts just like a person but doesn't
*  have consciousness so this is the philosopher's thought experiment of the zombie the philosopher's
*  zombie is somewhat different from the ones you find in hollywood movies or in you know haitian
*  voodoo culture the ones in voodoo culture as far as i can tell are mostly beings that have been given
*  some kind of point people have been given some kind of poison and somehow seem to be lacking
*  autonomy volition a certain kind of free will the ones in hollywood movies are beings which
*  are a lot like us but they're dead and reanimated and they want brains the philosopher zombie is a
*  creature which is exactly like us functionally and maybe physically but isn't conscious now it's very
*  important to say nobody certainly not me is arguing that zombies actually exist that for example some
*  human beings around us are zombies actually i did once meet a philosopher in
*  in dublin who was very concerned that quite a lot of philosophers actually were zombies they
*  weren't they weren't conscious at all and i was i was a little bit insulted by this he seemed to
*  be worried about me he took me to lunch he took me to lunch and he asked me a whole lot of questions
*  about uh about consciousness and at the end he said okay you pass i think i think you're conscious
*  okay but a zombie could also pass right i mean so so is it right to say that a zombie
*  i don't think it'd be we let you finish your definition yet but a zombie would be behaviorally
*  the same but yeah behaviorally the same but no conscious experience there's nothing it's like
*  to be a zombie maybe a good way to work up to this is by thinking about say some sophisticated
*  artificial intelligence system the producers lots of intelligent responses maybe it talks to you
*  maybe an extension of you know alexa or siri who carries on a very sophisticated conversation with
*  us but most of us are not inclined to think let's say alexa and siri as they stand are conscious
*  that they're having subjective experiences okay now put alexa in a body like uh like sofia the
*  robot is a robot that's out there with a very sophisticated conversational system make her
*  smarter and uh and smarter and then there's at least an open question is she going to be
*  conscious and we can make sense of the hypothesis that she's conscious we can also make sense of the
*  of the hypothesis that there's not that she's not the extreme case is going to be a complete
*  physical and functional duplicate of a human being with all the brain processing intact all of the
*  behavior maybe even a complete physical duplicate of sean carroll and i think i can make sense of
*  the hypothesis when i talk to you that there'd be such a being who's not conscious zombie sean carroll
*  now i'm very confident that you're not zombie sean carroll i think most human beings are enough
*  like me that they're uh they're going to be conscious but the point is at least seems logically
*  possible it seems there's no contradiction in the idea of a being physically just like you without
*  consciousness and that's just one way of getting at the idea that somehow well where you do have
*  consciousness then something special and extra has to be going on something you can just put
*  the hard problem of consciousness as the problem of why why aren't we zombies right what differentiates
*  us from zombies and with some trepidation let me ask the question how the difference between
*  possible and conceivable comes into the zombie argument yeah i mean philosophers like to talk
*  about possible worlds what goes on in different possible worlds and you know there's a possible
*  world where hillary clinton won the election in 2016 and there are possible worlds where the second
*  world war never happened these are all uh maybe not terribly distinct possible worlds they might
*  for example share roughly the same laws of physics as ours maybe small differences in the uh in the
*  initial conditions some of us think we can also make sense of worlds with different laws of physics
*  and different laws of nature maybe there are classical possible worlds maybe there are possible
*  worlds that are two-dimensional like conway's game of life with just bits fluttering on a surface
*  governed by by uh by simple rules so yeah there are very distant possible worlds with very different
*  laws of nature and the broadest class is maybe something like the logically possible world
*  corresponds roughly to what we can conceive of or what we can imagine i mean maybe there are even
*  worlds we can't imagine like worlds where two plus two is five that's getting a bit too far even for
*  things really start to go haywire around that point but as long as we don't have contradictions
*  then we can at least entertain possible worlds i'm inclined to think the zombie hypothesis looks to
*  me perfectly coherent and perfectly conceivable there is a universe which is physically identical
*  to ours but in which nobody has subjective experience it's a that's an entire zombie
*  universe if you like conscious experience never flickers into existence there's just a whole bunch
*  of sophisticated behavior i don't think our universe is like that but it seems to make sense
*  and one way to pose the hard problem is saying what differentiates our world from that world right
*  so where i come down here is i don't think that zombies are conceivable and i'm very happy to be
*  talked out of this because i think that i i talked to you a couple years ago before i wrote the big
*  picture and i was not quite as sharp in my thoughts about this so like you just said we could imagine
*  a literal physical copy of our world so that includes all the people in it all the atoms that
*  they're made of and and you do think that as far as we know the atoms in my body just obey the laws
*  of physics as we know them right so i would in that world i would be here in that world but
*  without consciousness without experience i would be here i'd be a zombie but i would be acting and
*  saying exactly the same thing as i'm acting and saying now is that right yep okay and so if you
*  in that world were to ask me if i were conscious i would say yes yeah and presumably there is a
*  sensible way in which i could say i say yes because i believe it to be true is that fair
*  yeah it's a complicated issue whether zombies actually believe anything but they've got zombie
*  analogues of beliefs at the uh at the very least so in i mean the most basic way to put it then is
*  how can i be sure that i'm not a zombie if if all the things that i say and do are exactly what a
*  zombie would say and do well i think this is a very good argument that i can't be sure that you're
*  not a zombie because all i have access to with respect to you is you know your behavior and
*  your functioning right and so on and none of that none of that seems to absolutely differentiate you
*  from a zombie i think the first person case is different because in the first person
*  case i'm conscious i know that i'm conscious i know that more directly than i know anything
*  else i mean decart said uh you know way back in the 1640s this is the uh the one thing i can be
*  certain of i can doubt everything about the external world i can even i can doubt there's
*  a table here i can doubt there's a body there's one thing i can't doubt that's that i'm thinking
*  or i think he should he could even better have said that i'm conscious i think therefore i am so
*  therefore i don't i can't doubt my own existence so i would take it just i think it's natural to
*  take consciousness as our primary epistemic datum so whatever you say about zombies and so on i know
*  that i'm not one of them because i know that i'm conscious but i think that my worry about exactly
*  that is that so like you said my argument certainly would make you wonder whether i am conscious i
*  think it also makes me wonder whether i'm conscious because i think that the zombie me would
*  because the zombie me would behave in exactly the same way it includes you know writing all the bad
*  poetry i wrote in high school and you know crying at movies at wally and so forth and you know petting
*  my cats like all of these things the zombie would do in exactly the same way that i do if you ask
*  that zombie me are you conscious it would say yes and here's why it would give you reasons i don't
*  see how i can be sure that i'm not that zombie i think to be fair this is you're you've put your
*  finger on i think the weakest spot for the uh for the zombie hypothesis and for ideas that come from
*  in my first book uh the conscious mind came out about 20 years ago i had a whole chapter on this
*  that i called the paradox of phenomenal judgment that basically stems from the fact that my zombie
*  twin in that universe next door is going around doing exactly the same things that i'm doing and
*  saying the same things uh that i'm saying and even writing a word-for-word identical book
*  called the conscious mind arguing that arguing that consciousness is irreducible to to physical
*  processes and i'd say well it will end that's i mean you know a lot of strange things go on in
*  possible worlds we shouldn't take them too too seriously but i'd say that yeah in the zombie
*  universe the right view is what philosophers call eliminativism that there is no such thing
*  as consciousness the zombie is in fact making a mistake i think there is a there is a respectable
*  program um about consciousness in our world that says we're basically in the situation of the
*  zombie and lately just over the last two or three years actually there's been a bit of an upsurge of
*  people really thinking seriously about this view which has come to be known as illusionism okay the
*  idea that consciousness is some kind of internal introspective illusion um after all think about
*  what's going on with the zombie the zombie thinks it has special properties of consciousness but it
*  doesn't all is dark inside so then say that's actually our situation it's like it seems to us
*  do we have all these special properties those qualia those sensory experiences but we're not
*  all is in a way dark inside for us as well but there's just a very strong introspective
*  mechanism that makes us think we have these special properties that's illusionism now
*  most people find it impossible to believe that consciousness is an illusion in that way on the
*  other hand the view does have the advantage of predicting that you would find it impossible
*  to believe if it's a if it's a good enough mechanism that makes you focus on this so actually
*  lately i've been thinking about this a lot and i wrote an article called the meta problem of
*  consciousness that's just come out in the journal of consciousness studies the hard problem of
*  consciousness is why are we conscious how do physical processes give rise to consciousness
*  the meta problem of consciousness is why do we think we're conscious and why do we think there's
*  a problem of consciousness and the great thing about the meta problem is remember the hard
*  the easy problems are about behavior the hard problems about experience well the meta problem
*  is a problem ultimately about behavior it's about the things we say and things we do why do i go
*  why do people go around writing books about this why do they say i'm conscious i'm feeling pain
*  why do they say i have these properties that are hard to explain in functional terms that's a
*  behavioral problem that's an easy problem maybe ultimately there'll be a mechanistic explanation
*  of that and that would of course be potential grist for the illusionist's mill once you have
*  the mechanisms explained why we say all these things in physical terms you could then try and
*  turn that around into an explanation of of um you could then call that solution to the meta
*  problem an explanation of the illusion of consciousness some people will still find it
*  unbelievable but uh again the view predicts that and if i wanted to know why i feel puzzled by the
*  hard problem of consciousness is that the meta meta problem i think that maybe that's still the
*  maybe that's still the meta problem okay yeah why do you find consciousness puzzling is certainly
*  one central aspect to the meta problem there are all these things that we seem to feel and say my
*  red could be your green right i can imagine zombies consciousness seems non-physical those are all
*  behaviors explain those behaviors and maybe you've explained at least the uh the higher
*  order judgments about consciousness now my own view is that that even that wouldn't add up to
*  an explanation of consciousness but i think at the very least understanding that those mechanisms
*  might tell us something very very interesting about the basis of consciousness so i've been
*  recommending this as a research program a neutral research program for everyone philosophers
*  scientists not presuming any conclusion about what the answer will be exactly you didn't be
*  materialist you didn't be dualist you didn't be illusionists you didn't be you know this is just
*  basically an empirical research program here are some facts about human behavior let's try and
*  explain them furthermore philosophers psychologists neuroscientists ai researchers could all in
*  principle get in on this and i think there's gradually a building i mean there's already
*  going to be a target article a symposium in journal of consciousness studies with a whole bunch of
*  people from all those fields getting in on it so i'm hoping this at least turns out to be a
*  productive way to come at the question of course it won't be neutral forever eventually we'll have
*  some stuff and then uh you know some results and some mechanisms and then the argument will continue
*  to rage between people who think the whole thing's an illusion and the whole thing's real we should
*  say though that aside from eliminativism and illusionism which are fairly sort of hardcore
*  on one side uh or forms of dualism which could be on the other side there is this uh kind of emergent
*  position that one can take this is what i want to take in the big picture and so forth which is
*  physicalist and materialist at the bottom but doesn't say that therefore things like consciousness
*  and our subjective experiences don't exist or our illusions they're higher order phenomena like
*  tables and chairs you know they're categories that we invent to help us organize our experience of
*  the world yeah you know my view is that emergence is a uh sometimes used as kind of a magic word to
*  make us feel good about things that we don't understand how do you get from this to this oh
*  it's it's emergent it's emerging yeah what really do you mean by emergence i think i've written
*  article on emergence where i distinguished weak emergence from strong emergence uh weak emergence
*  is basically the kind you get from you know low level structure dynamics explaining higher level
*  structure dynamics the behavior of a complex system traffic flows in a city uh the dynamics
*  of a hurricane i mean you get all kinds of strange and surprising and cool phenomena
*  emerging at the higher level but still it's ultimately once you understand the low level
*  mechanisms well enough the high level ones just follow transparently it's just low level structure
*  giving you high level structure according to the following of certain simple low level rules you
*  could put it on a computer and simulate exactly but when it comes to consciousness it looks like
*  well when it comes to the easy problems of consciousness those may well turn out to be
*  emergent in just this way there may turn out to be low level structural functional mechanisms that
*  produce these reports and these behaviors and lead to systems sometimes being awake
*  and no one would be surprised if these were weakly emergent in that way but none of that seems to add
*  up to an explanation of subjective experience which just looks like something fundamentally new
*  this is philosophers sometimes talk about emergence in a in a different way as strong
*  emergence which actually involves something fundamentally new emerging via new fundamental
*  laws maybe there's a fundamental law that's saying says when you get this information being
*  integrated then you get consciousness i think consciousness may be emergent in that sense
*  but that's not a sense that ought to help the materialist i think if you want consciousness to
*  be emergent in a sense that helps the materialist you have to go for a weak emergence and that's
*  ultimately going to require reducing the hard problem to an easy problem so i want to i think
*  everyone has to make hard choices here and i don't want to let you off the hook of just saying
*  ah it's all ultimately going to be the brain and a bunch of emergence i think there's a respectable
*  materialist uh research program here but it has to involve ultimately turning the hard problem
*  all you're going to get out of physics is ultimately more and more structure and dynamics
*  and functioning and so on so for that to turn into an explanation of consciousness you need
*  to find some way to deflate what needs explaining in the case of consciousness ultimately to a
*  matter of behavior and a matter of functioning and maybe say that extra thing that seems to need
*  explaining that's an illusion and you know people like Dan Dennett i respect greatly has tried to
*  do this for years for decades that's been his research program at the end of the day most
*  people look at what dennett's come up with and they say nope not good enough you haven't explained
*  consciousness if you could do better then great whereas so um to to move more in the direction of
*  what you're positively advocating for at least i mean you've always been very careful to
*  positively advocate for not that much because this is as you say a hard problem we don't know the
*  answers yet we we don't need to move forward by sort of insisting this might be there must be the
*  right answer so you've been open-minded but you're at least open-minded about this uh property dualism
*  that you talked about and that sort of one version of that leads us into panpsychism so
*  can you explain these two concepts yeah so i'd say that um you know i've explored a number of
*  different positive views on consciousness what i haven't done is committed to uh to any of them
*  i see various different interesting possibilities each of which has has big problems has big
*  attractions but also big problems to overcome so i've tried to explore some of those one at a time
*  one of the possibilities is panpsychism the idea that consciousness goes right down to the bottom
*  of the natural order panpsychism i mean pan means all psych means mind so it's basically saying
*  everything has a mind taken literally would imply that you know people have minds particles have
*  minds but also tables and numbers have minds sorry do we have to say have minds or can we just get
*  away with saying something like have mental properties as well as physical ones yeah if that
*  if that makes you feel better it might be a little bit better yeah have experiences
*  because hey there's something it's like to be them well i don't know i mean do we want to say
*  an electron has experiences i think panpsychism taken literally has that consequence by the way
*  most panpsychists don't say that tables or rocks or numbers have minds but they're typically that
*  their biggest commitment is to fundamental physical entities have a mind so if you want to say now
*  there's a weaker view you might want to say actually something it's like to be an electron
*  electron doesn't have experiences it merely has some proto version of experience some predecessor
*  of experience maybe electrons are proto conscious then there's a view called pan proto-psychism
*  that could uh could maybe seem a little bit less insane okay to you i mean the trouble of course
*  one of the troubles with panpsychism is it seems very counterintuitive because we don't naturally
*  think that electrons have consciousness and there's not a whole lot of direct evidence
*  in favor of it on the other hand you might say there's also not a whole lot of direct evidence
*  against it it's not like we've got any experimental evidence that electrons are not conscious well let
*  me rather than uh harp on that let me just try to figure out what it would mean for electrons to
*  have minds or experiences or consciousness um it certainly can't mean another quantum number in the
*  physical sense right they can't have you know happy electrons and sad electrons that would change
*  much of particle physics in in bad ways so is it that the some kind of epiphenomenalism do the
*  do the happiness or sadness that we want to call it that just go along with the electron what
*  determines what the electron is feeling the way i think the best option for a panpsychist here is
*  yeah you don't need a whole bunch of extra new laws of physics for the consciousness at the basis
*  rather it's consciousness that's fundamentally playing the causal role for the physics that we
*  know i mean it's a point that's often remained about about physics and it's fundamentally the
*  science of physics is fundamentally structural or mathematical everything is basically explained by
*  how it relates to uh to other things maybe quantum mechanics gets messy and and uh you know uh
*  everything else in contemporary physics gets even messier so let's just start with classical
*  physics that characterizes you know particles with positions in space and time with some mass
*  with some forces that operate on them what is mass in classical physics well it's this thing
*  which is subject to the laws of gravitation and the laws of motion um and that you know is involved
*  in forces in a certain way nothing here tells us what mass is in itself rather explains mass by the
*  way that you know particles with mass interact with other particles what its role is with mass
*  so it's all a giant structure and physics does a great job of characterizing this structure and
*  then you want to that raises the question well what is what is it what is the intrinsic nature
*  of mass well one thing someone might say is it doesn't need to have an intrinsic nature it's
*  just a giant relational web and that's a respectable view which i think um you know maybe some people
*  think it doesn't make sense other people think it makes sense but here's another possibility
*  structural realism structural realism is what it gets called in contemporary philosophy of science
*  an ontological structural realism says that's all there is in the world a giant web of relations
*  right okay but the other possibility people sometimes speak of epistemological structural realism
*  what physics tells us is the structure but there may be some intrinsic natures underlying the
*  structure as far as i could tell that's a respectable possibility as well that mass does have an
*  intrinsic nature that when two things with mass interact they've got some intrinsic properties that
*  govern that interaction and of course the panpsychist idea is to say maybe that intrinsic
*  property is consciousness or experience or maybe proto experience mind yeah it's somehow mind lies
*  at the bottom of this bottom level serving as the intrinsic properties that underlie physical
*  structure if that's the role it plays we don't suddenly need to revise physics the structure of
*  physics can stay exactly as it was we're just going to have some intrinsic properties the ground
*  that structure then you might say well now how is mind making a difference well it's not like
*  it's making a difference by suddenly having new laws in the picture for minds rather it's making
*  a difference by being the thing the grounds the physical web anytime one particle's mass
*  interacts with another two particles say attract each other by gravitational force on this picture
*  it's ultimately going to be their mental properties doing the work okay so you are we're not saying
*  again in this picture which may not be right but we're not saying that the mental properties
*  affect the physical behavior of the electron so a physicist i know some personally might worry
*  that this isn't saying anything at all because still everything the electrons do is just governed
*  by the laws of physics because these mental properties don't affect it but you're saying
*  that's just the wrong way to ask the question the kinds of things that are being explained by this
*  positing of a mental character underlying everything are not the behavior of the electrons
*  but something deeper and something that kind of flowers once you get complex organisms that we
*  recognize as conscious it does the experience affect the behavior in one sense yes and in
*  other sense no here's i mean it's certainly true this is not going to be so exciting for a current
*  physicist in that all the current physics can stay the same physics with the experience underneath
*  it or without it i think it's a good thing we have all the excitement we need yeah if we had to if we
*  had to revise physics too then it would be a it would give rise to all kinds of extra crazy
*  complexities that said this is more of an interpretation of current physics and what's
*  going on in the world underneath current physics and it's ultimately saying that what is doing the
*  work in physics at the bottom level is these intrinsic properties of mind or consciousness
*  the fundamental laws you know which we think of as laws say you know connecting mass and mass or
*  mass and motion or whatever ultimately going to be laws connecting little bits of experience
*  in this structure from the outside all we see is the structure and we give it a mathematical
*  description and we call that the laws of physics and it's great but in reality what's underlying it
*  you know we're used to the idea what underlies a physical theory may involve more than what actually
*  gets uh that we see in experimental results in on this hypothesis what underlies it in reality is a
*  whole bunch of minds or experiences pushing and pulling each other is this wildly speculative of
*  course it is but is it ruled out by anything we know i think not so i think it's in a speculative
*  vein it's at least a philosophical view to take seriously and it must be tempting to look toward
*  quantum mechanics for a place to implement these kinds of ideas yeah quantum mechanics is of course
*  it's a magnet for anyone who wants to find a place for crazy properties of the mind to interact with
*  the the physical world because quantum mechanics is so ill understood then it does have suggestive
*  properties that connect that may seem to connect to observation or the mind i would actually not
*  uh connect combine quantum mechanics and panpsychism um in the most uh in the most promising role
*  um there are people who connect quantum mechanics and panpsychism and somehow the right degree of
*  quantum mechanical holism somehow you can see how those individual experiences might add up to a
*  big experience lately though i've actually been thinking about quantum mechanics in the context
*  of a different kind of view which is more a kind of dualism with property dualism with with properties
*  of of consciousness distinct from properties in physics but somehow interacting with it if you're
*  going to be not going to be a panpsychist and say consciousness is present at the bottom level
*  of physics then consciousness has to be somehow the property of consciousness has to be
*  separate from those other ones space time mass charge and that raises the question now how does
*  it interact either you say it doesn't it's epiphenomenal it does nothing well that's
*  kind of weird and consciousness has no effect at all in the physical world yeah or you say it has
*  an effect on the physical world then the question is how on earth do we consult that with physics
*  which doesn't seem on the face of it to have any room for consciousness to play that role and there
*  is but there is of course this one i would say age-old idea can't be an age-old idea because
*  quantum mechanics has only been around for a century or so but this one old idea that
*  maybe there's at least one kind of fairly traditional interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  where minds could play a role in quantum mechanics mainly namely via the process of observation
*  which collapses the quantum wave function of course it's very controversial but it is a very
*  traditional picture of quantum mechanics there's two kinds of dynamics of the quantum wave function
*  there's schrodinger evolution the normal thing and there's something weird which happens on
*  measurement and standard quantum mechanics says make a measurement the wave function collapses
*  and that's a different thing from schrodinger evolution now of course this immediately raises
*  a million questions like what on earth is measurement and why should that get any special
*  treatment that's the quantum measurement problem and that's many people run a mile at that point
*  saying oh come on i don't want minds to play a role in physics let's try and do let's try something
*  else and they find themselves in everett style many worlds quantum mechanics or bohm style
*  hidden variables quantum mechanics or grw style collapse quantum mechanics which doesn't give
*  minds a role and i think all those programs are great and very interesting and i'm not
*  against them but i'm also interested in a possibility which may have been overlooked
*  which is trying to make rigorous sense of a more face value interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  where there is something special that takes place upon measurement now if you're an average
*  physicist well why can we uh it just seems very strange to treat measurements as fundamental
*  because that would involve treating the mind as fundamental and that's not something that everyone
*  wants to do if on the other hand you're inclined to think there's already reason to think
*  the mind involves something fundamental and that consciousness is somehow a fundamental element
*  in nature then that reason to reject the view will not be a good reason to to reject the view and the
*  question for me is just can we actually make rigorous mathematical sense of the idea that
*  it's once consciousness comes into the picture that the wave function collapses is it fair to
*  associate this view with something like idealism where you're putting mind as the first thing that
*  creates reality i maybe there's an idealist version of this but i would actually think of it as a
*  version of property dualism okay that is the quantum wave function is real it's got an existence
*  that has nothing to do with the mind the universe has an objective wave function just as it might
*  on say uh everett style view is rather there's this aspect of the dynamics of the wave function
*  which is affected by the mind and under certain circumstances physical systems will produce
*  consciousness under certain circumstances that consciousness will collapse the quantum wave
*  function so it's actually it's a you know decart thought that you know the body affects the mind
*  and the mind affects the body that was classic interactionist dualism think of this as an updated
*  version of decart in a property dualism dualist framework you've got the quantum wave function
*  you've got some dynamics by which the wave function affects consciousness you got some laws
*  it might be say something like tononi's integrated information theory it says when the wave function
*  has enough integrated information then you get a bit of consciousness and then you need some other
*  uh bit of dynamics by which consciousness can affect the wave function the idea that i was
*  working on this with uh with kelvin mcqueen a former uh former student of mine who's now
*  in uh in philosophy and physics at chapman university in uh in california and um the idea
*  we started working with was there's something special about consciousness or maybe about the
*  physical correlates of consciousness so that it resists quantum superposition everything in the
*  world mass and charge can most properties can evolve into quantum superpositions but maybe there
*  are some special properties that resist quantum superpositions maybe they go into superposition
*  for a moment but then they always collapse back or maybe the moment they're about to superpose
*  they pick up determinate state and then the thought was if that happens say consciousness is like that
*  consciousness never enters a superposition the moment brain processes would be such that they
*  would produce a superposition of consciousness and somehow they collapse into a definite state
*  right and then you might see that as an effect of consciousness on the physical processes in the
*  brain that could in principle give you an effect of consciousness in the physical world and then
*  the question is for me ultimately turns i mean it's a wild it's a weird and speculative picture
*  of course but anyone's theory of consciousness is weird and speculative for me the question is
*  picking up old ideas from people like vigner and and they've dropped out of favor now yeah but you
*  want to re-examine absolutely so vigner in 1961 uh remarks on the mind body question is probably
*  the locus classicus for this people think they find the idea hints of the idea at least in von
*  neumann and earlier in the 1970s this got associated with you know the dancing wu li
*  masters and so on at which point physicists started running a mile loss of respect from this
*  idea i think you know it has been used in some unfortunate ways but i just want to examine this
*  idea see if we can get it on on the table as one of the many alternative interpretations of quantum
*  mechanics which has upsides and downsides for me the question is ultimately can you give it a good
*  coherent mathematical dynamics that works and is consistent with all of our predictions if that
*  could be done then we can take it seriously now i should say that the version kelvin and i started
*  with does have one rather serious problem with that the so-called quantum zeno effect okay yeah
*  roughly the quantum zeno effect says if you've got some quantities that are
*  constantly being measured they're always measured so they never enter into superpositions
*  then they never change so if you constantly measure the position of a particle it'll never
*  move i can see where this would be a problem yes if consciousness is is consciousness is such that
*  it's constantly never entering into a superposition it's at least as if consciousness is never being
*  measured is always being measured which means that consciousness can never change so for example if
*  you start out with an early universe with no consciousness then consciousness will never get
*  a chance to come into existence the moment there's a little glimmer of consciousness it's going to
*  like uh it's going to snap back right only one tiny little low amplitude part of the wave function
*  will there be consciousness and with probability one it will snap back to no consciousness the
*  consciousness can never evolve furthermore you can never wake up from a nap if you're unconscious
*  you'll never get there there'll be little branches that develop consciousness they'll snap back to
*  unconscious with probably a good world now i like it yeah never waking up from the nap that's go on
*  forever so okay this was a small small problem for the initial simplest version of the theory
*  which we're trying we're now trying to work this into a negative result paper called xeno goes to
*  coven hagen okay uh raising the xeno effect as a problem for a class of interpretations nearby
*  but then the question is can that is there a version of this you can make work that won't suffer
*  from this xeno problem we've been playing around with probabilistic versions and versions where
*  consciousness superposes for a while and collapses back and i'd say we haven't exactly
*  solved the problem yet but i think there's a there's at least an interesting class of
*  interpretations here worth taking seriously if you are inclined to take consciousness seriously
*  and after all quantum mechanics is enough of a mess that it's worth trying it's not like there's
*  any interpretations that that is free of problems so if there's something here that a gives you
*  apparently adequate quantum mechanics and b allows a role for consciousness in the physical world
*  and there would at least be reason to take the view seriously and if you are a property dualist
*  if you believe in mental properties as well as physical properties of stuff does that have
*  implications for questions like artificial intelligence or you know consciousness on a
*  computer yeah i think it doesn't have immediate implications i mean some people think that
*  if you're a property dualist you should think that computers won't be conscious to me that's
*  kind of odd i mean brain we're biological systems who are who are with brains and somehow we're
*  conscious so why should silicon be any worse off than than say brains i mean it almost seems like
*  a weirdly materialist idea to privilege the uh the you know things made of dna over things made of
*  silicon right why should that make a difference i think so dualism is just neutral on the question
*  um the kind of property dualism i like a fairly you know scientific naturalistic property dualism
*  with fundamental laws of nature i think it's going to come down to are the properties of matter
*  that get connected to consciousness in a theory of consciousness are they going to be more like
*  specific biological properties or are they going to be more like computational or informational
*  properties if it's something like chernone's integrated information that gives you consciousness
*  it looks like that could be present just as much in a silicon system as in a biological system
*  so in the work i've done at least i've tried to argue that it's really the computational
*  properties of matter that are relevant to uh to consciousness or the informational properties if
*  that's the case then an ai system will be able to do the job just as well and in principle we could
*  even replace our neurons you know one of the time the biological neurons by silicon prosthetic neurons
*  um if they work well enough we'll be left with a functionally identical system and i would
*  actually argue that that function identical system is going to retain the same consciousness
*  throughout the alternative would be to say that consciousness fades away or disappears but that
*  gives rise to all kinds of problems right and then if before i was asking if i'm sure i'm not a zombie
*  this leads us to ask if we are sure that we're not a computer simulation right this is a uh this is
*  one of the great problems of philosophy i mean decar said how do we know that there's an external
*  world how do you know you're not being fooled by an evil demon who's merely producing experiences
*  in you as of an external reality when all of this is just being generated by the demon now the
*  simulation idea is a wonderful 21st century version of uh of uh of decart i mean as illustrated by
*  movies like the matrix i'm still a fan of the depiction of this movie and there in the matrix
*  that really i think got quite a lot of this right um how do you know you're not living in
*  a computer simulation that is the computer simulations playing the role of the evil demon
*  running a model of a world feeding your brain experiences when in fact you think and you think
*  you're an ordinary physical reality but in fact you're in this computer generated reality and the
*  people who wrote movies like the matrix they say if this is the case then you're basically
*  living a life of illusion and deception and not the real world and none of it is uh is real which
*  is exactly what decart thought about the evil demon hypothesis so i've been thinking about this
*  lately and i do take the simulation idea seriously i think you know there's nothing
*  we know with certainty that rules out the idea we're in a computer simulation
*  um the philosopher nick bostrom has actually given a statistical argument that we should take it very
*  seriously uh that we are in a simulation roughly the idea is that any sufficiently intelligent
*  population will have the capacity to create lots and lots of computer simulations of whole populations
*  so as long as they go ahead and and use their abilities and create computer simulations
*  then most the majority of beings in the universe will be simulated beings and not unsimulated
*  beings and then the thought is we'll just do the uh do the math do the statistics uh 99.9 percent
*  of beings in the universe are simulated including a whole bunch who are just like me what are the
*  odds that i'm one of the lucky ones at ground zero the point one percent so you might say i
*  should be 999 out of 99.9 percent confident that i'm a simulated being now you can raise uh issues
*  with the reasoning here and there one question is would a simulated being be conscious some people
*  would say no they're not conscious they'll be zombies if so the fact that i'm conscious
*  shows that i'm not in a simulation you think you're conscious go ahead but um but uh but at
*  least but that's not going to help me because i'm i'm at least on record as thinking that a yes
*  simulated system an ai system could be just as conscious as a biological system so i think all
*  those beings in computer simulations may well be conscious uh maybe it's only 50 percent okay
*  even if it's only 50 likely they're conscious and i'm still should give a big dose of probability
*  to the hypothesis that i'm in a simulation so that's not going to help so i think it's actually
*  possible that you know i do i can't rule out that we're in a simulation where i where i want to get
*  off the boat though is this idea that simulations are illusions right that simulations aren't real i
*  think we could be uh we could be in a world which is a simulation but if so that doesn't mean that
*  you know there's no tables and chairs in the world around us there's no matter it's all an illusion
*  i think what we should say is instead yeah we're in a world with tables and chairs and matter and
*  we've made it if we're in a simulation then if we discover we're in a simulation we'll have made a
*  surprising discovery about what tables and chairs are made of they're all ultimately made of say
*  information and computational processes at the next level down which may ultimately be realized
*  in processes in the next universe up but importantly it's all still real it's not like as decart thought
*  a world where nothing around you exists yes the world around me exists it just has a surprising
*  nature and this actually connects nicely to the ideas about structural realism we were talking
*  about before that really physics tells you about the structure of the world it doesn't tell you
*  ultimately but what that structure is made up of if we're in a simulation it turns out the structure
*  is exactly the mathematical structure of our reality maybe exactly as physics says it's just
*  that it's all implemented or realized on a computer in the next universe up so uh yeah the structure
*  of physics is real so the electrons are still real they're just ultimately electrons made of bits
*  made of whatever is fundamental in the next universe up you said if we ever find out is
*  there any way we would ever find out depends how well the simulation is made doesn't it
*  you know if they if they if it's like the one in the matrix where they uh they gave us some
*  potential ways out like the red pill it's very buggy code yeah and yeah that's a dumb way to
*  to build a simulation if you ask me unless you want people to uh to escape if it's a perfect
*  simulation we may we may never find out um and because of that i think if we're not in a simulation
*  we may never be able to prove that we're not in a simulation because in a perfect simulation any
*  evidence any proof we can get could be simulated right by being for the same experiences so i
*  think we'll never get we'll never know for sure the negative claim we're not in a simulation
*  it could be that if we are in a simulation we could get some very decisive evidence for that
*  you know if the simulators suddenly move the moon around in the sky yeah and you know and write big
*  signals and we we look at our genetic code and we've had messages written in there saying hey
*  losers you're in a simulation then we take that to be pretty strong there is the pre-existing
*  hypothesis of god having done all this right it's not that different god doing these things
*  from our programmers doing these things exactly and people and the questions of ever the question
*  of evidence arises for god as well i mean we could in principle get decisive evidence that there is a
*  god it's very hard to get decisive evidence that there's not a god and you think that it's realistic
*  to think that we can at least imagine simulating doing simulations that are so good that a
*  multiplicity of intelligent conscious creatures exist there in our simulator simulations i think
*  so in principle i mean i don't see it's just a matter really of computer power and of you know
*  once you know once we know the laws of physics well enough presumably we could set up a universe
*  with boundary conditions like which are allowable boundary conditions for a universe like us set up
*  the differential equation simulators on our on our maybe would need to be a quantum computer to be
*  especially uh to get the quantum mechanics right but then um i don't see why in principle you
*  couldn't get maybe it'd be hard to get a universe as complex as our universe oh yeah it would have
*  to be less every every level down has to be less right if our universe is finite and it has say
*  one billion units of complexity then we can't simulate something with one billion units of
*  complexity but maybe something with you know uh one million units of complexity just to not detect
*  the universe yeah uh too much and of course we're if we are in the enormous universe that we seem
*  to be in now with enormous resources that seems to probably it'll have resources to be able to
*  simulate some pretty complicated universes without uh without too much trouble in principle these
*  kinds of scenarios whether it's day cart or simulations or whatever i mean can we
*  or or god creating the universe can we apply some kind of anthropic reasoning here and ask you know
*  if this were the case would that have some implications for what the universe would look
*  like and then ask it does or does not look like that like i've certainly said if you want to
*  depend on if you want to argue that the fine tuning in the universe of certain fundamental
*  physics parameters that therefore allows for the existence of life is evidence for the existence
*  of god then you should be consistent in that argument and point out that there are other
*  things about our universe that look wildly unlike you would expect if the point of the universe
*  existing was for our life to exist can we say similar things about the purported simulators
*  yeah i mean you might worry that most simulations are going to have certain properties and that our
*  universe does or doesn't have those properties i mean one thing about a universe is it's enormous
*  it seems to be enormously big it's so complicated why would you waste your time it does seem if
*  you're going to be making simulations you might think most simulations are going to be a whole
*  lot smaller and local for uh for many purposes why would the simulators be uh be generating
*  universes quite as big and as complex as we are you might think your average of course whatever
*  you do make in the universe like that like us it's going to involve a whole bunch of people making
*  simulations of universes which are simpler in turn universes which are simpler in turn more and more
*  of those ever simpler universes so you might think that actually most universes are going to be very
*  very simple exactly that's what i would think yeah i think i might have heard shawne carroll making
*  in the past at some point um and then so they are the very fact that we're in a complicated
*  universe is going to be at least some reason to disfavor the simulation the simulation hypothesis
*  now of course so to go there's a little bit of back and forth here one could respond to that by
*  saying well we don't know the universe is big we see galaxies in the sky but really we see photons
*  that have recently reached us we don't see the galaxies themselves maybe there's nothing more
*  than a few million light years away and it's all just set up to make us think that but then
*  we're in some sort of skeptical nightmare and yeah maybe it's just like everything out to the
*  solar system yeah we've actually sent probes out to the uh we think out to uh to you know to other
*  planets and so on so the earth i don't know i'm pretty i'm thinking it's going to be hard to just
*  to simulate like a like new york city because there's so many people leaving new york city all
*  the time and coming back and the news from the outside at the very least you're going to have to
*  have a pretty detailed simulation of the rest of the earth to keep all the newspapers and tv and
*  everything going but once you move outside the earth it gets at least a bit easier maybe it's
*  like maybe the moon is just uh i mean you've at least going to need a fairly detailed simulation
*  of the moon because of the role it plays in our lives but maybe beyond a certain point um you can
*  run a very cheap simulation maybe beyond pluto we've just got a very cheap simulation of the
*  rest of the uh the universe every now and then maybe the science maybe the simulator say hi
*  they've just made a new discovery they've discovered a new a new form of um a new way to monitor stuff
*  and they're looking a little bit closer at these exoplanets and maybe they they scramble and they
*  come up with some new data for us but maybe that's going to turn out to be much easier to run a cheap
*  simulation but doesn't doesn't even saying these words make you think that maybe this is not the
*  world we live in that this is not the world that these are all kind of arguments against living in
*  a simulation just our universe does look way bigger than it does you can imagine things the
*  simulators could do but why are they going to all this trouble i think it's quite possible though
*  that the uh whether i don't know whether our universe is infinite yeah it's quite possible
*  that the basic universe is infinite and maybe you know the next unit in the next universe up
*  they have infinite resources yeah it turns out that simulating a large finite universe is no
*  problem at all in fact they can simulate infinite universes because in an infinite universe you'll
*  have the resources for to simulate an infinite number of infinite universes without uh without
*  problems so as long as we don't fall into the trap of thinking that the next universe up has to be
*  just like ours then i think all bets are off and are there ethical implications for this or are
*  there implications of this idea for how we should think about ethics number one should we think
*  about ethics in our world differently if we're simulations and should we worry about making
*  simulations with conscious creatures and treating them well i think that the ethics of our world
*  didn't be affected drastically by this any more than it has to be affected drastically by the
*  theistic hypothesis that we're in a universe with a god we're still conscious beings living our lives
*  treat other people well make sure they have by and large positive conscious experiences rather than
*  the negative ones maybe we need to think about the impact of our actions on the people in the next
*  universe up but since we don't really know what those what that impact is it's you might say there's
*  a um self-interest comes into this after all if we want to live on the religious hypotheses people
*  modify their behavior greatly in order they can live forever we might want to you know make sure
*  the simulators keep us around i mean it does open the possibility of an afterlife right if we're in
*  the simulation yeah i mean maybe quite naturalist just as the simulation hypothesis here has a very
*  naturalistic version of god it could have a naturalistic version of an afterlife we already
*  see in tv shows like black mirror that uh you know people come to the end of their lives and
*  they upload into a into a simulation and keep going keep going that way have you read ian banks's
*  culture novels i haven't actually i should oh okay you certainly should because part of it it's a
*  small part except for one novel where it plays a major role but there's this idea that uh yeah they
*  do simulations all the time there are conscious consciousnesses and agents in the simulations
*  and therefore the intergalactic uh uh organization has passed laws you can't end at the simulations
*  because that would be genocide but then there's certain very very bad civilizations that actually
*  turn them into hells where they torture the ais that didn't behave in the right way so i think
*  the ethical questions absolutely get a grip once we start thinking about creating our own simulations
*  and i'm sure any number of people are going to be tempted just once we've got the capacity to
*  start up a copy of sim universe running on our iphone and maybe get a thousand copies up and
*  running and see what happens overnight run the entire history of this universe gather the
*  statistics could be useful for scientific purposes could be useful for like marketing purposes
*  predicting what product is going to do well could just be even go there but yes oh for sure you
*  want to you want to test your different products and see which iphone is going to is going to sell
*  the best for sure but yeah i think the ethical issue is really enormous you're going to be
*  creating um you're going to be creating universes with billions of billions trillions maybe
*  infinitely many people um each of which is living a uh is living a life as a conscious being and if
*  their lives of suffering then we've done something horrific and if their lives of pleasure then maybe
*  we've maybe we've done something good but you know people talk about did god create
*  when creating us create the best of all possible worlds why was there so much evil well maybe god
*  created many different universes all the ones that had a net balance of of positive experiences
*  over negative experiences turned out by creating all those worlds and somehow there was a net
*  positive in creating them well we're going to face questions like this too maybe if you want to create
*  experimental worlds where there's suffering you can only do that when there's a net balance of
*  positive experiences in your in your simulations to make up for it even then someone's going to
*  say well you could have created an even better world with a bit less suffering and a bit more
*  and a bit more pleasure or fulfillment or satisfaction so you do something immoral by
*  creating creating this world i think we're going to have to face all those questions they're not
*  going to have easy answers okay speaking of easy answers two last questions for you david
*  one is you're working on a book do i know it's well in advance but we can prime our audience
*  to be ready do you want to say anything about what the book will be sure yeah the the focus
*  of the book is very much this set of issues we've been talking about for the last few minutes about
*  simulations and about virtual reality my working title probably won't be the final title but the
*  working title reality 2.0 artificial worlds and the great problems of philosophy and it's all about
*  exploring philosophical problems like our knowledge of the external world and the nature of
*  reality through this through the idea of artificial or virtual reality so yeah are we in a matrix
*  that's one of them but also i really want to to develop my own philosophical line which is
*  virtual reality simulated reality is a genuine kind of reality it's not a fake right or a second
*  class reality it's a perfectly respectable way for a world to be and i think this is relevant
*  not just for way out speculation science fiction scenarios like we're living in a simulation but
*  very practical scenarios like the virtual reality technology that's being developed today things
*  like you know the oculus rift where people enter into into virtual worlds and start spending more
*  and more of their time there it's easy to imagine 50 or 100 years in the future we're going to all
*  be spending a lot of our time in these virtual worlds and the question's going to arise
*  is that can you actually lead a meaningful life there yeah and is this is it i'm not even sure
*  this is a meaningful question is this aimed at a popular audience or professional philosophers or
*  both i would say both but i'm absolutely trying to make it as accessible as possible so anyone
*  can anyone can read this book you have hopefully so you can do that yeah i hope they won't revoke it
*  but yeah it's meant to be both introducing a whole lot of philosophical ideas but also putting
*  forward a substantive philosophical view of my own but roughly this view that virtual reality is
*  a first-class reality across all of these domains i think it has bearing on the great philosophical
*  problems how do we know there's an external world decards problem it has bearings on the question
*  of the relationship between mind and body and has bearing on these ethical questions about you know
*  what makes a meaningful and valuable existence or life of the kind so i think it's actually a way to
*  come at some of the deepest philosophical problems just through this lens of just as thinking about
*  artificial intelligence turns out to shed light on many questions about the human mind i think
*  thinking about artificial realities turns out to shed light on all kinds of questions about
*  the actual natural reality we find ourselves in so that's what i'm trying to do and the last question
*  is tom stoppard it's one of my favorite living playwrights playwrights period he wrote a play
*  called the hard problem how does it feel to have a phrase you coined to become the title of a tom
*  stopper play oh i was i was i was very pleased i think actually it was my friend dan denett who
*  sent me an email he read this in an article and said hey there's a tom stoppard play coming out
*  called the hard problem i said great does this got something to do with consciousness but it turns out
*  it does and i've actually gotten to know tom stoppard a little as a result of this
*  process he put on it had its american opening in in philadelphia a couple of years ago maybe
*  about a year ago the wilma theater in philadelphia and i went down there and did an event with tom
*  where the two of us were talking on stage about the hard problem of consciousness the play is
*  very interesting i'm not convinced it's actually about consciousness at its root it's about a much
*  broader set of questions some of which involve consciousness some of which involve god some of
*  which involve value and in fact in this discussion it sort of emerged that it's not that it seemed
*  to be that the problem that was really generating things for tom was not the problem of consciousness
*  but the problem of value how can you have the experience of some things being better
*  than others of life being meaningful of uh of sorrow versus versus happiness of course that's
*  very deeply connected to consciousness but i suggested to him that really his hard problem
*  is the problem of value and he agreed he said yes thank you i think maybe that's what's really
*  moving me the hard it's another famously hard problem but okay it's not the hard problem but
*  they're all mixed up i mean you got to write the best play right that's even i'm but i'm an advisor
*  for hollywood movies about science the the goal is to make the best movie not to be the best
*  science documentary but the uh the play is about to open actually here in uh here in new york
*  at the uh at the lincoln center so i have another round of uh of uh of all of this coming up actually
*  the last i don't want to give away any spoilers about the play but at a certain point they
*  mentioned uh the main character goes to work with a professor at nyu whose ideas are said to be
*  indemonstrable and various people have asked me whether that's whether that's me i'm actually
*  fairly confident that it's not i think it's my colleague tom nagel who wrote what is it like to
*  be a bat yes and uh he's the he's the professor at uh but simply the label of being a philosopher
*  whose ideas have been called non-demonstrable is doesn't doesn't really narrow things down too much
*  oh no i was yeah i was talking about this with my colleague uh netblock there's three of us at nyu
*  who work on the philosophy of consciousness and we decided that the philosopher in question surely
*  couldn't be either of us because our ideas are demonstrable absolutely right all right david
*  chalmers thanks so much for being on the podcast thanks been a pleasure
