Welcome to the September 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape AMA, Sean Carroll | September 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [September 16, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzqAKZqzj0E)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the September 2021 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host Sean Carroll. This episode is being brought to you from the Mindscape
*  mobile podcasting unit currently located in Boston, Massachusetts, rather than my usual
*  home base of Los Angeles. With the pandemic clearing up a little bit, though obviously not
*  entirely, travel is once again possible. And as some of you know, I'm spending the fall semester
*  visiting the philosophy department at Harvard. Harvard was my graduate institution, but I was
*  in the astronomy department. I did though take some philosophy courses because I was interested
*  in philosophy at the time. So I got to sit on courses with John Rawls and Robert Nozick
*  and other people. And some of you have heard this question, this anecdote before, but I got to know
*  John Rawls. I chatted with him, very famous social, moral, political philosopher. And it turns out
*  that he's really, really interested in physics and cosmology. So he asked me because he was very
*  fair. John Rawls' whole shtick was justice as fairness. And happily, this doesn't always happen,
*  especially with moral philosophers, but John Rawls walked the walk as well as talking the talk. He
*  was a scrupulously fair guy. I remember once walking through Harvard Yard and running into some of my
*  friends who were in the philosophy class and I was just auditing it and they were taking it for
*  real. So they had just gotten out of the final exam. And I said, so how was it? And they said,
*  you know what, it was very fair. And a friend of mine who was with me immediately said, those must
*  be your philosophy friends. I've never heard a physics person say that their final exam was fair.
*  So anyway, yes, John Rawls was all about fairness. And so I asked him, even though I was just auditing
*  the class, could I go to the section discussions, you know, the small group discussions which were
*  led by him. And he said, you know, the rule is if you're a graduate student, you can go
*  to those sections. You're a graduate student, therefore you can go. Scrupulously fair.
*  I was hoping to talk to him about philosophy and fairness and things like that. But once he heard
*  that I was a cosmologist, it was all over. He's like, oh, you do that Alan Guth stuff. And so
*  whenever we met, he would ask me questions about the Big Bang or things like that, different
*  things in both mathematics and physics. I remember very well, once in class, he was lecturing and he
*  used the analogy, you know, proving this is kind of like proving Stokes's theorem on an arbitrary
*  differentiable manifold. You know, once you set up all the definitions, the actual steps are very,
*  very simple. I'm sure no one else in the class understood the power of that analogy, but I thought
*  it was a very good one for me. So anyway, it's nice to be back as an official person in the
*  philosophy department. Hopefully, I just started so I haven't done anything yet. But part of my
*  motivation here was to learn a little bit more about things like emergence and mathematics,
*  philosophy of mathematics, different questions in logic and causation and things like that.
*  But I will also confess that while I'm here, I'll be hanging out with my old friends, physics and
*  astronomy, as well as friends at MIT and elsewhere. It's a real tremendous number of intellectual
*  resources here around Boston. So I hope it'll be a lot of fun. And with that, we have a whole bunch
*  of AMA questions. I think that the quality of questions is going up now that we don't answer
*  every one of them. You remember the rules. I will answer a certain number of questions. It's nothing
*  to do with the quality of the question you're asking. What the criterion is, is do I have
*  something interesting to say about it? But people are definitely aiming their questions a little bit
*  better now that I can't do every one. They're definitely trying to get in there. I do feel really
*  bad for those who are not able to ask questions. Sorry about that. For those of you who are wondering
*  how to ask questions, this is a benefit that you get from joining the Mindscape Patreon page. So
*  if you support on Patreon, $1 per episode or more, that's up to you. You can ask questions for the
*  AMAs. And then you also get ad free versions of the podcasts. So that's a nice thing to do.
*  Patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll. The biggest benefit of course is the feeling of happiness
*  that you're supporting something that you enjoy. That's something that we can all get behind.
*  And with that, lots of questions. So let's go.
*  Michael Gordon says, during your AIP oral history interview in January, which for those of you who
*  don't know, I did a long interview basically about my career in physics, etc. And that we posted as
*  a bonus podcast episode back in January. Michael says, you expressed a wish to move toward a world
*  where judgment was passed more directly on the merit of the ideas in some opposition to the
*  current environment of specialization and departmental segregation of ideas. Can you
*  share more specifically why you believe a shift may be needed here? What you would like to see
*  change? And if you know of any rigorous work being done in this area that quantifies how and what is
*  lost in the process of specialization? So these are big, you know, difficult questions. And I'm
*  probably not an expert in them, you know, in the sense that I'm in academia and I do work and I do
*  interdisciplinary work. I'm familiar with some of the issues, but then I know very well familiarity
*  is not enough to make one an expert. So take anything I say with a grain of salt. But look,
*  I mean, the first thing to say is that the current system actually does work quite well.
*  We get a lot of research done, we discover a lot of things about the universe, you know, there are
*  literally things like science week in review, you can go see all the scientific advances that have
*  just happened this week, whereas 1000 years ago, there weren't many scientific advances every week
*  at all. The current academic research system is pretty darn good at producing new useful research.
*  But that doesn't make it perfect. And I think that it's true that one of the ways in which it falls
*  down is that it organizes itself, the whole academic research industrial complex or whatever
*  you want to call it, organizes itself in some way, like many institutions do, and that ways typically
*  into fields or departments in a university. So you have physics, you have biology, you have chemistry,
*  you have history, you have English, you have philosophy, and so forth. And these in the modern
*  university, these departments are largely self-sustaining. So the dean or the president
*  or the provost will say, okay, you can have this many new faculty members over the next five years.
*  But roughly speaking, the departments have 98% of the responsibility to hire the new faculty members
*  and to choose what areas they want to hire in. There are some rare exceptions, but that's the
*  usual rule. So as a result, it is kind of self-perpetuating. The physicists choose physicists,
*  you know, the biologists choose biologists. And so the people who are working in areas that are
*  instantly recognizable as not only good, but also friendly to the notions of the discipline
*  are easier selves for people who to hire than people who work at the boundaries. Because
*  different disciplines have very different standards, very different ideas of what problems
*  are interesting, how much you should have published, and all this kind of stuff is different
*  because you have a whole bunch of informal customs and rules that grow up, not just formal
*  bits of knowledge. I have an upcoming interview you will hear soon with someone who feels very
*  fervently that this is bad and, you know, it's caused us to not do as good research as we can.
*  And I think that's right. You know, I think that human beings are finite in their abilities to
*  do things. You know, you've heard that whether it was in my interview with Carl Friston or Stephen
*  Wolfram, we're computationally bounded. So we don't optimize things like a university to be perfect.
*  We sort of have finite resources and we deal with them in a finite kind of way. It's easy and fairly
*  effective to just organize departments and then be gone with it. But then you miss opportunities
*  at the interfaces. So that does open the opportunity for places like the Santa Fe Institute
*  to do cross-cutting interdisciplinary work. And of course, many administrators at universities give
*  lip service to the importance of it. But at most universities, when they start putting their money
*  where their mouths are, it's harder to actually do. So I actually don't know how to really solve it.
*  I think that the current system, like I said, is pretty good. I don't want to overthrow it wholesale.
*  So the least we can do is just remind our colleagues of the importance of looking a little
*  bit beyond their disciplinary boxes. You know, as long as it is faculty members in departments who
*  hire new faculty members, the single best thing you can do to broaden the horizons of university
*  departments is to broaden the horizons of individual faculty members. So say that
*  interdisciplinary work is good, but also do good interdisciplinary work, right? If you can point
*  to something and say, look at this result that we got because we were thinking in an interdisciplinary
*  way and you weren't. That's what will really change people's minds. Charlie Schaefer says,
*  from listening to you and reading your books, you suggest that the universe is ultimately
*  understandable to the human mind. My question is, how do you speculate on that knowledge
*  buildup and how does that final attainment of that understanding play out, giving the seemingly
*  immense time scale of the universe? Do we have a continual buildup of knowledge? Is there always
*  room for new discovery or do we need to rebuild era after era? This is a great question. There's
*  a lot of stuff going on here. So I will have to refrain myself from doing a whole solo podcast
*  about this. But the point is that it's not quite accurate to compare our knowledge of the universe
*  to the size of the universe, right? Or the immense time scale of the universe. Because
*  when we learn about the universe, we don't just learn a collection of facts. We're not just
*  collecting every individual thing that happened in the history of the universe. That would be
*  hopeless. We're collecting rules. We're collecting patterns. And it seems to be a feature of the
*  universe that it obeys these patterns. And you can think of these patterns as compressions
*  of all of the different ways, all the different events that happen in the universe. This is a
*  humian, following David Hume, a humian view on what the laws of physics are. They are just very,
*  very compact restatements of everything that happens in the universe. But again, it seems
*  empirically from our experience that you need a small number of laws of physics and a small
*  number of fundamental ingredients to account ultimately for everything that we see. So I'm
*  not worried about the immense time scale or anything like that. It's quite the opposite. I
*  am enormously shocked at how far we have gotten in understanding how the universe works right now.
*  Now there's a footnote here that is worth talking about. If you're interested, you can go back to
*  the podcast I did with James Lademan, who's a philosopher, who was one of the champions of
*  what is called structural realism. Because you say at the end, Charlie, do we need to rebuild
*  era after era? And there is sort of a school of thought in the philosophy of science that says
*  exactly that, right? Some version of Thomas Kuhn's structure of scientific revolutions,
*  picture says that we have a paradigm that we work within. And then ultimately, the paradigm is
*  overthrown in a revolution and the new paradigm comes in and sees things in a completely different
*  way. The structural realist, Lademan and his friends, will say there is something that is
*  preserved when we throw away the old picture and get the new one in. And it is the structure,
*  somehow. Even though the ontology might be different, the actual fundamental ingredients.
*  So when you go from Newtonian physics to relativity or from classical physics to quantum mechanics,
*  your ontology changes in a profound way. But still, both general relativity and
*  Newtonian physics give you more or less the same prediction for when the next lunar eclipse or
*  solar eclipse is going to be, right? That kind of structure, those relationships between what you
*  observe, is preserved over time. And so the hardcore structural realists will say that
*  those structures, those relations, are all that exists. There's no real stuff that we're studying,
*  we're just studying the relationship between, I guess, different observations. You know, if you
*  say you're studying the relationships, structures between things, there need to be things in some
*  sense, but I haven't completely understood this myself. So there are ontic structural realists
*  who think that the structural realism point of view is really a statement about what exists.
*  There's also epistemological or epistemic structural realists who think that this statement
*  is just a statement of what we can know about the universe. So I think I'm closer to
*  an epistemic structural realist. So but the point is, even if we keep learning completely
*  new vocabularies with which to describe the world, that doesn't mean we're starting again.
*  That doesn't mean rebuilding. We're keeping something along the way. Okay, I'm going to group
*  a bunch of questions together. We got a lot of questions about entropy and the arrow of time.
*  Unsurprising, because we had that wonderful podcast with David Wallace. So let me just read
*  a whole bunch of questions and I'll do my best to say something interesting about them. Nate says,
*  is there any interesting relationship between cosmological inflation or expansion and entropy?
*  In particular, could expansion or inflation be changing the entropy capacity of the universe?
*  Per Magnussen says, you've said many times that the presence of gravity made the entropy at the
*  Big Bang low. Can you give an intuitive explanation for how gravity has this effect? Reiner Glöge says,
*  is entropy not just an epiphenomenon of sufficiently complex systems and hence not
*  very fundamental? It may, for example, not be reasonable to speak about the entropy of the
*  early universe if there were not enough degrees of freedom to apply an entropy concept. John
*  Bergmeyer says, when you discuss the early universe having low entropy, how is that possible? I don't
*  have an intuitive idea of what that would look like since all the typical low entropy examples,
*  unmelted ice cube, etc. still have a pretty high entropy and many different possible microstates.
*  Nate Wadupes says, in your conversation with David Wallace, you said, it truly blows my mind that even
*  to this day, the reason why ice cubes melt and don't unmelt has something to do with what was
*  going on 14 billion years ago at the Big Bang. Could you elaborate? I'm well aware that ice cubes
*  do not unmelt, but I'm unaware of how that might stem from something that was going on 14 billion
*  years ago. Okay, let's take these not quite in reverse order. Let's start with Nate Wadupes'
*  question. I guess there's another Nate, just Nate without a last name, who has the first question.
*  So because this is the most basic one, what is this relationship of what is happening at the Big
*  Bang to the fact that ice cubes melt but don't unmelt? It's not that ice cubes don't unmelt that
*  is being explained here. The fact that ice cubes don't unmelt just comes from the fact that an
*  unmelted ice cube is lower entropy, which means there are far fewer ways to arrange water molecules
*  in a glass of water in the form of warm water plus ice cube than there are just everything is cool
*  water or something like that. Okay, so sitting by itself, it's not going to spontaneously go from a
*  cool glass of water with no ice cube to warm glass of water plus ice cube. So just to emphasize this,
*  the numbers that we're talking about here are really, really big. I think that if you haven't
*  done these calculations yourself and people say, well, this is unlikely, this is going to come up
*  later again when we talk about quantum mechanics. Over and over again, people say, well, this is
*  unlikely. Physicists say the following thing is unlikely and you can't help but think, well,
*  so you're saying there's a chance. It's possible. If you're saying it's unlikely, it could be possible,
*  right? Well, yeah, but really, really, really unlikely. If you converted all the atoms in the
*  universe to ice cubes in glasses of water and waited much, much, much longer than the age of
*  the universe, the chance that any one of those ice cubes would unmelt is very, very, very small,
*  okay, over the whole history of the universe. So it's not something where occasionally it will
*  happen. All right, having said all that preliminary, what is being explained by the Big Bang is that
*  there ever were unmelted ice cubes. That's the mystery. The mystery is not why you go from some
*  configuration like an ice cube in a glass of water and it melts. The mystery is, given that there is
*  a cool glass of water, why is it even plausible that there used to be a warm glass of water with
*  an ice cube in it? That's a much lower entropy state. It's not the easiest way to get to a
*  current configuration that looks like a cool glass of water. And that's what is explained by the Big
*  Bang. The Big Bang itself was a state with very, very low entropy in the coarse graining that we
*  human beings use to understand the universe. The state of the degrees of freedom in the early
*  universe was highly, highly special, highly, highly atypical, very, very low entropy. And it's the
*  gradual increasing of the entropy since the Big Bang, which is very natural, right, that allows
*  us to have ice cubes along the way and watch them melt. If it weren't for that boundary condition at
*  the Big Bang, either, you know, depending on what else you conditionalize on, either there just
*  wouldn't be any ice cubes in the universe. The universe would be in equilibrium, which is just
*  empty space and nothing going on. Or whenever there was an ice cube, the future and the past
*  of that ice cube would look the same, namely a glass of cool water without any ice cube in it.
*  That's the easiest way to get an ice cube, is to just sort of take a glass of cool water and wait.
*  It's very, very unlikely it will turn into an ice cube, but it's so many more possible starting
*  points that you still win on the number of starting points there. Okay, so there,
*  if you understood that, hopefully you did, but other people, John, for example, is asking
*  in what sense is the entropy of the early universe low? And Nate says, I'm sorry,
*  Perry Magnuson says, what does gravity have to do with entropy being low at the Big Bang?
*  So if you look at the state of the early universe and the Big Bang, it looks kind of high entropy.
*  It looks like a thermal blackbody, smooth, hot, dense state, right? And if you had a box of gas
*  and it was glowing with thermal blackbody radiation, you would say that's high entropy.
*  So it's not that gravity made the entropy of the Big Bang, at the Big Bang low. It's that near,
*  at the Big Bang, that early time, gravity was important. It's a big universe. There's a lot of
*  matter in it. The universe is much bigger than the boxes of gas that you're used to doing in a
*  laboratory experiment, okay? So in the box of gas in the laboratory, we just ignore gravity. We
*  ignore the gravity pulling one gas molecule by another gas molecule. The earth's gravity still
*  matters, but the intra, intra, yeah, intra molecular gravity in the box doesn't matter at all. Whereas
*  in the universe, it matters a lot. In particular, if you ask yourself, are there ways to arrange the
*  stuff in the early universe such that the entropy would be much higher, the answer is clearly yes.
*  Roger Penrose, former Mindscape guest, recent Nobel Prize winner, was the one who really
*  emphasized this, starting back in the 1970s, but he's emphasized it many times since then.
*  A single black hole at the center of our galaxy, right? There's a black hole in the center of our
*  galaxy, Sagittarius A, millions of times the mass of the sun. That has an entropy. We can calculate
*  that entropy using Stephen Hawking's formula and Bekenstein and Hawking. And that single black
*  hole has more entropy than the entire universe had at early times, okay? So clearly it's possible
*  to take the stuff in the early universe and put it into a higher entropy state. Just putting
*  into single black hole would be way, way, way higher entropy, okay? That's why gravity really,
*  matters. And that is why you can't say, to get to Nate's question,
*  expansion or inflation increases the entropy capacity of the universe. This is a very,
*  this is a very intuitive thing. I know why you would think that. You're thinking, look,
*  things are expanding, right? It's like taking a box of gas and making the box bigger. When you make
*  a box of gas bigger, the maximum entropy does go up because now you have more room in the box, okay?
*  But the point is you're fixing the size of the box yourself. It's not a closed system, right? You
*  are changing the size of the walls in the box as an external control, if you like, whereas the
*  universe is a closed system. The universe is just the universe. So you don't say, well, I'm going to
*  fix the size of the universe or the density of stuff and then calculate the maximum entropy.
*  I mean, you could do that, but who cares? It's a mistake. People do it all the time, but it's a
*  mistake to think of that as the maximum entropy because the physical system that you're looking
*  at is not a bunch of photons and atoms in a certain space time. It's the photons and the atoms and the
*  space time itself. So you can ask, could it have been in a higher entropy state? And the answer is
*  yes, just put everything in a black hole or for that matter, don't put everything in a black hole,
*  but just expand the universe. That's a physical change in the system that is perfectly allowed
*  and lets you have many, many more ways you can arrange the things and therefore much, much higher
*  entropy. Indeed, sometimes people say that the highest entropy state you can get is a black hole,
*  but that's wrong. The highest entropy state you can get in a theory with gravity is just empty space.
*  If you wait long enough, the universe will expand. Everything goes away. You'll be
*  left with nothing but empty space and you can show that is the highest entropy state.
*  Aidan Chatwin Davies and I, Aidan was a grad student at Caltech. He and I wrote a paper proving
*  this result under certain assumptions, under a bunch of assumptions, but I think the assumptions
*  are good and it's actually fascinating. So let me explain. There is a theorem by Bob Wald, one of my
*  old friends at the University of Chicago, brilliant general relativist. Bob showed that if you live in
*  a universe with a cosmological constant, with vacuum energy pushing things apart and you just
*  wait, eventually either the universe re-collapses or that vacuum energy pushes everything apart and
*  it sort of doesn't matter what the details were originally. It's much like when you make a black
*  hole, all the hair oscillates away in gravitational waves and you say black holes have no hair.
*  So Bob Wald's theorem says it's a cosmic no hair theorem. It says that it doesn't matter what you
*  started with. Eventually you get to empty space with nothing but a cosmological constant. For years
*  this made me think of the second law of thermodynamics or of the process of equilibration.
*  The ice cube melts. It doesn't matter whether you started with a glass of cool water or one ice cube
*  or two ice cubes or whatever. Eventually you get to a glass of cool water. They all go to the same
*  place just like the universe goes to the same place. So there's a equilibration no hair connection
*  and I thought we should try to make that rigorous. And so Aidan figured out a way to do it and he and
*  I wrote a paper showing that if you have a system in curved space time with a maximum possible entropy
*  that system goes to empty space expanding exponentially like it has a cosmological constant.
*  And we didn't even use Einstein's equation or anything like that. So you can think of this
*  evolution of the universe in the direction of emptiness as increasing entropy. So that's a
*  proof that the highest entropy state you can be in is completely empty space. I think I've answered
*  everyone's questions. Reiner Glöge said oh is entropy just an epiphenomenon and therefore maybe
*  not applying to the early universe. You have to be careful what you mean by degrees of freedom.
*  The early universe may have been dominated by inflation by an inflaton field with no particles
*  in it. But again just like for the expanding universe that is one particular physical
*  configuration that could have been in a lot of other physical configurations including a whole
*  bunch of gas and dust or a bunch of black holes or empty space. All of these are other possible
*  physical configurations of that early universe. It is not easy to write down a once and for all
*  formula for what the entropy is in such a situation but we know it's very very low and we have pretty
*  good formulas in certain special cases like black holes and like decider space and things like that.
*  So it is absolutely okay to apply entropy as a concept to the early universe. There are enough
*  degrees of freedom there. Okay at this rate this is going to be an eight hour AMA so I better speed
*  up. Dan O'Neill says I learned a lot from your podcast with David Wallace. Oh yeah it's another
*  entropy question but slightly different one. I learned a lot from your podcast with David
*  Wallace on the arrow of time but I'm still confused by how time's hour relates to what we perceive to
*  be the flow of time. I don't see how Boltzmann's probabilistic interpretation of the second law
*  of thermodynamics explains why we feel that time is something that flows or that we move through.
*  Well yeah that's perfectly legit and you can be confused about that. These are ongoing research
*  problems. Let me explain the basic reason why we think that something like that is the right answer.
*  They're according to the laws of physics according to our best current understanding of the universe,
*  time isn't something that flows. That's not a fundamental feature of time. Time's just a label
*  on where you are in the universe, when you are I should say in the universe, where you are in
*  space-time if you like. And there's not even any difference between the physics of moving toward
*  the future and the physics of moving toward the past at the fundamental level, the level of the
*  fundamental laws of physics. The difference between the past and the future comes exclusively
*  because entropy is increasing or more generally because the early universe was in a very very
*  special state and from that state the universe is evolving and that's what gives time its direction.
*  That's where time's arrow comes from. So if you believe that is the only place that time's
*  arrow comes from as I do then any impression we have that time is flowing has to come from there.
*  There's nowhere else for it to come to from. And indeed you can kind of see how that happens
*  because what you do is you connect the fact that entropy is increasing to other well-known
*  features of the arrow of time like you remember the past and not the future, your causal impact
*  flows toward the future and not the past, etc. It's these aspects of time that give us the feeling
*  that time flows as human beings. And if you haven't listened to it I encourage you to listen to the
*  podcast episode with Janay and Ismael because we talked about exactly this. She's the world's expert
*  on this. You're constantly carrying with you in your brain a memory of what you were just doing
*  and also a prediction for what you're about to be doing next. I talked a little bit about this with
*  David Purple also. So it's that comparison of where you are now when you just were and where
*  you think you're going to be that gives you this psychological feeling that you're flowing through
*  time. And ultimately that's because entropy is increasing. That's where that distinction comes from.
*  Anonymous says, could you talk about any proposed links between gravity and electromagnetism?
*  I'm sorry Anonymous that's a little bit too vague for me to give a very explicit answer to but I
*  wanted to address a little bit for two reasons or sort of in two different ways. One way is
*  if someone had the idea that somehow magnetism was either part of gravity or the explanation
*  for gravity. Okay so that is an idea that people have had and the idea is not correct.
*  They're similar. There's relationships between gravity and magnetism but they're not the same.
*  Einstein tried very hard to unify gravity and electromagnetism. These days we think that was
*  a little bit misplaced because he was trying to say let's ignore the nuclear forces and you
*  probably can't do that. But gravity and electromagnetism as we currently understand them are certainly
*  different but analogous in some sense things. One of the reasons, the biggest reason why they're
*  different at the practical level is electromagnetism has both positive and negative charges. Whereas
*  gravity only has positive charges. Gravity only ever attracts one particle only ever attracts
*  another particle never pushes it away. There's no negative gravity particles in the universe
*  and that's crucially important for the difference between gravity and electromagnetism.
*  The other aspect of the question is in the world of electromagnetism there's electro and there's
*  magnetism. So there's one underlying thing going on but there is sort of a manifestation of that
*  thing in the form of the electric field. There's a different manifestation of it in the form of the
*  magnetic field and this was all unified by Einstein basically right in the special theory of relativity.
*  The beginning of the unification went back to Maxwell but really understanding them from the
*  point of view of relativity is the is the ultimate way to go. And so you could ask is there a similar
*  decomposition in gravity? Is there sort of electrogravity and magneto gravity? And the answer is yes.
*  It's a much less relevant fact because magnetism becomes important when charges are moving fast
*  right close to the speed of light. Therefore gravito magnetism would become important when
*  gravitating objects are moving close to the speed of light. But gravitating objects tend not to do
*  that. I mean photons do it and photons move at the speed of light but they're so tiny that they don't
*  make a big gravitational field. Things that make big gravitational fields tend to be really heavy
*  and slowly moving. So typically, usually, unless you really care about details of black holes,
*  it is the electrical version of gravity that matters for what you observe in astronomy in
*  our everyday lives. Riverside says the Economist magazine just produced, just pronounced in a long
*  article about the state of quantum physics that your and Brian Swingles modeling of entropic
*  gravity with the use of quantum information theory is the closest thing that may put string
*  theory to the rest. Such journalistic simplifications aside, the LHC and Fermilab muon
*  experiments do seem to retire supersymmetry as a viable experimental outcome while quantum
*  entanglement becomes a more experimentally promising area. Are we looking at the possible
*  way out of an impasse? Will the mathematical apparatus of the string theory somehow become
*  scavenged and reused as part of entropic gravity entanglement information theory field?
*  A lot going on here also. Let me try to break things down. So yeah, there's a nice article
*  in the Economist. You need to subscribe to the Economist but that's okay. I'm a believer in
*  subscribing to things and supporting journalism. They did a nice article on the state of quantum
*  gravity and how string theory is a little bit stalled and some of us, Brian Swingle was mentioned,
*  and I was mentioned, trying to build up quantum gravity from quantum mechanics and quantum
*  information theory. So let me say, by the way, it's not just me and Brian Swingle. Even when it's me,
*  it's certainly me and my collaborators, Charles Tsao, Spiros Mikolakis, Ashmeet Singh, Aidan,
*  who I already mentioned, and a bunch of other people have been involved in this project with me.
*  And then there are other people like Steve Giddings, Tom Banks, who have been working on
*  this for a long time also. So there's a smaller number. It's not like the
*  tidal wave sweeping the world. There's nowhere nearly as many people working on this as there
*  are on more conventional string theory, but we exist. Okay. That's one thing to say. And I'm very
*  optimistic about it. You've heard me say I'm optimistic about it, but there's a long way to
*  go. We're not close to a breakthrough as far as I can tell. The second thing to say is I'm confused
*  as to why you write LHC and fermion muon experiments seem to retire supersymmetry.
*  I think it's exactly the opposite of that. The recent experiments seem to show anomalies
*  in the behavior of muons, their decays, and their coupling to other particles,
*  which could be signatures of supersymmetry. We don't know yet. We don't even know if those
*  experiments are going to turn out, if those anomalies are going to turn out to persist over
*  time, but they certainly don't rule out supersymmetry. Third thing is even if they did,
*  even if they were not related to supersymmetry, even if we just don't find supersymmetry at the
*  electroweak scale, it's still absolutely possible that super string theory is right. Super string
*  theory requires supersymmetry to make contact with the physical world, but it doesn't require that
*  signatures of supersymmetry are accessible to us experimentally. They could be up at the Planck
*  scale, or they would be completely inaccessible. Now it's true that for many, many years people
*  have focused their attention on versions of supersymmetry that are experimentally accessible.
*  That's not necessarily because those are the best models. It's because being experimentally
*  accessible is important, and we care about it, and we want to do the experiments, etc.
*  So as I've said before, the fact that we haven't found supersymmetry at the LHC or elsewhere
*  should lower your credence that supersymmetry is true, and therefore lower your credence that
*  string theory is true. But it might not lower it by a lot. That depends on what your priors are,
*  and even some difficult to calculate likelihood functions. Okay, finally, will the mathematical
*  apparatus of string theory become somehow scavenged? Yeah, look, let me emphasize string
*  theory is not dead. It might still be correct, but more importantly, even if it were dead,
*  we've learned a lot by doing string theory. All of the stuff on ADS, CFT, and holography,
*  and all that stuff grew out of string theorists, not to mention string theory trying to understand
*  condensed matter systems, or strongly coupled nuclear systems, or other things like that.
*  What we've learned from string theory will continue to be useful down the road. Richard
*  Graff says, you convinced me that emergence, oh, I'm grouping a bunch of questions together here,
*  emergence is the key to understanding how the quantum world manifests in the macro world we
*  experience. But what is the state of emergence study? Has it coalesced into what could be called
*  a science or math of emergence? Andre Mirabelli says, it seems easy to think about how rules about
*  gliders emerge from rules about grid occupation. That's a reference to John Conway's Game of Life,
*  the cellular automaton that is very famous. And laws about liquidity emerge from laws about
*  molecules. It is harder for me to see how the very existence of particles emerges from laws
*  about the probability amplitude wave for states or particles. It is still harder for me to see how the
*  experience of awareness emerges from material laws. Can you provide some guidance for how
*  to more specifically think about emergence in ways that can make its meaning clearer in these
*  seemingly more powerful senses? John Stout says, I'm grouping four questions together here. So
*  number three is John Stout says, emergence, can you explain this to me in more detail?
*  It is difficult to grasp how to label one or another effect as emergent. Basically,
*  it's a similar question to what Andre just said. And then Josh said, when you reason about
*  emergence phenomena, are you merely using a shortcut to reason about the underlying structures?
*  Or is there a sense in which understanding at the level of phenomena is different than merely being
*  able to reason about how the constituent parts fit together? Like for example, do humans who
*  understand concepts like center of mass and democracy have a sort of understanding which
*  Laplace's demon could never have? So yeah, this is a bunch of things here about emergence and what
*  it is and where it's going. So I said this before, I'm sure, but let me try to summarize how I think
*  about this idea of emergence. You know, it's not a great word, emergence. Let me put it that way.
*  When I was first writing the big picture, and I was using emergence all the time, like on every page,
*  many people, especially philosophers, but also sociologists and others said, oh my god, don't use
*  that word. It's too overburdened with different meanings, and it means different things to
*  different people, and it will just be confusing. And I thought I almost didn't use it. But, you know,
*  once it gets out of a bag, it's very, very difficult to invent new nomenclature for things.
*  People use the word emergence to talk about this stuff. Here is why you can get confusing because
*  physicists think about emergence as saying that there exists, well, so everyone who thinks about
*  emergence thinks about the world in terms of levels, okay? And the level metaphor is a little
*  bit misleading in its own right, but let's for right now go with it. So there's sort of microscopic
*  levels where you talk about particles and fields and forces, etc. Very, very tiny things coming
*  together to make bigger things, and there are macroscopic levels, whether it's chemistry,
*  biology, humanity, sociology, astronomy, what have you. And what the physicist will say is,
*  the different levels might very well speak different vocabularies, use different words,
*  right? The vocabulary we use to describe human psychology is very different than the vocabulary
*  of the standard model of particle physics or the core theory, if you like. But the physicists would
*  say they're compatible, it's just that the higher level emergent description is taking advantage of
*  the existence of patterns that simplify things that are implicit in the lower level dynamics.
*  So in other words, that's why I like to use the center of mass of the earth as a special example.
*  You don't need to know all the positions and velocities of the particles in the earth to
*  predict this motion around the sun. You only need to know the center of mass, position, and velocity.
*  But that's not easy or obvious or necessary, right? That's a special miraculous thing about
*  the laws of physics. You are throwing away almost all the information and still making good predictions
*  because the information that you're keeping, the center of mass, position, and velocity,
*  is really, really, really specific and special, okay? So if you had thrown away random information,
*  you'd be able to predict nothing. Like let's say you threw away all the positions and you kept only
*  the momentum of all the particles in the earth, right? So you know the average momentum of the
*  earth, we have no idea where it is. So even though you're now keeping half of the information,
*  you make zero predictions about where the earth is actually going to be. And that's the generic
*  situation. If you just keep some fraction of the information about the underlying system, it does
*  not allow you to predict anything at all, roughly speaking. So emergence in this physicist sense
*  is a special, wonderful, extraordinarily useful feature of nature, of reality, that there exists
*  these other ways of talking about the world that are, from the point of view of the microscopic
*  theory, woefully deficient in information and yet capture something real. Dan Dennett called these
*  features real patterns that really exist there. Now there are also other people in philosophy and
*  sociology, etc. communities who think about it very much the other way around. They think that
*  they use emergence to mean explicitly cases where there are behaviors in the macroscopic level
*  that cannot be understood in terms of just the microscopic level, something that is truly new.
*  So you couldn't put the microscopic theory on a computer, run it, and get the right answer,
*  because there's something truly new. That's the idea of strong emergence in some classification
*  schemes. So I never mean strong emergence. I only mean weak emergence. So to get to Andre's question
*  and to John's question, that's what I mean by emergence. The point is that, well actually,
*  let me get Richard's question first because maybe this will help. There's a lot we don't
*  understand about emergence. Richard is asking, you know, what is the state of the study of emergence?
*  There's a lot we don't understand. And the basic reason why there's a lot we don't understand is
*  because if what you want to understand is particle physics, the best way to make progress is to study
*  particle physics. If what you want to understand is biology, the best way to make progress is to
*  study biology. And if you want to understand psychology, the best way to make progress is to
*  study psychology. So clearly all of these different levels have to be compatible with each other,
*  but studying the ways in which they're compatible is very much less common than just studying the
*  levels in and of themselves. And because we can just look out the window and see human beings
*  and big macroscopic structures, we take for granted that they must be explicable in terms
*  of atoms and so forth without ever actually doing the work to say, you know, what is the
*  general theory of when is there an emergent description? When is a macroscopic theory
*  compatible with microscopic theory and all that stuff? So I would say that there's a lot of work
*  to be done in the theory of emergence. We'll be talking about it in upcoming podcasts. I think
*  it's important and interesting. But there are people studying it, right? I guess that's the
*  point. Like I said at the beginning, this is part of why I'm here in Harvard. Ned Hall, who is
*  another Mindscape guest and sort of my host here in the philosophy department, jokingly said over
*  email, yeah, like while you're here in the fall, let's figure out emergence once and for all. So
*  we're going to try to do that. I'll let you know if that happens. But okay. But the point is, so
*  that's the state of emergence, namely, it's, I think it's young and still underdeveloped.
*  But this fact that we can cheat by seeing the higher levels immediately, or in so just using
*  our eyes rather than always starting with the lower level and deriving the higher level,
*  means on the one hand, we can talk about different levels without understanding emergence very well.
*  But also, it means it makes the phenomenon of emergence sometimes hard to understand. Because
*  there's part of us, especially if we know about examples like fluid mechanics, right, like fluid
*  mechanics emerges from atoms and molecules. There, we can derive fluid mechanics from atoms and
*  molecules, you can literally go from the microscopic theory to the macroscopic one or the
*  center of mass motion of the earth, you can derive that Isaac Newton did it.
*  Whereas so that gives you the impression that what emergence is about or what the study or use of
*  emergence is about should be somehow deriving the higher levels from the lower levels. And that
*  might be arbitrarily hard, you know, the levels need to be consistent. But it might be effectively
*  impossible to derive them. That doesn't mean that it couldn't be done. But we human beings can't do
*  it or something like that. And as a result, the emergent levels can involve concepts and vocabularies
*  that are entirely different from the concepts and vocabularies at lower levels. That's even a little
*  bit true, even for liquids, right for fluid mechanics. I mean, we talk about temperature
*  and pressure and density, we talk about fluids, none of those rules is there, none of those words
*  is there at the level of atoms, individual atoms and molecules. And so we don't make a big fuss
*  about it because we're so used to it. But it's exactly the same for classical particles emerging
*  out of quantum mechanics or for humans and their psychological properties emerging out of biology
*  and ultimately from physics. It don't think about a direct route from the microscopic theory to the
*  macroscopic theory, think about both theories existing. And as a research program, find the
*  connections between them. That's a better way of thinking about how emergence actually works.
*  Finally, Josh asks a very good question. Does emergence give us human beings some insight
*  and understanding that Laplace's demon wouldn't have? After all, Laplace's demon knows where all
*  the particles are, all their positions, all their velocities, and can predict where they're going
*  to be in the future. So is there some sense in which Laplace's demon knows everything, but only
*  at the microscopic level? I don't want to speak for Laplace's demon. I don't know what Laplace's
*  demon knows and doesn't know, but I know what you mean. The reason why I said I want to speak for
*  Laplace's demon is I don't think that the thought experiment is perfectly well defined. Like no one
*  has ever agreed on exactly what capacities and abilities Laplace's demon has. So I could easily
*  imagine Laplace's demon just knowing the microscopic laws, just knowing the most
*  comprehensive fundamental level of reality and not realizing that there were these simplifications.
*  I mean, after all, if you had the exact solution in your head, who cares about the simplifications?
*  But I can also imagine a version of Laplace's demon that understood not just the microscopic
*  level, but every possible level of the emergent descriptions of reality. So I don't know. I think
*  those are different versions of Laplace's demon, but none is the right one or the wrong one.
*  Okay, Spoonly Orange says, if a particle is a wave in a quantum field, does it also exert a
*  force on the surrounding field towards the center of the wave? For example, a standing wave on a
*  string held between two clamps exerts a force on the clamps toward the center of the wave.
*  Yes, it can. They can, right? In fact, there's a very famous phenomenon called the Casimir Effect,
*  which is exactly this. You don't even need particles. You can just have waves, the quantum
*  fields in the vacuum. And what you say is that if you imagine two parallel plates that are
*  perfectly conducting, right? So what that means is if the plate conducts electricity perfectly,
*  it's a superconductor, then electric and magnetic fields cannot penetrate inside.
*  So it cuts off the different wave modes that you can have in the space in between the two plates.
*  And it turns out that the existence of some modes of the quantum fields, but not others,
*  in between the plates, exerts a force on them. I don't want to say it pulls because sometimes
*  it pushes. It depends on whether the fields are bosons or fermions. But this is something which
*  you can actually test experimentally. And then there are philosophical arguments about whether
*  it's really the vacuum modes or whatever. But I think the most straightforward way of thinking
*  about it is exactly that. So in that sense, yes. Douglas Albrecht says, would you mind providing
*  an explanation of what energy is, especially as it relates to the quantum? Is it mass? Is it
*  field frequency? Is it momentum? In its essence, what is energy? So it's none of those things.
*  I think the right way to think about energy, it doesn't even matter quantum versus classical.
*  Energy is a property. I think it's a mistake to start thinking about energy as a thing.
*  And I know why people would think about it as a thing because it's conserved. So, you know,
*  if you have a bunch of water and a bunch of pots and pans, the amount of water is conserved as you
*  pour the water from one pan to another, right? And so you think of the water as a thing and it's
*  conserved. And since energy is conserved, it can be transferred from one thing to another.
*  It's kind of tempting to think of it as a substance in some sense, but it's not.
*  What's a substance are the stuff. Substances are the stuff in the universe, particles and
*  things like that, right? So we talk about the energy of a particle. Particles can have kinetic
*  energy and potential energy, etc. Right? So it's a property of a particle or a field or a bunch of
*  particles. And what property is it? You know, it's the property that is conserved because the laws
*  of physics are invariant under time translations. This was the, this is Nerther's theorem. I mean,
*  Nerther was the mathematician who proved that when there is a symmetry of nature, there's an
*  associated conservation law. And the laws of physics have a symmetry, namely they're the same
*  laws at every moment in time. There is no force outside the universe, twiddling a knob, changing
*  the value of the fine structure constant or the mass of the electron or anything like that.
*  These are constants of nature, at least within our observable universe. And so because of that
*  symmetry, because of time translation and variance, there is a conserved quantity
*  and it's the energy. That's what it is. And now if that's too abstract for you, then all you have
*  to do is say, well, give me a physical system that you define very carefully and I can figure out what
*  the energy is. If it's a ball rolling down a hill, there's a kinetic energy and a potential energy,
*  etc. That's the formula I would use to calculate that property that the ball has. And that is what
*  energy is. Jeffrey Siegel says, I seem to recall in a previous AMA that you mentioned that most of
*  the expansion of the universe is occurring between galaxies with dark matter appearing mainly between
*  galaxies. I got the impression this is not simply because galaxies are flying off in many directions,
*  but rather that space is indeed expanding between the galaxies. If that is correct,
*  is there a theoretical reason for space to be selectively expanding between galaxies?
*  I want to get rid of the phrase dark matter that somehow appeared in the middle of that question.
*  That has nothing to do with dark matter. There's more dark matter in the galaxies than in between
*  the galaxies. There's some dark matter in between galaxies, but it collapses and concentrates just
*  like ordinary matter does in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Is there a reason for space to be
*  expanding between the galaxies? Yes, but it's kind of the other way around. It's not that space expands
*  between the galaxies. It's that inside galaxies, space isn't expanding anymore. In the early
*  universe where there were no galaxies, everything was more or less smoothly distributed. Everything
*  was expanding. Space was just expanding. But there were regions where there was a little bit more
*  matter than elsewhere, a little bit more gravity, and that gravity pulled things together. And once
*  the matter sort of stops moving apart and the overall local gravitational pull starts pulling
*  them together, at that point it is no longer meaningful to say that the expansion of the
*  universe is having any effect whatsoever inside that region of space. So I think the better way
*  of thinking of it is space is expanding everywhere except where there is a galaxy or some other
*  concentration of matter. Now for something completely different. I'm going to group two
*  questions together about relationship advice. Relationship advice is something again that I'm
*  not an expert on but do have experience with, so why not? Casey Mahone asks, how can you tell
*  whether a relationship is worth fighting for? And Michelle, to group it together, says, what is your
*  advice for dealing with people who are condescending and self-important? I don't, by grouping these
*  together, mean to imply that Casey's relationship is with someone who is condescending and
*  self-important, but there are certain commonalities between these two questions. And you know, again,
*  I'm not in any sense qualified to give empirically evidence-based answers to these questions, but my
*  own personal impression is that if I've learned anything about people in the context of relationships
*  is that people don't change that much that quickly. I do think people can change. People certainly do
*  change. People when they're 50 years old are not the same as when they were 20 years when they were
*  just obvious that people change, but there are certain commonalities and major changes, the kinds
*  of which would have a large impact on a close personal relationship are rare. And therefore,
*  the older I get, the more my philosophy of relationships is just have relationships with
*  good people from the start rather than having relationships with not good people and trying
*  to fix them. So the relevance of this observation to Casey's question, how do you tell whether a
*  relationship is worth fighting for? I mean, part of me wants to say almost never. It depends on
*  exactly what kind of situation you're in, but you know, and what you mean by fighting for the
*  relationship. Do you mean someone wants to leave you and you're going to fight to keep them? You're
*  going to sort of try to convince them that it's right? Almost never would I try to do that. If
*  they're still maybe interested and just not sure, then by all means, talk it out, you know, try to
*  figure out what's going on, how you can be better. But if they want to leave, you know, let them leave,
*  do something else, get another person, find someone who is a better fit with you from the start. I
*  mean, if you there's it's not that people are stuck and can never change and therefore relationships
*  can never change. But but rather than fighting for the relationship or trying to change the other
*  person, it seems to be me to be much more fruitful to try to look inside yourself and ask what is it
*  about you that is not making this work? What is it that you can improve? Changing yourself is really,
*  really hard, but it's much easier than changing other people. Now, on the other hand, if there are
*  two people who are very much want to be in a relationship, but there is some particular
*  aspect of it that is not working, right? So it's not that you're fighting the person who wants to
*  leave, you both want to stay, but there's something that's not working. That's worth trying to do,
*  try to figure out are there parameters that you have where you can both alter your behaviors in
*  ways that fixes things. But often there are just incompatibilities. And you know, I've often seen
*  with people I know, what they look for in a person is not what they really need in a person, right?
*  They're looking when they're out there on the market, they have a checklist and they want to
*  go through the checklist. But then when they're in the relationship, what they actually want to need
*  is something very, very different. So you have to be open to the possibility that there were sparks
*  flying there at the beginning. And yet now, it is not worth rekindling those sparks. And I hate to
*  be a downer about this. But you know, there's a lot of people out there. And when we're talking
*  about romantic kinds of relationships, I think that the usefulness of your time is much better
*  spent finding the right person for you, rather than trying to fit somebody else into a situation
*  that doesn't quite work for them. Someone else will be right for them, hopefully. And then
*  Michelle's question, you know, the reason why this is related is not because the questions are related,
*  but because the answers are related. Michelle's question was, how do you deal with people who are
*  condescending and self-important? The answer is, to any extent possible, you don't. Don't try to
*  fix them. Don't try to offer witty one-liners that will, you know, bring them down to ground.
*  Don't try to explain why this is not a good way to be, unless, you know, they're open to that. You
*  know, some people are open. Some people make mistakes, sure, and are willing to fix them.
*  But other people like being condescending and self-important. That's kind of their schtick.
*  That's kind of who they are. And I would say just don't hang with those people, to any extent
*  possible. Sometimes it's not possible, right? It's your boss or it's your student, for that matter,
*  right? It's someone you have a relationship with for some external reason that you can't get rid of.
*  So in that case, you know, I think that condescension and self-importance are
*  kinds of flaws that are not closely related to any real virtues, right? Other than being awesome,
*  like if the person is awesome and that's why they're self-important because they really are
*  important, then, you know, what can I say? But more often, it's not like, you know, someone is
*  a workaholic, right? Where workaholism has positive aspects and negative aspects. Even being lazy,
*  you can in some sense have positive aspects or negative aspects, the flip side of being a
*  workaholic. But being condescending and self-important is just bad. So typically, people who
*  are really characterized by those personality traits aren't going to change them. That's just
*  who they are. And so if you can't minimize your dealings with them and contact with them,
*  I would try to minimize your responses to them. Just let it roll off your back to the extent that
*  you can, you know? Twitter is a great training ground for this. If you can ignore people who
*  are saying dumb things on Twitter, condescending and self-important things, for example, then you
*  could ignore them anywhere because your real life barriers to trying to strike back are much greater
*  than they are on the internet for whatever reason. I don't know. So I don't think, I don't know whether
*  Michelle or Casey, whether that my advice in either one of those cases is very actionable and
*  helpful to you, but it's my attitude. You know, again, as I get older, as I've seen things,
*  I've lived my life, life's too short, man. It's too short to be with the wrong people in the wrong
*  situations. We spend far, far too much time trying to fix a bad situation rather than trying to find
*  a good situation. That's a very overgeneralized statement, but sticking to it. Antoine Chopin says,
*  congratulations on your new role at Santa Fe Institute. You told us your research focus
*  would be on complex systems. Could you give us a glimpse on what it is, what it is and how it relates
*  or not with what you've studied so far? So I should have, maybe I could have grouped this with the
*  emergence question actually, because that's the basic question. You know, complex systems is itself
*  a pretty broad field. If you go to Santa Fe, one of the great things about the Institute is
*  there'll be archaeologists, there'll be economists, there'll be physicists, there'll be computer
*  scientists, there'll be philosophers. It's an enormous range of traditional disciplines
*  that have something to do with complexity in some way. And so, likewise, you know, the field of
*  complex systems is itself very, very big. So my specific kinds of interests within complex systems
*  are the sort of general structural questions, the quasi philosophical questions. So just like within
*  physics, I'm much more interested in general principles than in specific physical systems,
*  you know, this or that particle or planet or material or whatever. Within complex systems,
*  I'm much less interested in this or that complex systems and in rules by which we can somehow find
*  commonalities between very, very different kinds of complex systems. And in particular, I would say
*  that the, you know, to specify it a bit more, my current research interest is in relating the lowest,
*  most fundamental level of physics, which is where I've spent most of my life studying,
*  to levels above. So entropy is a huge role in that, right? The arrow of time is a huge role in that.
*  But the very idea of emergence is exactly this idea, right? How you can relate different levels
*  to each other. Are there causal relations between them? Are there supervenient or entailment
*  relations between them? In what situations, in what are the criteria by which you say that
*  emergence can happen? Does it happen the same time all the way? When you go from small numbers of
*  particles to large numbers of particles, sometimes there are emerging phenomena, sometimes there are
*  not. Sometimes those phenomena are complex and sometimes they're not, you know, like a bucket of
*  water has a lot of particles in it, but it's not complex all by itself. So what's the difference?
*  What are the criteria you need to say that something is complex and how it will operate? And there,
*  once you have those things, can you use them to say things like, how are economies similar to the
*  nervous system or to the internet or something like that? That's the kind of thing at the very
*  broadest scale that I would be interested in. Okay, so I'm going to group together. There's a
*  whole bunch of questions on decoherence. Maybe this is just random quantum fluctuation, or maybe
*  it's because of the David Wallace podcast, but a bunch of questions. So Joseph Dundee says,
*  what is the relationship between decoherence and measurement? They seem almost like the same thing
*  to me. Marco Tausser says, as I understand it, decoherence can be thought of as due to the
*  leaking of information from a system to its environment. This is why Schwerdinger's sleepy
*  wakey cat is already decohered long before we open the box. The information about the cat leaks
*  through the walls of the box within a microsecond of when the superposition is first established.
*  My question is, can there conceivably be anything that we can make the box out of so that the
*  information doesn't leak out? Does nature allow decoherence shields? Bill Warner says, can you
*  help me understand decoherence? That's a very basic question. I can't picture a diagram for
*  it in either Copenhagen or many worlds. Benjamin Barbrell says, my question is about the measurement
*  problem in quantum mechanics. This problem arises from trying to find the boundary between classical
*  and quantum behaviors. I understand that decoherence essentially solves this problem.
*  Am I right to put it like this? How complete is our understanding of decoherence? Is it still
*  the object of theoretical or experimental research? So there's a couple things going on here as usual.
*  As a phenomenon, decoherence is pretty well understood. It is, I mean there are details
*  about when it happens, how it happens, how you can avoid it, how quickly it happens. Those are all
*  good technical questions, but the idea is pretty solid. Namely, you often, very, very, very often,
*  find yourself in quantum mechanics in a situation where you have a system of interest, cat and atom,
*  spin, whatever, and you have an environment. You have the whole rest of the world. And of course,
*  even in classical physics, you had an environment, but the difference is, in classical physics,
*  you could go to a regime where the environment didn't matter, where you did in fact shield it
*  off as Marco suggests. If I'm standing here and I'm being bombarded by photons, if you turn off
*  the lights in the room and I'm not being bombarded by photons, I don't change that much in any
*  particular way. Whereas in quantum mechanics, the environment becomes entangled with you very
*  quickly. So you can't not include the environment. And that process of becoming entangled with the
*  environment is what decoherence is. So you basically say, I have the system, I have literally
*  everything else in the universe. And I say, does the system stay unentangled with everything else,
*  or does it become entangled? If it becomes entangled, that's decoherence. If it does not
*  become entangled, it's coherent. That's the maintenance of quantum coherence. So Bill,
*  you want a picture of it, a diagram. I'm not sure how to do that. Usually, this might be a bit too
*  hardcore on my part, but usually to these kinds of questions, I say, too bad. There's no diagram for
*  this. Not everything can be visualized, especially in quantum mechanics, where things are many, many
*  dimensional, right? Far more numbers of dimensions than we can plot on a piece of paper. But you want
*  a picture. I mean, the picture is just this, a picture of Schrodinger's cat awake, entangled
*  with an environment that is interacting with it, and Schrodinger's cat asleep, entangled with an
*  environment that is interacting with it. That's basically what you should picture in your mind.
*  What is the relationship of this to measurement? Actually, let me first
*  answer the other questions. Marco says, can you shield decoherence? Well, yes and no.
*  You can't shield decoherence for a macroscopic system in the real world. The cat in the box
*  is a system, but the photons and air molecules in the box count as the environment. It's not only
*  the environment outside the box. In fact, usually when I say that decoherence happens long before
*  you open the box, I'm thinking about the parts of the environment inside the box, okay, that are
*  going on. Having said that, if you wanted to be more general about it, just ask the question,
*  can you shield one kind of system from becoming entangled with another? Yes. I mean, this is the
*  job of quantum computer builders, because to do a quantum computation, you'd multiple qubits,
*  which entangle with each other, but not with the rest of the world. You want to shield them
*  from decoherence. That's exactly what you want to do. So you make everything very, very cold.
*  It's harder than you think because you can say turn off the light so there's no photons,
*  but at room temperature, everything around you is glowing. If you put on your infrared goggles,
*  you'd see there's actually lots of photons in the room. There are radio waves and things like that
*  also. So it's harder to shield out photons than you would think, which is why it's harder to shield
*  out decoherence than you would think. The other two questions is about the relationship between
*  decoherence and measurement. The reason why the relationship is fuzzy is because the word
*  measurement is fuzzy. The word decoherence is not fuzzy. We know what decoherence is,
*  but measurement is something where we say we know it when we see it, like I've measured something,
*  but what is actually physically happening during the act of measurement will be different,
*  depending on your favorite interpretation of quantum mechanics. So because your favorite
*  interpretation is obviously the effort interpretation, there's a very, very close
*  relationship between decoherence and measurement, but in other interpretations, it might not be.
*  If there were no other interpretations of quantum mechanics and effort were just accepted as correct,
*  then there would be a very close relationship. Basically, what we think of as human measurement
*  is just one subset of the larger numbers of things that can happen where a system becomes
*  decoherent, and you might as well call all of them measurements. It's different than interactions. I
*  think maybe someone else had asked about the relationship between measurement and interaction.
*  You can interact something without becoming entangled with it. If I have a spin that is in
*  a superposition of spin up and spin down, and I just pick it up and move it, but I don't measure
*  the spin, I have interacted with it, but I've not become entangled with it. So it's not a measurement.
*  It's not decoherence going on because the entanglement didn't happen. Rebecca Lashua says,
*  are all physical phenomena computable? Most real numbers are not computable, and only computable,
*  countable subset of them is. Does this mean that space-time is much smaller than R4? R4 is the
*  four-dimensional smooth Euclidean space. Do you think the universe is necessarily computable,
*  i.e. that is incoherent to imagine existing within a universe that can't be computed by some algorithm?
*  I think that the issue with this question is we haven't quite defined what we mean by computable
*  in the following sense. Obviously, there are definitions of what we mean by computable,
*  and when you say the phrase most real numbers are not computable, that refers to a specific definition
*  of what computable means, namely ways to calculate numbers. As you say, most real numbers are not
*  computable. There's no algorithm you can write down that would specify that particular number.
*  This is a kind of counterintuitive thing to those people who have not studied analysis or topology,
*  but the real line has a lot of numbers in it, let's put it that way, more than you think.
*  That notion of computability doesn't immediately translate to physical phenomena. What do you mean
*  by are all physical phenomena computable? Here's a physical phenomenon. When I let go of the coffee
*  cup in front of me, it lands on the table and doesn't fall through. What does it mean to say
*  that's computable? It's predictable, but do I need to specify the literally exact location of the
*  coffee cup? Do I need to be Laplace's demon somehow? I don't know exactly what that means.
*  It seems, as we've already talked about, to be a feature of our physical universe that it obeys
*  rules, it obeys the laws of physics. In that sense, it's computable, but the thing that is
*  computing it is the world. The world itself can be thought of in some sense as a computer, going from
*  one moment of time to the next, but it does uncomputable things in some sense. If the laws
*  of physics were just Newton's laws of classical mechanics, space is a continuum that is part of
*  the definition. Whether that's physically right, I have no idea, but I don't have any obstacles to
*  imagining things like that being right. I don't know if it's a question of how to do that.
*  I can't write a computer algorithm for every single possible real number. It doesn't get in the way
*  of doing that, as far as I can tell. I'm not sure if that's a satisfying answer, but that's how I
*  think about these questions. You just need to be a little bit more careful about what you mean by
*  computable. Brandon Lewis says, what topics or concepts in mathematics beyond calculus do you
*  find useful in theoretical physics? Well, many, I mean many, many, many. You can buy fairly thick
*  textbooks called Mathematical Methods for Physics or for Physical Sciences or something like that.
*  These books usually talk about ideas past simple calculus. You'll take a class in calculus where
*  you learn derivatives and integrals. The mathematical methods courses will then do vector calculus,
*  complex numbers, so complex calculus also, but then also maybe linear algebra, so matrices and
*  vectors, a lot of differential equations and solutions to differential equations, which in
*  some sense is part of calculus, but so much material there that you need another course to talk about it.
*  And then a tremendous amount on transforms of functions, right? Fourier transforms,
*  Laplace transforms, turning data in one space, like position space, into data in another space,
*  like momentum space or frequency space and things like that. So a dead grab bag of different
*  techniques. And then even beyond that, you'll find other books for more advanced students called
*  things like Geometry and Topology for Physicists. And then you learn something about Riemannian
*  Geometry and Homotopy and Homology and Fiber Bundles and things like that. So there are a lot
*  of concepts in math that go, that are very useful in theoretical physics. It depends, of course,
*  on what kind of theoretical physics you want. I didn't even mention statistics, but that's just
*  taken for granted. Vincent Ohm says, will we ever be able to understand the nature of consciousness,
*  do you think? What is the likely road toward this understanding? I think so. I think we will. I mean,
*  why not? Whenever someone says, will we be able to understand the nature of X? I'm saying, yeah,
*  sure. Why not? I mean, maybe. Now, there are plenty of things we haven't yet understood.
*  And there's a temptation to say, well, we haven't understood it yet. Therefore, maybe it's not
*  possible to understand. But you know, you could have said that 100 years ago about a million
*  things that we do understand now, right? So that's not a very good argument. Consciousness is one of
*  the hardest things to try to understand, because it's an emergent phenomena from one of the most
*  complex systems that we know about, you know, the human brain and body. So the fact that we don't
*  understand it yet is the least surprising thing in the world. What is the likely road
*  toward this understanding, you know, doing neuroscience mostly some combination of neuroscience
*  and philosophy and psychology. But, you know, I can't be more specific than that, because
*  number one, I'm not a neuroscientist. But number two, it's in the nature of science to not know
*  exactly what steps you should take to get to the answer you're looking for. You just got to take
*  steps and try things and guess and see what works. Brandon Lewis says, the phrase shut up and
*  calculate comes from comes up from time to time in discussions related to theoretical physics.
*  What sort of calculations are usually being alluded to when this phrase is invoked? So this
*  phrase was invented by David Mermin, who is a physicist at Cornell, when he was trying to
*  characterize a certain attitude that some people have, not him, but some other people have toward
*  quantum mechanics. You know, some people like me and like David Mermin really want to understand
*  the foundations of quantum mechanics in a deep way. Sometimes we even end up talking to philosophers
*  about it. Other people say, look, we can use quantum mechanics just fine. We can predict
*  the lifetime of the neutron or the scattering rate of something or the temperature, high temperature,
*  superconductivity phase transition or something like that using the rules of quantum mechanics.
*  And to do that, you need to do a calculation, right? There's some integral, you calculate the
*  amplitude of some possibility, you square that amplitude to get the probability, right? That's
*  what you'd calculate in quantum mechanics. Those are the kinds of calculations that are being
*  talked about. So it would depend on the specific system you're studying, but it's just typical
*  physics calculations. Sid Huff says, in a previous podcast, you briefly briefly mentioned the book
*  Quiet by Susan Cain about introversion and the challenges often faced by introverts. So are you
*  an introvert? And if so, how do you think this trait has affected your professional career,
*  research teaching, etc.? So I think I am to be, I'll be very, to be fair, to be honest, two things.
*  Number one, I haven't read Susan Cain's book. I've read a little bit of it, and I've read like, you
*  know, excerpts and heard people talk about it. So I'm familiar with the basic idea, but I haven't
*  read it. And as a book writer myself, I know better than to mischaracterize what is in other
*  people's books. And secondly, second caveat is, there's research beyond what she wrote about
*  in the field of introversion and extroversion and controversies about that research. And I'm not
*  familiar with that either. So rather than trying to be too careful about the definition of introvert,
*  the one insight that a lot of people really appreciated from that discussion, and I don't
*  even know if it was original to her or she was quoting somebody else, but the idea that rather
*  than thinking of introverts as shy people, or anti social people, you can think of introversions
*  as people who it costs energy for them to interact with others. Whereas extroverts actually gain
*  energy, you know, they're interacting with others, you know, they get excited, and it juices them up.
*  And if they're left by themselves, they kind of sort of get antsy and uncomfortable. Whereas
*  introverts need to recharge, they need to be alone, have their alone time. And then in the right
*  circumstances, they can go out and interact with other people. I'm not sure if that's now the
*  accepted definition of introversion. But that's the takeaway that I had from the discussion
*  around that book. And by that definition, I'm absolutely an introvert, you know, I absolutely
*  need to be alone to recharge. I'm not someone who like so after I give a talk, if I give a public
*  talk or whatever, I would really just like to go back to my hotel room, whatever it is, and have
*  some me time. I'm not out there to party afterward. I'm exhausted usually afterward. It's, I can do it.
*  I can do small talk at parties, I can talk pleasantly to people I don't know. I can give lectures,
*  I can talk on TV, I can have a podcast, I can do all those things. But it wears me out, right? So
*  I don't know if that counts as being an introvert, then yes, I am introverted in that sense. How's it
*  affected my professional career? I'm surrounded by fellow introverts. So it hasn't affected it
*  that much at all. You know, there are people who within academia or within physics or within science
*  take more and less pleasure out of teaching and outreach and giving talks and things like that.
*  And I like giving talks a lot. I mean, I have a podcast, come on, it's pretty obvious that I'd like
*  interacting with other people a lot. But I didn't start out being any good at it. I wasn't, you know,
*  a natural or anything like that. I was terrible at it when I first started many, many years ago. And I
*  have worked to get better at it. And there's a lot of people in academia who just don't bother
*  to work to get better at it. So they remain not very good for their whole lives. So I think a lot
*  of people in academia are natural introverts. But some of them have gotten very, very good
*  interacting with large groups of people or maybe even small groups of people. Moshe Fader says,
*  this goes back to an editorial conference I had with a new author over a decade ago, we were talking
*  about future projects. And he described a science fantasy novel he'd done a little work on. It
*  involved two inhabited planets or maybe a planet in its large moon that powerful sorcery had brought
*  gently together until they nearly touched just a few miles apart. My question for you is what would
*  happen if the magic failed or was turned off and normal physics restored? Obviously, the two bodies
*  would immediately close the small distance between them. But then what? So two pieces of bad news for
*  you. One is they would not immediately close the small distance between them. It depends on how
*  they're moving, right? If the two bodies are revolving around each other in a common orbit
*  around their center of mass, then in some idealization where we forget about tides and
*  friction and things like that, if they were doing it at the right speed, they would stay exactly at
*  that distance between them, just like the Earth and the moon stayed roughly the same distance.
*  Not exactly because the moon and the Earth both rotate as well as revolving around each other.
*  And there are tidal friction forces that actually gradually pull them apart. So if the two planets
*  were not tidally locked with each other, then they would probably gradually drift apart, actually.
*  Of course, if they were not revolving around each other, if they were not moving, they would just
*  smash into each other and everyone would die, I guess. If they were living on the planets,
*  that would be bad. The other piece of bad news is that the novel has already been written.
*  It's called Roche World by Robert Forward. Robert Forward, one of my favorite science fiction authors,
*  not because he's a great writer. He was not a great stylist, let's put it that way,
*  but he was super duper imaginative. I think a professional physicist or engineer or something
*  like that. So he wrote Dragon's Egg, which is about life on a neutron star. And one of his other
*  novels called Roche World or alternative title, The Flight of the Dragonfly, was literally about
*  two planets that were so close together that they shared an atmosphere and even oceans and
*  things like that. So that has been explored and there's no magic involved. It was purely
*  science fiction, if you want to check that out. Thies Janssen says, could you play devil's advocate
*  and explain why interpretations other than the Everettian interpretation exist? Well,
*  there's two aspects here. One is the psychological aspects of people just not liking the Everett
*  interpretation. So that might mean they don't like the idea that there are a lot of other worlds,
*  or they don't like that the existence of these other worlds is unobservable to them,
*  or something like that. It just rubs them the wrong way. I think those are real. It's very far from
*  our experience and it's not even completely irrational to say that a scientific theory
*  that claims that the real nature of reality is very, very different in its fundamental essence
*  than our everyday experience should be treated skeptically. I think that it's okay to start
*  your scientific theorizing close to the phenomena that you observe. I think there's good reasons to,
*  in the case of quantum mechanics, go far beyond them, but it's okay to start there and to be
*  skeptical of ones that go far beyond it. But that's a more psychological
*  worry. There are also good physics worries, and I think that there are two very good physics worries
*  about the Everett interpretation. One is the probability question. In ordinary quantum mechanics,
*  certain things happen with certain probabilities. In Everett, everything that can happen,
*  everything for which you would ordinarily assign a non-zero probability, actually does happen in
*  some branch of the wave function. And so how do you recover the physical information, the data,
*  the experience that we have of the world that if we measure spins over and over and over again,
*  we get a certain fraction of them being spin up and a certain fraction being spin down
*  that we can predict very accurately? Now I think there's an answer to these questions.
*  In fact, I think there's more than one good answer to that question. Famously, David Deutsch
*  and David Wallace used decision theory to derive a proof that you get the usual predictions. Chip
*  Siemens and I developed another idea based on previous suggestions by Lev Weidman and others
*  that use self-locating uncertainty. So I think it's an answerable question,
*  but I get it if you're not completely convinced. It's tricky and it involves philosophy as well
*  as physics. And the other question, which I think has gotten even less attention, which is what I am
*  mostly thinking about these days, is the what we call the structure question. Every other
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics has a wave function, the Schrodinger equation, and extra
*  stuff. That extra stuff might be other hidden variables or extra rules about how wave functions
*  spontaneously collapse or something, some notion of what is observable and what is not observable,
*  for example. Whereas in the purest versions of ever-readying quantum mechanics, you just have
*  wave functions and the Schrodinger equation. You don't have any extra stuff. So the journey from
*  the pristine purity and austerity of ever-readying quantum mechanics to the messy specificity of the
*  world is very long and potentially fraught with peril. And not a lot of work has been put into
*  deriving the real world from the bare bones version of ever-readying quantum mechanics.
*  So I'm trying, if you are a little bit happy with some equations, you can check out my fairly recent
*  paper called Reality as a Vector in Hilbert Space. There was a previous paper with Ashmeet Singh
*  along the same lines called Mad Dog Ever-Readyingism. But the point for your question is, these are
*  perfectly good questions. It's not at all obvious that this idea of taking just a wave function and
*  the Schrodinger equation and deriving the world from it will work. We're doing it, I'm pretty
*  optimistic it will work. I would put good odds on it, but it's not obvious or set in stone.
*  As long as that is true, it's good that other interpretations exist. You know, if I were the
*  boss of reality and science, I would put less emphasis on the other interpretations, but I'm
*  glad that they exist and other people are working on that. Richard Riley says, I'd still like to know
*  just how electrons and protons fuse together to create neutrons during the process of neutron star
*  formation. Does an electron fuse with an up quark in a proton and turn into a down quark
*  in the resulting neutron? Is the mass of the neutron in general equal to the sum of the masses
*  of the proton plus however many electrons it would need, etc.? So, I mean, basically yes. Remember,
*  an up quark, sorry, a proton is two up quarks and a down. The up quarks have charge plus two-thirds
*  and the down quarks have charge minus one-third. The neutron is one up quark and two downs. So,
*  when you convert, let's do the more familiar one, neutrons decay, right? So, a neutron decaying is
*  basically the neutron turning into a proton and an electron and an anti-neutrino. It needs to be
*  an anti-neutrino to conserve a lepton number and all those things, but it's there. And so, that's
*  basically one of the down quarks in the neutron converting into an up quark plus an electron plus
*  an anti-neutrino. And you can draw little Feynman diagrams to watch it happen. I've drawn those
*  Feynman diagrams in many places, including the biggest ideas in the universe videos if you want
*  to check those out. So, the proton converting into a neutron is basically the same thing in reverse.
*  You go proton plus electron goes to neutron plus neutrino. So, really that electron is glomming onto
*  one of the up quarks in the proton converting it into a down quark and spitting off a neutrino.
*  And that's why when you make a supernova, there's a lot of neutrinos that come out. We've even
*  detected some of them like in supernova 1987A. The mass neutron is not equal to the masses of
*  the proton plus however many electrons it needs because there's other things going on. For one
*  thing, the proton and the electron are not necessarily in the same center of mass. You know,
*  the mass of an electron plus a proton is less than the mass of a neutron. So, you need more energy
*  than that, especially because you're also spitting out a neutrino. So, it's a complicated thing,
*  but don't worry. We have figured it all out. You can figure it out yourself. It's actually not that
*  hard to do what we call the kinematics of those reactions. Neil Glue says, the three spatial
*  dimensions of the universe we live in could go on forever in all directions or they could wrap around
*  in one, two or three dimensions. If they did wrap around in one or more with circumference less than
*  size of the observable universe, we might be able to observe that. Do you know of any astronomy or
*  cosmology work considering that possibility, particularly experiments to provide positive
*  or negative evidence for whether the observable universe wraps around? Yeah, absolutely. There's
*  very, I'm not sure if active is the right word, but they were active research programs to look
*  for evidence of a finite universe in the cosmic microwave background. If the universe is finite in
*  size but, you know, wraps around on itself like a torus or something more complicated, then it could
*  be that different parts of the microwave background we look at are actually the same physical location
*  in space just looked at in different directions. So, you can and you do look at that and people
*  have looked at it and put very, very strong constraints on that possibility. In fact,
*  Jan Levin, who was a previous Mindscape guest, wrote a whole book about it. She was one of the
*  experts in this field. So, her first book was called How the Universe Got Its Spots because
*  in these topologically nontrivial universes, you could get spots on the cosmic microwave
*  background. So, she talks about what that would be and how you would go look for it. It's a very
*  good book if you want to check it out. Matt Faw asks a priority question. Remember, I don't know
*  if you've had priority questions yet today, but priority questions are the ones that I promised to
*  answer. But every human being is only allowed one priority question per their lifespan in each
*  branch of the wave function of the universe. As I understand it, space begins to expand at t equals
*  zero uniformly everywhere. Therefore, it seems like every particle of matter or dark matter would,
*  from t equals zero, effectively move away from every other particle in the universe. As space
*  expands between them, the gravitational attraction between every particle in the universe should also
*  get weaker. If expansion beat gravity at the very first moment, it seems like expansion would always
*  beat gravity because gravity would just keep getting weaker the further things got from each
*  other. It seems as if expansion should lead to a universe without structure, just a fine mist of
*  rarefied particles. So, there's two things going on here. One is I want to be a little bit more
*  specific about what is happening at t equals zero. Specifically, you shouldn't say anything
*  about what happens at t equals zero. T equals zero, by which I presume you mean the singularity
*  in the Big Bang models of cosmology, is a singularity. By singularity, we mean physical
*  quantities become infinitely big and therefore your theoretical description of them is wrong
*  somehow. We don't know what happens at t equals zero. So, if you wrap your brain into knots trying
*  to understand not just the very, very early universe, but literally t equals zero, you're
*  going to come across paradoxes because many of the things you're trying to attach meaning to
*  are of the form zero times infinity or zero divided by zero or something like that, including
*  the space between particles or the size of the universe or things like that. These things are
*  just not defined at the Big Bang. One tiny moment after the Big Bang, 10 to the minus some seconds,
*  then you can talk about the whole universe and it might already be infinitely big then and there's
*  some finite number of particles per cubic centimeter, etc. Okay, that's one thing. But
*  the other thing is more straightforward. You know, you're saying if expansion beats gravity the very
*  first moment, it seems like expansion would always beat gravity. Well, no, because you know, there's
*  equations here and you have to solve the equations. There are two things going on. The universe is
*  expanding, particles moving away from each other, but they're exerting a gravitational force on
*  each other and there's a competition between those two things. So, which one wins depends on the
*  magnitude of the expansion rate, right? It is exactly like taking a ball and throwing it up in
*  the air, right? If I throw a baseball up into the air, as it goes up, the gravitational force on it
*  is getting weaker because its distance from the center of the earth is increasing. So, the force
*  of gravity on the ball is getting weaker and weaker as that ball goes up. And yet, most of the time,
*  when I throw a ball up into the air, it comes down because even though the gravitational force
*  is getting weaker as the ball moves up and further away from the earth, it's only getting weaker a
*  little bit and its velocity is decreasing noticeably. So, it just comes back. If I threw it at the escape
*  velocity of the earth or greater, then its gravitational force, gravitational pull, would
*  get weaker sufficiently fast compared to its velocity that it would escape to infinity. The
*  expanding universe is exactly the same thing. If the universe is expanding really fast enough,
*  then it will expand forever. That's an open universe and you will never have enough time
*  to make structure. If it's expanding slowly, it could actually not just form structure,
*  but it would turn around and re-collapse in a very small period of time. So, for whatever reasons,
*  and that's a whole other discussion, but the real universe had a balance or a near balance between
*  the gravitational pull of particles and the expansion rate of the universe so that the
*  universe expands for a very, very long time, but there is enough time to form structure.
*  Anonymous says, I can understand many physical constants as we accidentally have two units to
*  measure one thing. Seconds and meters for measuring space-time intervals, kelvins and joules for
*  measuring energy per particle. But I don't have a good physical intuition for what Planck's constant
*  means. Momentum is really wave number, energy is really frequency. Well, so I think that you have
*  outsmarted yourself, Anonymous, by understanding physical constants as accidentally having two
*  units to measure one thing. So, for space and time, for example, you're saying that we can use the
*  speed of light, c, to convert between seconds and meters. Which is true, but they're not the same
*  thing. Space is not the same thing as time. There's an arrow of time. There's not an arrow of space,
*  right? There's only one dimension of time. There are three dimensions of space. They're related.
*  They're both different parts of space-time, but they're not the same thing. So, I think that the
*  general strategy of trying to understand physical constants as measuring the same thing using
*  different units is not going to be a good one. Planck's constant is not that. Newton's constant
*  of gravity is not that. The mass of the electron is not that. These are not conversion factors
*  between different but equivalent physical quantities. So, it's not that energy is really
*  frequency. You're thinking of the famous formula E equals hf, I guess if you want to use English
*  letters, Roman letters. F is the frequency of a wave. H is Planck's constant. E is the energy
*  of a quantum of that wave. But that doesn't mean the energy is frequency. It just means that the
*  energy of a quantum of a wave at that frequency is given by that number. So, different physical
*  constants do different physical things. I think you're trying to squeeze them into two tiny of a
*  box. Chris says, how have your colleagues reacted to the amount of public communication work that
*  you do? Well, you know, my colleagues are a heterogeneous lot. They've reacted in many different
*  ways. I mean, there's absolutely people who don't like it. They will rarely say they don't like it,
*  out loud, because they like the idea of public understanding of science. But then at the same
*  time, for the people who actually do efforts in that direction, they will disparage them because
*  they're not spending their time doing research. And what they value is the research output.
*  And you know, that's a very real thing. And it goes the other way, too. There are people who love
*  the fact that there is public outreach. What's interesting, which you might not guess, is that
*  even within physicists, you know, different like if you do a lot of different things, you write
*  physics papers, you do outreach, you write books, you whatever, different people know about some
*  subset of what you do, right? So, there are people who, you know, are only vaguely aware that I do
*  outreach or public communication or write books or anything like that. But they've read my physics
*  papers. There are other physicists who have no idea that I've written any papers in the last few
*  years, right? They think I'm just writing books. It takes, you know, two seconds on my web page to
*  figure out that I'm actually doing both. But if you're aware of one and not the other, then that's
*  a perfectly natural thing. So, you know, I think overall, you know, I've written plenty about this
*  on my blog. For example, there was a semi infamous blog post I wrote called How to Get Tenure at a
*  Major Research University. And the point being that at those very tiny subset of universities,
*  known as major research universities, what they care about is the research. And at best, you know,
*  what they will say is, well, if you're good at teaching or outreach or whatever, or organizing
*  or community service, that will count a little bit, but it won't really help you very much. It's
*  not most important. What's most important is research. But that's false. They're not telling
*  you the truth there. They might even be lying to themselves. I don't know. But the point is,
*  if you do any of those things, secretly, they will be thinking, well, they could have been doing
*  research during that time. And it's kind of an interesting, weird phenomenon, because if you,
*  you know, play guitar, okay, if that's a hobby that you have, no one cares about that. Go ahead
*  and play guitar. But if you write books about physics, they care about that. That counts against
*  you. And you might say, well, why would playing guitar not count against you, but writing physics
*  books count against you? In their minds, they're thinking that the time and effort that could have
*  that you spent writing a physics book could have been used doing physics research, whereas the
*  guitar playing time is just a separate category. So that doesn't count against you. So the system
*  is biased against you. But individual people react in a wide variety of ways, as you would
*  expect individual people to do. Chris Rogers says, is there a parallel universe where the Nazis won
*  World War Two? That seems like a shame. So it's a short question, but I already have three things I
*  want to say in response to this. One is, who cares if it seems like a shame? I'm sure that you're
*  being somewhat humorous here. But of course, we want to find out what is true, not what we want
*  to be true. So whether it's a shame or not is irrelevant, whether it's true, as I'm sure you
*  already know. More importantly, number two, if there's a parallel universe where the Nazis won
*  World War Two, then there's a parallel universe where World War Two didn't even happen. And that
*  would be awesome, right? I guess. But most importantly, number three, if the parallel
*  universes we're talking about here are Everettian universes, are different branches of the wave
*  function of the universe, then it's true that there are many different branches where many
*  different things happen. Not everything happens. Things happen that have some non-zero amplitude
*  in the wave function of the universe, which is certainly not everything that you can imagine.
*  But not all universes are created equally. And this is the absolutely crucial thing that I've
*  said before, I'll say again, we'll always keep saying. You can't just assign sort of an equal
*  amount of oomph or weight to every branch of the Everettian multiverse. Number one, it's not what
*  the theory says. Number two, it wouldn't work empirically. You would get that probability rule
*  wrong that we were talking about. The thick universes, the universes that have a lot of
*  amplitude associated with them, count more. And typically, and this is something which, you know,
*  it's hard to work out quantitatively, but we can sort of try to get a feeling intuitively for what's
*  going on. When you're talking about big human events, these are mostly classical. And what that
*  means is that there is a way that things can happen where almost all of the amplitude ends up,
*  right? When you throw a baseball, there's some probability that it's going to like
*  just zoom off into space and never come back, but mostly it's going to follow its classical
*  trajectory. Both universes are real, but one is overwhelmingly bigger and more important than the
*  other ones. So when you think about universes where the Nazis won World War II or World War II
*  didn't happen, it's overwhelmingly likely that these universes have very, very, very, very tiny
*  amplitudes in them. So don't worry about them, honestly. Like either don't believe Everettian
*  quantum mechanics or don't worry about these universes. Those are your two intellectually
*  consistent choices. If you think that Everett is right and explains probabilities and things like
*  that, then you should assign smaller intellectual weight to the branches of the wave function of
*  the universe that have a much smaller amplitude. Brendan Hall says, what did you think about
*  Barack Obama's presidency? Well, you know, it's a complicated thing. A presidency is a very big
*  thing. Overall, I was positive about it, positively disposed toward it. There's a couple of complicating
*  factors. Number one is that he started off with a very, very bad hand being dealt with a gigantic
*  financial crisis and a lot of, not to mention foreign policy crises, etc. So a lot of the work
*  was necessarily like preventing collapse rather than building new wonderful things. And number two,
*  you know, I think that as talented as Obama was, he was young, right? That was a legitimate
*  worry about him when he ran for president. He didn't have the experience that some other people
*  had. I think that showed up in his being too optimistic about how he could get Congress to
*  work with him and things like that. So he accomplished less in that sense than he would have.
*  But overall, my feelings were good. And look, any president who was president for eight years,
*  or for that matter, even four years, does literally thousands of things. And so, of course,
*  you can pick out things and I could pick out things that Obama did that I really, really
*  disagree with very strongly. But what has to count is the average weight. Likewise, when you
*  have someone who you like as president, you can ignore the bad things and just count the good
*  things because there's just so many things going on. I think that if you're going to try to,
*  which I'm not doing right now, by the way, but if you were going to try to do a comprehensive and
*  fair evaluation of someone's presidency, you can't just pick out the best and worst things,
*  you have to pick out everything. And you also have to be counterfactual. Like if this person
*  weren't there and there was someone else in the White House, then how things would have been
*  in that case. And I can imagine it being much, much worse. Let's put it that way.
*  John Farr says, can you speak a bit about the virus and the vaccine? Is the virus research gone
*  wrong? Is Bill Gates the mastermind? So much misinformation and it would be nice to hear
*  your voice of reason on this one. So I'm not sure exactly what the implication of this question is
*  with the virus research gone wrong and Bill Gates, the mastermind. No, I don't think the virus
*  research has gone wrong at all. I think it's been a brilliant success story. Bill Gates has nothing
*  to do with it, roughly speaking. I think that when future historians write about this era and they
*  say, oh yeah, that was the time when they had a major pandemic that killed hundreds and thousands
*  of millions of people. And then they quickly discovered a vaccine that would basically wipe
*  it out. But people decided not to take it. Why were they such idiots? I can't even imagine what
*  they will be thinking about what the rationalizations were. It's okay to say, well,
*  there's a vaccine, it's new, I wonder if it works. But there's not really any disagreement amongst
*  credentialed experts about the vaccine. It's really, really good. In fact, the overwhelming
*  majority of scientific studies have been along the lines of the vaccine is even better than we
*  thought it was going to be. So it's okay to be worried about that. But if you actually
*  read what sensible people are saying, it's pretty unanimous. And especially compared to
*  the alternative of not taking the vaccine, you're seeing now that an overwhelmingly
*  non-representative fraction of people who are in the hospital, especially with very serious
*  symptoms, are the unvaccinated ones. People who are vaccinated don't get the virus with nearly
*  the same rate as unvaccinated people do. And when they get it, the disease is not as bad.
*  That may or may not continue to be the case as new variants emerge, et cetera. But right now,
*  this is not a hard question, I'm afraid. It's pretty obvious. DMI says, what do you mean by
*  exist? Would you say that numbers exist? If you would say that logic exists within language,
*  what do you mean by logic? Well, I do think that this is a good question to which I can't give you
*  a full answer. I cannot give you an answer that is completely satisfactory because I haven't
*  worked out for myself what I think the answer to this question should be. I think it's a tricky
*  question because I think that different things can exist in different senses. I think the most
*  down-to-earth sense of existence should really be reserved for physical reality. That's what exists.
*  And of course, different aspects of physical reality exist also. So I don't think that numbers
*  exist or logic exists in the same way that physical reality exists. But there's some
*  some reality, some oomph, some power, some non-arbitrariness to numbers and logic that
*  is very important. I just don't think it should be given the same label, existence,
*  in the same way that the physical world exists. I'm a reality realist, as I like to say.
*  Leah Reichvalt says, what are your preferred sources of information for news and informing
*  your worldview more generally? So again, I don't think this is a hard question. I think that most
*  straightforward mainstream news media mostly do a good job at reporting facts. Not a perfect job,
*  by all means. As someone who has read stories in news media about science, things that I know very
*  well, I know perfectly well that media can get things wrong. But in basic things that are
*  happening in the world, like there was a building that fell down, I believe what the mainstream
*  media says about those things. I certainly don't believe conspiracy theories where the media is
*  trying to mislead you. There's a set of very real critiques of the mainstream media dealing not with
*  what it factually reports, but what it chooses to report and not report. And the spin that it puts
*  on reporting things and not reporting things. But that's a very long, complicated, non-trivial
*  conversation. If you think you have simple answers to those, then I'm already going to disagree with
*  you. I think it's complicated. In addition to that, I think it is good because even mainstream
*  media has its blind spots and its biases, it's good to have a variety. So for what I do for that,
*  and again, nothing very profound about my own personal technique, but that's where I find social
*  media very useful. Following a lot of different accounts on social media from a wide spectrum of
*  different points of view and different interests will help point you to things that might not have
*  appeared in the mainstream media. And you should always be a little bit more skeptical of those,
*  but you can, you know, again, get a feeling for how credible they are, etc. So I get sort of most
*  of my news from conventional sources, but then I try to keep a lot of people I trust in the social
*  media feed so that I can get pointed to things that I would not necessarily have come across if
*  I were just reading the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or whatever it was.
*  Adrian says, around 10 years ago, you wrote an illuminating blog post about how energy is not
*  necessarily conserved in cosmology. Are there ways to harness usable energy from that, at least in
*  principle? Roughly speaking, that's probably a complicated question, but roughly speaking,
*  the answer is no. There could always be loopholes that I haven't thought of here, but the point is
*  that energy is not conserved in cosmology, at least the energy of stuff is not conserved in
*  cosmology because the existence of general relativity where space-time is dynamical and
*  responds to matter and energy means that the total amount of energy rather than just being a constant
*  obeys a relationship with the curvature of space-time. So space-time expanding or contracting
*  or doing other things can change the amount of energy in matter and radiation. And to be useful,
*  you say usable energy, if you're here on earth, space-time isn't changing that much.
*  In the approximation where space-time is static, which is a really good approximation here on earth,
*  then energy is conserved. So I don't see any useful way to get anything from that subtlety
*  of general relativity. Okay, we're going to group two questions together because they're about the
*  antimatter asymmetry in the universe. Clyde Schechter says there are two difficult to explain
*  asymmetries in physics that I struggle with understanding. One is the macroscopic existence
*  of an arrow of time in the laws of physics on the micro scale or invariant under time reversal.
*  The other is the predominance of matter over antimatter. Again, nothing in the micro laws of
*  physics calls for this. My question is whether these two asymmetries are related in some deep way.
*  And the other is from Sam Cardford who says question on baryogenesis. I've heard two
*  potential theories explained, one being there is an asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the
*  physics of the early universe, and the second being that we can only exist in the universe
*  with this discrepancy, so we might just exist in a statistical anomaly, so something like the
*  anthropic principle. So to Sam's question, that second possibility that there's just a statistical
*  anomaly? No, no one believes that. No credible person believes that. Number one, I don't know
*  where the statistical anomaly would come from, but number two, you know, whenever you run these
*  anthropic arguments, the correct thing to do is to say there's a distribution of possible
*  configurations of stuff, environments, situations in the universe, and living creatures will only
*  exist in those particular configurations where life is possible, okay? So to do this at all,
*  there's a selection effect. You're only observing those circumstances under which life can exist,
*  and observers can be found, but you need a distribution. You need to know how many of
*  one kind of situations there are versus how many of other kinds of situations there are,
*  and therefore, when you need some kind of fluctuation to let life exist, generally,
*  the anthropic principle would predict, absent any other mechanism, that the fluctuation will be as
*  small as it needs to be to get life to exist, whereas in our observable universe, there's a
*  hundred billion galaxies or a trillion galaxies, and they're all matter. They're not all antimatter.
*  That would be a much, much, much, much, much bigger fluctuation than you would need for life to exist.
*  So it could be that the asymmetry between matter and antimatter is just baked into the initial
*  conditions of the universe, but it's much more likely and much more popular to think that there
*  is some, like you say, asymmetry in the dynamics of matter and antimatter that created that
*  difference. So Clyde is asking whether that asymmetry could have anything to do with the
*  arrow of time. Not that I know of. The arrow of time in the sense of irreversible processes
*  existing in the universe is because entropy is increasing. To get an asymmetry in matter
*  versus antimatter, you need to violate what is called time reversal invariance, which is not
*  quite the same thing. Time reversal invariance can be violated and is violated by the fundamental
*  laws of physics, as we understand them, without violating reversibility. So things can go one way,
*  but still have the property that you know exactly where they came from. So remember the ice cube
*  melting into a glass of water? The irreversibility comes from the fact that given the final state,
*  a cool glass of water, you don't know where it came from. You don't know whether it came from
*  a cool glass of water 10 minutes ago or whether it was a warm glass of water with an ice cube in it.
*  Whereas in particle physics, there is t-violation, t being the time reversal operator,
*  but everything is still reversible. It's unitary evolution, smooth reversible evolution from one
*  state to another. But that is all you need, or that is one of the things you need. You need that
*  kind of time reversal violation in order to get a baryon asymmetry, more baryons than anti-baryons.
*  As far as I know, there's, I mean, sorry, you do also need, as Andrei Sakharov pointed this out back
*  in the 60s, you also need a departure from thermal equilibrium, which does rely on the arrow of time.
*  So I guess the right thing to say is that getting a baryon asymmetry requires an arrow of time,
*  but an arrow of time does not require a baryon asymmetry or any of the other ingredients for
*  getting a baryon asymmetry. So if anything, their connection goes one way, but not the other.
*  Kathy Seeger says, I've read that in June 2021, British astronomer Alexia Lopez and team discovered
*  a so-called giant arc, a structure of galaxies spanning 3.3 billion light years. It was said
*  that this wouldn't go along with the cosmological principle that matter on a large scale is evenly
*  distributed throughout the universe. Is there an explanation that could align cosmic inflation and
*  unevenly distributed matter? So two things here. One is I haven't read the paper. I haven't read
*  the specific example, so I can't comment on the giant arc or whatever it is. But number two,
*  there's essentially zero chance that the distribution of matter in the universe is flagrantly at
*  violation with the cosmological principle that matter is evenly distributed. The reason why is
*  because we have the cosmic microwave background, right? The cosmic microwave background is much
*  more precise and easy to measure than the distribution of galaxies. And it's super duper
*  isotropic. It looks the same in every direction. If matter through the universe was distributed
*  very non-uniformly, you would know because the microwave background would reflect that,
*  even if it just through gravitational lensing, etc. So I'm 99.999% confident that any
*  distribution that you find in galaxies or collections of galaxies will ultimately be
*  compatible with more or less cosmological homogeneity on very large scales. It's not perfect,
*  right? It's a good approximation, but it's a very good approximation.
*  Okay, I'm going to group two questions together. Ulrich Shiebe says,
*  The Marvel Cinematic Universe Loki series, as well as upcoming Spider-Man and Dr. Strange movies,
*  are diving headfirst into the multiverse. The explanation for how this fictional multiverse
*  works was explained to Loki at some point, and the broader lines seem to be heavily influenced
*  by many-worlds theory. You mentioned once that you had a small part to play in Avengers Endgame.
*  Rob Kraft says,
*  I recently re-read the novel Dune by Frank Herbert in preparation for the upcoming movie.
*  This is the first time I've read it since becoming familiar with many-worlds. It occurred to me that
*  Herbert's description of Paul Atreides' ability to see the future and possible timelines aligns
*  with the Ever-Readyen idea of the branching of the universe. Do you think Herbert, who published
*  Dune in 1965, could have known the Ever-Readyen interpretation and used that as the basis for his
*  explanation of Paul's ability to see the future? So I'm grouping these together for the obvious
*  reasons that they're connecting storytelling versions of the multiverse idea and asking if
*  there's a connection with the Ever-Readyen quantum mechanical version. And I want to emphasize that
*  if there is any connection, it's a very, very tenuous one. These are special examples of
*  you know, these are stories. These are in fact fantasy stories, even though they're gussied up
*  in some science fiction elements. The authors just make up the story that the rules of the game
*  for dramatic purposes, okay? Maybe they were inspired a little bit by Everett and quantum
*  mechanics or by the cosmological multiverse, etc. I don't know. But they don't need to be. You could
*  easily come up with these ideas without that particular inspiration. And certainly the actual
*  ways in which they implement the multiverses in both cases are nothing to do with Ever-Readyen
*  quantum mechanics. Now I did, I can reveal that when I was talking to the folks in Avengers,
*  you know, I got some advice in there that was taken about time travel. But I had, you know,
*  a more elaborate scheme for fixing the whole universe. So my idea was that there really were
*  branching timelines. Remember, you know, when the Hulk goes back to talk to the Ancient One,
*  played by Tilda Swinton, and she gives him a spiel about the one timeline and the other timelines,
*  and that is elaborated on in Loki, which is a great series, by the way, if you haven't seen it.
*  So the metaphor that is kind of used in the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse is pruning the other
*  timelines, right, getting rid of them somehow. So my idea was that that would be terrible,
*  because that's literally committing genocide, right? You're literally ending the lives of
*  trillions and trillions of people living in this timeline, and that should be bad. That should be
*  considered to be immoral, if anything is. And therefore, a better thing to do would be to
*  re-merge the timelines. Again, this can't happen in the real world. I made it up. But I thought it
*  would be interesting to imagine that the difficult task that they faced was to sort of line up what
*  was physically happening in all the different branches of the multiverse so that things once
*  again came together to make one big branch. Therefore, you could sort of preserve a single
*  timeline without literally committing genocide and killing a bunch of people. I think that was
*  too conceptually complicated and subtle for them to go with, so they didn't. But still, there's a
*  novel out there waiting to be written that has that idea in it. Tim Kennedy says, I've long been
*  curious about the mass of the proton. I've been taught and can accept that it comes mostly from
*  the binding energy of the quarks inside. But in a recent AMA, you characterize the inside of the
*  proton as a roiling soup of quarks that are appearing and disappearing, but with a constant
*  instantaneous average of three quarks. I had convinced myself that having exactly three quarks
*  constantly racing around at near light speed could result in a very large binding energy,
*  but now I am confused again. Maybe I should not be imagining the mass of the proton as something
*  resulting from classical mechanics. So once again, a lot going on in this question. First,
*  I have no idea what I said in the last AMA. My short-term memory and my long-term memory
*  both very bad. So forget what I said. I certainly would not want to characterize the inside of a
*  proton as a roiling soup of quarks appearing and disappearing. What I really like to emphasize over
*  and over again is that in quantum field theory, the state of something like a proton is static.
*  There's nothing changing. There's nothing roiling. There's nothing appearing and
*  disappearing inside a proton. We speak about it using a sloppy language of virtual particles
*  appearing and disappearing, but what really is there is just a fixed constant static quantum
*  field configuration. If you force yourself to interpret this quantum field configuration as
*  a collection of particles, I'm not forcing you to do that, but if you just insist and you imagine
*  drawing Feynman diagrams representing what's going on, the Feynman diagrams would look like
*  a bunch of particles popping in and out of existence, but the sum of all of them would be
*  a static unchanging field configuration. So quantum field theory really matters here.
*  That's one thing. The other thing is the extra energy. So the point of this question is that if
*  you calculate the mass of a lone all-by-itself quark, okay, that's a tricky thing to define
*  because there's no such thing as an all-by-itself quark. Quarks are confined inside bigger particles,
*  but you can do it. You can do something like it, and the masses of the three particles that go,
*  the three quarks that go in to make a proton are less by a lot than the mass of the proton,
*  okay? So the mass of the proton doesn't come from the mass of the quarks. It comes from the energy
*  contained in the gluon field, in the strong interaction analog of the electric and magnetic
*  fields. So here's the way you should think about it. Imagine there was an electron. So forget about
*  quarks because quarks are complicated. Take an electron and imagine that you could turn off the
*  electric field of the electron, okay? You can't, but imagine you could. And the electron has a mass
*  then all by itself. An uncharged electron has a certain mass and now gradually turn back on
*  the electric field. Well, it takes energy to turn on the electric field, to create that electric
*  field out of nowhere. So equals MC squared, the energy contained in a motionless particle,
*  a particle at rest is what we call the mass divided by the speed of times the speed of light
*  squared is the energy. And so you have more mass. There's more energy and therefore more mass.
*  There's a contribution to the mass of the particle from its electric field. And physicists argue
*  about, you know, renormalizing this and what counts as what, et cetera, et cetera. But the point is
*  there is energy and therefore mass contained in the electric field as well as in the bare mass of
*  the electron by itself. And one reason you know this picture works is because if you take an
*  electron and a proton and you bring them together, they make hydrogen and it's a stable
*  configuration. It takes energy to remove the electron from the proton. And the reason why
*  is because the electron's electric field has energy, the proton's electric field has energy,
*  but when you bring them together at large distances, they cancel and they have no energy.
*  So there is less energy in the combination of electron and proton than there was in the
*  separate electron plus the separate proton because both of those guys had electric fields which carry
*  energy. I mean, you combine them, the electric field mostly cancels and the energy goes away.
*  Exactly the same story is true for quarks in a proton. Now you have three quarks in the proton,
*  two ups and a down. They're different colors. But if you took a quark all by itself,
*  it would have a field, a gluon field, a quantum chromodynamic field, which is the quark equivalent,
*  the strong interaction equivalent of the electric field around the electron.
*  The difference is, and this is the crucial difference that makes a strong interaction
*  special, just like you take the mass of the electron and then add to it the energy from
*  its electric field, you take the mass of the quark and then you add to it the energy from its
*  quantum chromodynamic field, but that energy is infinite. If you had a lone quark all by itself,
*  the energy in the gluon field around it would be infinitely big. However, if you have three quarks,
*  all of different colors, then just like the electron and the proton, the fields cancel out
*  at infinity. So you get a finite energy remaining, a finite little remnant energy
*  in the gluon fields of the three quarks that are combined together to make the proton.
*  That's why you can't take a quark out of the proton because it would require an
*  infinite amount of energy to have a quark all by itself. But inside the quark, there's still
*  some energy from the leftover quantum chromodynamic field. And it's from that energy that the proton
*  gets its mass. The proton does not get its mass because the electrons or the quarks are moving.
*  They're not moving. They're in their ground state. They're in their lowest energy states.
*  It's from the quantum chromodynamic field that carries some energy, most of the energy in the
*  proton or likewise the neutron, et cetera. Okay, grouping two questions together. One is from P.
*  Walder who says, critical rationalists such as David Deutsch seem to suggest that induction
*  cannot be a valid approach to gaining access to truth about reality. They also seem to suggest
*  that Bayesianism is dressed up induction. Can you explain why you feel Bayesianism is a better
*  approach to understanding the nature of reality than hard to vary explanations that are advocated
*  by critical rationalists? And Jeff B says, are there any convictions that you hold about the
*  universe that are not based in scientific evidence but just feel right to you? Okay,
*  these two questions might seem different, but I'm going to relate them. The point being,
*  I'm not very familiar with Deutsch's argument as to why Bayesianism doesn't work and something
*  else does work. He's a more Pop-Aryan. I know that, but I haven't read his stuff very carefully.
*  I'm only very vaguely familiar with it, so I can't comment on what David Deutsch is saying. So I'm
*  not going to say yes or no. I can try to justify what I want to say because what I want to say is
*  the opposite of saying Bayesianism is dressed up induction. I want to say that Pop-Aryanism,
*  falsificationism, is dressed down Bayesianism. So to say that, you have to be clear about what
*  you mean by Bayesianism because Bayesianism comes in two parts. One is Bayes' rule, right? The formula
*  or Bayes' theorem or Bayes' law or whatever you want to call it. That's a theorem. That's a
*  mathematical result. It's just a statement about how probability works. If you're dealing with a
*  set of quantities that obey the axioms of probability, then Bayes' rule is just true
*  for those quantities, those probabilities. So you can't, there's no option there.
*  There's no other way to do it. The part where things become a little bit more potentially
*  controversial is not the formalism of Bayes' rule, but the meaning you attach to those probabilities.
*  Okay, where you go from just applying Bayes' rule to sort of doing Bayesian reasoning
*  is in the step where you say, okay, to every proposition I think of, I attach a prior. I give
*  a prior credence or a prior probability that that is true. And then I learn more about the world
*  by looking at the world, right? Doing experiments, gathering data, calculating the likelihood
*  that in this, if these propositions that I'm thinking about were true, I would have collected
*  that data and then using Bayes' law to update my credences from priors to posteriors.
*  So the tricky thing that not everyone agrees with is the idea that we get reasoning off the ground
*  by starting with a collection of priors about different things. It's a very subjective way of
*  doing probabilities. You're thinking probabilities as degrees of belief, as credences, rather than as
*  frequencies of things happening. And to a Bayesian like myself, it's hard to imagine doing it any
*  other way. Like if you say, what is the probability that it will rain tomorrow here where I am in
*  Boston? It's pretty high because we're at the remnants of a hurricane coming. But it's going
*  to rain or it's not. Like there's no frequency involved there, right? It's a degree of belief.
*  It's the best prediction I can make him the information I get. So to Bayesians, this is just
*  how to work. There's really no other alternative. But a lot of people react against the idea
*  that probabilities should be something fundamentally subjective. Different people can have different
*  priors and that bugs them. Now that's not what is bugging, I think, David Deutsch, etc.
*  The problem of induction, a well-known problem that David Hume and other people talked a lot about,
*  is you can't prove things with metaphysical certainty just by observing a lot of instances.
*  Can you prove that all swans are white? Well, you observe every single swan and they're all white.
*  Have you proven it? Well, unless you've literally seen every single possible swan,
*  it is always possible that tomorrow you'll see a black swan. And therefore you haven't proven
*  anything. So I would say that Bayesianism is not dressed up induction. Bayesianism is the fix to
*  that problem. Because sure, you're not proving with metaphysical certainty that all swans are
*  white, but you start with a prior that either swans are white all the time or there's another prior
*  on the proposition that some swans are white and some are black. You used those theories to make
*  predictions for what the color of the next one you're going to see is. You update your
*  credences as you get more data in. But the critical thing is your credences never go to zero,
*  right? You can see a billion white swans in a row. You still have some non-zero credence that
*  some swans are black because if some swans were black but only one out of a billion,
*  there would be some probability, some likelihood that that's what you would have seen.
*  So you don't run into this problem that induction runs into because you're not trying to prove
*  things with metaphysical certainty. You're just updating your credences as you get more information.
*  Now the Popperian falsification way of doing things, and again I haven't read Karl Popper in
*  any detail either, so you Popperians out there don't get mad at me. I'm discussing not really
*  what Popper said but sort of the cartoon Popper that a lot of scientists carry around with them.
*  This idea is that you list every possible thing that could be true and you don't assign prior
*  probabilities to them, credences to them. You just say it could be true or it either is true or isn't.
*  I don't know yet. Then you do experiments, you collect data, and you figure out that this piece
*  of data is incompatible with that theory, therefore it's false. It's been falsified.
*  So rather than having a large list of propositions and assigning credences to them, you have a large,
*  maybe even larger list of propositions and some of them have been falsified and some of them have not.
*  And that's it. That's what you're allowed to say. If you haven't falsified anything,
*  then it's not yet falsified. That's all you're allowed to say. To me, that's just a crude
*  approximation to being a good Bayesian, because in reality we don't assign equal prior credences to
*  every possible proposition and it would be crazy, I think, to do that. No one does it, no one should
*  do it. Why pretend that that's what we're doing? Or even failing, I guess. No one would say you
*  should apply equal credences but some people would say just don't apply credences. I think that also
*  fails. I think you have to apply credences. They might be implicit. You might not be very
*  above board about it, but implicitly you're doing that all the time. And that's why I'm grouping this
*  question with Jeff's question. Are there any convictions that are not based on scientific
*  evidence that just feel right to me? So the short answer is no. I mean, the principled answer is no.
*  You know, I don't, it's, I do have beliefs, degrees of belief, credences for how the universe works,
*  but I'm willing to update them, okay? And it's, you know, to say they're not based in scientific
*  evidence is hard to exactly countenance because these beliefs came from somewhere, usually from
*  observing other things about the world and saying, well, you know, this sort of extrapolates beyond
*  what I've seen to other things that I think are right. So mostly I don't have any convictions
*  about the universe that are not based in scientific evidence. I do have prior probabilities.
*  The one counter example or loophole to that is that there are some propositions, which if they
*  were true, science itself would not be possible, right? If I were being taunted by an evil demon
*  and all of my sense data were completely unrelated to the reality of the world, then I'm not able to
*  do science at all, right? Or if I were a Boltzmann brain that just fluctuated into existence.
*  So these are self-undermining or cognitively unstable beliefs about the world. And so I have
*  a prior probability that is essentially zero, that those are true. It can't even be exactly zero
*  because maybe the demon walks through the door and says, ha, see, I've been fooling you this whole
*  time. You never know. But you keep that probability so, so, so low to begin with that you don't take
*  it seriously unless you're forced into it later on. Brian F. Carpenter says, I've been trying to
*  find out the orientation of the Milky Way galaxy in relation to the origin of the universe or big
*  bang event and more broadly the orientation of space time and general relativity. In other words,
*  if space time is like the fabric of a trampoline, how do we know on which plane it's stretched and
*  why? So I have to unask this question, Brian, because space time is not like the fabric of
*  a trampoline. When we visualize, again, I've already said bad things about our tendency to need to
*  visualize things earlier on, but some things are not visualizable. Space time is four-dimensional.
*  It's not two-dimensional like a trampoline. A trampoline or a sheet of rubber or whatever
*  has the feature that it is embedded in a bigger space. If you treat the trampoline as two-dimensional,
*  it's embedded in three-dimensional space. Therefore, if you take the trampoline analogy
*  too seriously, you begin to think that space time is embedded in something, but it's not.
*  So there's no such thing as the orientation of space time with respect to what would it be
*  oriented? I don't even know what it could possibly be oriented with. So I would just undo the premises
*  of your questions. There is a more down to earth question that you get to, which is like you have
*  a bunch of galaxies, a bunch of stars, a bunch of solar systems, and they have angular momentum.
*  They're spinning, so there's some plane in which things are aligned. Is there some universal
*  lining up of these planes? Do different galaxies still orbit in the same direction?
*  The answer there, as far as anyone knows, is no. People look at that a little bit, not very
*  carefully, but we're so convinced theoretically that it would be weird for that to be true
*  it's not a high priority for people to collect data and look at it. When they have, they found
*  no evidence that there is any general alignment of different things in the universe. Brian Owenson
*  says, you recently tweeted that most of the mass in your body is made of particles containing 48
*  quarks. You must be referring to an oxygen atom. Are there any interesting questions that are better
*  addressed by thinking of an oxygen nucleus as a pool of 48 quarks, as opposed to thinking about
*  the nucleus as a pool of separate protons and neutrons? So there's a couple things going on.
*  Just to be strictly clear, you say oxygen atom, but what you mean is oxygen nucleus. It's the
*  nucleus that is made up of 48 quarks. The reason why I made that quip on Twitter is because people
*  were, as they occasionally do, getting excited about tetraquarks or other collections of new
*  collections, previously undiscovered collections of quarks that you can find at Large Hadron
*  Collider or wherever. And it's great, you know, this is important science, don't get me wrong.
*  It's important to do this, to learn about quarks and QCD and the strong interactions and how they
*  fit together. But I worry that people are getting excited just because there's more than three quarks
*  in this particle. Okay, we have plenty of particles with more than three quarks in them.
*  Every atomic nucleus is a particle with more than three quarks in them. And so that's why I picked
*  oxygen because most of your body mass is in the form of oxygen nuclei. The point being that you,
*  how do you define particle? There's two choices. One is you say, oh, only the elementary particles
*  count. In which case it's only quarks that count. Protons and neutrons do not count as particles
*  under that definition. The other definition you could use, which is also perfectly good,
*  is a bound collection of particles, of fundamental particles, can be counted as a
*  composite particle. In that case, mesons and baryons, like pions and protons and neutrons,
*  those are all composite particles. Perfectly good definition also. But under that definition,
*  atomic nuclei are composite particles. So you say, are there conditions under which you should
*  think of an oxygen nucleus as 48 quarks rather than separate protons and neutrons?
*  Yeah, all of the conditions. This is sort of a secret of nuclear physics that does not become
*  clear when you look at little cartoon images of nuclei. Because when you draw cartoon images of,
*  let's say, hydrogen nucleus, sorry, hydrogen is not a good example, helium, two protons and two
*  neutrons, you tend to draw separate protons and neutrons. But that's not what the nucleus looks
*  like. It's just a spherical blob. And the spherical blob has all of the quarks and neutrons
*  arranged in it, not exactly equally, because there's a Pauli exclusion principle. But they're
*  not confined separately to protons and neutrons, which then combine into nuclei. They're all in
*  the nucleus. That's how they have names for the nuclear drop model and things like that, the bag
*  model. But you shouldn't think of protons and neutrons in a nucleus as having separate identities
*  anymore. That's all just a sea of quarks. David Gotti says, priority question, my son is about
*  to start a master's program in physics and would like to get a PhD after that. Much of his
*  undergraduate work was in astronomy and physics influenced by his key professors work on galaxies.
*  And he made poster session presentations at the annual American Astronomical Society Conference.
*  However, he's open to other fields within physics he has not been strongly introduced to yet.
*  Can you discuss and give advice for him how to use his master's work to best set himself up to be a
*  strong PhD applicant and how his loved ones can best support that? So it's a bit of an unusual
*  question actually, David, because most in the United States anyway, which is where I'm familiar
*  with what goes on, most people who get PhDs don't go from undergraduate to master's to PhD.
*  They do a right from undergraduate program to PhD program. That's the much more common route to go.
*  You pick up a master's along the way, like after two years, they just say, oh, yep, here's a master's
*  degree, no big deal. But it's not a separate step. So it's perfectly okay to go to a master's program
*  first, but I'm just saying it's not the common route. So I'm not as good at offering advice
*  about what to do because it doesn't happen that often. I mean, in fact, what I would say is this,
*  roughly, who cares that he's getting a master's? What matters is he's going to be applying for PhD
*  programs. So the question is not what should you do in your master's program to prepare you.
*  Your question is just how to be the best possible applicant to a PhD program, whether or not you
*  have a master's degree. When you apply to PhD programs, again, I can only speak for the US
*  because different countries are very different. Usually, you indicate a preference for a group
*  to be a part of. So you'll have a department, physics department, right? But there'll be
*  different groups within the department. Theoretical particle physics, experimental particle physics,
*  theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, theoretical condensed matter physics,
*  biophysics, et cetera, right? There are individual groups and there are different faculty members
*  associated with those groups. You might think that either you apply to the department or you
*  very specifically say who you want your PhD advisor to be, but neither one is true. You typically say,
*  I would like to be in this group. And then you get there. And when you're there in the group,
*  you sort of talk to the different faculty in the group and eventually settle on one as your advisor.
*  So that's the sort of mindset that an applicant should have. They need to know what kind of group
*  they want to be in. By the time you're entering grad school, you shouldn't be undecided about that
*  anymore. You don't need to be decided about what exact research project you're going to do, or even
*  deciding between like string theory and particle physics or something like that, things that are
*  within the same group, okay? But you do need to decide what group you're going to be in because
*  different groups might have different numbers of people they can accept, different standards,
*  different amount of funding available for new students, things like that.
*  So it doesn't matter that much what research you did before you were a PhD student, whether
*  it's undergraduate or master's. It's good that you've done research. Doing research is a good
*  thing, but especially if you're going to do highly theoretical things in grad school. But even if not,
*  it's generally understood that people will do different research in the PhD program than they
*  did before. What's much more important is getting good letters of recommendation, okay? That's the
*  single most important. I should have said that first if I were front loading the important thing.
*  The important thing to use that master's degree for is to have faculty members, ideally faculty
*  members who will be known to people in the graduate, in the PhD programs they'll eventually
*  apply to, get to know the student very, very well. Well enough to really write a good letter of
*  recommendation for them that can be explicit about why they're a strong applicant. It's also nice to
*  get good GRE scores and grades and so forth. But if you really want to put your research time to work
*  while you're a master's student, you know, it's, I see it all the time where people apply to grad
*  school and no faculty member knows them well enough to write a good letter. And that's bad.
*  That's a shame because that's really useful information for the admissions committee.
*  So I guess the two things to do are number one, get to know faculty members well enough they can
*  write you good letters. Number two, choose what group you want to be in when you apply to the
*  PhD programs. And then you can hopefully find a group with many different faculty members in it.
*  And once you're there, once your son is there, decide which of them might make a good advisor.
*  Jesse Rimmler says, worker-owned cooperatives are examples of extending democracy into the workplace.
*  As a fan of democracy, are you interested in a similar extension of democracy into
*  scientific institutions? You know, I think roughly it's already there. It's too late.
*  You know, science is not an autocracy. There's no pope or emperor of science. You know, science is
*  run by scientists as a collective. And it's not very formal, right? You don't make elections. You
*  don't vote on whether this theory is true or not. But individual scientists make up their mind and
*  they vote with their feet. They vote with deciding what to do research on and what papers to write
*  and who to hire and things like that. That's how they make the voting. And you know, they can be
*  department chair or whatever, but who cares? Being a department chair means you decide who gets what
*  office. It doesn't mean you decide what scientific results are true. Okay? Science is very democratic.
*  This is part of the wonder of how science works is that ideas bubble up from the bottom and you need
*  to convince people that you're right, just like you do in a democracy. So I am a fan of exactly that.
*  BK says, a lot of academics have dissected the show The Chair, which is on, where is the chair on?
*  Is it on Netflix or HBO? I forget. Anyway, they dissected it on Twitter down to the decor in the
*  buildings, offices, etc. with reference to how realistic they look. What do you think of the
*  representation of Caltech in films and TV shows such as The Big Bang Theory? So I have a small
*  amusing anecdote to say about this. I've said it before, so apologies. I only have a fine number
*  of stories to tell. So those of you who listen to me too much are going to hear them all several times.
*  My friend David Salzberg was the official science advisor on The Big Bang Theory. David is an
*  experimental particle physicist at UCLA and they really took the science advising seriously,
*  you know, way more than most science shows on cable TV do. Let's put it that way. What it means
*  is that all the science dialogue and all of the equations on the whiteboards, etc. were from David
*  and he made absolutely sure they were accurate. Even if they were hypothesizing, they were
*  hypothesizing in plausible ways. So that's good, even though most people wouldn't really care,
*  to be honest. But what was more interesting is before the show ever started, they were
*  designing the sets, right? This is what you're asking about, how the places look.
*  And they had these ideas like, you know, you would see a lab like you saw in The Avengers, right? Or,
*  you know, you see any of these science fiction shows of very high tech glossy things with,
*  you know, gleaming lens flare and chrome and whatever. And then so David Salzberg said,
*  well, I'll take you on a tour of the labs in the physics department at UCLA. And the set designers
*  were appalled. They're like, oh my god, this place is a dump. You're blocking your lasers with a
*  piece of cardboard attached to a clothespin. This is not very high tech at all. Of course,
*  because, you know, you have a limited budget and you want to stretch the budget as far as you can.
*  You don't spend your actual science dollars on a gleaming, all futuristic looking laboratory
*  equipment. So that got reflected. If you look at the lab scenes in The Big Bang Theory, they're
*  actually much more realistic than most other scenes. The other thing I can say along those
*  lines is a slight faux pas on my part. I was once consulting on the TV show Bones.
*  There was a murder mystery where the accused murderer was a theoretical physicist played by
*  Richard Schiff, famous as Toby from the West Wing. And so I got to write some of his dialogue and
*  yeah, in fact, some of the things he says have to do with entropy and the arrow of time, as you will
*  see in Robertson Walker cosmologies. I also write blackboards, which turned out to be an important
*  plot point on the show, the blackboard. So if you see this show, if you want to Google the episode
*  of Bones with Richard Schiff as a guest star, I forget what the title of the show was, but look,
*  it's actually really extremely well done. Like there's not a dry eye in the house at the end
*  of this show and your mistiness will be because of equations, believe it or not. I'm not going to
*  give away more than that. But the point is, you know, I walked onto the set, they had me visit and
*  I walked onto the set and it's a typical Hollywood version of a professor's office, right? Like big
*  overstuffed leather chair, elaborate desk, all of these books that look like they're from 150
*  years ago. And I couldn't help myself. I'm like, yep, this is a very Hollywood looking physicist's
*  office. Real physicist's office don't look like that. They're usually pretty Spartan affairs.
*  The walls are often cinderblock with a coat of paint. The books are not from 150 years ago. The
*  chairs are not leather bound. Let's put it all that way. And I felt bad because the set designer
*  was there and they were hurt because they tried to do a good job and they had no idea what a real
*  physicist's office looked like. I mean, they're much smaller than what the TV show had also.
*  So I at least said, well, let's put some more modern looking books on here or something like that.
*  Turns out to be hard to do because modern looking books, you might need to get
*  rights to show them on TV, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. My third story, I don't know why I'm
*  giving all these stories, but my third story along those lines is on the TV show Fringe.
*  I also consulted a little bit and a friend of mine, Glenn Whitman was one of the writers on the show.
*  And so he had me, he asked me some questions about wormholes and things like that. And I gave him
*  answers. And so as a reward, usually you don't get rewarded for this at all. You certainly don't get
*  paid for any of this, that's for sure. So my reward was, he said, there's a scene in the script
*  where someone is passing a book to someone else, we'll make it one of your books. We'll invent a
*  book that you haven't written, but we'll say you wrote. So they invented a book called Cosmology
*  by me. And John Noble's character says, have you stolen my copy of Carol's Cosmology or something
*  like that? And they have a book, like someone, the set designer made a book with my name on the
*  title, et cetera. And only afterward, this is before I'd written most of my trade books, but only
*  afterwards did I say, I wrote a general relativity textbook, they could have just used that. I could
*  have advertised my actual book instead of let them use a fake book. But no one said I was very smart
*  about these things. My branding needs a little upgrading, what can I do? All right, that was a
*  much longer question, I answered than you needed for that question, but it's a good question.
*  Paul Hess says, I believed you once mentioned that entanglement leads to or causes increased
*  entropy. Can you explain this connection a little more detail? As entropy always increases in the
*  universe, does entanglement also increase in similar proportions? So I'm going to have to
*  apologize because I do say things like that. And I try to be careful when I'm saying them, but there
*  are nuances and details that get glossed over. There are different kinds of entropy. When I say
*  that the entropy of the universe was low near the Big Bang and it's been growing ever since,
*  I really mean some kind of coarse grained Ludwig Boltzmann kind of entropy, which means that there
*  is a system which is the universe and there are many, many different microstates the system can be
*  in. And we group together many of those microstates into a macrostate, count them, take the logarithm,
*  and that's the entropy. That is a kind of entropy. There is another kind of entropy that exists in
*  quantum mechanics that Boltzmann didn't know about it. Boltzmann didn't know about quantum mechanics
*  and this kind of entropy was invented by John von Neumann and it's called either the von Neumann
*  entropy or the entanglement entropy. And it's called entropy because it is entropy. It's a
*  very similar conceptual thing. It has very similar looking equations, but it is a different thing
*  because entanglement exists in quantum mechanics and doesn't exist in classical mechanics.
*  So the point is this. If you have a system where you know what macrostate it's in, okay, so you have
*  a glass of water, a bunch of molecules in there, etc., but you don't know it's microstate,
*  entropy becomes useful because you can give a probability distribution to all the different
*  possible microstates, right? You can say, well, I'm sure the system has some particular position
*  and momentum and orientation of every single molecule, but I don't know what they are, so I'm
*  going to talk about a probability distribution, okay? So the difference between knowing the exact
*  microstate and just knowing the probability distribution, we call the former a pure state.
*  It's an actual particular realization of the positions and velocities of all the molecules
*  that Laplace's demon could work with and we call a mixed state the idea there's a probability
*  distribution over all the different possibilities. So the same thing is true in quantum mechanics.
*  You can have a pure state which is described by a wave function. You can also have a mixed state
*  which is described by some sort of probability distribution over different pure states. The
*  difference that I'm finally getting to in quantum mechanics is when you have two systems and they
*  are entangled with each other, remember the whole point of entanglement is that the two subsystems
*  don't have a wave function all by themselves. There is only one wave function, the wave function of
*  the universe, and if you just want to isolate your focus down onto two systems that are not
*  entangled with the rest of the universe but maybe with each other, then those two systems have a
*  single composite wave function, okay? So if they're entangled with each other then it is automatically
*  true that even if you know the exact wave function of the complete two system thing,
*  two subsystem system if you want, there is no single wave function for either of the constituents,
*  okay? They're both automatically in a mixed state. You can describe if it's A and B, if it's Alice
*  and Bob and they have their particles and the particles are entangled, there is no wave function
*  for Alice's particle, there's no wave function for Bob's particle, there's just a wave function for
*  both, there's no state, there's no pure state for particle A or for particle B. But you can have
*  a mixed state to particle A and particle B. It's as if, if you didn't know that particle A was
*  entangled, you would say that particle A is in a combination, not a superposition, but like a
*  statistical mixture of different possible quantum states and therefore it has an entropy. So the
*  thing that is new is that in quantum mechanics, entanglement can lead to an entropy of subsystems
*  even if you know the exact state of the composite system as a whole. Having said all that,
*  okay, that's the connection. Does entanglement increase as the universe goes on? Well,
*  that's a complicated thing. I want to say roughly yes. I would not go into any more details than
*  that, but the details are interesting and I don't think we understand all of those details
*  precisely. That's one of the reasons why I want to be vague here. Brad Malt says,
*  taking aliens seriously, Avi Loeb says that alien visitors may possess technologies so advanced
*  that they would look like magic to us and miracles we cannot really understand. His logic is that our
*  own technologies are evolving exponentially, so imagine what a civilization with a few hundred
*  thousand or millions of years could do. What is the coolest magic you could think that advanced
*  civilizations might possess? And do you think this could be any of the following? The ability
*  to connect with other branches of the multiverse, the ability to travel near the speed of light,
*  the ability to travel backward or forward in time, or the ability to make use of dimensions
*  greater than four that are currently accessible to us. Okay, so the reason why I wanted to answer
*  this question is because this very interesting list of possibilities, actually these, you have
*  four possibilities. Connecting with other branches of the multiverse, travel near the speed of light,
*  travel backward or forward in time, make use of extra dimensions. So, the first one is that
*  we have to connect with other branches of the multiverse to make use of extra dimensions. These
*  have very different statuses, these questions, okay, or these possibilities. So, the ability to
*  travel near the speed of light, absolutely, of course. We can do that with individual particles,
*  we accelerate particles near the speed of light. To accelerate a spaceship to near the speed of
*  light is just a technology problem, like that's very, very solvable. Whereas the ability to
*  travel forward or forward in time is absolutely impossible. There's nothing you can do in this
*  branch of the multiverse to connect with any other branches. Likewise, when you travel backward or
*  forward in time, well, backward and forward aren't created equal here. We travel forward in time all
*  the time. I traveled forward in time yesterday by 24 hours, and here I am. You can even get there
*  faster by moving near the speed of light. Whereas as far as we know, you just can't travel backward
*  in time. We don't know that for 100% sure. Check out the podcast I did with Kip Thorne for more on
*  that. But it seems the smart way to bet is that you cannot travel backward in time. And for
*  dimensions greater than four, number one, we don't know if they exist, okay, but number two, I would,
*  so this is a tricky one because if they do exist, it's not against the laws of physics to imagine
*  using them somehow technologically. But it is almost against everything we know about how they
*  would work. The energies that would be required to manipulate them are just enormous, and then
*  they would relax back to their ordinary state. So even though it's not strictly speaking against
*  the laws of physics, I see no way for advanced civilization to make use of extra dimensions
*  in any practical way. Okay, two questions I'm going to group together. One is by Justin Bailey,
*  who says, after listening to the podcast on Wu Wei with Edward Slingerland, I would really like
*  to know what the flow state is like for you. Are equations pouring out on the page, paragraphs just
*  appearing magically, and what does the flow for a cosmologist quantum theorist like yourself feel
*  like? And then Daniel Fox says, do you find concepts such as Wu Wei affect your approaches
*  to creative thinking about theoretical physics? So very, very closely related questions.
*  I'm not an expert on what really counts as that, but I think, you know, many of us have had the
*  experience that we've been in the zone in that flow state, and certainly that happens with
*  theoretical physics. And actually, it's a really good question to ask what that means, right? If
*  you're painting or if you're playing a musical instrument or if you're playing sports or something
*  like that, or even if you're driving, it's very clear what you mean to say that you're in this
*  flow state. You're sort of not consciously fretting about the details. You know, it's just happening
*  automatically. And we know, as modern scientists, that there are things going on in your brain,
*  but those things are just not penetrating to the conscious cognitive system two part of your brain.
*  They're all subconscious system one things going on. When it comes to physics, how do you even
*  do physics subconsciously? That sounds like a very difficult thing to do. So no, equations do not
*  pour out onto the page. That's just not how it works. Really, I wish it worked like that. But there
*  are the equations are like the quintessential paradigmatic example of needing your system to
*  needing your conscious cognition to kick in. But you can have states where it's sort of like,
*  you know, when you're puzzling over something and you go to sleep, and then you wake up with the
*  answer. There's the waking version of that. You can be so absorbed in a problem and sort of
*  thinking about it in such a pre cognitive way that you make progress. And it's sort of quasi
*  visualizing quasi feeling quasi just letting everything go. The difference is that unlike
*  playing a musical instrument, at the end of that process, you better have an equation or at least
*  an idea that leads to an equation, right? I mean, that's that's the difference. Something like
*  theoretical physics is at its best, a give and take a dynamic back and forth between the sort
*  of subconscious flow state and writing equations. Because once you write the equation, they say,
*  I need to integrate this expression. There's no being in the zone for doing an integral,
*  you got to follow the steps. That's that's all I can say. Okay, Mark Smith says, if the branch of
*  the wave function you're experiencing cannot interact with other branches, then what makes
*  the actual existence of the other branches more likely than their non existence? Well,
*  again, I've said this before, I'll try to say it again in as compact and understandable way as
*  possible. The other the existence of other branches is predicted by the Schrodinger equation.
*  And the Schrodinger equation works. That's the short answer. The real question, the sort of
*  question you should be asking is, why in the world and how in the world would you get rid of the other
*  branches of the wave function? I mean, it's perfectly clear and unambiguous and uncontroversial
*  that they are predicted by the Schrodinger equation, right?
*  When we observe things in quantum mechanics, the measurement outcomes are not naively what you
*  would predict by the Schrodinger equation, because the wave function appears to collapse.
*  And Everett has a very clear story about decoherence and how that works. But Everett also
*  implies that by taking the Schrodinger equation seriously at all times, the other branches are
*  there because that's what the Schrodinger equation says. So if you don't want to believe in them,
*  the burden is on you to tell me why they're not there, to how you're going to change or
*  add to or subtract from the Schrodinger equation to get rid of them. And that's exactly what people
*  do. You know, spontaneous collapse models literally subtract branches from the predictions of the
*  Schrodinger equation. Hidden variable models literally add pointers that say this is the real
*  branch. This is the one that actually exists. Okay. Whereas Everett just says there's just what the
*  Schrodinger equation says. That's all we accept. Simon Carter says, what's the latest regarding
*  your book writing? If memory... Sorry, I'm hesitating because my British publisher,
*  I thought it was named Simon Carter for a second, but it's actually Sam Carter. So this is not
*  secretly my publisher nudging me about my book writing. So sorry to confuse you about that, Simon.
*  What's the latest regarding your book writing? If memory serves, you have put back the book on
*  complexity and currently writing a Big Ideas book based on your YouTube videos and a Quantum
*  Mechanics textbook. So yes, as I said, I think in the previous AMA, I shouldn't really say what
*  books I'm working on ahead of time. It's bad karma or something like that, but it's too late now.
*  The cat's out of the bag. So short answer is yes. Right now I'm splitting my book writing time
*  between the Biggest Ideas in the Universe, which will be a three book collection, Volume One
*  Classical, Volume Two Quantum, Volume Three Complex, and the Quantum Mechanics textbook. So those
*  are my priorities right now. I have many other books that will be written. Don't you worry,
*  but I got to worry about a finite number of them at a time. Okay. Grouping two questions together.
*  One is from Ezra Parzybok, who says, do you think China, assuming they continue to rise in economic
*  and scientific standing, will eventually build the next level particle collider? And one from
*  Carlos Nunez, who says, what is your opinion on the rise of China? Should the US use adversarial
*  policies to try to impede them from achieving top superpower status? So the first question,
*  I think the short answer is, yeah, I think it's quite likely that China will build the next level
*  particle collider. I mean, they seem to want to do it. They have the money to do it. Why not? I mean,
*  that's the nice thing about being an authoritarian dictatorship is if the dictator decides to do
*  something, they can get things done. It's not necessarily good for everyone else in the country,
*  but you can certainly get things done and you have the resources to do it. As to whether the US should
*  try to impede them using adversarial policies, I don't think that's really the right angle to take
*  on asking the question, okay? Because it makes it sound like the bad thing is some other country
*  being the top superpower. I don't think it's anything intrinsically bad about some other
*  country than the United States being the top superpower. After all, if I lived in Iceland,
*  I might complain about things the United States did, but I wouldn't feel that the United States
*  was a threat to my status as a functioning democracy being in Iceland or being in Canada
*  or being wherever, right? Not every country needs to aspire to being the top superpower,
*  and it's perfectly okay to not be the top superpower. The problem with China is not that
*  it's potentially the top superpower. It's that it's an authoritarian dictatorship. It is a model of
*  governance that is not nearly as good for the people living in it as democratic republicanism
*  is. That's what I worry about. I worry not that China is going to be more economically powerful,
*  but that they will spread a political system to other countries that eventually results in
*  a worse off life and set of rights for other people as we're seeing in Hong Kong and elsewhere
*  right now. What should the United States do about it? I have no idea. That's the tricky thing.
*  Like, so given the reason why I'm sort of not exactly answering your question is,
*  if the concern of the United States were just, we don't want anyone else to be the biggest economic
*  superpower, then I can imagine certain adversarial policies to make that happen. But that's not what
*  I care about. I care about the spread of democracy throughout the world, and how to stop China
*  from spreading totalitarianism throughout the world is a much trickier thing in my mind
*  than just keeping up with them economically. So, you know, the single best thing that the United
*  States can do is not be an adversary to China, but to be a preferable role model, right? To be an
*  example of a functioning democracy that other countries look up to. Sadly, we've been bad at
*  that in recent years. So I would say forget about China, just get our own house in order. Be like
*  that person we talked about earlier who is in a bad relationship and wondering how much work they
*  should do to keep it going. Just worry about yourself first. Okay, Matt Hickman says,
*  how does time reversal symmetry work for classical black holes, specifically a situation where a test
*  particle just crosses the event horizon? So there's a short answer here because the classical black
*  hole is itself not time reversal invariant. Okay, a classical black hole is much like a melting ice
*  cube in a glass of water. The underlying laws of physics are time reversal invariant, but the black
*  hole, the creation of the black hole increases entropy, just like the ice cube melting. There is,
*  so sorry, so to complete that thought, there's no surprise then that the behavior of test particles
*  in the vicinity of a black hole is not time symmetric. You can cross into the event horizon,
*  but not cross out of it. There is, just as there is for the ice cube, a solution to the equations
*  of motion that is the time reverse. For the case of the ice cube, it would be a cool glass of water
*  evolving into an ice cube in a warm glass of water. Unlikely, but it obeys the equations at
*  the fundamental level. For a black hole, that would be a white hole. A white hole is just a black hole
*  time reversed, and there for a white hole, test particles can cross out of the event horizon,
*  but not go back in. So the whole set of possibilities is completely symmetric. There are black holes where
*  you can go in, but not out. There are white holes where you can go out, but not in.
*  Matt Haberland says, in the past, your guests' audio quality has been consistently terrific,
*  but recently there have been a few episodes in which the guests' audio quality is not as good.
*  Did something procedural change? So I recognize that that's true, and no, nothing procedural has
*  changed. It is a random fluctuation. It turns out that audio quality is a tricky multi-variable
*  thing, and many things can go slightly wrong. I think you're right that there have been a few
*  episodes recently where the quality was not as good. Trust me, I care a lot about getting the
*  audio quality good, and I'm going to keep trying to make it as good as possible, but many things
*  can get in the way. I do send my guests a microphone. Sometimes they don't want a microphone.
*  Sometimes they have a microphone they think is just as good. That's fine. But what has happened,
*  just coincidentally, again, no systemic reason recently, is that people have had good microphones,
*  but they've been in really echoey environments. As I say that, sitting in this apartment in Boston,
*  I worry that I'm in a very echoey environment. So I hope this isn't very bad, but I think I can
*  control it a little bit. But literally, I had a guest who was in the process of moving out of
*  their office. I'm not going to say who. There were no books or anything in the office. It was
*  just an empty room, and we had literally tested the audio quality ahead of time,
*  but in a different room. They moved to an empty room before recording the podcast a week later,
*  and then there was an echo. What can I do? All I can say is I am learning more and more things
*  that can go wrong with the audio quality, and hopefully this leads me to be better and better
*  at preventing those things from going wrong. Liam Appleba says, in the episode with Brian
*  Arthur about complexity economics, you asked if he was worried that his computational approach
*  would be missing the deeper understanding you can get from an equation-based approach.
*  What is it about equation-based approaches that gives a deeper understanding? If you mean intuitive
*  level of understanding, surely you can get that from watching a simulation. So this is a good
*  question. What I mean is just that an equation in principle, in practice that can be hard,
*  but in principle, an equation captures every possible simulation. Simulations are done one
*  by one, right? You do, okay, you simulate this configuration and that one, and you can try to
*  span the space of all possibilities, and you realize, ah, when I change this, this changes,
*  okay? But an equation, again, in principle, contains all the possible things that can happen.
*  It's a rule, right? So if I say that gravity is an inverse square law, I instantly know not only how
*  planets move around the sun, but also how apples fall from trees. Whereas if I just do a bunch of
*  simulations and see planets moving in ellipses, I say, oh, look, planets move in ellipses. Doesn't
*  tell me about apples falling from trees. The equation instantly spreads to all these different
*  situations. That's why I think that it can, in principle, once again, give you a more intuitive
*  level of understanding. Niles Darg asks a priority question. I love your thoughts on my interpretation.
*  The speed of light is the maximum processing power of the universe. Time moves forward constantly at
*  the speed of light, bringing everything with it, but when an object approaches sea, the universe
*  struggles to facilitate its travel through time, causing dilation. Similarly, time dilation is
*  experienced near a black hole because there is so much information being processed in such a condensed
*  space. So I'm going to do something very dangerous here, Niles, and I'm going to try to give you my
*  best answer. The reason why this is dangerous is because, you know, it's always very possible
*  that 50 years from now we have a much deeper understanding of these things, and my answer
*  turns out to be completely wrong. But my answer is, I don't like your interpretation. Sorry about
*  that. For a couple reasons. One is, you start by saying time moves forward constantly at sea,
*  but it doesn't. What does that mean? Time does not move at the speed of light. The speed of light is
*  the speed at which light moves. Moving, in this sense, is traversing a certain amount of distance
*  per unit time. That's why we measure the speed of light in something like meters per second.
*  Time does not traverse distance, much less traversing distance in any particular amount of time.
*  Time traverses time, so you can say how much time passes per unit time. The answer is always one
*  second per second. I said this before, I literally wrote that in my draft for the Biggest Ideas book
*  just the other day. That's the rate at which time flows. One second per second. Always. There's
*  literally no other rate at which it possibly could flow at. So you say then, when an object
*  approaches the speed of light, the universe struggles to facilitate its travel through time.
*  Well, and this is why I hesitate, what I said about time is just true, but this is a little
*  bit trickier because according to the theory of relativity, what you just said can't be right.
*  Because you're saying that the universe struggles to facilitate its travel through time when an
*  object approaches the speed of light, but in relativity there's no such thing as approaching
*  the speed of light, as an absolute sense. There is the relative velocity of two different objects
*  approaching the speed of light, but I can always switch to the rest frame of any object I want.
*  So if one object is approaching the speed of light, I can just go to its rest frame and it's
*  stationary in its rest frame. So the idea that the universe struggles to operate one way for one
*  particle moving in one trajectory and a different rate for another particle moving on another one
*  is incompatible with the spirit of relativity that says all such trajectories are created equal.
*  Okay, now you know maybe relativity will be superseded one day and things will be different,
*  but that's what I would say is probably true right now. Cooper says,
*  is there a sense in which entanglement can travel at different speeds through the environment?
*  For example, inside Schrodinger's cat's box, the photons and gaseous matter quickly entangle,
*  but then entanglement slowly propagates outward due to the solid less interactive matter making
*  up the walls. Is it true that you could cool a material down close to absolute zero to act
*  as an entanglement shield? Really should have put this back up there in the entanglement question,
*  but I think I've already answered it. Yes, there is a sense in which entanglement travels
*  at different speeds through the environment. I guess the reason why I isolated the question is
*  because for those of you who are interested, there is a mathematical result called the Lieb-Robinson
*  bound, Elliott Lieb, L-I-E-B, Robinson, don't know their first name. They made a bound on the rate at
*  which entanglement travels through a quantum system and you can look that up, but it depends
*  on the details. It depends on the materials that you're constructed of, the Hamiltonian or the
*  interactions or whatever it is, but yes, and then you can take advantage of this different rate of
*  entanglement spreading to shield things from becoming entanglement and that's what you need
*  to do if you build a quantum computer. Arthur C. Quark, probably not their real name, says,
*  could you elaborate on the difference between causality and determinism and what role entropy
*  plays? Causality says that it implies, so I'm not quite sure what the language is saying here,
*  causality, arrow, implies that A causes B but B does not cause A. Determinism, arrow, if you know
*  the state of system at any time and the laws of that system, you can calculate the state of that
*  system at any other time, future or past. For example, Arthur continues, if I were to watch
*  the movie of a perfectly elastic frictionless billiard table without holes, I wouldn't tell
*  if the movie were being played forward or backwards. Therefore, I can't say with certainty
*  what caused what to happen. However, I could calculate what the table looked like in every
*  frame of the movie if I really wanted to. If that's right, is it still true for something
*  more complex like scrambling eggs or stirring cream into coffee? So this is a complicated
*  question. This is literally something I'm trying to write papers about right now and the reason
*  it's complicated is because it's a question of emergence. Once again, determinism in our current
*  way of understanding the universe, so this is not a statement about every possible universe but the
*  real world, determinism is something that seems to be found at the micro level, right? Billiard
*  balls, something like that, small numbers of moving pieces. At the emergent level, at higher
*  levels, we're throwing away information, okay? That's what emergence is all about. There's
*  many different microstates that look the same as far as macrostates are concerned and therefore,
*  it is often the case that the immersion theory is not deterministic and there is an arrow of time,
*  okay? So what I would say is there's no reason to ever use words like causality at the micro level.
*  Causality, at least in the classical sense that Aristotle would have understood formal causes,
*  etc., is a strictly macroscopic phenomenon and it is a time-directed phenomenon. The causes never
*  come after the effects, whereas in micro physics, which Aristotle didn't know about at the time,
*  we have reversibility, determinism, Laplace's demon and so forth, so nothing is time-directed
*  at the deterministic reversible micro physical level. Therefore, you shouldn't talk about
*  causality. The interesting thing is to ask why when you do coarse grain and go from the micro
*  level to the macro level, you have something called causality that does play an important role and is
*  a useful concept and that's tricky. I don't have a complete story to tell about it, but it will
*  ultimately involve coarse graining and entropy and all sorts of interesting things that involve both
*  philosophy and physics and computer science and stuff like that. Joshua Hillerup says,
*  I know you aren't an expert in this, but from my understanding you do talk to all sorts of experts.
*  So I'm wondering, is there actually a way out of this pandemic? Given things like the delta
*  variant reinfecting people over and over again and new strains developing all the time, are we ever
*  going to be able to live in a society that can open up again without sending massive numbers of
*  people to the hospital or dying? Yeah, so I'm not an expert, so no one should take my opinion about
*  this seriously. You should listen to the experts, but I'm a human being and I do think about these
*  things. These are important questions, right? I think that the most obvious long-term
*  situation to be in, and it's far from completely obvious, but the first thing you would guess is
*  that the coronavirus, the novel coronavirus that as we used to call it, SARS-CoV-19, is
*  going to be like the flu, but worse. So the flu is a set of viruses, a wide variety of different
*  kinds of viruses that mutate, and so there's different kinds of flu every year and thousands
*  of people die every year, and there are shots you can get and some people get them and some people
*  don't, and the number of people who die every year is sort of just small enough that we don't
*  really go crazy about it. The number of people dying from COVID is much larger than that,
*  and I don't think we would put up with it if half a million people died in the United States every
*  year going forward as a rule. That would be bad, and we would sort of not put up with it in the
*  way that we put up with the flu, but you can imagine a sort of quasi-equilibrium where we fight it,
*  but not very effectively. So many people get vaccinated, but not everyone does.
*  New variants keep appearing and we get booster shots to fight them, but not everyone gets them,
*  etc., and every year 100,000 people die in the United States of COVID or COVID variants.
*  That's a possible future. It's not a good one. I don't love it, but it's possible, and in that
*  future some people will continue to wear masks, socially distance, other people will not. It'll
*  be almost what we have now, but a little bit better. That's what a very logical thing could be.
*  We could get our act together, get everyone vaccinated, and everyone in the world,
*  it's not enough because the countries are completely permeable membranes, so getting
*  one country vaccinated is not enough. If you get the world vaccinated, you can imagine stamping it
*  out. We have stamped out other diseases, smallpox and things like that, by getting really good
*  vaccines. If there aren't enough new people to be infected, the virus will die out. I just don't,
*  right now, as I'm saying this, I'm not at all sure that we have the willpower to do that,
*  and a lot of people just don't want to get vaccinated at all. So I'm not sure that that's
*  the happy scenario is going to come true. There's also much worse scenarios, right?
*  I mean, like you say, there are other variants. In some sense, we were really, really lucky,
*  believe it or not, with the coronavirus that it wasn't much more deadly. The tricky thing
*  about the coronavirus was that it has a long incubation period, relatively speaking. You can
*  have it and be contagious, but not be symptomatic, which is half of the ingredients for a truly
*  world-threatening viral plague. The other half is everyone who gets it dies. If that were true,
*  the worst possible virus would be one where everyone gets it, so it's super-duper
*  transmissible. It's very, very contagious. When you get it, you get no symptoms for a month,
*  or for six months. Then, six months after you get it, you die with 100% probability.
*  That kind of virus, if it were to exist, would wipe out humanity on Earth. It's probably not
*  going to be that bad. Don't get too frightened by it. It's unlikely that some variant of the
*  coronavirus is going to be 100% fatal. We're pretty good at developing vaccines now, so we can
*  protect against it. Some version of that is possible. If the median is like the flu, but worse,
*  the high-level hopeful future is we stamp it out, then the terrible apocalyptic future is
*  it just... There's a variant of it which is much, much more deadly and kills millions and millions
*  of people. I think all of these are on the table, and the longer we go without wiping it out,
*  the more chance there is to develop into a much more virulent, deadly variant.
*  I will say again, I am not an expert in this, so let that be provocation for your own thoughts,
*  but listen to the real experts if you actually want to know what's going to happen. I just haven't
*  talked to one recently about this exact question, so I'm just spitballing, not giving you expert
*  knowledge here. Eugene Ilovsky says, were you a math prodigy who turned to physics or a physics
*  prodigy who could do the necessary math? I will demure on the question of whether I was a prodigy
*  at all, but I did fall in love with physics very early, and it was physics that I fell in love with.
*  Not every decision you make when you're 10 years old turns out to be the right one, but for me,
*  that was the right one. I've learned a lot of math subsequently, but math is not my passion. If it
*  doesn't help me understand the world, I get kind of tired of it pretty quickly. You can follow
*  Steven Strogatz, former Mindscape guest, on Twitter, and he's great. He's just a great Twitter
*  follow, very good at explaining things and very entertaining and so forth, but man, he loves these
*  little math puzzles, and I just look at him like, I don't care. It just doesn't do it for me. What
*  am I helping to understand by thinking about this? I can't think of anything, and it's good
*  that we're different in that way. It's good that there are both physicists and mathematicians, but
*  for me, physics, easy call. Charlie H. says, I really admire the way you have great discussions
*  with experts from all fields on Mindscape. What, if anything, have you found to be a key or
*  significant difference between the Mindscape of sciencey guests from that of humanisticy guests?
*  That's a good question, and to be honest, I have never thought about it. I've never really
*  looked for commonalities between those two groups, so there might be ones that I haven't thought of,
*  so I'm not going to give you a very comprehensive, reliable answer here. In fact, as you might have
*  noticed, I have noticed, I'm constantly in the situation of interviewing someone who is not a
*  physicist and them telling me, oh yeah, I was a physics major as an undergraduate or something
*  like that. Even the humanistic people who I interview sometimes have secret physics sympathies,
*  so there's a huge selection effect in who I am picking, but also there's a selection effect in
*  which scientists I'm picking because I tend to pick scientists who have broader interests,
*  interdisciplinary interests, etc. I don't see a huge difference between them, but I'm picking
*  humanists who tend to be science-friendly and also scientists who tend to be humanities-friendly,
*  so maybe it's not such a big surprise there. Obviously, there's trivial differences. Scientists
*  are more likely to try to want to write down equations or do experiments than humanists are,
*  but I think that the general mindset is more or less similar. Christopher said,
*  you once said on Joe Rogan's podcast that you think cities are good for the planet. Could you
*  expand on that at all? Yeah, but mostly I would point you to an earlier podcast I did with Joe
*  Walston on urbanization and the environment, and he's the one who convinced me of this. I've heard
*  rumbles about it before, but Joe Walston is a conservationist by trade, so he's literally
*  invested in conserving the environment, and he gives the world's best sales pitch for cities
*  because, look, given a certain number of people and a certain amount of economic activity,
*  there's roughly speaking two extremes. One is you spread those people and that activity
*  uniformly across the land, and you sort of despoil all of the land because there's people everywhere,
*  or you concentrate those people and that activity in a small number of locations,
*  and you leave the rest of the land for the planet and the environment and the ecology.
*  Guess which one is better? And those concentrations of people and activity are called cities. That's
*  what they are. At a very basic level, you need fewer natural resources to live in a city than
*  you do in the country. You don't drive as far. Look where I am right now in this apartment building
*  in Boston, right downtown. There are other apartment units on most sides of my building,
*  so guess what? If I heat it or cool it, I'm not then ejecting that heat differential right into
*  the environment. I'm sharing it with other human beings right next to me, so it costs less.
*  It's much better for the environment in terms of resources, etc., if human beings limit the
*  fraction of the Earth's surface that they take over, roughly speaking. That's the point.
*  Anonymous says, what would happen if you put one end of an arbitrarily strong and arbitrarily
*  long cord into one black hole and the other end into another black hole? Would the black holes
*  be pulled together? So a couple quick thoughts here. One is, especially in relativity, but even
*  more generally in physics, as soon as you say words like or phrases like arbitrarily strong
*  and arbitrarily long, you're going to get into trouble. Arbitrarily long, okay, but arbitrarily
*  strong cords are not really physical, right? Roughly speaking, and again there's details here that I'm
*  not going to get into, but roughly speaking, the stronger or more rigid a rod or a cord is, the
*  faster sound travels down it. And you don't want your sound speed in your cord to be faster than
*  the speed of light. You want it when you tug at one end, nothing happens to the other end,
*  until the speed of light has passed, or until a signal moving at the speed of light could get
*  there. So it's a little bit unphysical to imagine these things, but I get what you mean. The reason
*  why it's a hard question to answer is that if you have the black holes and there's nothing else in
*  the universe, then even without the cord, they're going to be pulled together. They have gravity,
*  right? The gravity will pull them together. So I believe, I'm not 100% certain about this,
*  but I believe adding the cord in there will pull them together a little bit faster,
*  because roughly speaking, they're pulling on the cord as well as the other black hole,
*  but it's not a qualitative difference in the behavior. Okay, I'm going to group two questions
*  together. Brent Meeker says, in Mindscape 63 on finding gravity within quantum mechanics,
*  you speculated that there are only finitely many degrees of freedom in a given volume of space.
*  Wouldn't this imply that there are also only finite many possible states, and so there will
*  be a smallest non-zero probability of any possible event? Andrew Kay says, due to Bekenstein's bound,
*  in a finite volume of space, there can only be a finite number of bits of information. However,
*  in quantum mechanics, real numbers are used all over the place. Is it worthwhile to try to replace
*  these real numbers with rational numbers in order to only require a finite number of bits to represent
*  them? So both of these questions are getting at the following idea that the entropy of a black
*  hole, let's put it this way, there's different ways of stating the same answer, but the entropy
*  of a black hole, as Bekenstein and Hawking taught us, is a finite number, whereas the entanglement
*  entropy of a region of space in quantum field theory, remember we talked about entanglement
*  entropy, and if I just take a region of space and think of the quantum fields inside that region,
*  they are automatically entangled with quantum fields outside that region.
*  That entropy, they have an entropy, the quantum fields inside a region have an entropy because
*  of entanglement, and if you naively calculated it, you get infinity, and that's because there's an
*  infinite number of ways to arrange what's happening in a region of space, because quantum field theory
*  has an infinite number of degrees of freedom. So the fact that black holes have a finite entropy,
*  and yet we think that black holes are maximum entropy for a given volume, I said before that
*  black holes are not maximum entropy, but they are maximum entropy fixed volume, okay, and if you
*  don't fix the volume then you can always expand the entropy by expanding the volume of space,
*  but for a fixed volume, black holes are the highest entropy you can get, and it's not infinite,
*  that seems to indicate that quantum field theory is wrong, and that there is some finite dimensional
*  quantum mechanical system that describes what goes on inside the black hole. That's not 100%
*  accurate because it's a sloppy kind of reasoning, but it's very plausible, and I suspect it's right,
*  I suspect it's on the right track. But let me distinguish between two things, I think both
*  questions are mixing up two different possibilities. There's the number of degrees of freedom in the
*  sense of the number of dimensions of Hilbert space, the number of specific different directions in
*  which your quantum state can point, okay, if I have a single spinning particle, a single electron,
*  its spin is described by two-dimensional Hilbert space, spin up or spin down. The cat in Schrodinger's
*  cat also two-dimensional Hilbert space, awake or asleep, obviously there's many more degrees of
*  freedom in the cat, but we're ignoring them, okay. If I have two particles that are spinning, I have
*  four degrees, four dimensions of Hilbert space, two times two is four, if I have n particles it's two
*  to the n dimensions. But, so that's a finite dimensional Hilbert space, if that system of a
*  finite number of spins were entangled it would have a finite entropy, okay, not an infinite entropy,
*  but that's very different than the fact that each individual spin has a wave function that is a
*  superposition of spin up and spin down, and the amplitudes of that superposition are continuous,
*  they are not discrete, okay, that's not the idea that there's only a discrete set of probabilities
*  that you could have for spin up or spin down is not part of quantum mechanics, not part of anyone's
*  version of quantum mechanics, you could try to invent one, people have tried, but whatever you're
*  doing is you're not doing what quantum mechanics says. So the finitude of either entanglement
*  entropy in general or of the black hole entropy is the number of degrees of freedom, but it's not
*  a discreteness of the wave function, it's just the wave function is a function of a finite number
*  of variables instead of an infinite number of variables, but the values that it can take on
*  each one of those variables are still continuous, not discrete. I hope that's clear, it's a little
*  bit more technical than I usually get here, but given the questions that were being asked I hope
*  that you can understand. Okay, Jim Murphy asks a priority question, I'm basically wondering whether
*  the order of moments in time is necessarily fundamental, could all moments of time exist
*  independently without reference to moments before and after? I imagine the universe existing as a
*  mathematical set of possible states and time emerges from the fact that some states contain
*  references to other states, for example my brain right now contains memories of a brain a few
*  seconds ago, this seems similar to your explanation for our perception of the flow of time, but your
*  explanation still assumes a block universe rather than a collection of unconnected moments. So
*  honestly I'm just not sure what it would mean for the order of moments in time to not be fundamental,
*  especially if there are an infinite number of them, a smooth continuum of them, which I think
*  there probably are, but we don't know for sure, so I'm going to leave that aside. Let me say things
*  I think are true and hopefully they will address your concerns rather than trying to guess what
*  your concern is. We live in a universe that has two features that have to do with time, one is
*  continuity, so what we mean by that is there are equations that tell us whether it's Newton or
*  Maxwell or Einstein or whatever, but given what the universe is doing at one moment of time,
*  the way the laws of physics work is that they tell you what will happen at exactly the next moment,
*  they're differential equations in time in particular, so they describe a smooth evolution
*  of the state of the universe from one moment to another. So in that sense you could rearrange
*  or ignore the ordering of the moments, but that would be dumb, that would be very bad strategically
*  because then it's hard to say what the laws of physics are even telling you,
*  the laws of physics as we know them relate moments of time in a very specific order,
*  that's one fact. The other fact is like you say the arrow of time, and it's a little bit tricky,
*  the subtle relationship here, because of determinism and reversibility, if you're a Laplace's demon,
*  if you know the microstates, then the entire future and past are, let's say that you're
*  ever ready about quantum mechanics too, so there's no fundamental indeterminism in quantum mechanics,
*  the entire future and past are implicit in every moment to Laplace's demon. So in that sense,
*  Laplace's demon has perfect memories and perfect predictions. At the macroscopic level for we
*  emerge in non-Laplace's demons, we have memories of the past and not of the future, that's an
*  asymmetry that shows up. So when you say my brain right now contains memories of a brain a few
*  seconds ago, that's a time-directed statement, your brain right now does not contain memories
*  of a few seconds from now, and the reason why that asymmetry exists is because entropy is increasing.
*  Okay, so that is, I mean what I want to say about this is it's not fundamental, that fact that your
*  brain quote unquote contains memories of a brain of a few seconds ago is a statement at the emergent
*  approximate macroscopic level. At the microscopic level, your brain right now contains exact,
*  or at least some broad swath of the universe, maybe a few light minutes across, centered on
*  your brain, contains the information that determines both your brain a few seconds ago
*  and your brain a few seconds in the future, so there's no directionality there at the microscopic
*  level. So there's a temptation to think of something being contained in your brain that relates to the
*  past but not the present, but that's only because we only have access to the macroscopic level. If
*  we had micro information, we'd have equal information forward and backward. So what this
*  has to do with moments of time existing independently without moments before and after, you know again,
*  you're welcome to do that, but it seems to me to be a huge step backwards in convenience and
*  understandability. The world is intelligible because we can predict what will happen at the
*  next moment from what is happening right now. Mike Maloney says, you mentioned that the traditional
*  scientific, oh am I grouping two questions together? I am grouping two questions together.
*  Mike Maloney says, you mentioned that the traditional scientific method is not the way
*  professional scientists actually do science. As a science teacher, I was wondering if you could
*  think there is some other kind of method we could be teaching middle school and high school students
*  that would better prepare them for careers in science. And Rasmus Kees Neerbeck says,
*  in your opinion, what would be the most important thing to teach in schools regarding science in
*  general or physics in particular that are now missing from the general curriculum? I do know
*  that both teaching methods and curriculum is somewhat different in your country to mine,
*  but still interested in your opinion from a physics professor's view. So I think that Rasmus,
*  you're probably looking for some thing like quantum mechanics or relativity or entropy or
*  some physics concept. I do generally think that we are too reluctant to teach fun, modern, cool
*  physics in high school and middle school. I think that we will teach Newton's laws, maybe a little
*  bit of electricity and magnetism or something like that, but we're not going to teach general
*  relativity. The equations are too scary. I don't see any reason why we shouldn't do at least a
*  descriptive non-equation based explanation of these modern physics ideas even in high school.
*  But my real answer to your question is also the answer to the previous question, because what I
*  would really want to teach kids in high school and middle school is the scientific, is not the
*  scientific method, but the real method by which science is done, not what we typically label the
*  scientific method. For those of you who don't know, what is often labeled the scientific method in
*  high school science courses is this fairly formalized procedure that goes back to Francis Bacon
*  and his friends of doing science whereby you propose a hypothesis, devise a test for your
*  hypothesis, collect the data, determine whether your hypothesis passed the test, etc.
*  It's vaguely related to what scientists actually do, but any real scientist knows that real science
*  is way messier than that. And so I think the two things that I would like to get across
*  to high school students about the real way science is done is number one, that there is a procedure
*  that is highly fallibilistic. It's not an algorithm forgetting the truth. It's absolutely, I mean,
*  science is basically a highly formalized version of trial and error. It's imagine many different
*  possibilities, the hypotheses, and assign to them in a good Bayesian way, you don't need to necessarily
*  use this language in high school students, but you could, assign prior credences to them.
*  Simpler theories would get higher credences, more complicated ones would get lower credences,
*  but they would all get non-zero credence. Then you collect data and they change your credences,
*  but you could always be wrong. I mean, both your assignment of credences could be wrong,
*  your calculation of likelihoods can be wrong, and most importantly, your data could be wrong. Like,
*  have you ever done a laboratory experiment in high school and gotten the wrong answer?
*  I have. I think most people probably have. That's an important part of doing
*  science. It's not a collection of facts. It is a process, and it's a process that is highly
*  fallibilistic. The other aspect I would want to emphasize is that it's not even an orderly
*  process. The scientific method we're taught, the Baconian scientific method, seems to say you need
*  to first write down your hypothesis, etc. No one really does that. It's a constant back and forth
*  between observations, experiments, and ideas. You're constantly spiraling or dialoguing,
*  let's put it that way, between the real world and your thoughts about the real world.
*  And that's okay. It's not against the rules or anything like that. I would like to explain that
*  to high school students if I could. Mystery Horse says, given all of your success, I'm curious if
*  you've abandoned ideas, papers, books, or other projects that you had invested a significant
*  amount of energy into. If so, could you tell us about a particular failed idea that contributed
*  to a successful future one? Yeah, I mean, that happens all the time, actually. But then this is
*  not, I mean, I think that I'm slower than many scientists in the sense that I will often get an
*  idea and want to do it. And it'll take me a long time, years before I actually do something about
*  it. This happens all the time. This paper I wrote with Aidan Chatwin Davies on the relationship
*  between the second law of thermodynamics and the expansion of the universe. I had that idea years
*  before. I was convinced that the second law and the cosmic no-hair theorem had to be related in
*  some way. And it wasn't, I would occasionally tell my graduate students this, and they'd go,
*  yeah, maybe. And Aidan was the one who was actually able to come up with a way of proving
*  something, right? So it was never a failed idea, but it was a gestating one. My most highly cited
*  paper is on what is now called F of R gravity. So it's a modification of general relativity
*  that could possibly make the universe accelerate. I don't know if you want to call this a failure
*  or not, but I came up with that idea because I was hopeful that it would explain both dark matter
*  and dark energy, both rotation curves of galaxies and the acceleration of the universe. So it doesn't
*  do that. It doesn't work for rotation curves of galaxies. So I figured that out. Like I said,
*  oh yes, it could make the universe accelerate, but it will not explain rotation curves of galaxies.
*  So in my mind, it was a failure. And so I didn't write it because it didn't do what I wanted to do.
*  And it wasn't until my collaborators, Mark Troughton and others, independently came up with
*  the idea and said, is this interesting? I'm like, well, I guess if everyone else is coming up with
*  the same idea, maybe it is interesting. And we finally wrote the paper and it became a huge
*  success. There you go. Other papers I had are very much like that. There's millions of ideas
*  probably that I've had that have just failed and continue to fail. I have not grown into great
*  papers, but I tend to just not remember them very well. So I'm not going to tell you any.
*  Charlie Grover says, suppose one has a scalar field slowly rolling toward the minimum of its
*  potential. A concrete example of this would be a quintessence field. It's commonly said,
*  excitations of a quintessence field have a mass, maybe around 10 to the minus 33 electron volts.
*  What does it mean for excitations of the scalar field to have a specific mass
*  while it is rolling? Clearly, okay, it's a longer question, but so what's going on is the following.
*  Imagine you have a scalar field. So you're picturing in your head a potential, a hill,
*  right? A landscape. And the scalar field is a dot that is rolling down that potential.
*  And typically, most scalar fields, like the Higgs boson is a scalar field,
*  pions are scalar fields, axions would be scalar fields if they existed. We haven't found any yet,
*  but there you go. The mass of the scalar field is related to the curvature of the potential near
*  its minimum, okay? Because if you think about it, so you have a minimum of a potential. So there's
*  some value that the potential has, and then it has a first derivative, the slope, but the slope is
*  always exactly zero because you're at the minimum. We told you you're at the minimum, so the slope
*  of the potential is zero. The next interesting thing is the curvature, the second derivative
*  of the potential. And that is basically telling you how much energy it costs to nudge the scalar
*  field a little bit away from the minimum of its potential. And that energy cost shows up in
*  particle physics language as the mass of the particle that you're looking at. So the relationship
*  between the mass of a particle and the potential of the field that defines that particle is the
*  mass is given by the second derivative, or really the square root of the second derivative, of the
*  potential near its minimum. Now for a quintessence field, quintessence is a candidate for dark energy
*  that is a slowly rolling scalar field, and by slow we mean it takes longer than the current
*  age of the universe to roll down its potential. And what that means is, unlike the Higgs or the
*  Axion or the pion, this field is not sitting at the bottom of its potential. So it has a bottom
*  of the potential, it's just not there yet, hasn't gotten there yet, takes longer than the age of
*  the universe to get there. So you're completely correct, Charlie, when we say that we will often
*  talk about the mass of the quintessence field as if it were sitting there at the bottom of its
*  potential and calculating the second derivative. That's cheating, we shouldn't really do that.
*  When it's somewhere else on the potential, what you should do is expand, calculate the second
*  derivative there, wherever it is, okay, not at the minimum. And if it is at the minimum, then the
*  value of the second derivative somewhere else is just not an interesting quantity, but if it's
*  rolling slowly and hasn't gotten to the minimum yet, then the value of the second derivative where
*  it is acts as the mass. It acts as the mass in the equations of motion for the scalar field.
*  However, the reason why no one really makes a big deal about this is for a typical choice of
*  potential, for a choice of potential that you haven't finely tuned in some way, it will more
*  often than not be the case that the order of magnitude of the second derivative is the same
*  wherever the field is as it will be once it gets to the minimum. That it's obvious
*  counterexample to this, which is a field that just rolls off forever, okay, that doesn't even have a
*  minimum, but for a typical field that is just generically rolling, the magnitude of the second
*  derivative has a value that is comparable, same order of magnitude. So therefore, talking about
*  the mass is sort of a proxy, sort of a quick and dirty way of getting at how strongly the potential
*  is changing as the field value changes. That's all. So it's just sloppiness. That's the, I gave you a
*  long answer. The short answer is we're just being sloppy. Sorry about that. Okay, we're nearing the
*  end folks. We have two more questions left. James Nancarrow says, if there are many bubble universes
*  as an eternal inflation, and our universe is one of those, and the bubble universes are of various
*  random sizes and larger universes are less likely than smaller ones, does this provide a solution to
*  the Fermi paradox, why we don't see alien civilizations or their probes in our neighborhood?
*  I don't think so. No, I mean, I get the idea that, you know, you, if you have many, many different
*  bubble universes, the probability of getting even one civilization per universe can be very small,
*  and yet you're going to get a lot of civilizations because there's a lot of bubble universes, right?
*  So in that scenario, you would, as I think, James, you're getting at, you would predict that each
*  civilization is alone in its region of space. But the point is, you don't really need the
*  multiverse for that. So, I mean, I think that logic is completely good and might even be correct,
*  but you don't need the features of eternal inflation or bubble universes where, like,
*  the laws of physics are different or anything like that. You could just imagine that our universe is
*  really, really big, and the probability of life forming and intelligent civilizations forming is
*  very, very small. And then you explain the Fermi paradox, right? So you need that in your scenario,
*  I'm calling it your scenario, but you need other things in your scenario, all these bubble universes.
*  In my scenario, you just say the probability of life for intelligent civilizations is very small.
*  That's it. Now, we're here, right? So you might want to say, well, if the probability of life is
*  very small, maybe the probability of us being here is very small. But this is, again, a longer, more
*  nuanced discussion, but I think you should just conditionalize on us being here. We already know
*  we're here. This is what Bayesians call old evidence. We shouldn't count it again. There's
*  no theory we should be paying attention to that predicts we're not here, right? We've already
*  taken into account the fact that we're here whenever we do any of this reasoning about anything.
*  So our existence, I would argue, accounts for strictly nothing when we're talking about the
*  different probabilities of different theories of the universe. So as long as the probability of
*  life forming is small, then forgetting about us, the question we're asking is what is the probability
*  of life or technologically advanced life forming somewhere else? And the answer will be small if
*  the original number is sufficiently tiny. Okay, the last question, another bit of a curveball here,
*  Gabor Peter Ser says, looking at the failure in Afghanistan, what do you think would be an effective
*  way how Western democracies could help countries with strong influence of religious extremists?
*  If the goal is building a society where human rights are respected more with strengthening
*  secular education in favor of religious education, help. Yeah, so again, to people
*  a century from now listening to the old mindscape archives, we just had the American withdrawal
*  from Afghanistan, not quite two decades, but close to two decades after we invaded there
*  after the September 11th attacks. And, you know, tensions are running high right now. I don't want
*  to step on anyone's toes. On the one hand, you have a bunch of people who say, look, we get into
*  these wars to try to fix a whole country. And there's no end game, right? There's no surrender
*  or anything like that that we're looking for. The goal is nominally to transform a nation,
*  but that's really hard. So we end up just staying there and people keep dying and nothing really
*  good happens. There are other people and so therefore we should leave is their argument.
*  And the other people say, look, there are really bad things happening in the world,
*  human rights violations, dictatorships, atrocities of various forms, nurturing terrorists that can
*  attack other countries, etc. And we as the superpower have an obligation, this side says,
*  to go in there and stop that from happening. And as John McCain famously said, when he was
*  running for president, he would be willing to stay there for thousands of years if that's what it
*  took to tamp down the violence and the extremism in those countries. So there's one school of
*  thought that says we shouldn't go in at all. Another one says we should stay for thousands
*  of years. And we recently were there for 20 years and we left or 19 years or whatever it was.
*  And it's been kind of a mess to be very polite about it. Again, people disagree and tempers
*  run high, but it's been a mess. Let's just put it that way. The withdrawal has been a mess. And so
*  again, one side says, well, yeah, it was going to be a mess. There's nothing you could do. Like
*  you had your finger in the dike and you're saying, what's going to happen if I remove my finger? Well,
*  there's going to be a flood. There's just nothing else you can do about it. And the other side says,
*  there are ways to withdraw that would have been much better, that would have been not nearly as
*  messy. Okay, I'm not going to get into that one either. The question that Gabor is asking is,
*  if you imagine that we go there, if you imagine that we invade a country and, you know, okay,
*  we have the military capabilities of removing its government from power, putting another government
*  into power, stopping terrorist activity or at least fighting against it, et cetera, those things we
*  can do. But what about the fabric of the country? Like what about the fact that there are people in
*  this country? And I'm not even specializing to Afghanistan. I'm trying to be more general than
*  that. So the specifics of Afghanistan are again, not something I'm an expert in. None of this is
*  stuff I'm an expert in, but it's my AMA and I'm at the end of it. So I'm going to pontificate.
*  There are people in this country, this hypothetical country who support the bad guys,
*  right? I mean, otherwise they wouldn't have gotten into power in the first place.
*  So how do you not just overthrow the government, but change the fabric of the society and the
*  culture so that the set of people who support the bad guys is sufficiently small and powerless
*  that we don't need to be there to hold them down? That's the question that is being asked.
*  And the short answer is, I don't know, even at this sort of very loosey goosey end of the AMA
*  podcast episode, letting our hair down kind of mode, I just have such enormous respect for the
*  difficulty of this question that I think it would do a disservice to be too glib about it.
*  How do you change the fabric of a country? Just an hour ago, I said it's hard to change the fabric
*  of a single person you're in a relationship with. Changing the fabric of a country is really hard
*  to imagine doing. Having said that, I will say just one little tiny thing, which is that what
*  we tend to do historically is mostly military, right? That's where we focus our efforts. We,
*  being the United States in the last century of its history, we invade and we keep track of military
*  actions by the bad guys and we try to prevent them, et cetera, et cetera. We're much less good at
*  creating a stable functioning society in the non-military aspects of the country.
*  I'm not even sure that we try very hard. We try a little bit, but the idea of better schools,
*  better education, better healthcare, ideas that, by the way, would be also nice to have in our own
*  country, but these ideas are just not emphasized in these adventures very often. So on the one hand,
*  could we have more success in these adventures if we did more of that? Maybe. I honestly don't know,
*  but it wouldn't hurt to try. I think that there's enough historical evidence that we're not able to
*  change countries that don't want to be changed. What we can do, again, just like the question with
*  China earlier, the thing that we have in our power to do is to be a good example, to not just say,
*  be like us, to hector the other countries and say, you should be like us, but to make them want to
*  be like us by being awesome, by having great human rights, by being economically vibrant,
*  by protecting our own people, the poor people, the less well-off, and by giving them the way to do
*  that. If we had somehow, and I don't think it's possible, so I'm not casting aspersions here,
*  but if we could have converted Afghanistan into a prosperous functioning democracy,
*  we would not be in this mess. Now that's much more easily said than done, so again, I'm not saying
*  that we should have just done it, snapping our fingers, but it should be the goal. It should be
*  like the aspiration when we go into these, and if we can't, then we shouldn't linger there very long.
*  I do think the final thought here is that, again, truth in history, I was very much against the
*  invasion of Iraq when George W. Bush was president, but I was in favor of the invasion of Afghanistan
*  on the thought that the terrorists who were based in Afghanistan had just done a terrible terrorist
*  attack against us, and we should punish them somehow, but I would have been much, much more
*  in favor of something very quick in and out, rather than an attempt to go there and rebuild
*  the country. Go in and go out and, by all means, give them aid and give them resources to improve
*  their country and things like that. We should be doing those things anyway, even to other countries
*  that do not harbor terrorists that attack us, so certainly we should be doing it if we want to win
*  the hearts and minds of countries where we don't want them to support the bad guys. But, you know,
*  look, I'm an idealist at heart, an optimist at heart. I think that there are ways that society
*  can be much better, both other societies and our own. I don't think that religion is the fundamental
*  issue here, but it is an issue. It's part of the story, and if you want to say that my picture of
*  what we should do in these other countries is hopelessly naive and it will never work,
*  and you want to characterize your own point of view as more realistic and hard-nosed,
*  very well. You might very well be right. I'm not an expert on this. I'm just an aspirationalist who
*  thinks that we should... I'm becoming more of a deontologist, honestly, in my old age. I'm
*  thinking that rather than inventing consequentialist rules for making the world a better place,
*  we should worry about acting in the good ways ourselves and maybe the world will follow us.
*  There you go. Thanks for paying attention. Thanks for doing this AMA. See you next month,
*  and thanks very much for supporting the Mindscape Podcast. I don't say it enough,
*  but it is tremendously warming to my heart that as many people as do join Patreon and
*  throw in a few pennies here and there to support this little endeavor that we all do together.
*  Thanks. Bye-bye.
