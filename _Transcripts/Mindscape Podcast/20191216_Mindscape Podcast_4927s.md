In the United States, more than one in five deaths is caused by cancer. The medical community has put enormous resources into fighting this disease, yet its causes and best treatments continue to be a puzzle. Azra Raza has been on both sides of the patient’s bed, as she puts it — both as an oncologist and expert in the treatment of Myelodisplastic Syndrome (MDS), and as a wife who lost her husband to cancer. In her new book, The First Cell, she argues that we have placed too much emphasis on treating cancer once it has already developed, and not nearly enough on catching it as soon as possible. We talk about what cancer is and why it’s such a difficult disease to understand, as well as discussing how patients and their loved ones should face up to the challenges of dealing with cancer.

Azra Raza received her M.D. from Dow Medical College in Karachi, Pakistan. She is currently Chan Soon-Shiong Professor of Medicine and Director of the MDS Center at Columbia University in New York. Previously she was the Chief of Hematology-Oncology and the Gladys Smith Martin Professor of Oncology at the University of Massachusetts. Her Tissue Repository contains over 60,000 samples of samples from MDS and acute leukemia patients. She is the co-editor of the celebrated blog site 3 Quarks Daily.

# Mindscape 77 | Azra Raza on The Way We Should Fight Cancer
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 16, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SA5zuVqYHY)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and today
*  we're talking about a somewhat difficult subject which is cancer and how we can try to treat
*  and prevent cancer from taking lives. It's a difficult subject of course because I and
*  I'm sure many other people in the audience are familiar with people who have passed away
*  because of cancer. The two leading causes of any kind of death in the United States
*  are heart disease and cancer by a wide margin, these two things. And I think at least, you know,
*  informally, I don't have any data and I don't want to valorize one way of dying over another,
*  but my informal impression is that cancer is much crueler than heart disease in many ways. It can
*  come on people who are otherwise perfectly healthy. It can appear in people relatively young. I know
*  people in their 40s and 50s who have been diagnosed and the way that we have of treating it is not
*  very good. It involves a very painful process, a very drawn out long process that often fails,
*  that often even though we do everything we can, cancer still claims a victim. So today's guest
*  on Mindscape is Azra Raza who is the Chan Sun Siong Professor of Medicine at Columbia University.
*  She's an oncologist. She's been doing cancer research for a long time. She has a new book
*  out called The First Cell, The Human Costs of Pursuing Cancer to the Last. And as I said,
*  we all know people who have died of cancer. Azra's husband, who was also an oncologist,
*  was diagnosed with cancer and it eventually claimed his life. So no matter how much you know,
*  no matter how expert you are in the field, this can come to get you and there's really nothing
*  you can do about it. So Azra's angle is that we should shift a lot of our resources from fighting
*  cancer once it's already spread through the body to finding cancer as soon as it appears. That's
*  the name of the book, The First Cell, the first cell in the body that goes cancerous. Of course,
*  many people would agree, many doctors, many oncologists would agree that that would be great
*  if we could do it. But the argument is that we can do it. There are things that we know that would
*  improve the rates at which we find cancer very, very early, but we're just not putting in the
*  resources to doing that, that we could. And one of the wonderful things about Azra's book, and it'll
*  come out in the conversation, is that she's a very warm, human kind of doctor and there's a lot of
*  stories in the book about individual people and their struggles with cancer. And we talk a little
*  bit about the fact that I would be, you know, I would have a tough time being an oncologist,
*  talking with people who had cancer all the time, but Azra really appreciates it, thinks it's a
*  privilege that she gets to, you know, help people in this crucial moment in their lives, going one
*  way or another. So it's a very kind of uplifting conversation, despite the gloomy topic overall.
*  So this is the last Mindscape podcast, the last regular one anyway, of 2019. I take a two-week
*  break for the holidays. There may or may not be another holiday message like I did last time,
*  but one way or the other, I want to thank everyone who's been listening, Patreon supporters,
*  especially, but really anyone who is listening to Mindscape once or every single week. My thanks
*  goes out to you. It's sort of amazing to me that I can sit here and talk and I can send an email
*  to some brilliant, accomplished person somewhere in the world and say, can I talk to you for an
*  hour or two? And they will say yes, because I have this podcast. I hope you're enjoying it as much as
*  I am. And I know that I have some really good guests lined up for the schedule next year already.
*  So 2020 is going to be another great year for Mindscape. Enjoy your holidays and let's go.
*  Okay. Aswar Raza, thanks for coming on the Mindscape podcast.
*  Delighted to be here, Sean.
*  This is just so everyone out there in podcast land knows, we've never met before, but we have,
*  knowledge of each other over the internet for many years now. You're part of the collective that
*  makes Three Quarks Daily, the famous blog site. Is that right?
*  Yes. My younger brother Abbas Raza is the chief editor in chief of it.
*  And what kind of things do you contribute there?
*  For the last 15 years, I've been posting two stories daily, very occasionally one.
*  And one of them is a story related to some kind of scientific news that's just been released or a
*  scientific article. But the other is general interest because I have many other interests.
*  So it could be literature, philosophy, music, art, anything.
*  Well, that's what's great about the website. It really does bring things together in a way
*  that is reminiscent of the Mindscape podcast here. So that makes you a perfect guest.
*  And also what makes you a perfect guest is you have a book that just came out, is that right?
*  Yes.
*  Or is it coming out? Called The First Cell, and it's not about the origin of life. It's about cancer.
*  And you're an oncologist, and I thought I want to get into what cancer is, how we treat it,
*  and so forth. But I can't help but ask about the very moving personal story that you opened
*  the book with. Could you tell the audience about that?
*  Well, the book is titled The First Cell, but equally important is the subtitle of the book,
*  which is, And the Human Costs of Pursuing Cancer to the Last. So this is a book not about cancer,
*  it is about cancer patients. And the purpose of this book, Sean, is to bring back the patient
*  front and center into every discussion we have about cancer, no matter how deeply and rigorously
*  scientific it is. We have to ask the question at every point, where does the patient benefit
*  from this or is hurt by it? And so, as a result of having this goal in mind, I have told many
*  patient stories, as well as patients who are under treatment with me right now, their stories they
*  have told in their own words. But after I started to write it, I realized that it would be insincere
*  of me if I did not include my own. Because if I'm going into such granularity about people's
*  suffering and pain, it's not fair to shield myself. If you're asking other people to open up in this
*  way, then yes. That's exactly right. And so it has been 18 years now since my husband, Harvey
*  Preissler, died. I have never spoken about it to anyone or written about it.
*  But what made me come out and write it and then write in as much detail as possible,
*  because that's what I was demanding of my other patients and their families.
*  Now this personal story became like a red line running throughout the book, through every chapter,
*  and then there's a whole chapter devoted to Harvey. You asked me to tell you something about
*  this personal story I opened the book with. So this is the background of why I put it there.
*  And then, of course, Harvey was my mentor since I'm 24 years of age. We later got married.
*  He was the head of the cancer center. And in an ironic and cruel twist of fate, he got the very
*  disease he had dedicated his life to cure since he was 15 years old, cancer, leukemia. And he suffered
*  inexplicable indignities at the hands of this disease over a course of almost five years.
*  Our daughter was three years old when he was diagnosed and eight years old when he died.
*  And so in this sort of dizzying, disorienting period, what I experienced needed some distance
*  of time as well, even to verbalize some of those things. So in a way, the book is a combination of
*  my personal story, but that of the people I take care of and that of the disease I study.
*  So it's several books in one, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I also had a very good friend,
*  Michael, who was an oncologist and was diagnosed with cancer and eventually died of it. And
*  at nothing else, it reminds us that we really don't know so much about the disease. The people
*  who know the most are still helpless in the face of it. And there's something about cancer that
*  is especially cruel, how it happens apparently randomly. You can be relatively young and it takes
*  years and you can reach a point where there's not much you can do.
*  And the greatest cruelty is that it is a silent killer, that it can grow to an advanced stage
*  within your body and you have no inkling about it. In fact, there's a very interesting study
*  that was done some years ago, Sean, where people who have been long-term smokers try to quit many,
*  many times. And when they finally manage to quit and not go back, because they quit, go back,
*  quit, go back, finally when they manage to quit, an inordinately high number of them end up with
*  lung cancer. Really? So a study was done to show why and it turns the conclusion was that most likely
*  they could stop only because something internal finally warned them to. That was a selection
*  effect. So there is something but we tend to ignore it completely and because it's such a
*  subconscious level. So when you say that something very terrible about cancer, very unique about it,
*  is that it is a silent killer. And just so hopefully many people in the audience have not seen
*  cancer up close or had to deal with it. So let's back up, explain what cancer is. It's not a simple
*  thing to explain what it is, right? There's many varieties and many manifestations.
*  To begin with, the very simple thing is that every living cell which is normal has a limited
*  number of proliferations or divisions it can undergo. This is known as the Hayflick limit,
*  that after 40 to 45 cell divisions it will either undergo a process of committing suicide or be
*  killed by other things or it will dial down all its activities and enter a state of senescence and
*  be useful no longer. I mean by the way that's worth a podcast all by itself, that fact, right? Because
*  amoebas don't have that property, they can just keep dividing forever. So we complicated
*  multicellular organisms have built in a lifetime a suicide mechanism for our own cells. That just
*  fascinates me to no end but okay let's not get too distracted. And cancer cells overcome this
*  Hayflick limit and become immortalized that they don't die. So to me the definition of a cancer
*  is just that, that a cell which is now capable of infinite number of divisions. And what causes
*  cancer really, there are some very specific events that can give rise to it but most of the time
*  it's a random event and probably I would say at least 60 percent of all cancers happen because
*  of DNA copying errors as the cell is dividing. And is it correct to say that one thing we do
*  know about cancer is that it involves a change in the DNA, it's some sort of genetic mutation
*  one way or the other? Only partly correct because genetic change is one thing but
*  inside the cell itself but also control of those cellular function could come from an external
*  source. However ultimately it is the cell gone rogue by itself running amok. So in the end you
*  are right that there has to be a genetic component to every cancer cell. And is it just, is it merely
*  that it grows without bound or does the size and functionality of the shape of the cell also change?
*  Probably as a result of the cancerous changes everything goes haywire really. It serves no
*  useful function anymore and it does change size, shape, form.
*  When you have, I guess since I know so little about this, my ignorance is going to show,
*  when you have a tumor for a sort of cancer that is stationary in your body, does that grow because
*  the cells simply keep dividing or because the individual cells puff up or is it a mixture of both?
*  It's because cells are dividing and making a big mass around them. I think think of cancer as
*  something which tends to evolve like life itself. The same constraints and the same principles that
*  apply to evolution apply to initiation, expansion, growth of a cancer also. So one cancer cell, let's
*  say divides and becomes two. Each time a cell divides it has to copy its entire DNA which is
*  about three billion base pairs. So on the whole at each division a cell will retain three to four
*  new mutations. Now most of these mutations are passive which means they're not, they're harmless.
*  But some of these, if one of these happen to occur in a vital gene for example which is
*  controlling proliferation or which is responsible for growth control which are known as tumor
*  suppressor genes, if these mutations happen in one of those vital genes then the function of
*  the cell is affected. But then let's say now overcomes growth control because of this mutation,
*  that is mutation which will be termed as the driver or the founder mutation. So the first
*  cell will have the founder mutation but each time it divides into two shunt that's the problem.
*  It's going to pick up new passenger mutations that may not change its proliferative or doubling
*  ability but it can change its metabolism, its response to drugs, its ability to be more aggressive
*  and it's dividing so much more rapidly than normal cells that it starts making a mass
*  getting more and more blood supply to self becomes a hot area because it needs nutrition to
*  help itself. But the point is that this mass of cells now after like 30 doublings may have
*  nothing or very little in common except the founding mutation with the original cell.
*  So in other words it's a constantly metamorphosing, mutating, transforming, dividing,
*  selectively evolving sort of collection of cells. So what I say is that treating cancer
*  as one disease is like treating Africa as one country. It is and it's a moving target because
*  let's say I remove a tumor from my lung today to study its sensitivity to 50 drugs and find two
*  drugs which are very effective. By the time I found the two drugs it's six weeks later because
*  of all the tests I did. Cancer has moved on. The drugs would have worked six weeks ago
*  and this is one of the reasons that we have not been able to control advanced cancers until now.
*  The outcome for a patient with advanced disease is no different than it was in 1930s.
*  Is there is it if we put into an evolutionary context a biological context is there any reason
*  why cancer happens? Is there some purpose served for it biologically? I have this vague feeling that
*  elephants don't get cancer or something like that. There are different stories about
*  different species having different susceptibilities. Is there a grand theory of all this?
*  No. Short answer is no. It's called petos paradox because the idea would be that
*  if the number of mutations increase each time a cell divides then a larger organism should have
*  a higher chance of having cancer. Just by that alone. More cells. And it's exactly not true
*  and it's not the opposite either because for example mice and humans. Humans should have
*  more cancer. It's not true. Whales almost never get cancer for a different reason than elephants
*  don't. We think we know why elephants are not getting cancer because they have 20 copies of
*  a tumor suppressor gene called p53 and that those genes are redundant so that if one is mutated
*  another one takes its place and another one and so tumor suppressor gene p53 which is known as
*  the guardian of the genome because it's constantly surveying the genome for mutations and forcing the
*  cell which shows a mutation to commit suicide. If that gene gets mutated and it stops performing
*  its normal guardian function then the cell can become cancerous but if you have redundant copies
*  of that gene then the opposite would happen. That is you know this next copy would kick in even if
*  one is mutated. However when this was replicated in animal models to produce to over express this
*  gene or to have insert multiple copies of these genes the results were not so great because you
*  know what happened. The animals number one didn't get cancer but aged dramatically and died of aging.
*  Well I was going to ask because I've never heard of the tumor suppressor gene. Again I'm not an
*  expert in this area but it sounds like yeah we should just have lots of tumor suppressor genes
*  but it's not that simple either. It's not that simple and so it would be simplistic to think
*  that elephants who are large animals and should be getting lots of cancers don't get it is all
*  because they have 20 copies of p53. We'd like to think so but yeah. Let me pause for a second to
*  talk about policygenius.com. I know that probably shopping for insurance is something that if you
*  haven't already done it doesn't seem that exciting. It seems like one of those things you're going to
*  put low on your list of priorities especially the holidays are coming up you have other things on
*  your mind. So policygenius makes it easy to shop for insurance whether it's life insurance,
*  health insurance, disability insurance or what have you. You can go to one website type in what
*  you want and you can get a list of different options with all the prices explicitly there
*  and once you apply the policygenius team will handle all the paperwork and red tape. You can
*  save up to $1,500 or more per year by using policygenius to compare life insurance policies
*  alone. So if you need life insurance but aren't sure where to start why not start at policygenius.com
*  it only takes a few minutes to find the right insurance policy apply cross another thing off
*  your end of the year to-do list. Policygenius it's nice to get it right. So aside from the grand
*  biological theories what about human beings? Cancer is quite common on the scale of things that kill
*  us in the world today right and what should a typical American let's say
*  is sorry let me back up are the numbers very different from the US to Europe to Africa to Asia
*  etc? Actually no. Okay. The only difference in numbers that appears is because some places
*  keep good statistics others don't so the only numbers we can rely on unfortunately are only
*  western countries and a few countries in Asia and Africa but in general wherever it has been
*  looked at a few things are very clear. Number one no age is immune from cancer so from birth to death
*  a person is can get cancer anytime however it's much more common as age advances. So not just
*  because you're older but because the likelihood per year goes up when you're older. I actually
*  call it the mist of aging to remember it easily it's an acronym mist M stands for mutations so
*  just remember that by the time you are older each cell has now gone through multiple mutations so
*  each cell has more mutations in it and if you think about this great sandpile game that Pierre
*  Bach one of my patients that I described in great detail in the book came up with was that if you
*  are dropping grains of sand it forms a little pile but this sand pile after you keep dropping
*  the sand will eventually collapse the last grain of sand which caused the pile to collapse was no
*  different than thousands of grains that came before it it was the pile that had become unstable
*  so it's not necessarily something a mutation that causes cancer it could just be that with age
*  many things are becoming unstable in the body so one of them is the number of mutations have
*  increased per cell a second one is the immune system may be a little more decrepit now it's not
*  as efficient in eliminating the abnormal misbehaving cells. Right then immune is i in mist. Yes and then
*  the S is stands for senescence which we mentioned this briefly earlier that after
*  the hae flick limit is reached and cells dial down their activities and enter a quiescence period
*  in which they are really not performing any more useful function they are incapable of dividing
*  anymore so they'll never become cancerous but they have a minimal level of metabolic function
*  on to stay alive so now more and more cells are entering senescence with age and what is happening
*  is they are producing a ton of garbage and the garbage system in the body is becoming i can feel
*  it you're too young the garbage system is now becoming overwhelmed and what happens then is
*  that more and more of this toxic material starts collecting and poisons the soil or the micro
*  environment in which the seed or the cell is living so the S really is not just senescence
*  but the soil as well of the body becomes more pro-inflammatory which means these inflammatory
*  proteins cytokines are accumulating and causing normal cells to have less than robust existence
*  whereas supporting the proliferation and growth of something which is even slightly out of balance
*  but has a selective growth advantage in that setting so it's fitness of the landscape to the
*  seed that's existing in it and the last so sorry just to make that clear the senescent cells as
*  you say they're not the ones are going to become cancerous but they make all the cells around them
*  more prone to it by weakening them in some sense yes by poisoning the atmosphere in which they are
*  living poisoning the soil in which they exist that's exactly right and the last thing t that
*  you see one of the problems is that i'll give you the example of the bone marrow in a normal healthy
*  adult half of the marrow is fat cells and the other half is hematopoietic cells which means the
*  cells which make blood which do all the things blood is supposed to do by the time we are
*  let's say 70 years old
*  this ratio changes so that 70 percent of it is now just empty space which is filled with fat cells
*  and only 30 percent are active cells so in in this setting what happens is that
*  every living cell is under the control of signals from other cells from within itself from the soil
*  in which it exists from blood vessels that are coming from nerve endings that are feeding onto
*  it the increase in distance between controlling cells and those that are the targets the effector
*  and the effector cells just by increasing that that geographic distance you know that can also
*  lead to slight change in for example a suppressive behavior if a cell is growing too much then it
*  would be controlled and it would be told not to and yet it's suddenly taking off so i do think that
*  with age the incidence of cancer increases because you asked me about
*  is it the same all over the world and is it the same disease all over the world
*  what we see is in america for example 1.7 million new cancer cases are diagnosed in adults
*  in children 14 000 a year so you see the difference that age makes they're there but there's a big
*  difference yeah yeah so there is a big difference in age and but as i said no age is really immune
*  from it i mean all these facts about aging tangentially to this conversation but i've had
*  previous conversations with experts on aging and you know there are people out there who want to
*  stop or reverse aging and this reminds us how hard it is how many things are going on under the
*  umbrella of what we call aging no i don't think i mean of course it's going to be very hard like
*  curing cancer is like you're going to cure aging basically but one thing we can target is instead
*  of always running after disease and treating disease preventing it right sure absolutely but
*  i want to get there but just to drive it home how important that is again for the folks in the
*  audience who haven't had to go through this personally how do we treat cancer in a typical
*  patient these days is there a standard way of we've all heard of radiation therapy and chemotherapy
*  and so forth yes so the the good news is that 68 percent cancers we are that are diagnosed today
*  are cured but cured with what the same things we were using like 60 70 years ago slash poison
*  burns surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy the same things of course there are some very small
*  pockets of rare cancers for which other things are used two of them have targeted therapies one is
*  chronic myeloid leukemia being treated with the matenib which is one gene causing a problem
*  and one magic bullet that targets it that's the one cancer that has been really paradigmatic in
*  the sense that it seemed to establish a model that cancer is a disease that is caused by
*  a genetic change which can be targeted by a drug successfully sadly it turned out that for
*  all other cancers there's many many genetic mutations and no single drug seems to be working
*  so basically chemotherapies and in discriminant killing of normal as well as abnormal cells and
*  that's what we are still using the 32 percent patients that we are not curing
*  their outcome today is as bad as it was 50 years ago and so what should we do what you part of the
*  message of your book is that of course we don't have all the answers you don't have all the
*  answers either but we do choose to spend our resources trying different things and you have
*  a specific angle you think that we should be pushing toward yes the angle is of course that
*  of the first cell that instead of forever chasing and trying to kill the last cell
*  we have been trying to do that for 50 years we have done it successfully in a very small number
*  of rare cancers but for the majority of patients who present with the common types of cancers
*  you know GI colorectal lung ovarian kidney cancer I mean for these types of cancers we really haven't
*  made a big striking blow against them in using the same slash poison burn approaches
*  let me let me I should have asked this earlier but we speak of cancer being in remission we
*  typically don't speak of cancer being cured right can you explain the difference there
*  I mean it's a technicality where oncologists insist that if someone has been cancer free for
*  five years at least then we call them cured okay but otherwise if there is no evidence of even
*  microscopic disease we only will call it remission and that's because we are never sure whether
*  there's still a little bit of cancer there we're not yes that it may recur but after five years if
*  it recurs the chances are that it's a new cancer right okay that's fair and is it it if there are
*  genetic components to turning a cell into a cancer cell is it just one mutation would be enough do
*  you need a combination of mutations because if the latter then you can imagine that even if you get
*  rid of all the actually cancerous cells there's still a bunch of cells left over that are ready
*  to become cancerous because they have all but one of the mutations yes that's the answer is yes that
*  there is always that danger so you were talking about we have a certain amount of resources how
*  are we going to spend them I think before we get into it I want to give you a few statistics sure
*  the first is as I said our strategy has been since time immemorial to get rid of the cancer somehow
*  so we see a disease once it's already developed once it's already developed yes we we see it we
*  want to get rid of it and if we get rid of what we can see then we still assume that microscopic
*  disease may be present so we try to kill it with supplemental adjuvant therapies like chemotherapy
*  radiation therapy so we not only remove a woman's breast we now give her tons of both of these as
*  well over time we have learned to use these things better and that has changed but I wanted to give
*  you some statistics first of all patients who are diagnosed with early stage disease 90 can be cured
*  but those who are advanced with advanced disease 90 or more 100 are going to die with
*  the common kinds of cancers really that makes sense but it's a dramatic shift yeah so we know
*  that early detection is more amenable to treatment it's true for every disease the earlier you detect
*  the better you are able to treat it before you let things go completely out of hand now I started
*  my career Sean in 1977 by studying and treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia today in 2019
*  I'm using the exact same combination of two chemotherapy drugs popularly known as seven and
*  three to treat acute myeloid leukemia I was using seven and three then I'm using it now can you
*  imagine I see 30 to 40 patients every week for all these years can you imagine the same conversation
*  with the same side effects and the same dreadful results over and over honestly I cannot imagine
*  being an oncologist I think that you need a sort of strength of will and generosity that would tax
*  me a little bit but I give you credit for having all those conversations thank you for saying that
*  but I have the opposite view you have such exquisite sensitivity because I listen to your
*  all your great courses as well as your podcasts and I think you have exquisite sensitivity and
*  you would make an excellent doctor and we all have to do what we have to do in life that's right and
*  when a human being needs us then it is actually an immense privilege Sean to be there for someone
*  that's true and help them if we can't help them live a better life we help them have a better
*  death we help them at every step of the way and to me that is the most sublime form of grace that
*  you can see the most the greatest acts that you witness and are seen in the nobility of endurance
*  that is manifested by these patients and a corresponding level of frustration that you're
*  having the same conversation with them about the same treatments 40 years later and we should be
*  able to do better you think I'll give you one example my daughter Scheherazade's best friend
*  Andrew three years ago at 22 years of age got diagnosed because he had pain and tingling in an
*  arm by the time he reached the emergency room he was already quadriplegic the neurosurgeons when
*  they operated on him found a nine centimeter brain tumor which they could only partly remove
*  so every oncologist knew from day zero that this poor boy's chances of survival are 0.00
*  do you know the first thing he said when he woke up Sean from the anesthesia he said was
*  mom don't worry just call Azra she's on the cutting edge she's gonna find a cure for me oh no
*  how ashamed I felt how can I ever look at myself in the mirror that this poor boy I stood by his
*  bedside realizing how badly we have failed Andrew and the question I ask myself is how
*  many Andrews will it take and to address that last point I wanted to bring you up to date about Andrew
*  that three weeks before he died which was two years ago now they brought him a form to sign
*  do not resuscitate we call it a DNR form and how old was he 23 now diagnosed at 22 he's 23
*  how is a 23 year old supposed to sign his own death certificate he sent it away he said I'm
*  not signing it so they took it away that night his father came over to spend the night with him
*  as soon as his father came he called the people back to bring this form signed it saying I could
*  not sign it in front of my mother and sister this is the grace I'm talking about that his 23 year
*  old young man who's dying is protecting his mother well we we're all going to die someday we all know
*  it intellectually but you can certain point you reach as a cancer patient you know it in a
*  slightly different way in a more visceral way that it's coming and how you react how you behave
*  says something about who you are definitely it is my opinion that the kind of lonely courage that
*  this boy and that all the patients that I'm taking care of really show at one point or another in
*  the course of their illness that's the kind of courage that needs nations to dedicate monuments
*  to and you know some of it is it's the kind of courage that harper lee has defined beautifully
*  she says Shawn courage is knowing that you are licked before you start but you start anyway
*  and you see it through to the end and that is what andrew did from the start he knew he's licked
*  but he went through round upon round of chemo radiation more surgery immune therapy more chemo
*  more radiation more immune therapy more surgery he went through everything and saw it to the very end
*  he went through everything and saw it to the very end
*  and that's the kind of courage that really is what i am talking about after my husband died we found
*  in his wallet a beautiful saying beautiful line that he had written something to the effect that
*  there is no good end for what i'm going through
*  but i have to do it because i am a man and a man is responsible for himself
*  and it's difficult because we don't either sort of narrowly as a medical establishment or broadly
*  as a society deal very well with how to die right how to help people dying how to admit
*  that death is coming how to face it you know there's individual moments of courage and grace
*  but there is not we tend to avoid it right we tend to to live in denial do you think do you
*  think that we can change that do you think that how bad is it or is there is it better than i think
*  it is first i want to quote emily dickinson beautiful beautiful writer
*  i measure every grief i meet with analytic eyes i wonder if it weighs like mine or has a different
*  size i wonder if they bore it long or did it just begin i cannot find the date of mine it's been
*  so long a pain i wonder if it hurts to live and if they have to try and whether
*  could they choose between they would not rather die
*  you see death is not an option that is not a choice as you say death is coming
*  so for all of us but for those individuals who start hearing the footsteps of death approaching
*  what goes through their minds is impossible for us to imagine unless we are in those shoes
*  so i think it is impossible for us to switch places easily however one of the main reasons
*  to write the book for me was exactly what you said that i am getting tired of everyone only
*  promoting the positive anecdote as if dying is a failure dying is not a failure denying death is a
*  failure and the main difference between humans and greek gods is that we accept mortality in the
*  final analysis look at andrew at 23 he accepted mortality and is trying to protect the living
*  because he knows he is dying but he's trying to shield his mother and his sister that is the
*  sublime grace of humanity and that is what makes my life a privilege to live instead of people's
*  feeling sorry that i have to take care of dying patients they should be envious that i get to see
*  humanity in its noblest of forms basically it boils down to are we prolonging life or prolonging
*  death by the current techniques that's the question i'm asking in the book that if
*  the 68 percent patients we are curing today with cancer why are we curing them with paleolithic
*  treatments that belong in the stone age why are we still using chemotherapy for god's sake it's
*  like taking a baseball bat to a dog to get rid of its fleas it's so horrifying the toxic effects
*  and the 32 percent patients who present with advanced disease who we know we are not benefiting
*  we are being bringing drugs to their bedside which have a failure rate of 95 percent
*  and the five percent that are FDA approved and are ostensibly great successes
*  they should have failed because they are only prolonging survival by a few months for a small
*  minority so if 100 patients are given this drug x 20 to 30 percent will respond for a few months
*  70 to 80 percent will never respond and suffer all the toxic side effects 100 percent will suffer
*  physical toxicity of the drug and financial toxicity do you know shaun that today in america
*  42 percent individuals who are diagnosed with cancer 42 percent become financially ruined by
*  two plus years i was going to ask about that i do know that and that's astonishing number
*  it is untenable it is unsupportable it is unconscionable it would be one thing if
*  and then they lived happily ever after yes they are not even living so why are we bringing drugs
*  to the market or to the bedside which are benefiting a small fraction of patients for a
*  few days and hurting everybody and ruining 42 percent not just themselves their next generation
*  to come so the question is what should we do then we have present patients to worry about and then
*  what are our plans for the future either we can keep doing the same thing and there is some
*  and there is some benefit to hanging on to your ideas forever but sometimes giving up
*  bad ideas can also help okay we have milked the most out of chemo and radiation even for the 68
*  percent we are curing there should be better solutions in my opinion we don't have to torture
*  people and for this 32 percent we shouldn't be saying either you die of cancer or you die
*  of the drugs we give you and also be financially ruined so but we have a limited number of resources
*  how are we going to spend it actually let me let me interrupt you just there because i want to
*  i don't want to let this terrible fact about financial ruin and the grim mortality rates go
*  by without wondering about the causality just a little bit let me just put this on the table
*  are are some people or groups benefiting financially from the current regime do they have a vested
*  interest in keeping it like this
*  my answer is not some people but everyone is benefiting except the cancer patient why do i
*  say this i think it's very easy for the public to imagine the worst possible things about the evil
*  pharmaceutical companies but i ask you this question if you go to the corner drugstore and
*  buy a hundred packet of hundred band-aids you'll cost you 399 or something if you go to a hospital
*  and they put a band-aid on you one band-aid will cost 75 dollars so where's the drug company in this
*  equation and what about all the extra imaging or extra scanning people are getting and what about
*  all the therapies that oncologists are giving to patients who they know will not be benefited
*  80 percent chances they will not be benefit why aren't we holding them responsible the question
*  is i'm one of them every criticism applies to me as much as it does to any other oncologist why am
*  i doing it when i know seven and three is so bad why am i giving it because otherwise i'll go to jail
*  because a group of key opinion leaders in the field have reviewed all the data and come up with
*  guidelines and it's a good thing to try to make something more uniform try to bring some method
*  to the madness so that let's say if a pancreatic cancer patient is diagnosed with stage four
*  disease these three drugs will be used in first line treatment then these three in second line
*  these two in third line treatment that is the guideline if i deviate from doing that then i'm
*  opening myself to legal challenges so i'm also giving those drugs knowing full well that it will
*  only hurt 80 percent of the people practically 100 percent in the end for a benefit of a few months
*  the other thing is we tell everything to the patient it's not like we are doing it without
*  signed consent forms and they are the ones choosing it also because life is so precious
*  and dying is so scary that most of my patients will tell me even if there's one a million one
*  in a million chance what do i have to lose let me sign up for it and do it so it's a very strange
*  kind of system where everyone is to be blamed but no one can actually assume the blame so where does
*  individual responsibility end and society's responsibility begin these are the fundamental
*  questions i'm raising in the book and it's it is fundamentally difficult if you're told there's a
*  one percent chance of survival a 99 chance that you will die and your family will be financially
*  ruined saying no i'm not even going to try to take that one percent is difficult or more in terms of
*  policy saying well we should spend less because most of what we're spending is being wasted people
*  are going to worry that if you're spending less you're not doing as good a job of course honestly
*  hard to balance these so here's the thing i'm saying that if 95 percent of the drugs we bring
*  to the bedside are failing the first question is why are they failing because whatever we did to
*  bring them to the bedside is a failing model what is that failing platform where we are even
*  developing these drugs to bring to the bedside mostly in animals or in in vitro petri dishes
*  or in extremely artificial conditions that we keep insisting will be extrapolated to humans
*  well over and over it's been shown that doesn't happen so there's a time to simply take off the
*  blinders and admit the truth cancer is too complicated for us to understand every intracellular
*  signaling pathway and then try to fix it because it keeps it has moved on also i know you have
*  strong opinions about studies being done on mice very strong opinions and and mice are the model
*  organism in which we test our ideas about cancer right so i don't want to be misquoted here i'll
*  make myself very clear because very often i am misquoted and then i get hate mail for months
*  years not for mine no i hope not the main point i want to make is this
*  animal models are excellent biologic tools where we can test a large number of very intricate
*  questions about all sorts of biologic phenomena there's no question about it or most of the
*  advances have occurred even in cancer because of studying animals the only thing i object to
*  which i try to be as specific as possible and i'm glad you're giving me this chance to
*  explain my point of view accurately the only thing i object to is you can't create a tumor
*  in an animal treat it with some drug and think now when you use the same drug in the human tumor
*  it's going to have the same results so for drug development animal models have not been helpful
*  but this is the point but they are used in these preclinical testing platform in fact you can't
*  bring a drug to the market unless you've tested it in a mice and my question is why is that giving
*  the fda any level of confidence that if we don't see toxicity in mice we won't see toxicity in
*  humans or if we see efficacy in mice we'll see efficacy in humans because the actual evidence
*  is contrary to that that there is no possibility of this flip-flop exchange of information from
*  one species to another you know about the doing it the twitter account called in mice it takes
*  headlines you know study shows eating ice cream cures heart disease and then it just retweets
*  it with the words in mice i love that it's that time of year when you're doubtless buying
*  presents for the people you care about in your life so why not buy a present for yourself in

*  that you've been thinking about treat yourself it's the end of the year you're worth it yes so
*  I got tired of the promotion of this anecdotal person who has had remission for
*  four years on this drug that had failed in everybody the question I asked is that
*  yes it's true that there are unicorns who have superb inexplicable responses even to targeted
*  therapies that have failed in every other patient and we don't have an explanation of why they are
*  responding so well but we keep taking that as the anecdote that we recount over and over to say well
*  that could happen the question I'm asking is at the expense of what at the expense of 99 out of
*  100 patients suffering unbearable toxicities and medicines one rule that we begin with is first do
*  no harm so how can we justify ourselves in an enterprise where 95 percent drugs are going to
*  just harm and the five percent that we think won't harm will still harm the majority of patients
*  so instead of constantly trying to improve the typewriter we have to invent something like the
*  word processor to make that obsolete in order to make the paradigm shift to a better one we need
*  to show a better way because no one is going to willingly give up what they're doing and there is
*  sort of a naive logic about testing things on mice in the sense that if it goes terribly wrong and
*  the mouse dies it's not as bad as it happening to a human being but I think that you're you have
*  this idea that we can test things on human cells or human tissues without testing them on human
*  beings and maybe that's a better way to go yes that's exactly well said you should be giving
*  this podcast because you are so eloquent no I think that's exactly right that yes there are
*  some things we can't do in humans that we can do in animals but we don't have to do them there are
*  other things that we can do that we haven't even interrogated yet yet so how do we do that how do
*  we test things out on human tissues or cells without the whole human I think it was in 1940s
*  I think that somebody said the best model for a cat is another cat preferably the same one
*  same cat yes they are different yes so in other words what we need is we need to test individual
*  humans for their disease and if we want to diagnose we know that the only thing that works in cancer
*  is not in fact 1903 Dr. Childay in England said this it's not the cancer that kills but the delay
*  in treatment that kills so if we know that the earlier we detect cancer the higher the chances
*  of cure why not try and develop better techniques to detect cancer early well this is not a new idea
*  screening measures for cancer were put into place 50 years ago screening how by mammography by
*  colonoscopy by pap smear and by PSA measurements these are the four most common screening measures
*  used and mortality from cancer has dropped by 26 percent in the last 30 years not because we
*  invented some new magic bullet but because we're curing it no because of two things one anti-smoking
*  campaigns and two screening measures even with these four old screening measures we have brought
*  down the mortality but these have been milked dry now this is the maximum benefit we will get
*  the present rate for cancer mortality is only declining by one percent a year and only that
*  is happening again not because of new drugs coming on market but learning to use existing
*  chemotherapy radiation therapy better and diagnosing cancer earlier and earlier through more
*  sophisticated imaging scanning etc techniques so what my point in the book is simply we have done
*  enough by trying to chase the last cell we have used artificial testing platforms clinical drug
*  development platforms these have been and spectacular failures and by the last cell we mean
*  the most recent cancer cell in this cancerous growth rather than the first one that appeared
*  the last cell means that after you have given all the treatment you still think some residual disease
*  may be left behind and that is the last cell i'm talking about so we keep trying to develop
*  sophisticated techniques to molecularly identify the last cell i'm saying why not go not for minimal
*  residual disease but develop techniques to determine minimal initial disease and diagnose it
*  cancer early in fact and try to prevent it so instead of using the standard screening
*  measures i described why not in this day and age of god-like technology cutting and pasting the
*  dna why not develop technologies like you go to sleep in a in bed sheets that scan you overnight
*  for the presence of a hot spot because remember i told you a cancer when it begins divides faster
*  than normal cells so it needs more nutrition it attracts more blood supply area becomes hot it can
*  be picked up by scanning techniques so the phrase hot spot is not metaphorical it's literally hotter
*  or part of your body that is higher than average temperature yes for example a smart bra is now in
*  clinical trials which is fitted with 200 nanosensors that detect changes in temperature and circadian
*  rhythms so the point is or you can sit enough on something in the toilet in the morning it's called
*  the fit loo it takes part of your urine and examines it for the presence of biomarkers of
*  malignancy that are being metabolites that may be secreted or you can do a liquid biopsy if somebody
*  has colon cancer as soon as cancer cells begin and start proliferating they start shedding their dna
*  into the blood you know where it started actually it started with
*  mother child placental bridge because it turns out that since developmental abnormalities in an
*  embryo in an embryo increase with increasing maternal age so an older woman becoming pregnant
*  has a higher chance of having an abnormal developmentally abnormal baby in order to
*  diagnose those kinds of syndromes like down syndromes etc we used to put a long needle
*  into the uterus of the mother draw amniotic fluid and look at it i underwent this amniocentesis
*  when i was pregnant because i was 40 years old when i was pregnant but then this was discovered
*  that the fetus is shedding its dna into maternal blood so cell free fetal dna cff dna is now the
*  standard routine thing all we need is a few drops of the mother's blood now and we have the health
*  of the fetus reflected in those few drops of blood or few ccs of blood the same techniques have been
*  applied to cancer when cancer starts it also sheds off cell free dna cf dna into the blood
*  and so you can this is the mutated dna that is that you can pick up and and just two weeks ago
*  it was announced by the company grail which is really going after early detection of cancer
*  they announced that not only can they detect cell free dna reliably 99 percent of the time they can
*  also say which organ it's coming from so is it coming from pancreas is it coming from the liver
*  is it coming from the lungs based on the kind of mutations so this is the beauty of very different
*  disciplines of knowledge coming together in a conciliance of cross disciplines to yield this
*  kind of information because the human genome was sequenced 20 years ago practically but now we are
*  seeing the dividends of it because we know what the normal dna should look like we can pick up a
*  mutation we can now detect i mean think about it 20 years ago it took 15 years and 2.7 billion
*  dollars to do the first human genome sequencing today it cost a few thousand dollars and three
*  weeks of sequencing so we become efficient very quickly and i think that if we start paying more
*  attention to these new types of techniques we need to develop strategies to detect cancer's
*  footprints in any secretion for example blood sweat tears urine stool you can do you can find
*  biologic markers of dna for example some cancers which are beginning let's say your bed sheets
*  detected a spot in my head of pancreas one night the next morning it isn't necessary for me to have
*  an open abdominal procedure in a whipple's procedure and eviscerate my whole belly no what it means is
*  first i should be monitored and then taken for maybe even more sophisticated focused scanning
*  measures to make sure that this thing is growing it's a real presence if it is confirmed it's a
*  real presence one thing we can do is do a liquid biopsy see if it's shedding anything in the blood
*  in the urine in the tears and saliva if we don't find it then we can still do another thing we can
*  yell at that spot how do we yell using ultrasounds we hit it with ultrasound when ultrasounds hit this
*  little mass it wiggles it shakes and they shed off more protein so you hit it it yells back and
*  then you just do another test of these liquid biopsies from various places and now see if you're
*  detecting it and once you detect it then you really confirm its potential lethality because it may not
*  necessarily be very aggressive it may not need to be removed right away it may not kill someone who's
*  80 years for another 30 years so there's no need to go in so all these markers of initial malignancy
*  its potential lethality its ability to become invasive and aggressive those are all pieces of
*  information that can actually be investigated with the current sophisticated technology
*  so my point is we have present patients and we have future patients we should divide up
*  resources into half and half half we should be dedicating to the present patients half to
*  developing better technologies to prevent and to detect early and prevent the disease from becoming
*  its end-stage monstrosity whereas right now it's not 50 50 no it's five and 95 right now five percent
*  for future patients for future for for early detection and for present patients what we need
*  to do also Sean which I feel very strongly about is we have to stop hurting them
*  I mean that is something we need to stop giving everybody and the simple the the most obvious
*  thing to do is try and identify which patients are likely to respond to which drugs how do you do that
*  well anytime a sponsor wants to propose a clinical trial an experimental trial they should be made to
*  save every sample from every patient going on that first trial and then you'll have some patients who
*  respond some who don't now you compare the responders and non-responders using every
*  technique you have available genomics proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics panomics test by
*  every way and try to enrich the next trial for patients who are likely to respond and so on and
*  so forth today the clinical trials are done the same way they were being done in 1977
*  and it is horrifying to me that the agencies which have been charged with protecting patients and
*  demanding this kind of rigor are not doing it I think that the this this sounds very
*  provocative and promising and so forth that the idea that is the scientific idea that I that I get
*  from it that is most exciting to me is the idea of the footprints of the cancer I mean the wearing a
*  blanket and finding a hot spot sounds interesting but that's literally looking for the tumor in your
*  body whereas this sort of indirect idea that once there's a tumor in your body it leaves traces
*  either from dna and correct me if I'm wrong from reading your book but you can find tracers of the
*  fact that your immune system is beginning to fight it also in your blood is that another way of doing
*  it yes definitely in fact I have a the best way that would emerge eventually is a collection of
*  all of this technology which is imaging and scanning and devices and biomarkers and generic
*  markers all these put together and all being read by something no bigger than your cell phone and
*  all the information available on this but then even implantable devices I mean I'm working with
*  biomedical engineers at Columbia University on a chip that we want to implant under the skin from
*  birth to death which constantly should be monitoring the idea is that even the screening
*  techniques we used so far brought down the mortality considerably but it's not happening
*  anymore because they have reached their limit but those were done annually at best
*  we want to treat the human body as if it is a machine and constantly monitor it for even the
*  appearance of perturbations in disease caused networks and you see that and you step in and
*  try to intervene so this many of the same drugs which are failing today can be applied in earlier
*  stages of the disease and may be far more effective and this has been shown as a paradigm
*  in chronic myeloid leukemia the disease I mentioned to you for which a targeted therapy
*  is the ideal for every cancer well in that cancer itself as long as it is chronic myeloid leukemia
*  that drug is all is curative but if the disease starts to accelerate becomes acute leukemia the
*  same drug is useless so earlier stages the same drugs can work well that's what I wanted to
*  pinpoint also so I mean it seems obviously true that if you can find the disease earlier you have
*  a better chance of curing it but how far can we go in saying that you know if we find it very very
*  early does our chances of curing the disease go very very high or does it increase by 10 percent
*  my answer is it will be 100 percent more curable why because of all the statistics that are
*  available the earlier you find cancer the better you're able to cure it but the issue is how
*  quickly are we able to do it and then technologies will also evolve for treatment of early disease
*  so if you're a different kind of thing to try to do totally different disease yes so let's say you
*  have a million cells to kill rather than 150 billion cells to kill there's a big difference
*  so I think for example if you needed radiation therapy to kill 100 billion cells you may need
*  just a targeted laser to knock off a few million cells quite confidently or you can use immune
*  cellular therapies that if we have a biomarker we can arm the killer cells of the immune system with
*  it and it will be able to distinguish then between the cancer and the normal cells the current
*  cellular therapies we are using are unable to distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells
*  that's why the toxicities of say CAR t therapy because it will kill every cell that is expressing
*  that marker which means normal cells as well as cancer cells I'm saying that once we have biomarkers
*  specific for cancer cells we may have an address for the cancer cell also that is more usable by
*  these the same techniques which are causing so much toxicity and it sounds like this is great
*  because it's not just an aspiration it's not just a sort of feel-good motto that if we found the
*  cancer earlier we could help cure it quicker more effectively but that there are very concrete steps
*  being taken is this how popular is this view in the community is this a plucky minority or is it
*  catching on as that this is what we should be concentrating on right now it's all of these
*  things I described to you are in various stages of development so everyone has known for 50 years
*  that the best strategy is to go early and people have spent a lot of time in screening and trying
*  to make those as accurate as possible and in the last 10-15 years people have started developing
*  all this new technology based on the evolving genomic information and proteomics etc that's
*  becoming available so clearly those things are all in various stages of development it's not a pie in
*  the sky but we the more resources we need the more people will get interested and young minds who
*  are today wasting their time and talent and intellect on failing models because they are
*  working with mentors who for 30 years have used those failing models and they are the ones sitting
*  in every granting agency deciding who gets the grant and who gets to scratch who's back this is
*  all has to stop and young minds and young intellect as well as resources should be better used I think
*  and new technology new ideas new therapies will bring their own set of problems so I'm not someone
*  who's going to say all our problems will be resolved because I'm an old hag I've been
*  been there done that in all kinds of things but I do think that it is time to recognize at least
*  where we are failing time to take off our blinders time to at least describe the problem in its detail
*  and see the problem for what it is right now we are not even willing to see the problem
*  it's not that we are just not finding the solution we refuse to look at the details of what we are
*  doing wrong my insistence is to look at all of this through the prism of human anguish
*  because this is not just some cut and dried science this involves humans this involves a 22
*  year old Andrew or a 38 year old umar or my patient JC who died at 34 or Harvey who was
*  diagnosed for with his first cancer and then at 34 and his second cancer at 57 and this is one
*  thing I want to also recount to you Sean that my life has been committed to early detection
*  since 1984 you know why because I started by studying acute myeloid leukemia and treating
*  patients with it within a short space of seven years it became clear to me that in my lifetime
*  this disease is so aggressive we will not be able to cure it and I was right unfortunately we were
*  using seven and three then we are using seven and three now in 1984 because of a patient JC I
*  realized that the best way to handle acute myeloid leukemia is to stop the disease before it becomes
*  so aggressive are there patients like that yes it's a whole series of syndromes called
*  myelodysplastic syndromes which are pre-leukemic because a third of these patients can develop
*  acute myeloid leukemia my idea was well then we should study pre-leukemia and follow these
*  patients through and had I gone to school in this country at this point I would have invested the
*  rest of my life into making a mouse model of this pre-leukemia but coming from Pakistan as a fresh
*  immigrant I trusted my instinct rather than followed custom and I decided oh I'm going to
*  study these patients let me save their samples so I just started banking blood bone marrow
*  aspirate biopsies normal buckle smears germline controls on all my patients so by saving them
*  you don't mean saving the data you mean literally saving the tissues both no I mean both the data
*  as well as the actual samples it's the most well annotated tissue repository which today has more
*  than 60,000 samples from thousands of patients and not one cell has come from a different doctor
*  every patient is my patient do you want other doctors to contribute to this is there an
*  ongoing it's very expensive they can't afford to do it I'm the only one who does it because I pay
*  for it and how do I pay for it no grant afford can support it my patient support it for me I ask them
*  and they they want to give me money and I say no I don't want personal money give it to the tissue
*  repository because it costs almost a million dollars a year just to maintain the tissue repository
*  so point is that I have these samples which were obtained in a longitudinal fashion
*  serially on these thousands of patients as they progress from pre leukemia to acute leukemia
*  now if we go in and study these samples and work our way back we can at the end go and ask the
*  question why did this a healthy individual even get pre leukemia was there a genetic
*  mutation that made them susceptible or at high risk for it what was it about their exposome
*  environment exposure what was there about their background their inherited dna and so those kinds
*  of questions we can then take to the dna sequences that are in the public domain from hundreds of
*  thousands of healthy volunteers and find out how many people fit our bill for being at high risk
*  of developing even pre leukemia and then following those healthy individuals to find whether they
*  develop it or not and how quickly can we stop it there this is the kind of thing we need to do the
*  problem is so it took me so long to amass the samples even today I'm doing five to ten bone
*  marrows every week in my clinic in my with my own hands I do the bone marrows and banking them so I
*  have all this tissue the technology has caught up we need resources right who's going to give the
*  resources the government can't afford it because I need a hundred million dollars to study the
*  whole repository it isn't as if I haven't been studying it Sean of course over the last 30 years
*  I have over 300 original publications which are reporting on the results we find from limited
*  samples we take out study it for one gene or that signaling pathway or this drug or that kind of
*  thing with limited questions clearly now that all the technology has arrived and we need to go in
*  and study the entire tissue repository that is a thing that no one can no government grant can
*  support hundred million dollars to one individual and I don't need the money to set up you know
*  building with 70 scientists working in it no this is money that's needed to pay for the actual tests
*  for the samples to do the proteomics on 200 patients cost four million dollars this is the
*  kind of that's that's where the money will go so the other idea that occurred to me was if there
*  are any mindscape listeners out there who would like to donate 100 million dollars to the tissue
*  repository we'll encourage them to do that I mean can you just I'd like to try to give the the
*  audience a sort of visceral feel for what it's like to be doing this kind of work number one let
*  me just mention this kind of longitudinal study is the gold standard in sciences social sciences
*  especially and really hard and expensive to do because you have to start young and continue to
*  be dedicated and get the resources but how like where is it where are these tissues like are they
*  in a room somewhere are they kept cold or they do do they still duplicate the cells or is there
*  a finite number of cells that we use up so it's the entire tissue repository is housed at columbia
*  university cancer center it moved with me from buffalo to cincinnati to chicago to massachusetts
*  to new york now it's been around and it has since 1984 which traveled with me and these are samples
*  which are in in freezers but in addition we have frozen viable tissue also which can be brought out
*  and regrown in plates in animals in vitro in vivo so it's an immense collection of samples
*  everything belongs to columbia university i don't have any companies to my name i don't need any
*  personal money this is all going to go through columbia university so one thing that occurred
*  to me shawn is that the people who should be most interested in finding the first cell
*  are the people who are at highest risk of getting cancer who are those people they're people like
*  late husband people who have one cancer now i don't want to scare your listeners at all
*  but i do want to say that one in five new cancers is diagnosed in a cancer survivor
*  because whatever was there to cause the first cancer is still there the conditions are still
*  conditions are there and probably with our treatment for some of them we have made the
*  conditions worse because harvey did not die of his cancer he died because we wiped out his immune
*  system with the horrible chemotherapy we gave him so the point is the people at highest risk
*  should be the most interested today in this country there are 20 million survivors from cancer
*  even if one million of them just give ten dollars a month for a year that's it that will fund the
*  whole tissue repository people ask me dr azza why should we give you money and not to the
*  american cancer society my answer is where's the tissue for american cancer society talk is cheap
*  shawn but i'm the one who has the tissue i'm the one who has the commitment to early detection
*  because i've been going after not just acute leukemia but pre leukemia since 1984 i've been
*  saying the same thing since 1984 how much more credibility can i give people are very quick to
*  start criticizing me oh she's talking about the first cell she has she doesn't know how much
*  screening measures have failed i know nobody needs to lecture me about these things because not only
*  do i see 30 to 40 cancer patients every week i have had a cutting-edge research lab for 35 plus years
*  and i'm a cancer widow so i have stood on both sides of the bed of a cancer patient as well as
*  a family member as well as an oncologist so there is really very little that i have not experienced
*  directly and firsthand and i have been consistently committed to finding cancer at its earliest
*  possible cell and try to take care of it to prevent the disease from happening and if people don't
*  trust me by now and don't want to support this tissue repository then i don't know who will
*  all i can say is as long as there is one breath left in my body i will keep saying the same thing
*  and trying to work as hard as ever for my patients i can't think of a better place to end up than
*  very eloquently said uh dr azra raza thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast
*  thank you shawn it has been an honor being on your podcast
*  you
