Welcome to the March 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). With an expanding number of questions, itâ€™s become a bit impractical for me to try to rush through and answer them all. So instead, this time I have picked out certain questions to tackle, and grouped some together if they were related. I tried to pick questions on the basis of whether or not I had anything interesting to say in response, but that will of course be in the ear of the listener.

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | March 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [March 10, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW7mlAifIJk)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the March 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of the Mindscape podcast.
*  I'm your host Sean Carroll.
*  And as most of you know, this is something that is made possible by donations from patrons
*  on Patreon.
*  So once a month we do an episode where patrons get to ask questions and then I will try to
*  answer them.
*  And then a couple weeks later, we'll get the transcript made and release the results into
*  the wild into the public.
*  So thanks to the patrons for supporting this.
*  And the number of patrons and the number of questions has been growing.
*  So we finally reached a point where rather than just trying to answer every question,
*  I will pick some subset of the questions to answer those.
*  And so therefore, this is the first time we've been doing it and we'll see how it goes.
*  Let me know.
*  Please do feel free to chime in your opinions as to how it's going.
*  How do I choose which questions to answer you might ask?
*  So it turns out that well, you know, I'm still trying to answer a lot of questions.
*  I don't want to just pick five questions out of 100 or 200 and answer those.
*  I want to give as many people a chance to ask something as possible.
*  But it's a weird, unpredictable set of criteria that I use actually, and maybe not even completely
*  explicable or articulatable.
*  Some questions, for example, were perfectly good questions.
*  Most questions are really good in some contexts, but I just don't have anything interesting
*  to say about them.
*  So I skipped those.
*  And some of those were sort of fun questions like, what's your favorite dessert?
*  Well, I don't have a very fun favorite dessert.
*  I don't know, ice cream, apple pie, something like that.
*  So it just didn't seem to be the kind of thing to, you know, give myself time to expostulate
*  on when I have nothing to say.
*  So oftentimes, if I don't pick your question, it's more a comment on me than a comment on
*  your question.
*  Okay.
*  And other questions are just also interesting.
*  But in some realm that I either don't have anything to say about or I've said too much
*  about already and I am interested in saying other things.
*  So but I think I think it'll work out pretty well.
*  Anyway, you'll let me know, right?
*  We still have plenty of questions to get through.
*  So let's go.
*  So before we officially start, let me have some words on time dilation and special relativity
*  and those kinds of questions, because I actually called them out in the little call for questions.
*  I mentioned that these are not my favorite kinds of questions.
*  And yet some were asked fewer than usual.
*  But so let me let me rather than answer them, explain why these are not my favorite questions,
*  because it's not like they're, again, bad questions are perfectly good questions.
*  And it's certainly these questions are asked by people who are trying better to understand
*  difficult physics, right?
*  So that's the kind of thing that I want to encourage.
*  But it's a specific genre of question that I just get tired of answering myself because
*  there is some kind of phase transition your brain goes through when you learn relativity
*  from the point where these questions about time dilation and and either in special relativity
*  or in general relativity, when you have black holes or whatever, they go from being just
*  completely ineffably mysterious to like completely obvious.
*  So you let you get it right.
*  You you like it suddenly clicks and you understand it.
*  And once you reach that point and sort of articulating it over and over again, you just
*  find yourself repeating yourself and it's less interesting.
*  So let me try to sort of give my once and for all answer to how one should think about
*  this kind of thing.
*  You know, I noticed it again on Twitter recently when we just recently had the Lander, the
*  Perseverance Lander landing on Mars and someone, you know, we know that Mars is seven light
*  minutes away, roughly speaking.
*  So it depends on the place it is in the orbit and so forth.
*  But there's a delay from the signal getting from there to us.
*  And this is a perfect opportunity to talk about special relativity, which I didn't really
*  do. But I just made a joke about the fact that someone said, we know that the landing
*  has either happened or it had not happened, but we don't yet know whether it's been
*  successful. And I said on Twitter, you know, actually, I was that guy.
*  I said, well, in some reference frame, it's happened or not happened in another reference
*  frame. It hasn't happened yet.
*  Right. Because Mars is sufficiently far away that you cannot blithely extend your local
*  reference frame in a unique way.
*  People moving at different speeds will get different answers to what's going on and which
*  is, you know, not the world's best observation or anything like that.
*  But people objected to it.
*  Right. People were like, no, no.
*  There is a fact of the matter about whether it's landed or not.
*  You just don't know. And I think that represents just a misunderstanding of special relativity.
*  I did. I made a follow up joke, which was better about the fact that the landing is
*  now in our past light cone, because being in our past light cone is, in fact, a real
*  physical thing happening at the same time is not a real physical thing.
*  That's exactly what special relativity is about.
*  You cannot define simultaneity for events that are very, very far away in space.
*  So what's going on there?
*  What is the whole issue that is that is such a difficulty?
*  And I think it comes back to the fact that our intuition, our view of the world that we
*  grow up with is very much steeped in the Newtonian limit.
*  If you want to think about it that way of special relativity, right, Newtonian mechanics
*  can be thought of as a limiting case of special relativity that is perfectly valid as long
*  as all of the objects that you're talking about are moving much more slowly than the
*  speed of light, which you and I are.
*  We are moving through our lives, even if we're in a very fast jet airplane, much slower
*  than the speed of light.
*  OK, so as a result, there are two different things, two different notions of the word
*  time that are separate in special relativity, but are the same in Newtonian mechanics.
*  So let's see where that comes from.
*  You know, there's a notion of time that is our measured time on our clocks, OK, the time
*  that clocks measure.
*  So you and I, we can have watches and we can measure time.
*  And if we move through the universe, we can both equally measure time, right?
*  And as long as we're moving slowly with respect to the speed of light, with respect to each
*  other, then the following thing happens.
*  You and I can get together and we can synchronize our watches, right?
*  Assuming we're wearing accurate timekeeping devices, we can synchronize our watches so
*  we know they measure the same time.
*  And then we go off and we do our things, you know, we execute our bank heist or whatever
*  it is.
*  Then we meet up afterward and we look at our watches.
*  And if they read the same when we started and they're accurate time pieces, they still
*  measure the same.
*  So and that's going to be true for any number of people in the universe along again, as
*  you're in this Newtonian limit, you're moving slowly compared to the speed of light.
*  So what this makes you do, what it makes Isaac Newton do and all of us in our intuitions
*  is to associate the passage of time, not with individual people or timekeeping devices, but
*  with the universe, right?
*  With something objective and real and out there, you think that we're just measuring
*  the passage of time, right?
*  That's what our watches apparently are doing.
*  So special relativity comes along and says, no, that is not what we're doing.
*  The objective, real physical thing is the time measured by observers along their path.
*  But that time is not universal.
*  It is not objective.
*  It is, as I've often said, it is exactly like distance in space.
*  You can have a path between two points in space and you have a straight line path or
*  you can have a curvy path.
*  No one in their right minds ever thinks that all paths between two points in space must
*  be of the same distance, right?
*  The straight line path is the shortest distance one.
*  There are also curved distance paths that will be longer distances.
*  So special relativity says that the time between two events as measured by observers carrying
*  their watches is like that.
*  It's like distance.
*  It will be different for different observers.
*  You don't notice it usually because you all move slowly compared to the speed of light.
*  But if you did start moving fast compared to the speed of light, not fast compared to
*  the speed of light, but at or near the speed of light, right?
*  And you left the same event in space time where you synchronized your clocks and you
*  go off in two different paths and you come back and you meet again at some other event.
*  The time that passes on your watch and the time that passes on someone else's watch will
*  be different, okay?
*  Because it's just like taking two different paths through space.
*  You're measuring two different things.
*  The space time interval, the temporal interval, or what physicists call the proper time on
*  two very different trajectories.
*  Why should they be the same?
*  Even if they begin at the same event and end at the same event, if they're different trajectories,
*  they will have different proper times, okay?
*  So what this means is that it separates the notion of the time that you feel and you experience,
*  the proper time, and that's an objective, real, measurable thing from an entirely different
*  is the coordinate that we put on space time to locate things, okay?
*  So we might put coordinates on the universe or even just on our local solar system or
*  something like that that tell us where and when things are, a full four-dimensional coordinate
*  system, okay?
*  And we all know that coordinate systems are not physical, real, objective things.
*  They are inventions of the human mind.
*  One person can use one coordinate system.
*  Another person can use another coordinate system.
*  So special relativity says that if you want to talk about the time it is right now here
*  on Earth and try to extend that to a notion of time on Mars, you can do that by choosing
*  a coordinate system, right?
*  Typically, what we do implicitly is we imagine that we are moving slowly compared to the
*  speed of light and we imagine send out a whole army of little clocks that fill space that
*  start their lives in our rest frame and move very, very slowly to get to their locations.
*  And so we extend our rest frame throughout the universe.
*  But that's highly non-unique.
*  If someone else had been moving at a different speed or if you just picked some weird curvilinear
*  coordinate system, that would also be just as good, okay?
*  So the very notion of when the thing on Mars landed, when Perseverance landed from our
*  point of view, that's just not a well-defined notion in special relativity.
*  What you can say is it's in our past.
*  If it's in our past light cone, if a signal from that event could get to us by moving
*  at or more slowly than the speed of light, then it's in our past.
*  If it's not, then all you can say is it's not.
*  Technically the term would be it's space-like separated from us.
*  But there's no deep reality to the idea of did it happen already yet or not?
*  That notion of simultaneity is just not well-defined.
*  It's like saying, you know, it's really exactly like saying, okay, here I am sitting in Los
*  Angeles.
*  Where would I be if I were in New York City?
*  I mean, that just makes no sense.
*  There's no unique way of extending my location throughout space, right?
*  I could put some coordinates.
*  I could put x, y coordinates, latitude, longitude coordinates, etc.
*  And I could say, am I at the same latitude or whatever?
*  But that's a completely arbitrary choice.
*  So all of the questions in special relativity about time dilation, length contraction, all
*  of these things, they're all instantly dissolved in your head if you really believe that how
*  time should be measured is along individual trajectories.
*  There's the extra little confusion that for space, the shortest distance between two points
*  is a straight line.
*  For time, the longest time between two events is a straight line.
*  So if you zoom out of the speed of light or you hang out near a black hole, you will always
*  have experienced less time when you reconvene to compare your clocks.
*  But otherwise, the math works out very, very similarly.
*  So I just never like it when people talk about, well, time is flowing more slowly near a black
*  hole or time moves more slowly when you move near the speed of light.
*  That's nonsense.
*  Time moves at one second per second.
*  When you're far away in relativity, you just shouldn't compare the rate at which time flows.
*  You should only talk about the rate at which time is measured by individuals.
*  And that rate is always one second per second.
*  You can globally come back to where you left and meet up with the people that you left
*  behind and then compare the total amount of elapsed time.
*  But that's not a rate of anything flowing.
*  And my belief is that once you truly internalize this way of thinking about time dilation and
*  special relativity, you get it and you're free to ask questions on podcast AMAs that
*  have nothing to do with time dilation anymore.
*  And it's a wonderful moment in your life worth celebrating and remembering for the rest of
*  the time.
*  All right.
*  That's not a specific answer to any particular question, but those are my thoughts on time
*  dilation.
*  So I hope that those are useful.
*  Now I can point here whenever anyone is tempted to ask such questions.
*  So moving on to the actual questions and I sort of scramble the order a little bit, but
*  of course I will publish when I publish the transcripts, I'll publish the list of questions
*  that were asked.
*  So Duncan Palmer says, I'm grateful you shared your you shared the podcast of your personal
*  oral history.
*  And it's an oral history of my personal history.
*  And you are making a professional life change right now.
*  If resources and money were not constraints, how would you devote your time and energy
*  differently post covid than you are currently planning to do?
*  So the reason I promoted this question to the very first slot here is because I wanted
*  to say something that I should have said before to especially to those patrons out there who
*  are supporting the podcast.
*  For those of you who don't know the context here, I mentioned on Twitter and also on this
*  AIP oral history interview that I did that I'll be leaving Caltech next summer.
*  So a year and a year and a half from now, something like that.
*  And you know, they it's it's my choice.
*  They have a contract that is renewed every five years and I'm choosing not to renew it.
*  And so why am I doing that?
*  Well, it's a complicated set of many different issues going into it.
*  But you know, basically what it comes down to is that it's I am no longer a very good
*  fit for Caltech and Caltech is not a very good fit for me and vice versa.
*  OK. And this actually has you know, there's a lot we could say about this and it's nothing
*  against Caltech.
*  Caltech is a tremendously wonderful place for the right person, for the right situation.
*  It's just not my situation right now.
*  My own research interests have drifted as I hope that people's research interests do.
*  You don't want to continue to do the same thing you did in graduate school for the rest
*  of your career, although there are people who do that.
*  And you know, look, if it works for you, that's great.
*  That's not my thing, I should say.
*  That's not the way that I like to be.
*  And in particular, you know, this goes back to a feature of modern fundamental physics,
*  which is that it's a bit stuck right now, as I've mentioned in other places in other
*  context.
*  Talked a little bit about this with Frank Wilczak.
*  I've talked a little bit about this in the Biggest Ideas videos in the very last video
*  about science itself.
*  You know, we have these incredibly successful models of the universe, the standard model
*  of particle physics, general relativity, the standard cosmological model, etc.
*  And all the experiments we do, roughly speaking, fit these models.
*  OK, so we know these models are not the final answer.
*  We need to do better.
*  We haven't quantized gravity.
*  We don't understand the black hole information problem or what the dark matter is or what
*  happened at the Big Bang.
*  There's a million questions we don't understand.
*  But our guidance to finding better answers is not coming from experimental surprises,
*  as it usually does in physics.
*  So we're reduced to a situation where in order to get better answers, we kind of have to
*  guess, right?
*  And so you guess how to extend beyond the standard model.
*  There's a whole, you know, subfield of physics called beyond the standard model, and that's
*  particle physics in particular.
*  And there's a whole other set of areas about quantizing gravity, unifying things, etc.
*  etc.
*  These are all guesses, the right model of inflation, the right model of dark matter.
*  You guess, you hypothesize.
*  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
*  That is the right thing to do.
*  This is how science makes progress.
*  You make a guess, hypothesis, test it against the data, etc.
*  But I personally, and I played that game for a long time, but I personally have become
*  convinced that I'm just not going to guess the right answer by this method.
*  You know, when I was at the University of Chicago, I wrote a paper with some of my collaborators
*  on modifying gravity to explain the acceleration of the universe, right?
*  Something that is now called f of r gravity, a function of r, f of r, r being the curvature
*  scalar of spacetime.
*  This is a way of modifying gravity, very simple, very, very straightforward, kind of obvious
*  way of modifying gravity makes the universe accelerate.
*  The paper helped inspire a lot of other people to do a lot of other work, lots of industry
*  of sort of figuring out what are the cosmological implications of this, what are the predictions,
*  etc.
*  Okay, so I could have just become the world's expert on f of r gravity or modified gravity
*  and its cosmological implications, right?
*  And that would have been a very standard, respectable cosmological career to have.
*  I would have gotten tenure somewhere, no worries, you know, gotten citations, the whole bit.
*  But, you know, I think that there's it's just not very likely that f of r gravity is the
*  correct theory that describes the universe.
*  Number one, it's possible.
*  So it's very worth doing and thinking about, but I wouldn't say it's probable.
*  And, you know, furthermore, I'm just not constructed to, you know, come up with an idea
*  and then devote 20 years to investigating it.
*  That's just not how I work.
*  And again, nothing wrong with people who do work that way.
*  But once I sort of figure out the idea, I want to move on to figure out other ideas.
*  And it's just become harder and harder to figure out interesting ideas along those lines,
*  which has caused me to shift my research direction.
*  Like when I go to talks in the seminar series or the colloquia or whatever that are about
*  someone's model for dark matter or dark energy or inflation or whatever, I just find it,
*  you know, not that compelling because what are the chances that this is the real world,
*  which is ultimately what I care about.
*  And as I say, in the biggest ideas video under those kinds of circumstances, there's different
*  things you can do.
*  And one of the things you can do, which is what I have chosen to do, is sort of take a step
*  backward and look at the underlying foundations of the field you're thinking about.
*  So whether it's the sort of philosophy of quantum mechanics or cosmology or statistical
*  mechanics or general questions about emergence and complexity and things like that,
*  that's what I have decided is a much better place for me to spend my efforts.
*  So like I said, when I go to particle physics seminars, I just it's just not interesting to
*  me personally these days in the way that it used to be.
*  Whereas when I go to foundations of physics talks, you know, we have a I go to several
*  zoom series, let's put it that way about philosophy, physics and foundations of physics.
*  Or when I spend time at Santa Fe and talk to people about complexity and things like that,
*  I have this enormous intellectual excitement, right?
*  And that's what I want to have.
*  That's what you should have as a working scientist.
*  So I've shifted my research interests and it's no longer a good fit.
*  Caltech hired me to do this particular kind of research, and I'm not interested in doing
*  that research anymore.
*  I'm interested in doing other things.
*  And furthermore, like my other than just writing papers, my single most important job
*  at Caltech was advising graduate students, right?
*  Helping people get their PhDs, working with them, collaborating with them, launching them
*  on their careers, you know, something that I care a lot about, take a lot of pride in
*  and so forth.
*  But it got to the point where and I've had amazingly good graduate students at Caltech
*  and zero complaints about that.
*  They've been fantastic.
*  But I got to the point where I thought that I was letting them down and they were slowing
*  me down through neither my fault or their fault.
*  But there's a system that we're all embedded in, right?
*  I mean, the people who were my graduate students entered physics graduate school at Caltech
*  to get a PhD and become theoretical physicists doing particle physics, gravity, cosmology,
*  that kind of thing.
*  And I had lost interest in doing those things to some extent.
*  The kinds of things, the kind of research that I wanted to do would not get these students
*  jobs, right?
*  It would not launch them on a successful scientific career.
*  If my current interests are too idiosyncratic and weird to do that, and it wasn't what they
*  wanted to do anyway, it's not why they came to grad school at Caltech because they were
*  attracted by cosmology and particle physics and field theory.
*  So I needed to sort of, you know, change what I wanted to do to help them out.
*  And yet I wasn't very good at doing that, right?
*  Like you can't really fake that kind of enthusiasm.
*  So I don't think that I gave them the projects to work on that would absolutely maximize
*  their chances of becoming successful physicists.
*  So I thought that, you know, I wasn't a good fit either way.
*  So anyway, long version of saying that I've decided that being a Caltech wasn't a good
*  fit for me.
*  And now we're coming to the punchline here.
*  So I don't need to be a Caltech anymore.
*  And some large factor in not making me need to be a Caltech is you folks, the patrons
*  that are helping out the Mindscape podcast.
*  I can pay my salary through a combination of the podcast, writing books, giving talks,
*  things like that.
*  So I don't need to be at Caltech anymore.
*  It was a good thing to be there when I got intellectual use out of it.
*  But now I'm not doing that either.
*  Right.
*  So now I can do exactly the work I want to do because no one can tell me I don't need
*  to worry about, you know, what the grant people think, what my bosses think or anything like
*  that.
*  I can do exactly the stuff I want to do.
*  And I spend, you know, a day a week doing the podcast and a day or two a week writing
*  books or whatever, giving talks.
*  And the rest of the time I can do my work, my research.
*  And it's a weird thing because, you know, exactly in the the it's in the nature of podcasts
*  and books and talks that those things get a much bigger audience than the work I do
*  writing papers and things like that.
*  But, you know, the papers that I want to write are the most important thing to me.
*  And they do feed into, of course, the podcast and the books and so forth.
*  So it's not they're not completely independent.
*  So now I can do things like, you know, this fall I've been invited to spend a sabbatical
*  at Harvard, talk to people there.
*  Santa Fe Institute reached out and they want me to come spend more time there and talking
*  to those folks.
*  And I can do all this because I'm 100 percent free from any obligation to any other place.
*  Now, I say this with complete knowledge that it might very well be that if I come back
*  to a year from now, I might say, you know, look, I got a job offer that was really good
*  and I took it.
*  So if I get if I if there were an academic job that let me do the work I wanted to do
*  in the way I want to do it, then that would be even better than being a freelancer because
*  then I would be it's all about the thing that you're missing by not having that position
*  is colleagues to talk to.
*  Right. So that's one of the reasons why I'm going to go around visiting places, spend
*  more time at SFI and things like that, hire postdocs and do grant proposals at SFI so
*  that I can keep talking to people who have the same interests as me.
*  But I want to like send out a word of thanks to all of the people supporting on Patreon
*  because you're a big help in this project.
*  And so it's not just the podcast that you're making possible by doing this, not just the
*  AMA.
*  So Duncan, to the answer to your question, what would I do differently?
*  Nothing.
*  What I'm doing now for, you know, maybe the first time in my life is nothing more or less
*  than exactly what I want to do.
*  And hopefully I can keep doing that.
*  All right.
*  Simo Vysanen says, what was your journey into theoretical physics and how have how come you
*  decided to become a physicist and not a mathematician?
*  Yeah, I sometimes get asked this and I don't think I ever give especially helpful answers
*  because I was young and I just stumbled into it.
*  You know, it wasn't some choice and I loved it and decided to do that.
*  And here I am doing it.
*  The difference between physicist and mathematician, again, I was never tempted to be a mathematician
*  at all.
*  I love math.
*  I love certain things that one learns by studying mathematics.
*  But doing math as a career was just never something I took as a serious possibility
*  because I care about the real world.
*  That's ultimately what's driving me is how does the world work?
*  And mathematics sometimes applies to the real world, sometimes doesn't.
*  The, you know, the whole personality difference between physicists and mathematicians is that
*  mathematicians are not content to stop when they're pretty sure something is right.
*  They need to prove it, right?
*  That's not my personality.
*  If I think that something is pretty much right, I want to move on to do something else.
*  So, you know, on Twitter, some friends of mine are discussing the question.
*  Someone raised on Twitter the question, what do we know about the number
*  pi to the power of pi to the power of pi to the power of pi?
*  So this is very more complicated than it sounds like.
*  You can't just plug it into your pocket calculator because the uncertainties when you raise one
*  number to another power and then you do real number arithmetic rather than arbitrary arithmetic
*  or, you know, finite power arithmetic, I should say, the uncertainties build up very, very quickly.
*  And so there's an interesting math question about how well you can approximate such a number.
*  And I just have zero interest in this, like this little puzzle solving.
*  Like, I'm just completely not into these weird math puzzles that people like to set for themselves.
*  If it's not the world, if it's not a step to describing the actual world,
*  it's not for me. Again, let a thousand flowers bloom.
*  I'm very, very happy that there are people out there who do care about these things,
*  but that those people are not me. So that was never a decision I was really faced with.
*  Okay, we have three questions in a row that are on similar.
*  I've sort of tried to group some similar questions together.
*  So here's the first group. Mystery Horse says, do you practice any kind of art or do you know
*  of any other theoretical scientists who do? Tim Ryan says, if you could choose to excel at any
*  art form, what would you choose? And Rocket Rat says, do you have any hidden talents like juggling,
*  making good wookie sounds, blowing bubble gum bubbles, etc.? Well, you know, so the short,
*  to get to what people actually want to know, I'm not good at any other art form. No,
*  I have no talents. But you know, I wish I lived in a world and this is true for art as well as
*  for science. I wish I lived in a world where we didn't try to confine the practice of art
*  to experts. You know, science is a different thing because the practice of science requires
*  a certain amount of expertise. But in art, that you know, that's the difference between doing it
*  and doing it well, right? Like, I don't think that people like me should be up there on stage
*  singing. You don't want to hear me singing on stage. Trust me about that. But I think that
*  people should, you know, play instruments more and they should paint more, especially when we
*  have all these technologies to enable us to do it. You know, I think that the podcast did quite a
*  while ago with Grimes was inspirational in this area. You know, she took a course in a neuroscience
*  class and they were told to, you know, do something about music and she made an album and decided,
*  realized that she could do it with the technology that was available. And that doesn't mean it's
*  easy. It doesn't mean we can all be as good. But we should be able to democratize art a lot more.
*  So as I think I have said before, one of my quarantine projects was learning bass guitar,
*  something I've always wanted to learn to do. And look, there's no question I have no talent for
*  this at all. I cannot keep time. I do not have a good ear. None of the things that would be good.
*  I'm too old to really learn something from scratch. But it's fun. I like it. I do it. And,
*  you know, I enjoy doing it. So that is my attitude towards art forms as scientists.
*  And I should say some other scientists are great at either art or music or whatever.
*  I do also I did go through a phase where I painted acrylics, abstracts. And again,
*  they were not very good, but it was fun to do. And you know, I think that should be an attitude that
*  more people have. Okay, Jim Sicilian says, Does the motion of the earth around the sun, the sun
*  around the Milky Way and the Milky Way itself affect the cosmic microwave background? Does this
*  make the CMB a preferred reference frame for the universe? So yes, it absolutely does. The CMB does
*  have a rest frame as a sort of gas of particles. There is a frame in which the radiation coming
*  from you is on average completely isotropic, same temperature in all directions. If you move with
*  respect to that rest frame, then in one direction, the photons get blue shifted in the opposite
*  direction, they get red shifted. And this gives a dipole pattern of temperature variations on the
*  CMB sky. So it looks hotter in one direction cooler in another direction. And we absolutely
*  observed that that was the first anisotropy of the CB that was observed a long time ago.
*  But we know it's not intrinsic to the early universe. It's something that is just due to
*  our local motion with respect to the CMB. So yes, cosmologists know about this. They take into
*  account they remove it from the maps that they show you usually, although you can find
*  pictures of the cosmic microwave background dipole online if you want, just google those words.
*  Does it make the CMB a preferred reference frame? You know, it's a reference frame.
*  But whether or not it's preferred is a trickier question. What do you mean by preferred? You know,
*  we always leave out some details when we try to translate the ideas of relativity and anything
*  else into ordinary English, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with having a preferred rest frame
*  in special relativity, right? Here in my office, I have a preferred rest rest frame at rest with
*  respect to the tables and chairs that are around me that does not violate the rules of relativity
*  or physics. What the real rules are is that there's no rest frame in the vacuum. There's no rest frame
*  that is intrinsic to the laws of physics themselves. When you have stuff, whether it's a planet or the
*  microwave background or whatever, then of course you can measure your speed with respect to that
*  stuff and call that a rest frame when you're at rest with respect to that stuff. And the CMB lets
*  you do that. James Kittick says, when the super lotto got huge, I used the universe splitter app
*  to generate enough bits of randomly chosen numbers and bought one ticket to each lottery.
*  The me posting this comment didn't win, but do you believe one of me did? It's not that one of you
*  did. Someone did. I do believe that someone did, but they're no longer you, right? This is the lesson
*  of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. All those other branches have different
*  people that descended from the same past you, but now are no longer you. They're different people,
*  just like if you had an identical twin. So, yeah, I think that overall the collection of people who
*  are descended from you lost money, but there should be one out there who won money unless the lottery
*  was rigged, in which case I can't help you there. Okay, another few questions that I've grouped
*  together. Kirk Briggs says, why is temperature not symmetrical? Absolute zero is the minimum and
*  there's no maximum. Could time be similar with a beginning and a no end? Michael Edelman says,
*  at the cost of building particle accelerators, as the cost of building particle accelerators continues
*  to grow, the cost of doing some other kinds of science has decreased. Can you imagine that there
*  might exist a new approach to high energy physics that could be done, if not on a tabletop, at least
*  in a small laboratory? And anonymous says, we think there's plenty of particle physics we're missing
*  because we can't get temperatures high enough. Do we have reasons to rule out there being major
*  particle physics we're missing because we can't get to temperatures low enough? So I hope it's clear
*  why these three are at least somewhat related. Maybe I didn't read them in the best possible order.
*  Look, why is temperature not symmetrical? There's plenty of things that are not symmetrical,
*  the set of all positive numbers is not symmetrical. And temperature is kind of like that. Classically,
*  temperature is just the average kinetic energy in a collection of molecules in thermal equilibrium.
*  So kinetic energy is a non-negative number. If an object has zero velocity, it has zero
*  kinetic energy and the kinetic energy is one half mv squared. So v squared is a positive number.
*  You're never going to get it to be below zero. So that's fine. I mean, there's nothing really to be
*  explained there. Could time be similar? Sure, time can go to minus infinity to plus infinity,
*  or time might go from zero to plus infinity, or time might go from zero to some big number
*  that we don't know about. We don't know anything about what those possibilities, which of those
*  possibilities are really true. Is there something called low temperature particle physics, just like
*  there's high temperature particle physics? You know, probably not, but we don't know for sure,
*  right? We never know these things for sure. These are always our best guesses. But according to the
*  philosophy of effective quantum field theories, quantum field theories that work at one energy
*  scale typically work below that energy scale. It's just part of the structure of quantum field
*  theory, but they might not work at energies above that energy scale. There really is a difference
*  between going down in energy and going up in energy. And I talk about this again in the biggest
*  pictures, biggest ideas in the universe videos. We talk about why that is true in the renormalization
*  video, Ken Wilson's ideas about quantum field theory. So probably not, but you know, you never
*  know. So I think that to get people interested in that, one would have to come up with a particular
*  model in which new phenomena arose at low temperatures, low energies, long wavelengths.
*  And that's hard to do. Maybe gravity has something to do with it. Who knows? But it's not what you
*  would typically expect, which by the way is one of the reasons why it's probably not true that
*  gravity is modified on cosmological scales, right? We have a very good theory of gravity,
*  general relativity that works in the solar system, etc. It would be really weird for that theory to
*  break down on galaxy or universe size scales, but we don't know for sure. So we keep looking.
*  As far as particle physics experiments are concerned, you know, just for the reasons I just gave,
*  the best bet to find new phenomena experimentally in particle physics is to do go to higher energies,
*  smash particles together with more and more momenta. So you can be clever in particular models,
*  like there are particular models for dark matter where if you shine light at a wall, sometimes the
*  light will turn into dark matter and then turn back out. So some of the light will pass through
*  the wall and you can actually use that to test ideas about axions and so forth. But those are
*  very highly model dependent. And again, any one of them is unlikely to be the right answer. Whereas
*  if you just go to high energies and smash particles together, eventually you're guaranteed almost to
*  find something new. So you can try to be more clever about doing particle physics at low energies,
*  but it's just not as guaranteed a payoff as it is by going to higher energies. And furthermore,
*  there are plenty of interesting phenomena that we can imagine that can only be found by going to high
*  energy. It's not that we're just not thinking hard enough. That's where they are and you got to go
*  there to see them. So there is a subversion of your question, which is, can we go to high energy? Can
*  we smash particles together with enormous energies without building giant particle accelerators that
*  are kilometers across and billions of dollars to build? We would all love to be able to do that.
*  And there are people who are thinking about doing it. There's a whole industry of what is called
*  plasma wakefield accelerators, et cetera. So far they don't work. So far it's not been very
*  promising, but that would change everything. If you could really do that, if you could
*  build the equivalent of a large hadron collider in your basement, like Tony Stark somehow is able
*  to do, then it would change the economics of high energy particle physics enormously. No one wants
*  these experiments to cost $10 billion, right? We all want to be able to do them at our own universities,
*  but we need a huge breakthrough in technology to make that happen. And I'm not in a position to
*  tell you whether or not that's a likely breakthrough or not. Eric Klein says, if the mythical machines
*  for going back in time exist and you travel back in time six months, would you appear in the point
*  in space where you were in space currently, but the earth is where it was six months ago, causing
*  you to be floating in space on the other side of the sun? Well, there's a reason why these machines
*  are mythical, right? Typically, the movie version of time travel is wrong in a million different
*  ways. And you're pointing out one of the ways in which it's wrong. It takes you to, typically,
*  the same location in earth, right? Like if you travel back in time in your basement, you end up
*  in the future or the past in your basement. But we know that, in fact, what you're doing is you're
*  traveling to a different location in space time. Why in the world should you still be in your basement?
*  So it depends on what your mythical time machine is. The most real world version would be a wormhole
*  that literally connected two different regions of space time. So then the answer is you climb in
*  your wormhole and you go to wherever the wormhole comes out. And you should be able to predict that
*  ahead of time, I hope. So it's not like you're completely lost, but there's no reason why it has
*  to be the same point in space with respect to the earth that it was when you left. James Kirkland
*  says, I've long been fascinated by electroweak false vacuum decay. I wonder if anyone has done the work
*  to find out what the new stable symmetry breaking would look like. Yeah, no, absolutely. So this idea
*  is we know from in the standard model of particle physics that there is a symmetry group
*  SU2 cross U1 that is broken by the Higgs field down to just a U1 amount of symmetry. And if all those
*  letters and numbers don't mean anything, that's fine. What it means is that there's a certain
*  amount of symmetry in what we call the electroweak theory. And the Higgs field gets a non-zero value
*  in empty space, which breaks that symmetry. And it's very much like, you know, imagine you have a
*  sphere in space and you can rotate it, right? You can rotate it in all different directions,
*  sort of three different directions. There's three different axes around which you can rotate it.
*  But then you put a dot on the sphere and you say, I'm gonna now, well, what you say is what is the
*  symmetry group now that I have a dot on the sphere? If I move the sphere that in a way that moves the
*  dot, that's not a symmetry anymore, right? A symmetry is a transformation that keeps something
*  unaffected. But there is still some symmetry. You can move around the axis defined by the dot,
*  right? You can rotate the sphere in such a way so the dot doesn't move. So there's a little bit of
*  unbroken symmetry in that case. And that's very analogous to what happens in the standard model
*  of particle physics. The Higgs boson picks out a direction in field space and some of it remains
*  invariant and that gives rise to electromagnetism as we know it. The rest remains broken and that
*  gives rise to the weak interactions as we know them. And so it has been hypothesized that this
*  Higgs field in empty space might be not completely stable, that the Higgs field could suddenly jump
*  to a much bigger value at some point in time. That would be electroweak false vacuum decay.
*  And the question is, would the symmetry breaking change? And the answer in the models that I know
*  about is no. So the amount of symmetry breaking would change, but which symmetry was broken would
*  not change. There would still be electromagnetism, there would still be the W and Z bosons. So it
*  would still be SU2 cross U1 breaks down to just U1. You would need a completely different field
*  that is also charged under electromagnetism to get a non-zero expectation value in empty space to
*  also break that U1. So that would be a different kind of thing. Peter Benham says, I was re-watching
*  your Big Ideas videos on fields and was struck by how the infinite number of modes results in an
*  infinite amount of energy and how that sounds a lot like the same problem we had with the ultraviolet
*  catastrophe. So yes and no, I think. Just because two things are infinite doesn't mean they're equal,
*  right? You have to be a little bit careful. So there's quantum field theory and there's quantum
*  gravity, okay? And these are slightly different things. In quantum field theory, there's sort of,
*  things are infinite in at least three different ways. In quantum field theory, you can think of
*  what's going on. There's a field pervading all of space and it's very, very convenient to analyze
*  what's happening to that field in terms of modes, as we call them, which are just sine waves, right?
*  Like plane waves stretching throughout all of space with a fixed wavelength vibrating with some
*  amplitude, okay? And so if you think in terms of those ways, just pick a certain mode and there's
*  three different ways that sort of things can go wrong. Not wrong, but you might get an infinite
*  answer. One way is if the wavelength of the modes you're thinking about is taken to be infinitely
*  long, right? The energy in a mode goes down when the wavelength goes up, especially if the field is
*  massless like the photon or the graviton or whatever. So there are what are called infrared
*  divergences because very, very long wavelength modes of electromagnetism, for example, are easy
*  to make. They cost no energy and that's sort of a calculational problem and people learn to deal
*  with that. There's another infinity that you could get when the modes become very, very short
*  wavelength. This is an ultraviolet infinity, an ultraviolet divergence, and that's what happens
*  in particle physics. Once you turn on interactions, the interactions naively can give you infinite
*  answers. Also, and maybe this is what you're referring to, Peter, when you calculate the
*  vacuum energy, the energy in empty space. If you include the zero point energy, right, the quantum
*  intrinsic energy in all of those modes, you also get an infinite answer to that because of the
*  ultraviolet contributions, okay? So that's the second infinity. There's infrared, ultraviolet.
*  Then there's the third infinity that for any fixed wavelength, you know, don't let the wavelength get
*  really big or really small, just fix the wavelength, but let the amplitude of the wave become really,
*  really big. Then any fixed wavelength mode can have an infinite amount of energy in it and that is a
*  difference between quantum field theory and quantum gravity. In quantum field theory, that's true,
*  but it's just true. You can get an infinite amount of energy, you can get as much energy as you want.
*  In gravity, if you try to put a lot of energy into a small region of space, the whole thing just
*  collapses into a black hole. And this, even before you get onto anything fancy about holography or
*  string theory or whatever, this simple fact that you can't fit an arbitrary amount of energy into
*  a region of space indicates that there is a deep fundamental difference between gravity and quantum
*  field theory. And so you should not be surprised that just trying to quantize general relativity,
*  which is a field theory, doesn't work very well, okay, or other approaches along those lines.
*  Gravity is something very special and it doesn't mean that it's not possible to fit it in to the
*  bigger picture, but we're not going to get there by just building a more clever quantum field
*  theory in some ways. So to your question, you know, there are all these infinities, but they're
*  different infinities, okay? There's different kinds of infinity that come up and you need to just be
*  on your toes when you refer to a problem with infinities in these contexts. Sam Barta says,
*  why do physicists give so much credence and real world significance to determinism given quantum
*  mechanics? Quantum randomness. I think it's a very misleading thing to a general audience. Well,
*  I don't know that physicists do do that. I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. You know,
*  some physicists, well, let's back up. You know, I wrote a whole blog post a while ago,
*  you can look up about determinism and when it appears and when it doesn't.
*  Certainly in quantum mechanics, the predictions we make are not deterministic. Let's put it that
*  way. Whether the fundamental underlying structure is deterministic or not is less clear, but the
*  empirical predictions we make for observable things are not deterministic. So yeah, so in that sense,
*  physics is not deterministic. On the other hand, if you want to play baseball or play soccer or get
*  a rocket to Mars, you don't need to worry about that quantum indeterminism. The relevant physical
*  rules on the relevant scales are pretty darn deterministic, right? So there is to some extent
*  just a question of accuracy, right? You know, there's an extent to which physics is deterministic
*  and that's fine and there's an extent to which it's not. Just, I mean, maybe what you have in
*  mind is some question about free will. Maybe not. I really don't know. But let me say this. Free will
*  has nothing whatsoever at all, even a little bit to do with determinism. In fact, let's say even
*  stronger than that. When people are talking about free will and they start talking about determinism
*  versus indeterminism, you instantly know not to take them seriously. This is not what the issue is.
*  If your question is whether or not there exists what we call libertarian free will, the ability
*  to sort of be a law unto yourself in Immanuel Kant's formulation, the ability to not be governed
*  by the laws of physics, what matters is not whether the laws of physics are deterministic or not. What
*  matters is just that there are laws. The fact that quantum mechanics is indeterministic has
*  absolutely zero to do with free will because it's not your free will making the choice about whether
*  the spin is measured up or down, right? Laws can be random and stochastic or they can be deterministic.
*  The question is whether or not you obey the laws if your question is about libertarian free will. So
*  I'm not sure why, in what context the people you're thinking of are talking about determinism,
*  but I would advocate being careful about that context. Jeff B says, in the Biggest Ideas series,
*  you started explaining why we see discrete particle phenomena despite the world being composed of
*  wavy fields. Is it that the world is wavy but only interacts in small point-like locations or is the
*  particle-like behavior a more elaborate emergent phenomenon from all the waving? I don't think it's
*  either one of those, actually. I did try to explain this both in the Biggest Ideas videos and in the
*  book Something Deeply Hidden, but it's a tricky thing. So I'll try again. Here we go.
*  The simple glib answer is it's exactly like a vibrating string and the harmonics of a
*  vibrating string, right? If you have a string and you tie it down or a rubber band or whatever,
*  you tie it down on both ends, so there's boundary conditions where the string cannot move at the two
*  ends, and you pluck it, then there's a discrete set of vibrational modes that you can get. You can get
*  the fundamental mode and then you can get all the overtones, okay? You can get a wavelength of
*  the whole thing between the two pegs or half that or a quarter that or whatever, okay? That phenomenon
*  is discreteness from continuity, right? The string, if it weren't tied down, there's nothing
*  discrete about the string, you can go wherever it wants or the rubber band or whatever, but it's
*  because you tie it down and you provide boundary conditions that in the presence of those boundary
*  conditions you get a discrete set of phenomena. That phenomenon is why particles arise in quantum
*  mechanics and in quantum field theory. In particular, in the original word quantum came to be because
*  we were seeing discrete packets of energy released by atoms. I'm not going to get the history
*  exactly right here, but you know that electrons can move to higher and lower energy levels in atoms
*  and they emit or absorb photons while doing it, and only certain photons are emitted or absorbed,
*  certain energies of those photons. And the reason why is because there's a discrete set of orbitals
*  that the electrons can be in. If the electron were not in the orbit of an atom, it could have any
*  energy at all, but once it falls into the potential field of the electromagnetic field of the nucleus
*  of the atom, then it has a boundary condition. Namely, its wave function is near the nucleus
*  and goes to zero far away, right? And that boundary condition is enough to say there's a
*  discrete set of possibilities exactly with the vibrating violin string or whatever. In quantum
*  field theory, it's a little bit different, but the concepts are exactly analogous. So in quantum
*  field theory, you do what we did before. You consider a certain wavelength of a mode of a
*  quantum field, and that mode, you know, that wavelength of the field can vibrate up and down,
*  right? Its amplitude goes up and down. And you say, well, I don't see any boundary conditions
*  there. It can vibrate up and down as much as it wants, right? But what you're thinking of,
*  and this is why it's hard to understand, but what you're thinking of is the wave function of that
*  field, okay? So wave functions are not fields. Wave functions are assignments to every configuration
*  of a physical system, a number, a complex number, the amplitude. And you would square that amplitude,
*  find out what is the probability of getting an observational result, seeing the physical system
*  in that configuration. So you say, I have a physical system, which is a wave, and it has an
*  amplitude, and I have a wave function, which says, what is the probability if I were to observe that
*  mode of the field to observe it with a certain amplitude or a different amplitude or a different
*  amplitude, okay? And there is a boundary condition there. You want the amplitude, the wave function
*  for observing the field to have enormously big amplitude, enormously big vibrations,
*  to be zero, to go down to zero, to fade away. You do not want an arbitrarily large amount of energy
*  in your quantum field. Any finite energy configuration will have the feature that
*  the wave function assigns a very low probability to the field vibrating too much.
*  That provides boundary conditions. That says that in the space of all possible
*  vibrational amplitudes that the field can have, the wave function goes to zero as the amplitude
*  gets very, very big. And that, once again, gives you a discrete set of possible vibrational modes.
*  And we interpret those vibrational modes as there's no particles there, there's one particle there,
*  there's two particles there, etc. That's why we get discreteness in the sense of particles in quantum
*  field theory, because of the boundary conditions on the wave function of the quantum fields.
*  So, you know, I've been thinking for years about how to best explain this, and that was it. And
*  it's not very clear. I get that. But I do, you know, having said that, go back to the videos or go
*  back to the book and see if the description there makes any more sense. That's the general idea.
*  Nate Wadupes says, what is it that makes general relativity and quantum mechanics incompatible?
*  I've heard a few times that they are incompatible. I'd love to know more about why.
*  Well, I think that there are two whole big buckets of ideas that go into why general
*  relativity and quantum mechanics seem to be incompatible. I won't say they are incompatible,
*  but the straightforward ideas that we generally have don't quite work. We say there are both
*  technical issues and conceptual issues. Okay. So the technical issues are the following. If you,
*  you know, make your life easy, just say, I'm going to only think about very, very tiny
*  gravitational fields, right, small perturbations, very weak field. So space time is almost flat,
*  but let it vibrate a little bit. Okay. And there you can do quantum gravity perfectly well. That
*  works pretty well as long as you don't push it too hard. If you let those small violations of
*  small vibrations in the gravitational field act as virtual particles, so you put them inside
*  Feynman diagrams, then the rules say that you have to, you have to include contributions from
*  all possible wavelengths of those vibrating gravitational fields all the way down to zero.
*  Maybe you want to cut it off at the plank length, but okay, that's not what the rules say. The rules
*  say you go down to zero and you get the infinities that we were talking about before. And this is a
*  fancy way of saying that quantum gravity is not renormalizable. Okay. So what that means is in
*  practice that there are corrections. You basically start with a classical expectation and then you
*  quantize it. And what you hope is that the quantum corrections to your classical expectations are
*  small and controllable, but in a non-renormalizable theory, they're not, they're big and uncontrollable.
*  So you get infinities everywhere and you don't know what to do and you can cut them off, but you
*  don't know where to cut them off or how to deal with that or anything like that. So at the simple
*  technical level of quantizing gravity and getting a sensible theory, it doesn't work. Okay. You need
*  to think a little bit more cleverly about that. And obviously people have suggested schemes for
*  thinking more cleverly. Conceptually, you know, gravity is different because it's a theory of
*  space-time in a way that other theories are not. All the other theories you have are theories on top
*  of space-time. Okay. So if you think about the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, the SchrÃ¶dinger equation
*  says I have some quantum state. It evolves with time in a way that is determined by what we call
*  the Hamiltonian, which is a fancy way of saying the energy of the quantum state. But you use the
*  rules of general relativity and you just naively plug it in. And unlike every other theory,
*  general relativity is about time and space in a very direct way. And what pops out of the
*  straightforward follow your nose kind of approach is that the wave function of the universe and
*  quantum gravity doesn't evolve with time at all. It's just static. This is what is called the
*  Wheeler-Dewitt equation after John Wheeler and Bryce Dewitt. So what do you do about that? I mean,
*  time seems to be happening all around us. And it seems that this most naive version of quantum
*  gravity says that time doesn't exist. And this is literally what is called the problem of time
*  in quantum gravity. So again, people have solutions to the problem of time, time as emergent or
*  something like that. And that's great. It's not an unsolvable problem, but it is a problem. And so
*  people disagree about what the right solution is. So those two sets of things, both the technical
*  problems that you just get infinite answers and the conceptual problems that certain things that
*  seemed clear and obvious for other quantum mechanical theories aren't quite so clear and
*  obvious for general relativity. Alexander Khabanov says, have you ever had any PhD students who are
*  violently opposed to the many worlds interpretation? So short answer, no, I've never had any PhD
*  students who are violently opposed to anything. I don't think. PhD students aren't that violent,
*  usually. Famous exceptions, of course. But no, but I get the point. So let's interpret this as a
*  broader question. What happens if an advisor to PhD students has certain ideological commitments
*  and the students themselves do not share them? You know, usually this just doesn't happen because
*  why would you choose as your advisor someone who you disagreed with in some very, very profound way,
*  right? That doesn't really fit together. You generally choose someone as your advisor,
*  who you're sympathetic with on the big questions. But yeah, students have minds of their own and
*  opinions of their own. So I don't think I've ever had a PhD student who agreed with me about
*  anything, about everything, anything I said by, that was a Freudian slip. They agree with me
*  on many things. In fact, you know, it's funny, my very first PhD student gave a seminar
*  while he was a graduate student, gave a seminar at a different university. And, you know, he was
*  answering some questions from the audience, from the seminar audience. And at some point,
*  he mentioned that he was working with me. And then one of the audience member goes, Oh, now I
*  understand why you're saying all these things. So there's some, you know, you fit into a tradition
*  that is defined by the work that is being done by your advisor. And also, by the way, you know,
*  most of my research career, I was not thinking about the Everett or many worlds interpretation
*  that much. I was just doing more or less standard cosmology, general relativity,
*  field theory stuff. So the question just didn't arise. Okay, there's two questions that are
*  different, but I'm going to group them together. Patrick Hall says, many of the contemporary
*  debates in theoretical physics are very complicated to lay people such as myself. The only thing us
*  lay people can do is trust the experts, but many of the experts disagree with each other.
*  How should we the lay people go about taking sides on issues within theoretical physics?
*  The other question is from Alexander Cordova, who says, what is your process for obtaining
*  reliable information about politics, social issues, etc. It sometimes feels like a full-time
*  job's worth of work to just stay reasonably informed due to the sheer amount of information
*  that we have access to nowadays and the increasingly polarized political climate we live in. I was
*  wondering if you had any thoughts about this or if you could discuss how you're able to stay informed
*  while also having time for your actual job. So here we have two different sides of a similar
*  question, namely, how does one develop credences or beliefs or opinions in a world where one is not
*  an expert and the experts disagree, right? So this is a question for non-physicists talking to people
*  like me or for people like me thinking about politics or economics or whatever. So I think,
*  obviously, I do think that listening to experts is important. I think that experts generally know
*  things. And if you don't know anything, if you're a true non-expert and there is a consensus among
*  experts that says one thing, then not 100%, but you should put a very high credence on that consensus
*  simply because they're experts, right? I think that's a perfectly fair thing to do. Again,
*  not 100%. And if you have good reasons, if you're not completely uninformed,
*  if you have good reasons to doubt the experts, then do that. But if you don't,
*  if you literally know nothing about a field, then your default should be to give most of your
*  credence to what the consensus of experts is. But of course, both questions here are in the trickier
*  situation where the experts do not have a consensus. Then what do you do? Well, then you have to like
*  keep your words about you a little bit. And I think that there's two things to do. One is
*  to listen to the actual reasoning, right? I mean, I think this is something that can be done even
*  if you're not an expert sometime. So people say two different things in some technical field,
*  and you say, well, why? Why do you believe that? And sometimes, not always, but sometimes it is
*  possible that even if you're not an expert, you can listen to their reasoning and go, oh yeah,
*  that's the kind of reasoning that I'm sympathetic to. Or, oh no, that reasoning sounds like completely
*  backwards to me even though I'm not an expert. So sometimes you're lucky about that. Like if you say,
*  why do you not like the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics? And someone says, well,
*  it bugs me to think that there are other copies of me out there in the multiverse. Or even,
*  or if they say something like, well, it's just not falsifiable because I can't see all those other
*  universes. And maybe you have enough expertise to go, no, I don't really like those kinds of
*  reasoning, so I'm not going to listen to you. Or to be fair, if someone said, I like the many
*  worlds interpretation because it's a very, very simple underlying ontology, even though it predicts
*  lots of universes. And maybe you can personally say, nope, I don't find that kind of reasoning
*  very persuasive myself. So you can try to do that. The other thing, if you're not so lucky as to be
*  able to sort of have a feeling about their process and evidence, even if you don't have a feeling
*  about their conclusion, is listen to how they frame the controversy. So regardless of particular
*  subject matter field, some people are just more trustworthy than others. And it's regardless of
*  expertise also. I mean, there are people who are super duper experts, but not trustworthy,
*  and vice versa. So when you talk to people and they're sort of giving you the sales pitch for
*  believing something, listen to how much do they understand the alternatives to their point of
*  view? Are they simply dismissing those alternatives? Are they being fair? Are they straw manning the
*  alternatives? Are they saying, well, here are the weaknesses in my view, but here's why it's
*  nevertheless okay? Or are they hiding those weaknesses from you, right? There's a bunch of
*  habits, a bunch of traits that you can pick out as trustworthy in different people, even if you are
*  not in possession of the expert knowledge that they have. Neither one of these techniques is 100%
*  reliable. And that's why life is hard. Sorry, can't help you there. Sometimes we have to make leaps
*  into beliefs of some sort or another. All right. Jorge says, what are the main obstacles or
*  difficulties in quantizing gravity? I think I already did that one. I should have grouped that
*  one. Sorry. Good. I do have another group of questions here. Rasmus Case-Nierbeck says,
*  particles have antiparticles, but the force carrying particles are their own antiparticle.
*  I've always struggled to get a mental picture of this. Trilobite Tark says, looking back at your
*  quite enjoyable and helpful summer series, when you talk about fermions and bosons, is it correct
*  or too simplistic to say that since bosons can share locations, that accumulations of bosons can
*  account for forces? And Brian Brunswick says, there's a common illustration of the rarity of
*  weak force interactions that neutrinos would pass, half pass through several light years of lead.
*  But what about the same question for gravitational waves? How much interaction is there with matter?
*  So all of these questions, all these three questions have something to do with
*  the basic question of forces, which is sort of a macroscopic kind of human scale question,
*  versus particles like bosons and fermions, right? And how do you get these macroscopic forces out
*  of individual little particles? So to the middle question, yes, the thing that you and I perceive
*  as a classical force, electromagnetism, gravity, or whatever, in the language of particles is just
*  an accumulation of individual particles on top of each other. And bosons can accumulate and therefore
*  give rise to big classical forces, whereas fermions cannot accumulate. That's why we do not have
*  fermion forces noticeable in the real world. But it's a fuzzy boundary. So sometimes particle
*  physicists will talk about forces from the exchange of fermions. And what they mean is
*  that two particles can interact by exchanging fermions. So for example, two photons can bounce
*  off of each other, can scatter by exchanging electrons and positrons. It's a very weak thing.
*  You need very high energy photons to see it. But in some sense, that's kind of like a force.
*  What it's not is a big macroscopic force that we could notice in the real world. The bosonic nature
*  of photons and gravitons is very important for creating those big macroscopic forces.
*  To the first question, you have been told that particles have their own antiparticles,
*  but you've just been lied to. Some particles have their own antiparticles and some don't.
*  The idea of anti-matter is a convenient kind of classification in some cases, but it's not a
*  fundamental idea. When you have particles that carry some conserved quantity like electric charge,
*  then they will have antiparticles. A charged particle with a positive charge will always
*  have a negatively charged antiparticle. But for particles like photons, they don't have
*  their own antiparticles. Or sometimes you will hear people say they are their own antiparticles.
*  And the same would be true for just a single, you could imagine a single fermion that didn't
*  have its own antiparticle. You're allowed to imagine that possibility, although we just don't
*  know of any in nature that are like that. So when you get into it, when you get into it a
*  little bit more deeply, what matters is what the charges are, what the symmetries are, and what the
*  interactions are between the different particles. This particle and antiparticle classification
*  doesn't always fit reality very well. Sorry about that. Sorry I've been misleading you
*  for all these times. I do it myself. And about the passing through neutrinos or gravitons passing
*  through light years of lead, gravitons, individual gravitons, interact much more weakly than neutrinos
*  do. So if you're literally talking about a collection of gravitons, they would pass right
*  through lead, no worries. The difference is, as we just talked about, gravitons can pile on top
*  of each other. They're bosons, unlike neutrinos, which are fermions. And so gravitons can give rise
*  to big macroscopic classical force fields or classical excitations in the gravitational field.
*  So classical gravitational waves can be thought of as a huge number of gravitons piling on top
*  of each other. So in principle, a gravitational wave passing through matter would be distorted by
*  it. It would lose energy because it would try to squeeze the matter a little bit and pass energy
*  onto it. And indeed, that process is at the heart of how we can detect them. But you need a lot of
*  gravitons pile on top of each other to make that a noticeable thing. If you're talking about individual
*  gravitons versus individual neutrinos, individual gravitons will pass through matter much quickly,
*  much more easily than even neutrinos will. Okay, Josh says, a field like biology can have moral
*  implications. For example, discovering which species feel pain. Do you think that anything
*  we've learned in the field of physics has implications for morality? And there's a related
*  question that I'll ask here. P. Walder says, at this year's Darwin Day lecture, Oliver Scott
*  Curry presented data from twin studies showing that the moral qualities of kinship, mutualism,
*  exchange, heroism, etc. are encoded in our genes. Data was also presented for 60 different cultures
*  showing that the same moral qualities were universal across the cultures. Assuming these
*  data are replicable, should we now consider that ought can be derived from is? So in both cases,
*  let me let me do the second question first. No, this is zero evidence that ought can be derived
*  from is. You literally just mentioned a whole bunch of things that are is is. People behave
*  heroically, people show deference, people feel kinship, right? And these are encoded in our genes.
*  That's an is. That's a fact about the world, okay? There's nothing in our genes or our behavior
*  that lets us then say, oh, and this is how we ought to behave, right? That's the question of morality.
*  If you presuppose that kinship and heroism, etc. are good, are things that we ought to do,
*  then these genetic studies show us that these good behaviors that we ought to have are in our genes,
*  right? And in fact, this is a well-known argument against moral realism, because people say, look,
*  there's something that evolves, right? There's some pressure to reproduce under the rules of
*  natural selection to pass on our genes to future generations. And there is also something that is
*  right and wrong. Why in the world should they match up? Why in the world should they agree?
*  I mean, if you thought that there was some pre-existing objective morality, why should
*  natural selection ever find that when natural selection just wants to make us survive?
*  So the inability to derive ought from is is simply a logical impossibility, right?
*  Ought is a different property than is. It can't be derived from it. So there's no evidence that
*  will ever change my mind. This is, you know, you cannot add two even numbers together and
*  get an odd number no matter how many mathematical experiments you end up doing. So likewise,
*  the previous question, do you think that what we've learned in the field of physics has
*  implications for morality? Here, it depends on what you mean by implications, because you begin
*  the question, Josh begins his question with biology can have moral implications, for example,
*  discovering which species feel pain. Discovering which species feel pain doesn't have implications
*  for metaethics. Metaethics being the job of justifying one's moral principles, right?
*  Pain exists, I feel pain. If I discovered that earthworms felt pain, that would have zero impact
*  on the way that I justify my moral principles. It might have an impact on how I behave if I
*  already had a moral principle that said pain is bad and I should try to minimize it in the world.
*  Okay, so sure, physics can absolutely have implications for how we behave in the world,
*  given what our moral principles are. Physics helps us build bombs, okay? So I should not act
*  in a certain way to build a bomb and drop it on people if I think that's morally wrong.
*  But these discoveries in neither physics nor biology directly affect what I take to be the
*  moral rules that I live my life by. Okay, Hilbert Spaceman says, probably not their given name,
*  suppose we have a two-state quantum system for which the Born Rule predicts equal probability
*  to measure the system in either state. If an experimenter were to get the same measurement
*  a million times in a row, would this be considered an experimental violation of the Born Rule? And if
*  so, how does one experimentally test the Born Rule? You can't violate the Born Rule in quite
*  that clear cut away, right? As I think you probably felt as you were typing this question,
*  if you have a prediction via the Born Rule, the certain system and experiment will give you 50-50
*  answers, spin up and spin down, and you get spin up five times in a row, you go, huh, that's pretty
*  rare. And if you get it 10 times in a row, you're thinking, wow, that's really rare. And if you get
*  it 100 times in a row, it's more rare and a million times is more rare. So it never passes
*  some threshold to go, oh, the Born Rule is wrong. But as a good Bayesian, what you should be doing
*  is saying, well, there's a certain credence I give to the Born Rule being right, there's a certain
*  credence I give to the Born Rule being wrong. And the more data I collect of all these spins being
*  up when the Born Rule predicted that there'll be 50-50, the more I deviate from the prediction of
*  the Born Rule, the lower my credence is that the Born Rule should be accepted, right? That the Born
*  Rule is right. So it's exactly the same as with anything else. Look, if I say I have Newton's
*  inverse square law of gravity here near the earth in the non-relativistic regime, places where it
*  was all Newton's laws of gravity are very, very well tested, right? Could I imagine doing an
*  experiment that seems incompatible with Newtonian gravity? Sure. Maybe I just make a mistake,
*  right? Like maybe my experimental setup isn't very good. So you never just do an experiment,
*  go, oh, I have ruled out my theory. You change your credence in your theory and you change that
*  gradually. This is what a good Bayesian does and it applies just as well to the Born Rule
*  as to anything else. Greg Griffiths says, about your ruminations on the philosophy of mathematics
*  a few months ago, what issues do you personally find most in need of thought in that field? So
*  we will have podcasts coming up about the philosophy of mathematics. Honestly, the most basic dumb
*  questions are the ones that I am struggling with. What is real, right? To what extent do we think
*  of mathematical structures as real like a Platonist would do or a mathematical realist more generally?
*  My inclination is to say that there are senses in which mathematical things are real, but not
*  the same sense in the tables and chairs are real. But honestly, you know, the real philosophers of
*  mathematics, they thought through all this stuff and this is a perfect example of a place where I
*  am not an expert. So I'm trying to listen to them and listening to them is hard because again,
*  they don't agree with each other, right? As we said before, this is me, I'm trying to apply
*  my criteria to the experts. I'm reading the experts and I'm, you know, trying to find the
*  ones that on the one hand, you know, overlap with my beliefs in other areas. On the other hand,
*  seem trustworthy, you know, seem honest about what they're doing and who give reasons that I
*  find compelling. That's what I'm trying to do. Sam says, what are your thoughts on Cornell West's
*  current situation at Harvard? So for those of you who don't know Cornell West, previous podcast guest
*  is a professor at Harvard, but in a special position that is not technically a tenured
*  position at Harvard. He used to be tenured at Harvard. In fact, like a big university
*  professor kind of job. Then he left because he was insulted by Larry Summers, who was the president
*  at the time. He went to Princeton and then he moved back and I have zero knowledge of all the
*  twists and turns in that saga and I have zero knowledge of what Harvard is saying. But it's in
*  the news recently because apparently he wants to be, he wants to have that tenured label attached
*  to his current position and Harvard is reluctant to do it. And so people are, you know, people have
*  their opinions about this. So I don't have opinions about that specific situation. And as
*  a general rule, it's not always true, but as a rough guide, I try not to comment on individual
*  people's employment situations at institutions that I don't know much about because you don't
*  know. I mean, it's the kind of thing you can easily ride that those kinds of controversies
*  for your own political purposes. But in fact, there's usually about a billion factors going
*  into these discussions that you're not aware of because you're not there, right? And not all the
*  facts come to light, not all the parties involved have any interests in sharing all the features
*  that they're talking about. So you don't know and maybe you should just be quiet about it. So
*  I'm going to be quiet about the actual facts of Cornell West's current situation. We can think
*  more broadly about the kind of situation, right, where we can abstract away from his personal
*  situation. You know, what if you have someone like Cornell West, who is clearly very accomplished in
*  their field, has also been extremely active in a more public sphere, right? So I think that it's
*  fair to say that the one of the reasons why there is some resistance to giving tenure to someone like
*  Cornell West these days, even though there wouldn't have been 20 or 30 years ago, is because
*  a lot of his work is sort of more public facing than traditional and scholarly, right? And,
*  you know, referee journals and things like that. So what should the role be of people like that?
*  There's, of course, a whole huge extra set of considerations because Cornell West is
*  a very, very famous African American scholar. And there are black students at Harvard who says like,
*  he's our guy and you will really be treating us badly if you do not try your best to keep him,
*  right? And I take all of those arguments very seriously. I think that's true. I think
*  representation matters. Role models matter, all that stuff. But again, I'm not enough of an expert
*  to opine intelligently on that. So when it comes to, you know, what do you do about people who,
*  I mean, you can probably guess my answer here, right? But what do you do about people who've
*  been doing most of their work in a more public facing way than in the traditional academic
*  channels? You know, I'm in favor of those people. Guess what? You know, I try to do both myself.
*  Not because I think it's the best for my career, but because that's what I enjoy doing. Like,
*  I take real true pleasure in writing papers, technical papers for referee journals in the
*  very standard academic way. But it's not the only thing I take pleasure in doing. I do things like
*  what I'm doing very at this very moment, which is much more public facing. So I'm a big believer in
*  a diverse ecosystem when it comes to this stuff. I think that a good university should not devote
*  all of its faculty positions purely 100% to people whose noses are to the grindstone in the academic
*  treadmill, writing papers for referee journals, etc. That stuff is important, but it's not
*  uniquely important. There are other things that are also important. I mean, say what you will about
*  Cornel West. You cannot accuse him of not working hard. I mean, the man puts in the hours, right?
*  Even if it's kind of adorable, I don't even know if you know, but he doesn't use a laptop.
*  So when we had him on the podcast, he uses an iPad. I don't know, he probably doesn't know how
*  to type, but he must know how to type because he gets a lot of books written. But yeah, he uses an
*  iPad. So we had to figure out what the right microphone and software was to do the podcast.
*  But he was willing to do it. He said, all right, help me figure this out. Very prolific. He has his
*  own podcast. He has done the academic grind kind of work. I'm 100% in favor of people like
*  Cornel West being tenured professors. Again, you wouldn't want every tenured professor to be like
*  that, but you wouldn't want all the tenured professors to be stuck in their offices doing
*  their work for the 12 other people in their field either. You need both. And so, you know,
*  in terms of places like Harvard devoting some tiny fraction of their resources to professors who are
*  hugely influential public figures doing interdisciplinary work, being good role models,
*  stuff like that. Yes, I think that's kind of important. Ashley Hyatt says, can you explain
*  how Hawking radiation causes a black hole to shrink? If only one particle from a pair created
*  near the horizon is emitted as radiation, isn't the other one consumed by the black hole thus
*  increasing its mass? Yes, the other one is consumed by the black hole, but there's a
*  trick of general relativity. So, you know, I don't know where you are in your education, Ashley,
*  but if you ever get to read my graduate textbook on general relativity, Space Time and Geometry,
*  what you will learn is you can define the energy of a particle as seen by different observers.
*  This is a feature of relativity, okay, so that different reference frames, if you want to put it
*  that way, or different observers located different places will define what you mean by the energy of
*  a particle differently. And in particular, when you're close to a black hole in general relativity
*  where space and time are being warped, that difference can be pretty big. So it turns out
*  that if you were at the horizon, if somehow, and this is not actually possible, but if you could
*  imagine seeing these two particles, a particle and an antiparticle being created, one goes out,
*  one goes in, and as you're falling through the horizon, you would see both of them as ordinary
*  positive mass particles. But from the point of view of someone who's very, very far away,
*  they attribute a negative energy, a negative mass effectively, to the particle that falls in.
*  So yes, the black hole, to the point of view, an outside observer, the black hole is absorbing
*  a particle, but it's absorbing a particle with a negative energy. So the total energy of the black
*  hole goes down. And of course, the energy that it's absorbing, the negative energy it's absorbing,
*  is exactly the same in magnitude as the positive energy of the particle that's emitted. So all the
*  math works out. Surprise, surprise. You're probably not surprised. All the math actually does work out.
*  Okay, two questions I'm going to group together. Sandro Stuckey says, could you tell us a little
*  bit about your podcasting setup? What type of hardware and software do you use? You said at
*  some point that you send mics to the guests. Would you mind telling us what type of mic those are?
*  And Steve Lauterbach says, you've mentioned you send a microphone to guests, so share with us the
*  manufacturer and name of that microphone. So yeah, short version here. If you go to the podcast
*  homepage, preposterousuniverse.com slash podcast, one of the, you know, there's all sorts of goodies
*  there. I encourage you to check it out. One of the things on the right-hand column is about Mindscape.
*  You can click there and you can find the complete description of my podcasting setup. I've typed
*  that in and there's also these links to buy it. So my microphone is what is called an Electro
*  Voice RE320. It's a very nice voice microphone. You know, it's not, you know, it's not going to be
*  a good studio microphone for professional musician, but for podcasters, it's just about
*  perfect, I think. And for those, I don't know how up you are on microphone technology, but the big
*  decision to make if you are a potential podcaster and you're looking at microphones is
*  the wiring, believe it or not. I mean, there's other decisions to make because there's like
*  condensers versus dynamic microphones and et cetera, but okay, really the wiring matters because
*  there are USB microphones that you just plug right into your computer. No worries, right?
*  But there's also XLR microphones. So the XLR cable is a different cable. It's not USB, not at all USB.
*  It's a more professional audio quality kind of cable, okay? And so the higher end microphones
*  will tend to be XLR microphones, not USB microphones. Therefore, my microphone is an XLR microphone.
*  I cannot plug it directly into my computer and I knew this going in. It's not a surprise.
*  So what you do is you plug it into a recorder or a mixer, okay? So the standard in the podcast land
*  is something called a Zoom recorder. Nothing to do with Zoom, the online video thing, but there's
*  only so many names you can have for your company. So there's a very nice company that makes small
*  recording devices to which you can plug in XLR microphones. And so it's both like a recorder
*  in and of itself and also an interface for your mic. And then you can attach the Zoom to your
*  computer via USB. I have a slightly higher level thing, which is called a MixPre 3 made by sound
*  devices. And it's a little tiny mixer, okay? So I can plug several microphones in, three, in fact,
*  microphones, and they have their separate volume controls, gain controls. And I can also plug in
*  the computer to the MixPre and I can get an input from there. So usually when I'm actually
*  recording a podcast, I have my microphone plugged into the MixPre 3 being recorded in the left hand
*  channel of the stereo mix. And I have the guest coming into the computer, which is then plugged
*  into the MixPre 3 going into the right hand channel. But I don't actually use that guest
*  audio for the podcast because I record using ZenCaster. And ZenCaster will record the guest
*  locally themselves and then transfer the file to me. So I can download from my MixPre the stereo
*  version of what I've recorded with both my voice and their voice. And then I take from ZenCaster
*  just their voice and I go into this program called Audacity, which is either free or it's anyway,
*  it's public. But it's a four-year computer and you do all the audio mixing from there,
*  noise reduction, compression, all of those things. And so if you listen to the early podcast,
*  I was not very good at that. I'm still not great at it, but I'm better than I was at the beginning.
*  So then I can line up the file that I get from ZenCaster in time. You can shift it right,
*  right and left. So I line up the guest's audio from ZenCaster with the guest's audio that I recorded
*  and then I can delete the guest's audio that I recorded so that the time sync is right,
*  but the audio quality is better because I'm getting it directly from ZenCaster. So the voice
*  that you hear from the guest in my podcast did not come over the internet before it was recorded.
*  It was recorded directly there at their house. So I'm not going to, I mean, this stuff is too
*  expensive. I'm not going to mail it all to them. What I generally mail to the guests is a Blue Yeti
*  USB microphone. So you don't want the guest to do too much work. The Blue Yeti is a very,
*  very standard microphone. It costs about a hundred bucks. They went through a period when we first
*  entered quarantine, they became very expensive because everyone was starting a podcast because
*  what else are you going to do? But a Blue Yeti is a wonderful microphone. It is the standard for
*  very good reasons. It's plug and play, plug into your computer and push the button and there it
*  goes. And it records quite well. Not as well as my RE320 or my Mixpre3. They're recording from a
*  Blue Yeti directly into their computer. So inevitably my video, my audio sounds a little
*  bit better. Okay. But so be it. And then what was I going to say? Yeah. So then I think that
*  if you're a starting out podcaster, you could just start with the Blue Yeti yourself. Oh,
*  I remember what I want to say. Thank you. Thank you once again to all the Patreon folks out there
*  because you, you know, and of course also the ads that appear on the non-Patreon version of the
*  podcast, but it's your contributions that let me buy microphones and send them. Like the guests
*  are always very, very happy that they get a microphone for free for appearing on the podcast
*  because I, you know, I don't ask them to send it back. I try to minimize work for my guests,
*  right? So it's a gift. Keep the microphone, use it for the next podcast you want to be on. So
*  gradually I am improving the sound quality of everyone's podcasts. I should give credit also
*  to Sam Harris, who actually gave me the idea for sending microphones to people, but you folks,
*  the Patreon supporters are paying for it in some very real sense. You're paying for that. You're
*  paying for the transcripts of every episode. All this stuff costs money. And I do it because
*  there are people who care enough about the podcast to give me money to do it. So I want to make the
*  quality as high as I can for all of you folks. So thank you. Another podcast question comes from
*  Matthew O'Connor. What is your process with a typical guest before recording starts? Do you
*  do a warmup call? Do you go in cold? Do you send them an outline of points you'd like to hit?
*  Don't do many of these things at all. No, I think that I try to get people,
*  high quality people as guests on the podcast. They're usually very busy. I try to make their
*  burden minimal. I try to do very little to ask them to do things other than the actual interview.
*  I do let them suggest things to talk about if they have, you know, there's some subset of all
*  the things that they've done in their life that they're very interested in talking about right
*  now, then I'm very happy to take those suggestions. But there's no warmup call. There's no outline or
*  anything like that. You know, I am trying to get better at being the interviewer on the podcast. I
*  probably over prepared when I first started, you know, had a whole list of questions planned out.
*  And I think that to make it more of an organic conversation, these days, I try to go in with,
*  you know, a couple two, three, four main points I want to hit, maybe a little, a couple of things
*  that I've read or heard in their stuff that is sufficiently fun anecdote that I want to bring up.
*  But otherwise, try to let the conversation be the conversation. I'm still not as good at that
*  as I would like to be. But that is definitely the goal. And like I said, the guests are busy
*  people and I want to make their burden as light as possible. In my view, the guests are being
*  incredibly generous by offering their time to be on the podcast. So I don't want them to do any work
*  to do it. Peter Bamber says, if a proton is made of quarks, which themselves are disturbances in
*  quantum fields, what does it mean to refer to the diameter of a proton? Well, it is a necessarily
*  fuzzy concept, the diameter of a proton, you know, these fields have profiles, roughly speaking,
*  that's a slightly overly classical notion, but maybe you know what I mean. And it's sort of like
*  saying what is the width of a bell curve distribution, right, the bell curve, Gaussian
*  distribution never hits zero, no matter how far you go away from it. But you can talk about the
*  width at half of its size, right, half of its amplitude. So there's other ways of talking about
*  sizes of things that don't really have any well defined boundary. That's what it is for the proton,
*  you know, where do the fields fall off sufficiently far that you wouldn't say that you were in the
*  proton anymore, something like that. Samuel Benjamin says, are you aware of any evidence
*  that as humans, we try to fix the world around us into a highly organized lower entropy state,
*  because we like to make order from the chaos. I'm thinking specifically about efforts being
*  put into highly coordinated and interconnected smart energy networks across the UK. These are
*  super complex to design, no one really has an effective way of doing it. Wouldn't we be better
*  off having more localized energy networks that are far less effort to design, i.e. higher entropy?
*  I think that you're onto something here, but I'm not sure if I would use exactly that terminology
*  or necessarily that motivation. I don't think that human beings are trying to just be as organized
*  as possible. What I think is that human beings, you know, when human beings design things, it is
*  an example of intelligent design. It is different than things growing up organically. And I think
*  that the real issue with things like that is not that they're too complicated or too simple or too
*  global or too local. It's that when we design things, there's a whole bunch of factors that go
*  in, one of which is ease of being comprehended by us, right? We need to be able to look at it and fix
*  it. And another thing that goes in is we can imagine a certain set of circumstances that would
*  qualify as disasters, right? As bad as failure modes for the system we're looking at. And we're
*  less imaginative in some sense than nature is. So since nature does not design for specific purposes,
*  we end up with organisms that are just more multipurpose and in a sense much more flexible,
*  much more able to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. But I don't think that it's
*  necessarily the right thing to say, well, we need more localized energy networks. I think that it
*  would be nice to have more robust energy networks and grids and things like that. But that might end
*  up being higher entropy or low entropy. I'm not quite sure what. I think that that is not necessarily,
*  as far as I know, the right criterion to have in mind in a case like this.
*  Victor Alejandro Winer says, I grew up in the 60s in Argentina in a family of writers, painters,
*  and actors. As a child and then as a young man, I had the strong feeling that if you were a fan
*  of the sciences, there was nothing for you in the arts and vice versa. Later, I saw this attitude ease,
*  thanks in no small part to the Hofstadter's, Sagan's, and so on. Does this fit with your
*  personal experience at all? Did you ever feel that you needed to choose? No, I don't. Actually,
*  I don't really think so. I never, you know, look, I did not grow up in a family of either scientists
*  or artists and writers. I grew up, you know, in people who were working as secretaries and sales
*  people and steelworkers and so forth. So there was no science versus arts dialogue going on in the
*  house that I was growing up in. And honestly, I never, I mean, I know what you're referring to.
*  I get it. I have seen it later in life, but I never worried about that. I never thought that,
*  oh, I need to be either artsy or sciency or something like that. That wasn't a bifurcation
*  that I was aware of at the time in order to fret about. Steve Pelling says, according to PBS
*  Space Time, gravity is due to the local time slowing effect due to the effect of mass on
*  space time. This is mind blowing. Can you discuss this and how it explains the gravity acceleration
*  equivalence principle? I'm probably not going to exactly explain what you want me to explain.
*  Let me say a few words about this. For one thing, there is no local time slowing effect, as I said
*  right at the beginning of the podcast, that is not the way to think about it. What there is in
*  general relativity is a metric on space time, which is a way of relating different curves in
*  space time, which could either be literally a curve through space that you draw on the ground
*  or a curve through time, like the trajectory of a particle or something like that. And the metric
*  tells you the length of these curves. If the curves extend mostly through space, it will tell
*  you the spatial length. If the curves extend mostly through time, it will tell you the time elapsed
*  on such a curve. And this thing that you're calling, that probably PBS Space Time also called
*  the local time slowing effect, is exactly a comparison that you shouldn't be doing between
*  a clock that is in deep in a gravitational field and a clock that is far away. It's not a comparison
*  you should make because time is measured locally and you should only compare elapsed time along
*  trajectories that start and end at the same events. But I know what you mean. There is a
*  metric on space time that has a form that depends on the distance that you are away from some
*  gravitating object. And furthermore, the way that the actual metric of space time works in
*  general relativity, there's sort of two factors that come in. There's a factor that multiplies
*  the time coordinate and there's a factor that multiplies the spatial coordinates.
*  And here's what they're getting at. Here's the actual thing that they're trying to say.
*  You might think that gravity, if you ever think about all those pictures of general
*  relativity with like a rubber sheet with a bowling ball or whatever, right, bending space around it,
*  you might think that the gravitational field that we feel is mostly due to this stretching of space,
*  not the stretching of time. Time isn't being bent in these rubber sheet examples, right?
*  But that's not true. The reality is that if you think about your trajectory through space time,
*  you're traveling much slower than the speed of light, right? So in some very real quantifiable
*  sense, you're traveling more through time than through space. You're not moving that fast through
*  space and you're moving one second per second through time. So it turns out that it's the
*  warping of the time component in the metric that is actually more responsible for gravity
*  in the Newtonian limit, the inverse square law of gravity. The fact that apples fall from trees,
*  the fact that you do not float away from the earth, this is mostly because of the warping of that time
*  coordinate, that time like direction. Now, I would be reluctant to allow you to sort of extend this
*  in any simple minded way to how you experience time or acceleration or the equivalence principle
*  or any of those other things. It is just a true fact about the Newtonian limit of general
*  relativity and the fact that you're moving slowly compared to the speed of light, you feel the
*  warping of time more than the warping of space. That's really all it is. It's not even that
*  important. I wouldn't make too big a deal of it. John Lounsbury says, as quantum computers move
*  from theoretical to practical applications, can you envision any ways in which their computations
*  could actually help solve other quantum mysteries? Yeah, sure. It's definitely possible to imagine
*  them. Indeed, that was the big motivation that Richard Feynman had when he was one of the first
*  people to discuss quantum computers. And basically, if you want to simulate a quantum mechanical
*  system, what better place to do it than in another quantum mechanical system? You don't have to do it.
*  We can simulate the wave function, the Schrodinger equation on classical computers,
*  but quantum computers are sort of tailor-made for that kind of thing. So whether it's things like
*  chemistry or down at the single molecule level, how do different molecules come together to do
*  chemical reactions, or quantum field theory, my Caltech colleague John Preskill and his friends
*  have done a lot of work on simulating quantum field theories with quantum computers. I'm not an
*  expert on any of those things, but if you want to know whether quantum computers will be used
*  to solve quantum problems, the answer is yes. You say quantum mysteries, the mysteries in quantum
*  mechanics are more like the foundational questions, right? The measurement problem,
*  the reality problem. I don't think that quantum computers are going to say anything about those
*  things, but they will help us do practical calculations. Daniele Cortese says, what do
*  you think about Penrose's argument that consciousness is not a computation? Well,
*  I do not agree with it. I mean, I get it. I get where it's coming from. There is this argument
*  from GÃ¶del's theorem, essentially, or even, I guess, from Turing, that there's some things
*  that computations can't do, right? There's some things that you can't reach axiomatically on the
*  basis of some axioms and then do computations on the axioms to prove theorems. There are conclusions
*  you can't reach in that axiomatic way according to what we know about logic and mathematics,
*  whereas it seems that human beings can reach conclusions. So, you know, GÃ¶del's theorem
*  says if you have a sufficiently powerful formal system, then there are statements in that formal
*  system that cannot be proven if the system is consistent. So either the system is inconsistent
*  and you can end up proving it, or the system is consistent and you can't prove it, in which case,
*  maybe it's true, but you can't prove it, and you get into sort of philosophy of math questions very,
*  very quickly. Whereas Penrose and others would say, look, I can see that statement. I can just
*  look at it and I know it's true, even though the formal system and therefore a computer can't prove
*  it. Well, the question is, and Scott Aronson, who previously appeared on the podcast, is the one who
*  basically taught me this, you know, how do you know that that formal system is consistent? Right?
*  We think it's consistent, but do you know, like, how do you prove that? Have you proven it?
*  And a computer, you could just say, well, you know, let's assume it's consistent and see what
*  we get out of that, right? I think that the human brain is physical, right? I think that
*  we are sloppy thinkers, our human brains, and we can often attribute certainty to some of our
*  thoughts that are in fact don't deserve to have certainty attributed to them, and therefore it can
*  lead us to believe that we've quote unquote reached conclusions that a rigorous algorithmic
*  computer wouldn't, but I think that's just giving us too much credit, honestly. Horst Worst says,
*  what is your opinion on black heterodox public intellectuals like John McWhorter or Coleman
*  Hughes? Do you share their concerns regarding critical race theory or identity politics?
*  No, I don't generally share their concerns. Also, I should say I don't have great familiarity with
*  either one of them. I know who they are. I was on Coleman Hughes' podcast, but I don't know their
*  work in any detail. I am a big believer in the existence of heterodox public intellectuals
*  in a very similar vein to what I just said about people like Cornell West. I do think that there's,
*  you know, there's usefulness in pluralism and variety in intellectual life. We talked about
*  this on the podcast with Musa Al-Gabri. You know, it's just good to have a whole bunch of different
*  ideas out there, so I'm all in favor of people like John McWhorter and Coleman Hughes existing.
*  Having said that, let me say two other things. One is, you know, there's an obvious bias
*  at work here that people can fall into if you're not black, if you're a white person,
*  and you kind of are rubbed the wrong way by black people going around saying, you know,
*  we've been oppressed, we've been discriminated against, there's a legacy of slavery, there still
*  exists biases and discrimination. A lot of white people are defensive about that. And so when they
*  can find a black person who says, oh, no, no, no, it's more black people's fault than white
*  people's fault, which is, I know a dramatic oversimplification, but for this thought
*  experiment, there's a huge bias that you can fall into in saying, ah, you're a good black person,
*  you're saying what I want to hear, let me talk to you and elevate your opinions. This is not a
*  criticism of the opinions themselves. This is a criticism of who's listening to the opinions and
*  who is giving them voice, etc. You know, and again, not to say that these opinions are the
*  wrong ones, but you should be very, very wary about your own vices, right, your own biases,
*  your own ability to want to hear certain things, and to agree when the people you're talking to
*  say the things you want to hear. I think that it's more important to be confronting and to be facing
*  the opinions you don't want to hear, right? So I think that it's important that we have heterodox
*  black public intellectuals, but also it's super important, arguably more important, that we take
*  seriously what the more orthodox black public intellectuals are saying that we don't want to
*  hear if we, we in the sense of white people, who might be might take some of what they say as
*  criticism, right? That's what we have to face up to. The other thing is, you know, I have a
*  complicated relationship with the word heterodox, you know, because I do believe in pluralism,
*  and I do believe that there's a lot of questions to which we don't know the right answer. Some
*  amount of heterodoxy, I think, is important, heterodoxy being not being orthodox, right,
*  you know, going against the tide. But I believe that because I believe in pluralism, not because
*  I believe that heterodoxy by itself is a virtue. You know, there's a very thin line between saying,
*  you know, I'm heterodox, I don't fall into the establishment, man, and just being a crackpot,
*  right, or just valorizing heterodoxy, like, you know, the Heterodox Academy is a whole thing. And
*  I would never want to belong to something called the Heterodox Academy, because I don't value being
*  heterodox. I value being correct. And I worry that there's a whole, again, a temptation, a bias,
*  whatever you want to call it, to valorize being anti establishment for the sake of being anti
*  establishment, not for the sake of being correct. Sometimes you got to be anti establishment because
*  you think it's correct. That I'm all in favor of. But as soon as you sort of start taking pleasure
*  in being naughty and contrarian just for the sake of being naughty and contrarian, that's equally
*  bad of a vice or a bias or a mistake, as it would be to just always go along with the orthodoxy,
*  right? That's why intellectual life is hard, because there's a balance you have to be able
*  to strike between listening to experts, knowing what the orthodoxy is, trying to understand what
*  they're saying, and also be willing to be heterodox and anti establishment when you think it's the
*  right thing to do. Okay, that's a really, really difficult balance to get right. I struggle with
*  it, everyone struggles with it. So I'm all in favor of the existence of black heterodox public
*  intellectuals, along with the orthodox ones. And we all white, black, yellow, purple, whatever,
*  have the difficult task ahead of us of listening to all of them, and listening to them for the value
*  in what they're saying, not because they happen to be saying what we do or do not want to hear.
*  Johnny says Frank Wilczek spoke recently with Sam Harris and said something to the effect of,
*  it is enough to make the calculations in quantum physics and the interpretation of what is happening
*  is basically semantics. Is this actually the prominent view in the field? It's certainly a
*  prominent view. I mean, a lot of people think that I mean, maybe probably, you might be right. I'm not
*  new, but the question might be, the answer might be yes. That is the most prominent view in the
*  field always depends on how you define the field, right? It's obviously not the prominent view among
*  people who specialize in foundations of quantum mechanics. But then there's obviously also a huge
*  selection effect. Like if you thought that was the right view, you would not specialize in the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics. It's like most philosophers are atheists, but most philosophers
*  of religion are not, right? Okay, that's the least surprising thing in the world. If you're an atheist,
*  probably not going to specialize in philosophy of religion. If you think that the interpretation
*  is basically semantics, you're not going to specialize in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  I disagree, obviously. I have thought about this carefully, I think, and other people
*  also thought about it carefully. And I completely wildly, dramatically disagree that the
*  interpretation is just semantics. There are physical questions. Is the wave function a
*  representation of reality? Or is it just a represent a calculational tool that we use to make
*  predictions? That's a question. I can't even imagine thinking that the question is somehow
*  basically semantics. It's a question about the fundamental nature of reality. Are there hidden
*  variables? Are there objective wave function collapses? Are there branches into other
*  universes? These are all direct physical real questions that are certainly not semantics.
*  And I know perfectly well that Frank and others have these points of view. And so I had them on
*  the podcast and we didn't talk about that. And I don't want to talk about that stuff with Frank
*  Wilczek because Frank Wilczek has made enormously big contributions in a bunch of really creative
*  ways to all sorts of interesting questions in fundamental physics. I want to talk about that
*  with him. I do not consider, I know this wasn't your question, Johnny, but let me just say it
*  anyway. I mean, again, part of why I'm picking certain questions to answer here is because they
*  spark in me other things I want to say. So I don't bring people on the podcast to debate them.
*  I certainly do not bring people on the podcast to ride my hobby horses and confront them with my
*  opinions about things about which we might disagree. When I bring people on the podcast,
*  I want them to look good. I want the people who are listening to the podcast to say,
*  oh yes, I see why this person is an interesting person to listen to. Whether or not I agree with
*  them. I'm very happy to bring people I disagree on the podcast, but I want to disagree with them in
*  a way that is potentially profitable, potentially constructive, that I can learn something from them,
*  even if I disagree with them. And mostly they're there on the podcast to say their spiel,
*  not to listen to me. The total number of words I've said on the podcast over 130 some episodes
*  is way bigger than any of the guests. So I don't need to spend the whole time talking to Frank
*  Wilczek, riding my hobby horses about the foundations of quantum mechanics. I would
*  much rather learn from him about particle physics and his views of fundamental physics. Today,
*  just in case you were wondering why I did not give him a hard time about the foundations of
*  quantum theory. Okay, so I have another group of three questions. Yes. Anders says in your
*  interview with Brian Green, he mentioned that some people suspect that string theory might not allow
*  for a positive cosmological constant after all. Let's say that that's definitely true. Would you
*  say what is more probable? A, string theory is wrong, or B, the cause of the universe's acceleration
*  is not a cosmological constant. So that's one question. Daniel Westwater says I was wondering
*  why dark energy is known to be the cause of the expansion of the universe, increasing the speed
*  of galaxies moving apart, but seems like it's only an empty space. Why don't we see dark energy
*  in effects in galaxies themselves? And the third question is you often mention, sorry, from David
*  de Kloet, you often mentioned that the cosmological constant is the best candidate for what the dark
*  energy is. I can see how a constant in a formula can describe what dark energy does, but how does
*  that explain anything? How can it be dark energy? So yeah, let's go, I should have ordered these
*  better once again. Let's do the last one first here. The cosmological constant, that's a label,
*  right? Okay. So yes, it is true that I have said, and I continue to believe that the cosmological
*  constant is the best candidate for what dark energy is. But the phrase cosmological constant
*  is a label for what is alternatively known as the vacuum energy. It's the energy inherent in empty
*  space itself. It's a thing. It's not just a number in a formula. It's a real thing. It's the energy
*  of empty space in every cubic centimeter of space. If there's no stuff there, no particles, no radiation
*  or whatever, you can still ask how much energy it has. That's a fact about empty space itself.
*  And that fact is the vacuum energy, aka the cosmological constant. That's how it can be
*  dark energy. It's just an inherent property of space time itself. For the effect on galaxies
*  themselves question from Daniel, well, there is an effect. So if you have the cosmological constant
*  in particular, but also if you have other forms of dark energy, in principle, that affects the
*  motions of the planets around the sun. It affects the motion of the stars in the galaxy. But in
*  practice, when you calculate the numbers, the effects are really, really, really small. Why?
*  Because the amount of dark energy is really, really, really small. The difference between it
*  and other things is that it accumulates in effect because it's everywhere. It's literally in every
*  cubic centimeter. Okay. So to see the effects of dark energy, you need to let that effect build up,
*  which means that it's easiest to see when you look at galaxies very, very far away. So you're really
*  seeing the whole expansion rate of the universe here in the solar system. In principle, the
*  procession of mercury is affected by the value of the cosmological constant. But the precision to
*  which we can measure that is nowhere anywhere close to what it would need to be to detect the
*  effect of the cosmological constant. Finally, in reverse order here for Anders's question.
*  So it is possible, although people don't really have an agreement on this, this is another place
*  on which experts disagree. Is string theory compatible with a positive cosmological constant?
*  I think it'd be a very good question. I'm only two cheers for string theory, not three cheers kind of
*  person. I will continue to say until I no longer believe it that string theory is the most promising
*  approach that we have on the market now to a quantum theory of gravity. But it doesn't mean
*  it's right. None of the approaches are, you know, home runs quite at this point in time. So string
*  theory could easily be wrong. If the cause of the universe's acceleration is not a cosmological
*  constant, that also leads to other problems. It leads to problems with fifth forces and constants
*  of nature changing and other new fine tunings and so forth. So neither one of these options would be
*  plausible. Sorry, not plausible. Neither one of these options would be, you know,
*  easily embraced by someone like me. But that's okay. You know, you got it. Sometimes you're forced
*  to take action. So I think I can't quite answer the question definitively. If the cosmological
*  constant were positive and sorry, if string theory were incompatible with the cosmological constant,
*  would I first give up on string theory or that the acceleration of the universe is a cosmological
*  constant? I think I would decrease my credence in both of those by a certain amount and wait for
*  more evidence to come in to decide between them. Angela Howard says, if the wave function represents
*  reality and we're living in a particular branch, why do we see a wave pattern in the unmeasured
*  double slit experiment? Are we seeing part of the wave function of the universe? Well, in my way of
*  saying it, so I need to confess different fans of the Everett interpretation will answer this
*  question differently. You know, famously, I think David Deutsch, if I get his view correctly, talks
*  about the two different slits that the electron can go through as being two different branches
*  of the wave function of the universe. I do not think that way at all. In my way of thinking,
*  branches happen when quantum mechanical systems decohere, that is to say when they become
*  entangled with their environment. So in my way of talking, your question is easily answered.
*  The electron going through two different slits is still one branch of the wave function. Okay,
*  it's doing two different things because its wave function is spread out, but its wave function is
*  not entangled with anything else. That's why you can still see the interference pattern. It's not
*  two different branches. And honestly, I'm not sure how you can consistently hold the other point of
*  view. I mean, if you think about a spin instead of an electron, think about a, rather than instead
*  of the position of the electron, think of it spin. So we know that if you measure the electron,
*  it's spin in a plus z axis, okay, then you will always get either spin up or spin down. Those are
*  the only two choices. Likewise, if you measure it along a plus x axis or a plus y axis, you will
*  always get either spin up or spin down along those individual axes. So let's say you have an electron
*  that you've just measured, you know it is spin up along the x axis. Okay, so you know what the
*  spin state is of the electron. It's up along the x axis. But if you can express that in the z axis
*  basis, and an electron that is pointing along the x axis is exactly the same as an electron that is
*  half pointing up along the z axis and half pointing down along the z axis. So with respect to the x
*  axis, it's a single thing. It's just pointing in the plus direction. With respect to the z axis,
*  it's a combination of two things. One spin up and one spin down. So is that one branch or two?
*  I think the answer is it's one branch in either case because as long as it's not entangled with
*  the rest of the world, it's still one branch. Anonymous says, could the expansion of space ever
*  move the Earth and Sun so far apart that we all freeze or does the local gravitational traction
*  of the Earth and the Sun keep us safe? It's the latter. I probably should have grouped this with
*  the previous question, but the Earth and the Sun are not moving apart because of the expansion of
*  space. Here's something you can think about. If you had a universe that was completely uniform,
*  right? The matter particles, and let's say that they're super duper cold dark matter particles.
*  So they're literally zero velocity with respect to each other. Just a lattice of particles sitting
*  there in a universe that is expanding, perfectly smoothly distributed. So you know exactly what
*  the solution is, an exact solution to Einstein's equation with an expanding universe. What you can
*  do is you can take some sphere, imagine some sphere that you invent with particles inside and
*  particles outside, and you can take all the particles inside and collapse them to the middle
*  so that you now have the same number of particles you had before, but instead of being uniformly
*  spread, they're all collapsed. Let's say a black hole or a planet or something or a star
*  inside this sphere, and there's a sharp boundary where you're vacuum inside except for the planet
*  or star or black hole or whatever, and outside there's this uniform gas of particles. So it
*  turns out that this is another situation that in general relativity you can solve exactly.
*  There's actually not that many solutions in general relativity that are exact. There's a lot of
*  approximate solutions, but this is what is called a vacuole model where you take a uniform collection
*  of dust, but you take some sphere and collapse all the particles to the middle. So we know exactly
*  what the metric of space-time is inside that hole, right? You have a hole in space with all
*  the matter in the middle rather than being uniformly spread, and we know exactly how
*  much expansion of the universe there is inside that hole, and the answer is zero. There is no
*  expansion of space whatsoever inside that hole, even though the whole rest of the universe is
*  expanding, okay? So as long as the expansion of the universe is spherically symmetric around us,
*  it's exactly analogous to a question of what if you have a spherical shell of metal that you put
*  an electric charge on, right? So from outside it looks like a ball that is electrically charged,
*  and there's a charge, but what's inside? What is the electric field inside? And the answer is zero.
*  As long as it's spherically symmetric, there's literally zero field inside. Likewise for the
*  solar system. As long as the universe around us is expanding spherically symmetrically around us,
*  there is literally no effect on what goes on here in the solar system.
*  Okay, here are three questions that I'm grouping together, and it's a little bit complicated, so
*  bear with me. They're long questions. James says, I haven't quite wrapped my mind around the need
*  for a past hypothesis to explain the arrow of time. If I zoom out and look at the model of the
*  universe as a whole, it seems that simply having a boundary condition at the Big Bang, along with
*  the second law, is sufficient to result in a model of the universe where entropy increases
*  when moving away from that boundary condition, and the entropy will be low by definition at
*  that boundary. Am I thinking about this wrong? Matt, Matt, Matt, three Matt's in a row is the
*  person's name. I have a question about your thoughts on time direction and Landauer's principle.
*  Landauer's principle, by the way, parenthetically, is what attributes a growth of entropy when you
*  erase some bit of information in a thermal bath. So the question continues, supposing that the
*  erasure of a memory increases the entropy of the relevant system, what does this mean when we choose
*  to describe things in the opposite direction of time? Surely we say that towards the past,
*  memories are erased, but that there is not an accompanying increase in entropy. Should we say
*  that Landauer's principle only applies to the future? And finally, Nick Shorten says, I've heard
*  physicists talk about the time reversibility of the laws of physics and the linking of the arrow
*  time with entropy in many worlds where the Schrodinger equation is presumably time reversible.
*  The splitting seems to only go one way. Is this related to entropy or an unrelated separate arrow
*  of time? Good. So all these three questions relate to the idea that the second law of thermodynamics
*  that says that entropy increases with time is explained by this combination of two things.
*  One thing is the definition of entropy, which says that high entropy states are associated with
*  macroscopic configurations that have many, many microscopic configurations associated with them.
*  The entropy is the number of the logarithm, I should say, of the number of microscopic
*  configurations that look macroscopically the same. That's thing number one. And thing number
*  two is there's a boundary condition. So if you start the system in a low entropy state in that
*  case, there are just more ways to be high entropy than low entropy. So if you let it go, almost all,
*  or at least the vast majority of trajectories will increase in entropy over time. So that second
*  condition, that there is a boundary condition with low entropy, is called the past hypothesis.
*  And so James is saying, so James, I'll confess, I don't quite exactly understand your question.
*  What you've described is exactly what people say. That there is a boundary condition at one end of
*  time, and that's the boundary condition says that entropy is low there. And we define that
*  direction of time to be the past. And that's why we call it the past hypothesis. So that is exactly
*  what we do. And you're saying you don't understand why, but you just described exactly what is the
*  correct thing to do. So I think you're thinking about it right. I'm not quite sure why you are,
*  why you think you're disagreeing with the usual way of stating it. There's no pre-existing
*  definition of past and future. There is the direction of lower entropy and the direction
*  of higher entropy. And we label the direction of lower entropy to be the past. And to Nick's
*  question, yes, this is exactly the same thing going on with the Schrodinger equation and branching in
*  many worlds. The fact that there were fewer branches in the past and the number of branches
*  increases toward the future is exactly because of a low entropy boundary condition in the past.
*  Now that's not to be too glib about it. There's still issues to make that exactly rigorously
*  defined, etc. What do you mean by low entropy, etc.? Do you have a pre-existing division of the
*  world into environment and system and stuff like that? But basically it's the same kind of thing.
*  It's a cosmological boundary condition that gives us the apparent asymmetry, time asymmetry,
*  of branching from an underlying equation which is perfectly symmetric. Then the Landauer's principal
*  question. I think that you're cheating a little bit. I need to actually, I haven't thought about
*  this one very deeply, so I might be getting the wrong impression here. I think you're cheating
*  when you say, surely we say that toward the past memories are erased. I think there's a difference
*  between being erased and not yet having been created, right? I mean it's true as we go into
*  the past there are fewer memories because there's not as much past to remember in some sense. But
*  if you actually take, consider a memory. The memory for those of you who don't listen to this
*  kind of thing all the time, a memory in this case is just some physical artifact, some feature of
*  the present state of the world to which we can attach a correlation with some event in the past.
*  Okay, so it's not just necessarily memory in your brain, any record, any photograph, any document
*  that says something about the past. One of my favorite examples is a footprint on the beach.
*  Okay, if you come across a footprint on a beach you will be quite right in saying, I bet there
*  used to be a foot that landed there. I bet that this is a record of the passage of someone who
*  left a footprint. You might not be right. There's a possibility that the random motion of the ocean
*  and the sand and so forth left a footprint there. But given the evolution of entropy in the universe
*  and so forth, most such footprints are going to be associated with a past event, namely
*  the walking down the beach of some person with a foot that landed there and left the footprint.
*  Okay, so if you were to erase that, so if you take a bucket of water and you pour it over the
*  footprint and you've now erased it, right, you have increased the entropy of the universe. You've
*  shaken things up. It's an irreversible process. If someone comes across the same patch of beach
*  where the footprint used to be, they don't know whether there was a footprint there that you erased
*  or whether there was never a footprint there at all. So that's the definition of an irreversible
*  process. You don't know how to go backwards. Whereas if you take the footprint and evolve
*  backward in time, follow where it came from, right? So unwind the clock and see the person
*  walking backwards and their foot exactly lands on where the footprint was and they raise the foot
*  and the beach goes back to being perfectly flat. In some sense, that's removing the memory. It's
*  removing the footprint, but it's not erasing the memory in the same way that you erased it by
*  pouring a bucket of water over it, right? And the reason why the two processes can be so different
*  is because the reversed time one is lowering entropy all the way, right? The universe is being
*  traced toward the direction of lower entropy in the Big Bang. So I think, if I understand
*  the question correctly, I think the answer is that your notion of erasing a memory is not quite the
*  same in those two cases. Roy Rodenstein says, in your February Ask Me Anything, in 51 minutes,
*  you cleanly dispel free will, then in 56 minutes, you offer advice to take initiative.
*  Can you share how you think about this? Sure. So I did not cleanly dispel free will. If anything,
*  I cleanly dispelled libertarian free will, right? Libertarian free will is exactly the idea that we
*  talked about earlier, that somehow you are a law unto yourself. You are not beholden to the laws
*  of physics, okay? I do not believe in that. Very few people do believe in that. Some do. Actually,
*  probably the majority of people in the world, very few philosophers and neuroscientists and physicists
*  believe in that. Let us put it that way. But I am a compatibilist, so I think that it is still useful
*  to talk about free will. For example, I give advice to people to take initiative. So what I would say
*  is that the laws of physics are the laws of physics. My willpower does not overcome them.
*  My willpower is an emergent creation of the laws of physics, so there is no libertarian free will
*  in that sense. And yet, when I describe human beings, when I talk about human beings, when I
*  interact with human beings, including myself, it is overwhelmingly useful to use that description
*  of human beings as decision-making agents, as people who can think about reasons for doing things,
*  and on the basis of those reasons, they can make decisions, okay? That is what a compatibilist is.
*  A compatibilist is someone who recognizes that the laws of physics are the laws of physics. I cannot
*  overcome them. And yet, there is an absolutely clear sense of volition and decision-making
*  and free will that we have at the emergent level of being human beings. And honestly,
*  in my less generous moments, I think that literally everyone is a compatibilist,
*  but some of us are willing to admit it and some of us are not. I have never met a free will skeptic,
*  someone who doesn't believe in free will, who also refuses to use the language of people making
*  choices, who always refuses to try to convince people of things, right? I mean, if you don't
*  have the ability to be convinced because everything is predetermined, why would you ever convince
*  people of anything? Why would you ever think that anything is right or wrong? You can't believe in
*  morality if you don't believe in free will. You can't believe that I can make a right decision
*  because you don't believe I'm making decisions, okay? So I think that a lot of people are
*  compatibilists. They just don't like to use that language. That's my theory, like I said,
*  in my less generous moments. Jim Murphy says, in the many worlds theory, we need to give branches
*  of the wave function different weights in order to make sense of the observed probabilities. Does
*  this mean that somewhere out there, there is a thickest branch? Could there be any significance
*  to this idea of the trunk of the many worlds tree? Sure, there should be a thickest branch,
*  but I don't think that there's any significance to it being, I wouldn't call it the trunk, right?
*  I mean, a trunk is not just the thickest part of the tree. There's something kind of central about
*  it in some very real sense, whereas there's no center to the set of all branches of the wave
*  function of the universe. So, but yeah, different branches will have different weights. If there's
*  a finite number of them, one of them will be the thickest. There you go. Will Robinson says, in the
*  laws of physics, in the laws underlying the physics of everyday life are completely understood,
*  you seem to focus on what we can observe in the everyday world. But in some podcast statements,
*  you also extend your conclusions to cover what we could possibly build tomorrow, no Star Trek
*  force fields, etc. You seem very confident that a future understanding of dark matter will not lead
*  to a similar technological change in our everyday lives. Is this right? And if so, what is that
*  certainty rooted in? It's not certainty. It's never certainty. This is science. Okay, so you should
*  never be certain, but we have different credences for different things we might believe in. I did
*  just recently write a paper about this, where I tried to make the case at a more technical level
*  than I have in blog posts and things like that. So you're welcome to look up that paper called
*  the quantum field theory on which everyday life supervenes or the everyday world supervenes,
*  something like that. And the point is that there are very good reasons to believe that dark matter
*  or Higgs bosons or anything like that, grand unification particles are not going to lead
*  to technological changes, namely because we can't interact with them very much. The Higgs boson we
*  made, we did interact with it, right? We discovered it, large hadron collider, and then it decays away
*  in 10 to the minus 21 seconds. It is completely impractical for any technological purpose that
*  you might want to put it to. It goes away. First off, you need a $10 billion particle accelerator
*  to make one, and then it disappears in a zepto second. Not very useful for technological changes.
*  Likewise, dark matter seems to be stable, right? Otherwise it wouldn't have survived for the whole
*  age of the universe. But you can't make it. It interacts too weakly with us. If you had a dark
*  matter particle in front of you, you couldn't hold it in your hand. It would pass right through your
*  hand. We know that's true because if it wouldn't pass through your hand, if it would interact with
*  you strongly enough that not only could you hold in your hand, but you could trap it,
*  using anything that we have at our disposal, we would have done that a long time ago. People have
*  been trying to do exactly that and failing. So dark matter just goes right through you.
*  And the similar reasoning goes for anything else you might want to imagine. So there are plenty of
*  possible new particles, new forces, etc. But we will not have the ability to manipulate them
*  in interesting technological ways. And in fact, that point is long past. As I mentioned in this
*  paper, the last time we made a discovery in fundamental physics, not higher level physics,
*  not emergent level materials or anything like that, but in fundamental physics, particle physics,
*  quantum field theory, gravity, stuff like that. The last time we made a new discovery
*  that actually had technological implications was basically like the 1950s. Okay, we discovered
*  pions and things like that. And those are like just they're not stable, but they're stable enough
*  that you can imagine putting them to some use. Since then, for the past more than half of a
*  century, technological change has all been putting the stuff that we know about the fundamental
*  ingredients we already discovered long ago to work in different ways in more complicated
*  configurations, right. And I think that's what technological change is going to continue to be.
*  And there's a lot of ways to do that. So we have a lot of room for new technological change,
*  but it will not be based in new fundamental physics discoveries. Again, not a certainty,
*  I could be wrong, it'd be great if I were wrong. But that's the argument. Siraj Rajan says,
*  as a medical professional during my European stint, I had appreciated the large population
*  medical data sets we had access to due to the centralized medical data collection systems that
*  they have there. They also have a more interconnected network of labs, etc. Are there any interesting
*  practices or traditions you've noticed in non-American physics or cosmology universities
*  that you wish you could implement in the US? So I included this among the questions to say out loud,
*  because I think it's an interesting question. Sadly, I have nothing interesting to add to it.
*  I'm just offering it up to other listeners if they have anything that they want to think about
*  spurred by this question. You know, and partly, this is because I've not spent an extremely
*  large amount of time in foreign universities. I visited them for a few days or a couple weeks
*  at a time. Even a couple weeks might be a slight exaggeration. I visited plenty of
*  foreign universities, but not really hung out with enough time to get deeply immersed in the
*  culture of them. And also partly because my particular kind of theoretical physics is,
*  you know, pencil and paper. There's not a lot of things you can do in different ways, you know,
*  theoretical physics of this form I do it is basically the same whether you're in Los Angeles
*  or Paris or Beijing or Seoul or wherever. Okay. So there's not a lot of differences. If anything,
*  the most noticeable thing is that, believe it or not, a lot of foreign universities have way worse
*  bureaucracy than the United States does. To get reimbursed for travel expenses if you go to a
*  conference in France is just such an enormous pain that it's almost not worth it sometimes.
*  They love their paperwork there, man, like no one's business. And so in that sense, I'm happier
*  for the American system. But you know, I'm sure there are different things. But the things I
*  notice are like, you know, yeah, they have really good coffee and wine at the conferences in Paris.
*  So that makes up for the paperwork. Anonymous says the game Minecraft has seed numbers used
*  to generate their worlds. If two players generate a massive world with the same seed number, they
*  would both start and walk hundreds of miles in a direction and get the same random block in front
*  of them without communicating. Is this analogous to quantum entanglement? So no, it is not analogous
*  to quantum entanglement. And this is a crucial thing. This is why I think this is a good question
*  to answer. Entanglement is not correlation. Okay, I mean, it is correlation was more than that. It's
*  different than classical correlation. It's this is not exactly your question. But there's a related
*  famous example given by John Bell of Bertelmann's socks, right? Bertelmann always used to wear two
*  different colored socks. He would never wear two socks that were the same color. So whenever you
*  saw him, and if you saw that on one foot, he was wearing a green sock, you would instantly know
*  without actually seeing it. The other sock was not green. Maybe it's purple or red or whatever,
*  but you know it's not green. And so Bell, John Bell is saying, isn't that like entanglement? But
*  he knows better. He's using an example. He's saying, no, entanglement is not like that. It's
*  not just like that. And the reason why is because there is some fact of the matter about the color
*  of Bertelmann's left sock and right sock. There is some fact of the matter about what your seed
*  number is and therefore what block will randomly quote unquote randomly drop down in front of you
*  miles hundreds of miles away. Okay, there's a fact of the matter. So there's a correlation.
*  You don't know that these two things are in certain states, but they are in certain states.
*  Okay, the number has been generated. The sock has been put on the foot. Whereas entanglement is a
*  different kind of thing. Because if I have two spins, and let's say they are oppositely aligned,
*  so that an entangled state of two spins so that I know that if one is spin up, the other is spin
*  down or the other if the first is spin down, the other is spin up. Okay, so two things to note.
*  Number one, neither one of them has a definite state of its spin. It's not spin up or spin down.
*  It's in a superposition of both. That's different than the classical analogy. But if I observe one
*  spin, then the other one I will know. Okay, but more importantly, I could choose to measure along
*  a different direction. Remember, we just talked about how you can relate spins in the z direction
*  versus spins in the x direction or y direction, etc. So for this kind of entangled state of two
*  spins held by Alice and Bob, I could choose to measure something different. I could choose to
*  measure the spin along the x axis rather than along the z axis. And it would still be true
*  that the spins would be anti-aligned. So if I measure my spin, or Alice measures her spin along
*  the x axis, whatever answer she gets, I now know that Bob, very, very far away, will get the
*  opposite answer. So it wasn't a pre-existing correlation. It wasn't until I chose to measure
*  that that I could say what Bob was going to see. So it's not just the existence of two copies of
*  the same thing from a common cause, even from an accidental cause. It's a kind of relationship that
*  is intrinsically quantum mechanical, and you can't really analogize very well classically.
*  UC Poldvay says, I was wondering, does it feel different now that you were in, that Biden and
*  Harris are in charge? At least looking from afar, it seems that the first month has been full of
*  smaller and bigger changes in the right direction. Yeah, I think it absolutely feels different. I
*  think that's actually the good way of putting it. You know, I mean, the people who are in charge of
*  different government organizations are now experts in their fields rather than close relatives and
*  lawyers of the president. Decisions are being made. I'm not going to agree with all the decisions,
*  but they're being made by people who are pretty competent in their fields. And also,
*  this feeling question, a lot of it comes down to what in both physics and in poker, which is another
*  regime arena that I always use to reach for for my metaphors, we would say has to do with the lowering
*  of the temperature. Okay. You know, in physics, if you have a box of gas, a very low temperature,
*  everything, the molecules are not moving very much. They're just sitting there. If you raise
*  the temperature, heat it up, put your cup of coffee in the microwave, that everything moves faster,
*  right? Everything's jumping around and going crazy. Poker players use this as a metaphor. If
*  if you're at a table poker players, and they're all very tight, right, so they're all very reluctant
*  to bet, like if someone does make a bet, everyone else folds, it's very kind of predictable.
*  That's a low temperature situation. And if you just bring in a couple of new players,
*  who suddenly like always are raising and betting and going crazy, in order to adapt to, you know,
*  play well against that different kind of style, you have to increase your frequency of raising
*  and betting and stuff like that. So the whole temperature of the table goes up. And the switch
*  from Trump Pence to Biden Harris has lowered our political temperature. That doesn't mean it's
*  lowered the polarization or the commitment of Republicans to oppose the Democratic agenda or
*  anything like that. But the discourse is just a fundamentally different kind of style that is
*  going on. You know, we're we're talking about the actual technical problems of getting vaccine doses
*  into the right hands as quickly as possible. We are not talking about, well, you know, the
*  governor of that state was mean to me, therefore, I'm not going to give them any aid or something
*  like that. You know, the state of Texas did not vote for Joe Biden. Nevertheless, no one ever even
*  imagined that he would fail to give them aid when they recently had to go through a lot of
*  troubles with the temperature was very low, the it was very, very bad weather and the electrical
*  grid in Texas failed. And a lot of people were in trouble. And yeah, the federal government helped
*  out because that's what the federal government is supposed to do. It's not an issue now in the way
*  that it would have been a short while ago. Terry LaRue-Packett says, why are you uncertain about
*  Hilbert spaces size? So Hilbert space is the size is the space of all possible wave functions of a
*  physical system. So if you have a spin, that can either be spin up or spin down, that's a two
*  dimensional Hilbert space. But very quickly, if you have something like the position of a particle,
*  just in good old non relativistic quantum mechanics, well, how many different positions
*  could you observe if you measure the position of a particle, an infinite number, right, any real
*  number you could get as an answer. And therefore, the Hilbert space, the space of all wave functions
*  for a particle moving in one dimension and non relativistic quantum mechanics is infinite
*  dimensional, the number of dimensions of Hilbert space is just the number of possible
*  observational outcomes that are truly distinct from one another. That don't, as they say, that
*  commute with each other a complete set of commuting observables. So what about the real world,
*  right? I mean, if a single particle has an infinite dimensional Hilbert space,
*  surely the world, which has lots of particles, has an infinite dimensional Hilbert space,
*  how could it be finite? Well, that idea of a single particle described by non relativistic
*  quantum mechanics is not the real world, right? It's a model. And it's a model that imagines that
*  we could divide space arbitrarily into tiny regions, which maybe we can't do in the real
*  world, because the real world has gravity. So again, I'll refer to a paper that I wrote,
*  but I wrote a paper with Ning Bao and Ashmeet Singh, I think, saying that the Hilbert space
*  of quantum gravity is locally finite dimensional. And the reason why is because something we
*  mentioned way earlier in the podcast talking about black holes, when you try to put a lot of energy
*  into a quantum field in a world with gravity, you don't create whatever you want, you create a black
*  hole, there's too much energy in a region. And we know that black holes have an entropy, Stephen
*  Hawking told us that and we know that entropy is finite. And there's a relationship, I won't go into
*  details, but there's a relationship between the entropy of a black hole and the dimensionality
*  of its Hilbert space. So it's a finite number. So we think that in a world with gravity,
*  in any region of space, there's only a finite number of things that can happen, there's only
*  a finite number of quantum mechanical states that are truly distinct from each other.
*  That would lead us to believe that Hilbert space is locally finite dimensional. And by the word
*  locally, I mean in a single region of space. But then how many regions of space are there, right?
*  We have our observable universe, which is a region of space, maybe it has a finite dimensional
*  Hilbert space, but maybe there's an infinite number of regions of space outside. So that's
*  why we don't know. We're a little bit unsure about whether this argument that quantum gravity makes
*  Hilbert space locally finite dimensional is even true. I think it's right, but we don't know for
*  sure because quantum gravity is tricky. And we don't know the total dimensionality of Hilbert
*  space because we don't know how many local regions of space there are. That's okay, lots of things
*  we don't know about the universe. Andre Deneu says, as an advocate of many worlds, you probably
*  agree with the philosophical perspective labeled as wave function realism by David Albert. If so,
*  then what do you make of the criticisms against that position considering the wave form function
*  of the universe as the fundamental ontological entity which describes our world? So I need to be
*  a little bit technical and nitpicky here. I am not a fan of wave function realism, but you have to
*  understand what wave function realism as David Albert posited it is supposed to mean. So David,
*  of course, one of the world's leading philosophers of physics, former mindscape guest, and what he
*  says is the following, and I'm not even sure if he believes it. I mean, this is something which we do
*  as thinkers. We put forward ideas as possibly true and then we investigate them. We don't just say,
*  well, because I thought of it, it must be true. So what David says is, look, if I have, let's say I
*  have a particle in a box, a three-dimensional box, and in classical mechanics, I would say, okay,
*  the particle lives in the three-dimensional box. And if I have a quantum theory of that particle,
*  then its wave function can be thought of as a function of space, as a function of that
*  three-dimensional space in which the box lives because the wave function assigns an amplitude,
*  which I would square to get the probability to every point in that box, every point in that
*  three-dimensional space. So far, so good. But David says, look, what if you have two particles
*  in the box, okay, then because of entanglement, there are not two different wave functions for
*  the two particles. There's one wave function for the two-particle system, and the two-particle
*  system, even though each individual particle lives in a three-dimensional box, the two-particle
*  system lives in a six-dimensional configuration space. Three dimensions telling you where one
*  particle is, three dimensions telling you where the other particle is. Let's assume they're not
*  identical particles, so an electron and a proton, for example. And so David says, in that case,
*  the quantum mechanical wave function is a function of the six-dimensional configuration space.
*  And if I have n particles in a three-dimensional box, the wave function is a function of a three
*  n-dimensional configuration space. So he wants us to imagine the idea that that kind of wave
*  function, not just an abstract quantum state, but a function on configuration space, three n-dimensional
*  configuration space, is what is real, is the fundamental ontology of the world. So in some
*  sense, the three n-dimensional configuration space for this view is more fundamental than the
*  three-dimensional space that we call space. So it's a slightly cheeky point of view because we all
*  think that space is more fundamental than configuration space in some sense. So I admire
*  that cheekiness. I think that's a good thing to do. But look, I don't buy that ontology, as it were,
*  in a straightforward way. And for a number of different reasons, the most basic is the world
*  is not made of particles. That's not the world, sorry, right? I mean, the world is maybe made of
*  quantum fields, but like I said, gravity is not a quantum field theory itself. So the world's made
*  of something. We don't know what it is, but it's definitely not a bunch of non-relativistic particles.
*  So that straightforward literal wave function of n-particles ontology certainly is a non-starter,
*  in my view, as describing fundamental reality. But also, that wave function is, in my mind,
*  a representation of a quantum state. It's a way of describing and giving the information contained
*  in a quantum state. But it's a highly non-unique way of giving that information. For example,
*  I'm not sure, Andre, how much into quantum mechanics you are, but there is the position
*  basis. There's also the momentum basis, right? So I can equally well describe that n-particle
*  state in the momentum basis, in which case the wave function is a function of momentum space,
*  not of configuration space. So I certainly can't imagine taking configuration space as fundamental
*  as the fundamental arena in which wave functions live. What I can do is be even more abstract than
*  David was proposing to be and say what really exists is just a vector in Hilbert space.
*  And you can represent such vectors in Hilbert space as functions of configuration space.
*  You can represent them just as well as functions of momentum space or literally an infinite number
*  of other choices. It's just like when we were talking in the very first special relativity
*  talk when I said choosing coordinate systems is not an objective physical thing. It's a choice
*  made by human beings. Likewise, choosing representations of quantum states is not an
*  objective physical thing. So the thing that is real in my mind is the vector in Hilbert space.
*  Now, most philosophers of physics would say that's crazy talk. And they would say it because there's
*  not enough structure in Hilbert space to recover the reality of the world. And David Wallace,
*  who's another leading philosopher of physics, has said this out loud. I believe the phrase he used
*  was it would be naive in the extreme to believe that. And I know that off the top of my head,
*  because I'm writing a paper right now. I'm supposed to finish it this week. And yet here I am doing
*  AMAs, but I love doing the AMAs, so it's okay. Anyway, I'm writing a paper that gives a defense,
*  an apologia for this view that really is just the wave function as a vector in Hilbert space that
*  should be considered real, not configuration space or momentum space. So I'm quoting David
*  Wallace as saying that my view is naive in the extreme. But I think that's just because
*  people don't appreciate there is just enough structure in Hilbert space to do everything
*  you want. And that's what you want. You want to be able to reconstruct the complicated world around
*  us from the minimal amount of structure. I think that's what we can do. Okay, Nathaniel Zabel says,
*  I've always sort of romanticized academia and studying physics, I gave it a go and realized
*  that it may not be for me. And now I'm most of the way through an electrical engineering undergrad
*  degree. So my question is, how, if at all, do you see engineers involved in real physics?
*  Well, they're all over the place, you know, I mean, it depends on what you mean by real physics. But
*  most of physics, not what I do, but most of physics, involves experiments in a very intimate way,
*  right? Building apparatuses, designing detectors that are the world's most precise and robust,
*  there's an enormous amount of engineering that goes into this, you know, you don't think that
*  large hadron collider was built by physicists, do you? And there's a lot of physicists involved,
*  but there's a lot of engineers, technical people, you know, contractors, etc. Someone had to pour
*  concrete, etc. So yeah, if you're interested in being involved in the broader project of physics
*  from an electrical engineering degree point of view, that's 100% possible. I'm not the world's
*  expert about how to do it, but it's absolutely possible. Carlos Nunez says, if you could have a
*  superpower, what would it be and why? Yeah, I think, let me see, I think the answer is obvious,
*  which is teleportation. And you know, look, there's slight ill-definedness in the question,
*  because what counts as a superpower? Like, is omniscience a superpower? Will I get to do that?
*  You know, another obvious choice would be flying or, you know, telepathy is a good one, reading
*  other people's minds. Certainly reading other people's minds would give you great advantages
*  going through life. I also think it'd be really depressing, right? I think that minds are messy
*  places that people don't have complete control over. And I don't necessarily want to know what
*  other people are thinking about everything. So telepathy might be more than I want access to.
*  Flying seems cool, but if you believe that you have some limitation on your speed, then
*  teleportation is way cooler. So I'm interpreting the question as, you know, going through the lists
*  of superpowers that superheroes tend to have. So I'm excluding omniscience or something like that.
*  Teleportation would be great. Do you think I can walk out the door and suddenly have lunch in Paris
*  or, you know, breakfast in Tokyo? That would be pretty awesome. Don't have to fly, don't have to
*  wait in line with TSA. Yeah, that would be a good superpower in my view. Stephen Klein says,
*  the sun is hot. The 93 or so million miles of space between earth and the sun is cold,
*  near absolute zero. How is it that the heat of the sun can travel that distance through cold
*  without heating space up and then get hot again when it hits earth? Well, the reason why I include
*  this question is because it's a good one, exactly because we are usually sloppy about using words
*  like hot and cold, okay? If you're really, really strict, and you shouldn't be, but if you were
*  really, really strict, you should only attribute a temperature to a system that is at or near
*  thermal equilibrium, okay? That a system that has been given a chance to equilibrate and come to
*  a constant temperature everywhere, then we have a well-defined notion of what it means to be at a
*  temperature. If you are near the surface of the sun, well, then you're pretty close, okay? Then
*  everywhere around you is the same temperature, everywhere around you is the same density of
*  matter, etc. You're pretty, if you're not outside, but right inside the sun, that's a pretty good
*  approximation. But if you're in the space in between the earth and the sun, you're nowhere near
*  thermal equilibrium, exactly because in most directions you look, it's really cold, the sky
*  is dark, but in one direction you look toward the sun, it's really hot and bright, okay? That is
*  paradigmatic example of not being in thermal equilibrium. So it's not that space is cold
*  in between the earth and the sun, it's that space doesn't have a temperature, strictly speaking.
*  It's not a system that is in thermal equilibrium. There's the other part of the answer, which is
*  that space is not a thing. You can't heat up space. Space is the thing through which other things
*  travel at this level of description. So you should, another reason why you should not attribute a
*  temperature to it. But if that's a deflationary answer, then sorry, but that's the right way, I
*  think, to think about these things. Costello Rotari says, why isn't there an Italian translation of
*  the big picture? Will it happen and can I do it myself? So I answer this question because maybe it
*  helps, I get this kind of question, usually by email, a bunch of times, you know, can I translate
*  your book? As far as I remember, there is no Italian translation of the big picture and no
*  current plans for one. I believe they are currently in the process of translating something deeply
*  hidden. But the big picture, I don't think I have an Italian contract for. So the point is, you know,
*  look, the publishing business is a business, okay? People get paid, people earn their living doing
*  it. You need to have contracts and dollar amounts or lira amounts or euro amounts or whatever.
*  So a lot of people from different countries write in and say, there is no translation in my language
*  of your book, can I translate it? And the answer is no, you can't. What you can do, I'm not sure if
*  this ever works, but in principle, you could interest a publishing house in getting a translation
*  done. And maybe you could even volunteer your service or let yourself be hired for money as
*  the translator, okay? But the actual translation and publishing of a foreign language edition of
*  a book has to be done through a publishing house with a contract, etc. So if you have a favorite
*  Italian publisher, especially one that you know does translations of English language science books,
*  then by all means pester them to offering a contract to my agent to do a translation.
*  Usually, you know, for those of you who are out there interested in writing books and things like
*  that in the economics of the business, foreign language editions of books are not a good way to
*  get rich. Like if you write a book in English, most of the people buying your book will buy the
*  English version, not a foreign language version. So you know, you can make a few hundred, a few
*  thousand dollars here and there depending on the version, but I'm not saying all this because I
*  want to get rich off the Italian edition of the big picture. That is not going to happen, but there
*  are legal things to keep in mind and there are Italians who work for publishing houses who need
*  to earn a living. So that's the way to get it done. Ben Turner says, you mentioned before you
*  had previously considered going to law school. If you'd been a lawyer in other life, what kind of
*  lawyer would you have been? You know, honestly, I would have been a law professor. I don't like
*  I don't know because I haven't tried it, but the romance here is not me being in court and being
*  Perry Mason or whatever. It's thinking about the idea of the attraction of law school was that law
*  is sort of an intersection of logical thinking and reasoning with down to earth human concerns,
*  right? It's not the world, you know, finding out the truth about the world outside, but there is
*  legal theory, constitutional theory, things like that. And that's what attracts me. So I think that
*  doing that as a law professor would have been a better fit to me than to be like a corporate
*  lawyer or even a constitutional lawyer or something like that. Chris Fotosh says, you talk about
*  anti-desider space often, but where do we find that in our universe? Isn't space time a desider space?
*  So desider space was is a solution to Einstein's equations for general relativity that you can get
*  if you start with an empty universe that has a non-zero vacuum energy that has a non-zero
*  cosmological constant, a positive value of cosmological constant. So desider, Willem desider,
*  way back in the days, I don't know, 1917 or something like that, very soon after general
*  relativity came along, solved the equations for general relativity with a positive cosmological
*  constant, we call it desider space. We don't live in desider space. Our space time is not desider
*  space because there is stuff in our universe other than the vacuum, right? There are stars and planets
*  and dark matter. The better thing to say is that as time goes on, that stuff is emptying out and we
*  are approaching, we're asymptoting toward desider space and maybe in the future we're going to look
*  more and more like desider space. Anti-desider space is an analogous thing but what would happen
*  if you get a negative cosmological constant? So there's no worries about a negative number for
*  the vacuum energy. It's just as physically allowed. So you can imagine cosmologies with
*  the negative vacuum energy, solve the equations. We call it anti-desider space. There's no Mr.
*  Anti-desider but I don't know who did anti-desider space first. The reason why anti-desider space is
*  so often mentioned is because it is a wonderful toy model for quantum gravity and it's wonderful
*  because of the discovery in the mid 1990s from Juan Maldacena that quantum gravity with anti-desider
*  boundary conditions is related to and maybe is exactly the same as a quantum field theory without
*  gravity living on the boundary. That's the ADS CFT correspondence. ADS being anti-desider,
*  CFT meaning conformal field theory, a particular kind of quantum field theory. So the idea, so you
*  might say well okay that's good if you have this correspondence between a theory of gravity and a
*  theory without gravity then we can use our knowledge of non-gravitational quantum field
*  theory to learn something about gravity. Yes that is the motivation behind ADS CFT correspondence
*  being so popular in the physics literature. But you might say but who cares if it's not our world,
*  right? And the answer would be well we know so little about quantum gravity like we think that
*  information is preserved when black holes evaporate but we don't know how. Maybe studying a problem
*  like that in the context of the ADS CFT correspondence teaches us something fundamental about quantum
*  gravity that will continue to be true or maybe less so but equally good will inspire some true
*  thing in the real world, in the d-sitter space world. I think this is a reason why, I mean
*  let's put it this way, this is the generous way of spinning why so many people care about ADS CFT
*  because they're trying to learn robust features of quantum gravity in a well-controlled
*  example that hopefully we can then port over to more realistic situations. There is a less
*  generous construction which would say it's just full employment like once you have ADS CFT there's
*  a million questions you can ask and answer, a million equations you can write down and solve them
*  and whether or not it's related to the real world that's what physicists like to do so they do it,
*  okay? The truth is probably somewhere in between those two things. There is definitely some you
*  know treadmill kind of work, you're on the hamster wheel of solving equations in the ADS CFT
*  correspondence and you lose sight of the bigger picture but there's absolutely also work that has
*  come out of ADS CFT that potentially has interesting ramifications for the real world so somewhere in
*  between probably is the truth. Humberto Nani says is it possible that the universe looks flat
*  because it has not had enough time or space to express its curvature or is that possibility
*  ruled out by observations? No it's absolutely possible so you know we sometimes say that when
*  we talk about the curvature of space in cosmology there are three choices there's positively curved
*  negatively curved and zero flat right? Well you know that's not a false statement but it's also not
*  the most information conveying statement. A better way to say it is that there is for every possible
*  geometry of space and these are not arbitrary geometries but homogeneous and isotropic
*  geometries there's only those three choices you can attach a real number to any such geometry
*  called the radius of curvature okay the radius of curvature of a sphere is literally the radius
*  right? How big is the sphere? Spheres are positively curved so if you take a sphere and make it bigger
*  and bigger right bigger and bigger radius of curvature in the limit where it becomes an
*  infinitely big radius of curvature it's flat you you get the plane this is a you can check
*  this mathematically and then you can sort of come back the other side you can say well what if I have
*  a negative radius of curvature that's what you would attach to a hyperbolic geometry a negatively
*  curved surface so even though there are three classes of geometries of universe positively
*  curved negatively curved or flat there's really a continuum of actual geometries from
*  infinite negatively infinite curvature to positively infinite curvature so what we're
*  measuring when we measure the curvature of the universe is a real number not a discrete choice
*  of three different possibilities so the measurement that we do of the curvature of the universe has
*  error bars and right now the curvature of the universe as we've measured it is compatible with
*  zero curvature compatible with being flat but it's also compatible with a very large radius of
*  curvature that is either positive or negative so as those error bars get better or as our
*  observations get stronger we might discover that the universe is a little bit negatively curved or
*  positively curved that is absolutely possible christopher matthew says as someone who hasn't
*  solved an equation since high school i don't have a great sense for what is actually involved when
*  you talk about solving sort of equations a working physicist would solve is that something you could
*  describe or would i need a stronger background to grasp it it's hard to describe just because
*  there's so many different equations right i mean there's a lot of different techniques for solving
*  equations that physicists use sometimes pretty simple like you know oftentimes you know i already
*  mentioned earlier that if you have a bunch of particles in a box you can describe them in
*  position space or in momentum space well there's a technique there's a mathematical technique for
*  transforming from one to the other called Fourier transforms and so many systems that are very
*  complicated in position space are easy to solve in momentum space you do that kind of integral
*  transform other times you have a simple differential equation like the Friedman equation for the
*  expansion of the universe and even though it's very simple if you have some complicated stuff
*  in the universe you're just going to solve it numerically you're just going to put it on a
*  computer and solve it in yet other cases you have something like Feynman diagrams for a scattering
*  process and Feynman has given you a little recipe for attaching to each diagram an integral or a
*  set of integrals to do and a set of tricks like literally there's something that you can look up
*  in quantum field theory books called Feynman's trick for doing integrals and it's a trick that
*  is specific for the kind of integrals that appear in Feynman diagram calculations other areas of
*  physics will have matrices that you need to diagonalize or find the eigenvalues of you know
*  there's just a whole bunch of different techniques so i'm not giving you a very helpful answer but
*  it's a big heterogeneous mess that's the that's all i can really say for it sorry
*  okay here's a group of questions i'm going to group together Robert Casson says did your
*  conversation with Russ Schaefer-Landau change your degree of belief in moral constructivism
*  um Stefan Berninger says did your podcast with Robert Sapolsky yield any new insights about how
*  we humans should deal with moral challenges and Andre says in your recent podcast with Robert
*  Sapolsky you didn't push back on his views against free will what is your response to his arguments
*  against compatibilism so the grouping is did my mind change uh when i did these podcasts and nope
*  my minds didn't really change like my amount of information increased i learned something about it
*  but for the Russ Schaefer-Landau podcast for example you know he is really quite explicitly
*  you know he's very honest and an admiral about it he's a he's basing his moral realism on our
*  intuitions we have an intuition about what is right and what is wrong and he thinks that deserves
*  you know being taken seriously as a moral realist and i just don't i'm like wow our intuitions
*  which clearly were shaped by evolution and all sorts of weird things in the structure of our
*  brains and so forth i can't imagine attaching moral uh heft to what those intuitions are so no
*  i understand better where he's coming from but my mind did not change um with Robert Sapolsky uh
*  yes you know he take you know he knows much better than i do what are the different actual
*  characteristics of the world that go into making us make certain choices and do certain behaviors
*  and he concludes from that that there's no free will because he can see why we're making all the
*  different choices from a philosophical point of view i don't think this has much to do with
*  compatibilism the the philosophical case is about what i said before is the best language that we
*  have for talking about human beings and describing their behaviors one in which they are agents
*  making choices and even if they are not making choices they are making choices in a way that
*  i know that there is something called um the amygdala and there are hormones and there are
*  genetic behaviors and there are things that happen in your childhood or in the womb and etc all of
*  these i can know all of these things but as long as a person is not sufficiently brain damaged or
*  something like that that my best way of thinking about them is as a person i could give reasons to
*  and they could respond to those reasons and make choices based on those reasons then as that's what
*  i mean by free will so i don't think that Sapolsky has um uh really thought about the philosophical
*  argument one way or the other which is fine that's not his job that's not what he is doing
*  so it does not change my personal view on free will um and again as i said before in the podcast
*  i'm not there to ride my hobby horses you know i if i have robert sapolsky on the podcast i want to
*  hear his insight about how the brain works i don't want to have a long complicated semantic argument
*  over how we should think about free will okay um and how the question about how whether or not that
*  podcast change how we humans should deal with moral challenges again you know no not really and i think
*  this is why i don't like the free will discussion that we have in the modern world because there
*  are really important questions about practical things we should do punishing people who behave
*  badly treating people who have mental disorders or addictions or things like that these are real
*  questions okay that i don't have any simple answers to to me these questions are largely
*  orthogonal to the free will questions you know these are all questions about which i am very
*  much a consequentialist what is the thing we can do to make things better to the extent that we
*  agree on what should be better you know if someone is addicted to heroin it would be better if they
*  were not uh if someone murdered someone it'd be better if they didn't murder people okay so we
*  agree on what the goals are and we have a very instrumentalist question how do we get those goals
*  and that seems to have nothing to do with how we think about free will in my mind it has a lot to
*  do with the biology sure so that's the the discussion i think should be going on not should
*  we think about free will or not but given what we know about biology and psychology and pharmacology
*  and and the legal system and all these things how should we make all those systems the best
*  to get the outcomes we want and if no one ever used words like free will in that discussion i
*  think the discussion would be way better than it is okay gary miller says why are you skeptical
*  of avi lobe's view that umamuma sorry uamua man i was really good at pronouncing that when i
*  talked to avi but i've lost the ability why are you skeptical that it's artificially made as a
*  lay person i think it's a fascinating idea but rely entirely on what the experts think what do
*  you think on a move being artificial versus natural well partially it's a question of priors
*  right you know i think that most objects flying through the solar system are much more likely to
*  be natural than artificial so i would need really good evidence to change my mind before i sort of
*  switched over you know it just for the simple reason that you know i presume in my way of
*  thinking about life in the galaxy that most of the stuff in the galaxy is natural not artificial
*  and you know the the specific scenario being put forward is a little bit weird right i mean on the
*  one hand it's supposed to be a solar sail you're supposed to say well it's more likely that it
*  would pass close by the sun because it's meant to be a solar sail and use the sun but why exactly
*  like is it you know where is it aiming why didn't they just aim it where they're supposed to aim
*  it rather than like send it on trajectory past the sun why is the solar sail the right thing to be
*  why didn't it give off some signal that makes it perfectly clear that it's that it's artificial
*  and so forth like the bigger context here is not very convincing to me
*  on the other hand i'm very much in agreement that we should take it seriously that's why i had
*  Avi on the podcast you know again i don't i invite people on the podcast who i disagree with but not
*  people who i don't think are worth listening to so it's very much worth taking that seriously and
*  you know i do think that Avi like more than Sapolsky or Schaefer Landau Avi did shift my
*  credences a little bit toward taking the possibility of detecting extraterrestrial life a little bit
*  more seriously than i usually do he didn't change my credences on whether artificial life exists
*  but there is some you know payoff to finding it if it's out there especially defining it before
*  they find us so i think that's a good lesson to learn Joseph Tangretti says if two massive objects
*  exist in space time and are x distance apart how does space time know the distance and impute the
*  proper amount of gravity between the two objects well the the answer is because space time is not
*  empty space time contains fields at every point in particular in this case it contains the metric
*  tensor field which we previously referenced the metric tensor is just a fancy way of saying
*  space time has a geometry the metric tensor is what keeps track of what that geometry is and so
*  there is something that stretches in between these two objects and that thing that metric obeys an
*  equation Einstein's equation of general relativity that's how it knows that's why there's not any
*  question of spooky action at a distance in general relativity of course Isaac Newton did worry about
*  exactly this because he didn't know about the metric tensor he didn't know about fields
*  more generally so he didn't know how objects did this but we've learned a lot since Newton's time
*  okay Aman Nilapa says I'm a naturalist such as yourself however having been brought up in India
*  I've always been cognizant of multiple claims that there is a deep non-naturalistic perhaps
*  metaphysical truth on offer to someone who's prepared to dedicate themselves to a rigorous
*  and long-term mental and physical discipline the catch is that one has to dedicate one's life to
*  such a pursuit and another catch seems to be that the said truth is claimed to be only expressible
*  by a metaphors and eludes a direct and precise description however from all accounts the nature
*  of the truth that one discovers is not just deeply gratifying and beautiful but also largely
*  consistent as can be evidenced from the similarity in the writings of those who are believed to have
*  done a particularly good job of walking these disciplines what in your opinion should be one's
*  attitude towards claims such as these so this is a really good question you know I don't I hope that
*  no one listening is dismissing this question you know so the claim is that there are truths of some
*  sort which are left vague the sort of truth that you're getting here is left vague that can only
*  be reached with a certain kind of investment right and that once you do reach that truth you
*  can't even convey it to those who have not made that investment so is this worth taking seriously
*  right like if it's if it's all just hokum then you would waste a lot of time if you put in that
*  investment so I don't you know I'm a little skeptical honestly but I'm willing to be open
*  minded about something like this you know so let's let's think about the in principle question
*  before we think about specific examples in principle is it possible there are kinds of
*  truths realizations revelations if you want to call them that they can only be reached by
*  meditation or practice or something like that and then even when you attain them you can't share them
*  with anyone so I think that's possible I can imagine something like that is correct I don't
*  think that the kinds of truths being obtained that way would be physics truths or math truths
*  I think those kinds of truths are essentially always expressible in non-metaphorical ways but
*  you might be able to reach truths about yourself you know about how you should think about yourself
*  as a person in the world how you should live your life what you should value those kinds of things
*  I certainly would be much more so what I just said is I think it's possible in principle yes
*  it's conceivable on the other hand I still am skeptical in part because I think it would be
*  much more convincing if you could give some flavor of those truths even to those of us who've not
*  gone through the discipline right you know being a scientist doing science one of the lessons you
*  learn is as I think it was Feynman who said you know you have to be careful not to fool yourself
*  because you're the easiest person to fool and this kind of thing where oh I have some special
*  knowledge but I can't tell you what it is man that just seems ripe for fooling yourself right like
*  you have a vested interest because you've put in a lot of work put a lot of your own time in
*  attaining this kind of truth and so you're certainly predisposed to think that it's there
*  and then you're predisposed to think that you've done it right so it's hard to be skeptical it's
*  hard to stop yourself from fooling yourself and finally if it were true that this these kinds of
*  truths were obtained then I would expect there to be even if the people who gained that truth were
*  not able to convey it non-metaphorically I would expect there to be some kind of tangible difference
*  in that person a wisdom or knowledge or something like that and I don't see it I think that you know
*  people who spend a lot of time meditating or you know monks or priests or mystics or so forth
*  in my experience which is admittedly limited in these regimes but they're the same kind of people
*  that I see otherwise they're not any better doing physics I know that they might be more
*  peaceful but I don't you know I don't always see that even to be very honest I went to a
*  Catholic school it's not quite the same but you know there's something similar there so yeah you
*  know so I would tend to be skeptical but I don't in any sense claim to know for sure or to even be
*  unpersuadable about those things Greg says what are your thoughts about the risk of setting off
*  an AI apocalypse i.e. the possibility of creating hyperintelligence self-replicating and self-improving
*  beings that would ultimately result in a net detriment to humanity so I have conflicting
*  thoughts about this you're asking me my thoughts on one side I absolutely think there is a worry
*  here worth worrying about right and putting aside the buzzword language of AI and hyperintelligence
*  we're creating systems we don't understand we're creating complex systems artificially constructed
*  that it is hard for us to be specific about what they do what how they will respond under different
*  circumstances and that's just dangerous right we're you know technological progress has brought us
*  to the point where human beings can create enormously powerful things it would make me
*  happier if we really really really understood those things we're creating and we don't always
*  okay that's one side of it the other side the much more skeptical side is I think that people
*  who I've heard talk about this to my mind are just being way naive about how they anthropomorphize
*  AI systems you know they use words like hyperintelligent they use words like values
*  and morals that they attribute to these systems and there might be a sense in which these words
*  have some relation to what's going on but and this is not I'm not trying to say that artificially
*  constructed systems can't be intelligent or even conscious or whatever I'm just saying that to the
*  extent that we create systems that have something like intelligence or consciousness or whatever or
*  values or morals I suspect that those systems will be wildly different than human intelligence
*  and values and morals and I think that I'm just very unconvinced by the discussions I've heard
*  about you know how to make them value the same thing we value like how in the world do you think
*  that we can tell them what to value like if they're really hyper intelligent to the point where
*  they're like us they're going to decide what to value they're not going to listen to us we can't
*  bake it in if we bake in instructions then they're not really as intelligent and self-aware and
*  self-controlling to the extent that we want them to be so I think that the real problem is not
*  this simple-minded thing that they're so smarter so much smarter than we are that we become sort
*  of lesser beings the real problem is that these systems are going to be so different than what we
*  think of as an intelligent agent that they'll be totally unpredictable and that's a worry I agree
*  that that's a worry I hope that we are worrying about it to the right extent Katen says in your
*  book from eternity here you wrote to this day scientists haven't determined yet to anyone's
*  satisfaction whether the universe will continue to evolve forever or whether it will eventually
*  settle into a placid state of equilibrium but given an infinite period of time for something
*  to happen why wouldn't any equilibrium eventually break perhaps as a result of quantum fluctuations
*  so um yeah there's the the short answer is because there are competing infinities here
*  if you have a system which is sort of a finite state system there's only finite number of things
*  that can happen or even a bounded state system so there's there's sort of a real number of things
*  that can happen but they happen in a circle or in some bounded region of space or configuration space
*  and that thing lasts for an infinitely long time and the dynamics are sort of irreversible
*  okay I'm sorry the dynamics are reversible so let me back up I'm making too many assumptions
*  here to even make the conclusion clear think of all the different possible dynamics of a
*  particle moving on a disc okay so you have a disc so you have literally some little circular
*  thing and its interior and you say I have a particle so point a little mathematical idealized
*  point moving on the disc and the there are different kinds of dynamics I can imagine one
*  would be a kind of random dynamics where the particle wanders around in a random walk and it
*  will come back to where it started etc but there are other kinds of dynamics where the
*  particles goes in a circle forever or a figure eight forever or whatever and there's a third
*  kind of dynamics where it can just sort of spiral into the middle and just stay in the middle forever
*  so in all these cases the particle evolves for an infinitely long time but in some cases it just
*  fills the space of possibilities over and over again and in other cases it just goes to a single
*  point and stops so in this space of all possible dynamics you can have anything you want in that
*  set of circumstances if you put on the extra restriction that the dynamics are like the
*  reversible dynamics of the real world of the schrodinger equation or whatever then the system
*  will not simply wind down to a point because that that's not reversible once you're at the point you
*  can't you don't know where you came from however maybe the world the universe doesn't have a bounded
*  space of possibilities right if you have both infinite time but also an infinite space of
*  possibilities then any given region of the universe can wander into an equilibrium and never leave
*  that is absolutely mathematically possible so there's no to get to your question there's no
*  guarantee that just because there's an infinite amount of time you will return to any particular
*  place like if you are walking on the real numbers and you're walking in the increasing direction
*  and you go you know one two three four five you can keep going forever you're never going to get
*  back to one if you just keep walking in the same direction and the universe might be like that
*  gordon bamber says my assumption is that dark matter interacts only gravitationally with normal
*  matter there must be occasions when a black hole accretes a large amount of dark matter
*  if dark matter does not emit electromagnetic radiation then could the resulting energetic
*  accretion disc be detected at all so you so the assumptions are not quite mutually compatible
*  gordon it's fine to assume the dark matter interacts only gravitationally with normal
*  matter that's a that's a possibility the question is is the dark matter interact only gravitationally
*  with itself and maybe it even only gravitationally is an exaggeration maybe just doesn't interact
*  very strongly with itself or with ordinary matter okay in that case so if dark matter
*  mostly interacts gravitationally sure dark matter can be absorbed by black holes but not a lot of it
*  because the reason why ordinary matter gets absorbed by black holes is because ordinary
*  matter undergoes dissipation when atoms of ordinary matter bump into each other they can
*  emit photons and lose energy that's why you make an accretion disc because and the accretion disc
*  is shining because there's a dissipation filled system where the the matter bumps into other
*  matter loses energy increases the entropy of the universe and settles into a disc okay none of that
*  happens for dark matter dark matter typically would just zoom right by the black hole it would
*  have to hit it right on to be absorbed by it whereas ordinary matter it can come near the black
*  hole and if it were all by itself in the universe it would go right by but it's not it bumps into
*  some other ordinary matter loses energy and spirals into the black hole so mostly dark black holes
*  are going to be eating up ordinary matter not dark matter so there is no accretion disc of dark
*  matter even if there is dark matter being absorbed by the black hole and if there were we couldn't
*  detect it because it would be subdominant to the ordinary matter in a typical situation okay
*  jim burnside says if dark energy is causing the galaxies to travel apart at an accelerating rate
*  at very high velocities then i don't understand how the milky way can be on a collision course
*  with andromeda well i should have put this up with the previous questions about dark energy in the
*  solar system dark energy is not pushing the milky way away from andromeda that that idea that the
*  universe is overall expanding is only true on the larger scales it's an approximation that gets
*  better and better as you consider galaxies that are further and further away the milky way and
*  andromeda are near to each other they are gravitationally bound to each other it's just
*  like the earth and the sun are gravitationally bound to each other so the milky way and andromeda
*  have broken away from the larger expansion of the universe and dark energy does not change that fact
*  last question is from akak acac i was re-listening to your mindscape episode with
*  lennard suskind in the end he talks about his father and wanting to teach science to him and
*  others above a scientific american level was this an inspiration for your biggest ideas in the
*  universe series and the textbook you are or were working on um not quite in exactly that way you
*  know um i had less lofty inspirations or at least different inspirations you know the the big picture
*  question here as it were is that i've always had an interest in explaining and talking about and
*  discussing physics with a broad audience not just my fellow physicists i think it's part of the fun
*  honestly in doing it you know i've said it many times before the kind of physics that i do doesn't
*  cure cancer or lead to technological investigations improvements all it does is help us understand the
*  universe better so to understand the universe better and then to not tell anyone that you've
*  understood it better seems crazy to me so i really like that part of the um enterprise including
*  making videos and so forth um the biggest ideas videos in particular honestly i think i said this
*  somewhere but maybe didn't get enough credit but my friend lauren gunderson who's a playwright
*  she's actually the most published most produced playwright in the united states working today and
*  when the pandemic hit and when we started to be locked down she started doing playwriting lessons
*  online you know as a way to keep people connected and talking to each other and doing things and
*  learning improving themselves and so that fact that she did that was the immediate inspiration
*  for me for doing the biggest ideas in the universe series i'm like well that's something i can do i
*  can make little videos teaching people about physics and you know the q a videos were uh part
*  of that inspiration that it was not going to be just me talking it would be some interaction of
*  some form right and now the question that i honestly even though it was only last year i don't
*  even remember how i chose exactly the level right so the thing that makes those videos interesting
*  in my mind is that they're higher level and in a form of in the sense of being technical and
*  mathematical than most popular physics discussions while being lower level than most textbook discussions
*  right um so and that's a niche that is that is unfilled to a very large extent and so i'm very
*  happy that the videos ended up being in that niche and i would like to turn them into a book someday
*  that is also in that niche because i think that is is not filled as much as it could be
*  but i really don't remember how conscious that choice was or it was just like i started talking
*  and that's where they went i would have to think back and you know um it all moved very quickly
*  because honestly i had to rush out and get the equipment to uh start the videos before everything
*  locked down and then once i started them i put myself on this weekly uh schedule i didn't have
*  a lot of time to sit back and reflect so they happened you know they were i didn't do a lot
*  of research for them it was just mostly stuff that i thought that i knew already that i could share
*  with a broad audience uh and as everyone knows who saw them my uh video quality fluctuated with time
*  mostly improved but fluctuated a little bit and uh and it was great fun but it wasn't something
*  that i put a lot of pre-planning into um i'm not a really great pre-planner kind of guy like once
*  i'd gone out and purchased the green screen and everything i wanted to start making videos i
*  didn't want to i what i should have done was like watch 20 hours of other youtube videos about how
*  to make good videos right that's what i should have done i didn't do that i just plunged into it
*  and the result is up there and we'll be there on youtube forever or at least as long as there is
*  youtube forever is an exaggeration but i hope people enjoyed it i hope people enjoyed the podcast
*  i hope people enjoyed the ama i hope you uh like how it went i still did probably many
*  probably a little bit too many questions i went too long uh in this ama but um i think it works
*  picking some questions that i want to answer because i'm more enthusiastic about the answering
*  i think maybe that happened maybe i'll try to be even a little bit more um persnickety about which
*  questions to answer next time uh so that i can i can just take the questions that are inspiring
*  me to give interesting answers and focus on those but i do solicit feedback let me know how you think
*  it went thanks for listening bye bye
*  you
