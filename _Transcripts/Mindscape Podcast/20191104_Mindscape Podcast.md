The human brain contains roughly 85 billion neurons, wired together in an extraordinarily complex network of interconnected parts. It’s hardly surprising that we don’t understand the mind and how it works. But do we know enough about our experience of consciousness to suggest that consciousness cannot arise from nothing more than the physical interactions of bits of matter? Panpsychism is the idea that consciousness, or at least some mental aspect, is pervasive in the world, in atoms and rocks as well as in living creatures. Philosopher Philip Goff is one of the foremost modern advocates of this idea. We have a friendly and productive conversation, notwithstanding my own view that the laws of physics don’t need any augmenting to ultimately account for consciousness. If you’re not sympathetic toward panpsychism, this episode will at least help you understand why someone might be.

Philip Goff received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Reading. He is currently Assistant Professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Durham. His new book, Galileo’s Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness, is being published on Nov. 5.

# Mindscape 71 | Philip Goff on Consciousness Everywhere
**Mindscape Podcast:** [November 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfAhup-fDYs)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll, and today we're going to go back into consciousness.
*  Not just the easy problem of consciousness, how the brain looks at the world and figures out what is where and how to respond to it,
*  but the hard problem of consciousness. What makes us who we are, how we experience the world, what it is like to be us,
*  that inner subjective first-person view that we have of reality.
*  Now if you've been following me for a while, you know that I'm a naturalist, I mean physicalist in fact,
*  which means I think the world is made of stuff, obeying the laws of physics, and that's basically it.
*  Except when that stuff comes together to form complicated things, like human beings, there can be new emergent phenomena that arise,
*  and consciousness is one of those. Consciousness is just an aspect of the collective action of underlying stuff, obeying the laws of physics.
*  But you will not be surprised to learn that there are those who disagree, and those who disagree need not be hardcore Cartesian dualists.
*  They don't necessarily think that there's a disembodied mind that somehow interacts with the body.
*  It can also be true that you believe the world is made of physical stuff, but the physical stuff has extra properties, mental properties.
*  And this point of view drives you in the direction of panpsychism, thinking that everything is a little bit conscious.
*  It's not just that something new happens when atoms and particles come together to form a brain,
*  but that there was something that was there all along, and it becomes important and noticeable once you get something like an organism or a brain.
*  So for today's guest we have Philip Goff, who's a professor of philosophy at Durham University in the UK,
*  and one of the leading thinkers on panpsychism. He is all for it, I am against it, so we have a very nice conversation.
*  Philip is the author of an academic book called Consciousness and Fundamental Reality,
*  and also a brand new just published popular level book called Galileo's Error, Foundation for a New Science of Consciousness.
*  So I have fun in the podcast with the idea that I'm on Galileo's side and Philip is against Galileo's side,
*  but basically Philip is also pro Galileo. He thinks that Galileo made a mistake in overly mathematizing the world that we live in,
*  that there's a qualitative aspect to the world as well as a quantitative aspect.
*  So you can listen to what we say back and forth about both sides of this, mostly as usual,
*  I give Philip a chance to give his sales pitch for his side, but you can tell where my sympathies lie.
*  Remember that if you want to support the podcast, you can go to the web page, preposterousuniverse.com slash podcast.

*  Philip Goff, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thank you very much. Good to be here. Thanks for having me.
*  I'm very excited for this podcast because I think, I'm not completely sure, but I think this is the podcast on which the guest and I disagree most strongly about most of the important things we'll be talking about, but in a productive way.
*  And I really think I read you have a new book coming out. I read the book and it's fantastic book, very, very clear statement of the case that you want to make.
*  And that case, of course, is for a panpsychist view of consciousness. So why don't we, you know, we had a, I had a previous interview with David Chalmers and so some of the podcast listeners will have heard that, but not all of them.
*  So let's not assume they know anything. Why don't you tell us why there's a problem with consciousness, what it is that we're trying to figure out when we talk about consciousness?
*  Sure. Well, it's, it's a big discussion, but I think the core of the problem is that physical science works with a purely quantitative vocabulary.
*  Whereas consciousness is an essentially qualitative phenomenon, just in the sense that it involves qualities, the redness of a red experience, the smell of coffee, the taste of mint.
*  And you can't capture, it seems these qualities in the purely quantitative vocabulary of physical science, right? You can't capture in the quantitative language of neuroscience, the redness of a red experience.
*  And so it looks like as long as your, your, your description of the brain is framed in a purely quantitative vocabulary, it seems that you're going to miss out these qualities of consciousness and thereby miss out an essential component of consciousness.
*  So that's the way I like to frame the starting point of the philosophical problem, this clash between the quantities and qualities, the quantities of physical science and the qualities we know from our own first person conscious experience.
*  So for people who do know a little bit about the issue, you're interested here in the hard problem of consciousness, that first person subjective experience, less so in the easy problems about how people behave and how we treat them as conscious creatures, you know, how they perceive the world and things like that.
*  Yeah, I mean, look, there's all sorts of very important things we can do with with neuroscience and neuroscience is absolutely essential for making progress on consciousness. I'm a big fan of neuroscience and, you know, I try to keep as up to date as I can.
*  But I mean, I think essentially, here's another way of putting you know, what neuroscience gives us are correlations between brain activity and conscious experience that you can scan people's brains, you can ask them what they're thinking and feeling.
*  And you can get a rich body of information correlation between certain kinds of brain activity and certain kinds of conscious experience. But that in itself is not the full story.
*  Because if we want a complete theory of consciousness, if we want if you like to move to solving the hard problem, we want to explain those correlations.
*  Right. We want to say, you know, why is it? Why is it when you have such and such brain activity, you have feeling of hunger or whatever.
*  And because of the purely quantitative vocabulary of physical science, it's hard to see how you can provide any such explanation.
*  So, yes, I mean, the starting point is my starting point is we know that consciousness is real.
*  Nothing is more evident than the reality of our feelings and experiences.
*  So we have to find some way of integrating it into our scientific story.
*  But we can and we can build correlations and that's fine.
*  And that's important. But to give a kind of deeper explanation, we come up against this difficulty of the essential qualitative nature of consciousness and the quantitative vocabulary of physical science.
*  So, yeah, that's the challenge. Yeah.
*  And just to preview a little bit, I'm sure we'll get into this in more detail.
*  But my point of view, the point of view of someone like me, which will label the materialist point of view going forward, is that in some very real sense, there is literally nothing else to say.
*  Once you've said what all of the physical stuff in the universe does, right?
*  That what we do when we talk about consciousness or even feelings of experiences and so forth is simply come up with a convenient label for a higher level emergent phenomenon that is ultimately nothing more than physical stuff doing things.
*  And I think and this is really where, you know, David, I guess, and I talked about this a little bit, but I think this is where our conversation is going to be very, very useful in digging into what exactly is meant by that distinction,
*  like whether it is or can be a complete explanation just to say what stuff does.
*  Yeah. And I mean, I think that's a coherent position you just described.
*  And, you know, I read some of your most recent book and yeah, I was actually to say that I was actually struck at how detailed you go into these these contemporary philosophical discussions, you know, because everything's so specialized these days.
*  It's hard to it's hard to learn about.
*  I'm jealous of people in the 17th century where you kind of know everything.
*  It's hard to I know.
*  I'm sure they complain, too.
*  But yeah, but yeah, there was you put quite a lot of research into these the details of these contemporary philosophical discussions.
*  And yeah, I think that's a coherent position you describe.
*  But I suppose if you're going to defend that view, so maybe that's why I probably wouldn't set things up in the way Dave Chalmers does.
*  I mean, that's been a hugely important influential way of setting things up.
*  But you might think it's sort of already assuming what it's trying to prove that, you know, neuroscience can just give us the easy problems.
*  Then there's this hard problem, whereas you might say, I don't see why there's another problem.
*  I don't see why there's another problem.
*  And but so what I would say is, OK, fine.
*  That's a coherent position you've just described.
*  And that would solve the problem if it made sense.
*  But I think you then have an extra explanatory obligation.
*  Right. You've got to, you know, I would say maybe you disagree.
*  I would say that we know from our first person perspective, from our immediate awareness of our own feelings, experiences, we know that consciousness has this qualitative nature.
*  It involves these qualities, the redness of red experience and so on.
*  And I think if you're going to be a materialist, then you owe us an explanation of how that is accounted for in the terms of physical science.
*  And if you don't account for those qualities in the purely quantitative language of physical science, you owe us an explanation, perhaps something like the explanation of the boiling point of water we can give in terms of chemistry.
*  So I think there's at least an explanatory obligation there for the materialist before we can say, OK, that makes sense.
*  Yeah, I think that's perfectly fair. And I'm biting my tongue because I want to try to give such an explanation.
*  But I will give it later or at least we'll talk about it later in the podcast.
*  Let's build our way up. I just wanted to preview for the audience what the stakes were a little bit.
*  You blame Galileo for people like me.
*  This is a very bold move in the book.
*  You know, I mean, Galileo is not one of the people who regularly bash in pop-side discussions.
*  So, you know, maybe give the audience a clue as to what your beef is with Galileo.
*  Sure. Well, you know, look, I'm a big fan of Galileo here as well.
*  I'm being a little bit provocative.
*  By the way, I was just in Florence in Italy, and I don't know if you've ever been there, but there is a Galileo museum where they keep his middle finger, the bones of his middle finger as almost like a religious relic.
*  So did you did you go and pay respects?
*  I did. I did. Yeah, there's no burning of incense or lighting of candles or anything like that.
*  But I did have Alice Drager as a podcast guest earlier, and she wrote a whole book called Galileo's Middle Finger, imagining that Galileo was giving the middle finger to the rest of the world.
*  I don't think that gesture has the same meaning in Italy as it does here.
*  But anyway, yes, we don't actually want to worship Galileo or anybody else.
*  So what's the issue?
*  So a key moment in the scientific revolution is Galileo's declaration that mathematics is to be the language of the new science.
*  So the new science is to have a purely quantitative vocabulary.
*  And so this is a much discussed moment.
*  But what is less focused on what I focus on in my book is the philosophical work Galileo had to do to get to that stage, because before Galileo, people thought the physical world was filled with qualities.
*  So there were colors on the surfaces of objects, smells floating through the air, tastes inside food.
*  And this was a challenge for Galileo's aspiration to give a completely mathematical description of the physical world, because as we've already discussed, it's hard to see how you can capture those kind of qualities in a purely quantitative language.
*  How can you capture in an equation the spiciness of paprika?
*  So Galileo got around this by proposing a radically new philosophical theory of reality.
*  And according to this theory, those qualities aren't really out there in the physical world.
*  Rather, they're in the consciousness of the observer, which crucially Galileo took to be outside of the domain of science.
*  So the redness isn't really on the surface of the tomato.
*  It's in the consciousness of the person perceiving the tomato, or the spiciness isn't really inside the paprika.
*  It's in the consciousness of the person eating it.
*  So Galileo, as it were, stripped the world of its qualities.
*  And after he'd done that, all that remained were the purely quantitative features of matter, size, shape, location, motion, things that can be captured in mathematical geometry.
*  So there is this radical division, radical dualism in Galileo's picture between the physical world with its purely quantitative properties, which is the domain of science, and consciousness with its qualities, which is outside of the domain of science.
*  So this is the start of mathematical physics, which has obviously gone very well.
*  But, you know, crucially, Galileo, at least, only intended it to be a partial description of reality, right?
*  The whole project was premised on setting consciousness outside of the domain of science.
*  So I think this is really important because it's generally accepted now that consciousness does pose a serious scientific problem, which is not always the case.
*  But a lot of people have this following reaction.
*  They say, OK, you know, there's a serious problem here, but we just need to do more neuroscience and we'll sort it out.
*  And I think the reason they think that is because they they look at the great successes of physical science and explaining more and more of our universe.
*  And they think, you know, of course, one day it's it's going to crack consciousness.
*  But the irony is, I would argue that physical science has been so successful precisely because it was designed to ignore consciousness.
*  That was the whole setup. So I think if Galileo were to time travel to the present day and hear about this hard problem of explaining consciousness in terms of physical science, he'd say, of course you can't do that.
*  I designed physical science to deal with qualities, not quantities.
*  Sorry, the other way around. I designed physical science to deal with quantities, not qualities.
*  So so this is what I'm trying to push here.
*  And we're not really at the stage of arguments.
*  It's a sort of narrative that I think I as a philosopher, I spend a lot of time on these fiddly arguments and I think they're important.
*  And maybe we can have some of those.
*  But I think really at the end of the day, it's it's the big picture that grabs people.
*  Yeah, big pictures such as you present in your book, you know, that like the success of science, physical science in particular.
*  Of course, it's going to explain consciousness one day.
*  But I think actually there's a different way of looking at the history of science such that that conclusion does not obviously follow.
*  In fact, we're probably led in something of the opposite direction.
*  So that's just so people know.
*  In fact, yeah, your your book is entitled Galileo's error foundations for a new science of consciousness.
*  So I'm happy to take the pro Galileo point of view for the rest of the podcast while you take on the plucky underdog.
*  Well, you should be a due list if you're going to take the pro Galileo position.
*  Galileo's position.
*  No, I'm just I think that I am what Galileo would have evolved into.
*  That's that's my goal.
*  Obviously, Galileo lived a long time ago and I don't really think this is jumping ahead once again, but I don't really think that it's putting consciousness aside.
*  I think that it is understanding these quantitative features of the world as ways of talking about the qualitative features of the world.
*  That's it. That's how I would put it.
*  But I mean, if I can just I can I just I'm inclined to think I'm what Galileo would have evolved into because I think I think Galileo took physical science with him.
*  He took physical science very seriously, but he also took the qualitative reality of consciousness very seriously.
*  And I and I think, you know, I think well, what we'll eventually get to is a way of bringing both together.
*  And so, yeah, anyway, from what I know about Galileo's personality, he would not have been very happy with a book called Galileo's error.
*  That's true. That's true. Fair enough. Fair enough.
*  But so good. Let's I think we have interesting things to talk about.
*  So let's quickly dispatch what I think is the least interesting thing, which is the idea of dualism.
*  Right. The the old fashioned Cartesian idea that there is a mind distinct from the body without localization in space or time immaterial that somehow talks to it.
*  So you're not in favor of that. And neither am I.
*  So let's explain why.
*  Yes, I think maybe the problems of dualism are perhaps of a more straightforwardly scientific form.
*  So maybe the problems of materialism are more philosophical in nature.
*  Problems of materialism, dualism, sorry, are more straightforwardly scientific.
*  So most dualists, although they think the mind and the brain are distinct, they they also want to hold that they stand in an intimate causal relationship so that they, you know,
*  when light hits the retina of the eye, makes changes in the brain, which will bring about visual experiences in the soul or vice versa.
*  You know, the decisions of the soul to raise the arm, make changes in the brain and cause the arm to go.
*  So so there's an intimate causal relationship there.
*  So from my point of view, if there were an immaterial entity impacting on the brain every second of waking life,
*  you know, I think that would really show up in our neuroscience.
*  There'd be all sorts of things happening in the brain that had no physical explanation.
*  It'd be like a poltergeist was playing with the brain.
*  And I think that's not what we see.
*  And so I think that gives us an ever growing sort of inductive argument against dualism.
*  So, I mean, I wouldn't want to completely stop taking dualism seriously.
*  I, you know, I'm mine.
*  I think there are a lot of including David Chalmers himself, a lot of interesting work done on this.
*  But to my mind, it's it's got a bit of a hurdle to overcome with those kind of problems.
*  Yeah. And I completely agree with everything you said.
*  And I said similar things in the big picture, just again, because people might have some familiarity with the discourse here.
*  There is a distinction drawn between property dualists and substance dualists, property dualists thinking that there's truly the mind is truly another kind.
*  Sorry. Substance dualists thinking that the mind is truly another kind of substance.
*  And I don't think that Chalmers is that.
*  But property dualists thinking that there are different kinds of properties that physical stuff has, physical properties and mental properties.
*  And I think that Chalmers, to the extent that he will allow himself to be pinned down to any actual position, is probably something closer to that.
*  And maybe you have some sympathies along those lines, too.
*  Yeah. So more this tends to the property dualist position tends to go along with, at least in the day in David Chalmers case, the commitment to special psychophysical laws.
*  That if you just had the laws of physics, the thought is you wouldn't have consciousness.
*  We'd all be zombies.
*  But these special psychophysical laws that are as fundamental as the laws of physics, because those laws are governing when you have certain physical states of affairs, they give rise to consciousness.
*  Actually, I mean, let me say it's interesting to say often when I'm talking to people who consider themselves materialists, they will often say, oh, yeah, they often take that to be the view that the brain produces consciousness.
*  But that's not materialism, right?
*  That's dualism. If the brain produces consciousness, then consciousness is this extra stuff.
*  So I actually think at least among sort of people just thinking about this in general, I think a lot of people who think themselves materialists actually turn out to be property dualists.
*  And when I found actually when I explained to them what materialism is, they're like, oh, no, that's crazy.
*  Of course, they're horrified.
*  So, so, yeah, so you might find that.
*  But this is exactly why philosophy is important, right?
*  Because people think that they have a view on something and they haven't really thought it through and they talk in sloppy ways.
*  And so you can analyze what's going on and go, no, no, no, your implications are not quite what are implied by your assumptions.
*  Absolutely.
*  So, okay, good.
*  So let's let's not even spend too much time.
*  We should pause to give credit to Princess Elizabeth, who was the first to raise this problem of how the immaterial mind is supposed to interact with the body, which is now grown up to be called the interaction problem.
*  And are there are there many actual hardcore substance dualists hanging around these days in philosophy departments?
*  Just a quick word on Princess Elizabeth.
*  So she was expressing worries about the intelligibility of the relationship between something physical and something nonphysical.
*  I think most people these days don't worry so much about that.
*  It's more of that would be a more philosophical worry.
*  The worry these days is more an empirical concern of the sort we can talk about.
*  But are there many substance units?
*  Actually, I'm not so sure Charmers is not is not so unsympathetic to substance dualism, actually.
*  And definitely Martina Nieder-Rumelan, who's in the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, is an excellent philosopher and substance dualist of some kind.
*  But she's, you know, she's, as I say, in my book, she's a, you know, she's a passionate atheist and she's she just thinks that the conscious mind is not physical,
*  but it's a natural phenomenon that arises from the physical and is law governed.
*  And so I think I think actually she's motivated to substance dualism, at least in part because of thoughts about identity over time.
*  I think some substance do that. Maybe we don't want to get into all that. But some people are worried about the way function of the universe starts branching into multiple copies.
*  It raises a whole nother conundrum for those kinds of things.
*  You're not going to be worried about it in that case. Yeah.
*  So I think that might be part of the motivation for people.
*  Yeah. All right.
*  So brushing that aside, hundreds of years of very difficult work in philosophy and consciousness studies, materialism.
*  So we have the idea post Galileo that, you know, we're made of these things.
*  We can describe them mathematically.
*  There is this always this slight footnote to trying to be a good materialist, which is that what we think the material actually is changes over time.
*  Right. Like Galileo would have thought it's one thing and then atoms came along and then quantum mechanics came along.
*  So it's hard even to pin down what you mean by materialism or physicalism.
*  I will I will grant that. But I think the basic idea is that there is stuff.
*  The stuff obeys the laws of physics. The laws of physics are impersonal.
*  Right. Their equations may be differential equations, maybe something more advanced than that.
*  And that's it. In some level, we could talk about the entire world in just those terms.
*  But then there are other higher level ways, sort of useful, effective theories or whatever you want to call them,
*  which come closer to our folk view of the world where there are people and intentions and thoughts and so forth.
*  So you're not on board with that very sensible perspective.
*  Do you want to give us your favorite arguments against it?
*  Oh, yeah, actually, I'm not I don't want to get lost in your last lost in definitions.
*  But I'm not sure any of that was inconsistent with panpsychism.
*  You said actually the I did say all there is.
*  Well, maybe we'll get to that.
*  I mean, just I mean, the way I would define materialism, actually,
*  I don't know if you said that is that fundamental nature reality can be captured with a purely quantitative vocabulary involving just mathematical and causal terms.
*  So that that's at least part of the definition.
*  Would you be happy with that?
*  Well, I I'm willing to be happy with it.
*  When you say it out loud, it strikes me as odd because we're trying to define materialism.
*  And the operative words in your definition were things like math and quantitative.
*  And that seems to be a slight sliding of what you're really aiming at here.
*  I mean, my my definition, whatever it would be, and I don't claim to have the world's most perfect definition, but stuff obeying the laws of physics.
*  And that's a complete description.
*  Like there's no extra properties over and about the physical properties.
*  That's the panpsychic.
*  The panpsychic thinks that as well.
*  Well, we'll get there.
*  We'll get there. OK, good.
*  But you don't let's put it this way.
*  Let's operationalize it.
*  You don't agree with materialism.
*  So tell me why you don't agree.
*  Yeah. Sorry.
*  Get locked in.
*  Let's philosophers get lost in pedantry.
*  No, it's important.
*  I'm very happy to do that.
*  OK. And so well, it really comes back to the to what we were talking about earlier.
*  So I mean, maybe here's another way of putting it.
*  I know from your perspective.
*  So what is the job of a theory of reality?
*  What are we trying to you know, what's the data for a theory of reality?
*  And I guess I think I think you think that the data is the data of observation and experiment.
*  Right. If you've if you've got a theory that can account for very roughly,
*  maybe you want to know if you can account for all of the data of observation experiment
*  in the most satisfying, elegant, simple way.
*  You have job done.
*  Whereas I think that's that's not enough.
*  There's something there's another bit of data.
*  There's something else we know to be real, namely consciousness.
*  And it's not something we know from observation and experiment.
*  You know, if you look inside someone's head, you can't see their feelings and experiences.
*  So if you know, if you're just aim is just to account for observation experiment,
*  then you never have any reason to postulate consciousness.
*  I think Daniel Dennett is wonderfully consistent on this.
*  But we do know that consciousness exists.
*  We know it from our immediate awareness of our own feelings and experiences.
*  In fact, I think Descartes was right that it's the reality of consciousness
*  is known with a greater certainty than anything about the external world.
*  And that's an extra datum that needs to be accounted for.
*  And we can't assume from the start that the postulations we made to account for observation
*  experiment will also account for this other data.
*  In fact, you know, in a way, it'd be strange if it did.
*  Right. Given that, you know, what you deal in, the postulations you deal in are tailored for a specific
*  purpose, explaining observation experiment, it would be kind of weird if they also explained
*  the subjective qualities that we're aware of in a completely different way.
*  So that's just a sort of prima facie thing.
*  But but then coming to the crux of it, I think there's this good reason to think that the
*  postulations of physical science alone cannot account for the reality of consciousness.
*  And again, it's coming back to the issue that consciousness has a purely sorry, consciousness has a
*  qualitative nature, whereas physical science deals with this purely quantitative vocabulary.
*  So let me put the point again in a slightly different way.
*  You cannot convey.
*  So I don't think it's just that when people have heard about Dave's Hard Problems, sometimes they think,
*  Oh, we just haven't got the solution yet.
*  So but I think that's to not to get to the philosophical core of here of this.
*  The problem is you cannot even capture the qualities of consciousness in the language of neuroscience.
*  And one way to see that if you could, if you could capture what it's like to see red in the language of
*  neuroscience, you could convey to a blind from birth neuroscientist what it's like to see red, the
*  qualitative qualitative character of red experience, which seems absurd.
*  You know, you could only know what it's like to see red when you actually have a red experience.
*  So I don't think you can even because of its limited vocabulary, I don't think you can even capture the
*  qualities of consciousness in the language of neuroscience.
*  So that's a kind of expressive limitation.
*  And I think that expressive limitation implies an explanatory limitation, you know, because if if you were
*  going to explain the qualities of consciousness in the language of neuroscience, it seems to me you'd
*  have to convey those qualities in the language of neuroscience and then explain them in more fundamental
*  physical terms.
*  If you can't even convey them, you can't even express them, then I don't think you can explain them.
*  So I think there are good in principle reasons to think, you know, neuroscience alone, physical science
*  alone, because of its quantitative vocabulary, can't give us a complete account of this phenomenon we know to be
*  real.
*  So it can't be complete.
*  It can't be true.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that this is exactly what I really wanted to dig into.
*  I completely agree that consciousness is real.
*  I've never been very sympathetic to people who said it was an illusion.
*  I mean, Dennett, I think he's maybe less consistent or less clear than you can credit for it because like he gets upset
*  when people say he denies the reality of consciousness.
*  So, you know, but he does sometimes seem to be calling it illusion.
*  And I'm not sure where to land.
*  I don't think it's an illusion.
*  I think it's a higher level emerging phenomenon.
*  I think that's a very different thing.
*  So I'm torn.
*  Let me let me I'll give you two choices.
*  I want to talk about zombies.
*  I want to talk about intrinsic natures.
*  Which do you think makes sense to talk about first?
*  Let's go with zombies before.
*  Yeah.
*  Before answering, because I want to get into the details of what you just said, but a nice little, you know, thought experiment on the table would be useful.
*  So give me your version of the of the zombie argument.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't tend to.
*  You prefer zombies rather than Mary.
*  I think, you know, Mary is easy.
*  I mean, even even Frank Jackson, who invented Mary, gave up on her eventually.
*  So I think I'm on firm ground there.
*  So why don't you tell us about Mary, the color scientist?
*  Yeah, I think I prefer Mary in some way.
*  It seems to always get it gets very technical.
*  The zombie argument, I think.
*  Right. So Mary is sorry.
*  I mean, just just to put it on the table.
*  I think that zombies are the world's best argument against panpsychism, which I do want to talk about at some point.
*  But we can talk about Mary first.
*  OK, cool.
*  So I think it's a way of it's really just a way of explicating and giving further to support to what I've already been talking about.
*  So Mary is this genius color scientist who knows everything neuroscience can teach you about color experience.
*  So, you know, the wavelengths hitting the eyes, the changes that makes in the brain, how it gives rise to various forms of behavior.
*  But for some reason, it's never explained.
*  She's been raised in a black and white room.
*  Right. I think the back story, the exposition is not very good.
*  OK, I think in a way we could have just had a colorblind neuroscientist or something.
*  Does this guy know be who's a who's a color expert who can only see black and white and shades of gray and has written some interesting stuff from his own position?
*  Anyway. Right.
*  Anyway, so let's come back to Mary.
*  So she knows everything there is to know, everything neuros.
*  Sorry, I should say everything neuroscience can teach you about color experience.
*  And then one day, but she's never actually seen colors because of this black and white room.
*  And one day, again, not explained, she's liberated from a black and white room and she sees colors for the first time.
*  So the proponent of the argument says at this point, she learns something new.
*  She learns what it's like to see color.
*  One problem with this is so that's the story.
*  And because the story is so simple, I think people are often too quick to think they've got the argument.
*  But so here's the argument, the knowledge argument that's based on this story.
*  The thought is if materialism is true, then in principle, neuroscience ought to be able to give us a complete story of the essential nature of color experience, a complete account of what's going on.
*  Mary, by stipulation, knows that.
*  So there ought to be nothing more she can learn about the nature of color experience.
*  She knows it all.
*  The analogy I give in my book is, you know, if you've got the complete final theory of black holes, right, you ought to be able to it ought to be the case that you can't learn anything new, any new essential features of black holes because you've got the complete final theory.
*  So it ought to be if materialism is true, there's nothing more that Mary can learn.
*  And yet, when she comes out of her room, she does gain some new information about the essential nature of color experience.
*  She learns what it's like to see color.
*  And this is information that couldn't be got from the neuroscience.
*  And so in some sense, the neuroscientific account must have been incomplete because there's information about color experience that goes beyond what the neuroscience can provide.
*  And then so just to link it back to what I've been talking about a lot already, what is that information?
*  What does she learn?
*  She learns about the qualitative character of colors, the redness of a red experience.
*  That's what a congenitally blind neuroscientist, no matter how much neuroscience they learn, will never know about.
*  So there's there's information there that goes beyond what neuroscience can capture.
*  That's it. So I was a bit long winded.
*  No, no, this is good.
*  So here's what I would say about that.
*  I mean, I have a long thing to say.
*  Let me just say the short thing.
*  If Mary knows everything about the neuroscience of color, that is to say, what exactly happens in a human brain when a human being looks at something that is red?
*  Clearly, that is different from experiencing red.
*  No one argues with that.
*  Right.
*  And so the analogy to me is if I give you all the laws of particle physics and atomic physics and gravity and so forth, and you know them and you have the equations in front of you and then I say, OK, tell me about the life cycle of a star.
*  Well, that's in principle.
*  You could figure it out in practice.
*  There's enormous amount of work to do.
*  In principle, Mary could say, OK, all I need to do is to have my neurons fire in the following way, which are the ways that they fire if I were seeing red.
*  So I will hook myself up to the correct electro stimulator machine and I will make those neurons fire in the right way.
*  And I will experience the experience of red.
*  And I don't see anything in there that gets in the way of being a materialist.
*  Yeah, but if you're learning the theory of black holes.
*  So, yeah, I completely agree.
*  I think this is I think there's a little bit of it.
*  People always think the argument is about the change in Mary.
*  You know, that how come she can't she knows all the neuroscience.
*  How come she can't experience red?
*  That's not the argument.
*  Of course, of course, you know, the materialism, the materialist does not have to deal.
*  That's not a problem for materialists.
*  But look, look, notice the disanalogy, right?
*  To know the relevant facts about black holes, you picked a complicated example.
*  But let me start again.
*  To know all the facts about black holes, you don't have to become a black hole.
*  It ought to be the case that you can know everything there is to know about color experience from the neuroscience and materialism is true.
*  Not saying you ought to be able to experience colors.
*  No, that's not the point.
*  You ought to be able to know all the facts from the neuroscience.
*  And you've just conceded that you can't do that.
*  You have to she has to have changes in neurons.
*  Why? Why does she have to do that?
*  If materialism is true, if materialism is true,
*  all the information should be there in the neuroscience and she's got it.
*  You know, you don't have to turn yourself into a black hole to learn the theory of black holes.
*  Why do you have to make changes to your brain to know the full theory of what color experience is?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's because you've set up the question a certain way.
*  Like you need to be a black hole to know what it is like to be a black hole.
*  And of course, the difference, which I which I completely agree with,
*  is that black holes don't have self-awareness or thoughts or anything like that.
*  You can argue that there isn't anything that it's like to be a black hole.
*  I can see that there is something it is like to be a person.
*  But that's because we have the capacity to hold in our brains representations of ourselves and, you know, attitudes towards things.
*  And therefore, it's not I would say that's not a very good analogy.
*  There is something that that is different, even if you're a materialist.
*  Do you think there's information, Mary in a black and white room?
*  Do you think there's information about the nature of color experience she doesn't have?
*  Um, in principle, no.
*  But but again, I'm conceding that it is different to know a bunch of facts about neuroscience and to experience something.
*  I just think that from knowing those facts about neuroscience, you can experience something without actually experiencing it.
*  You can make your brain do the things that it would do if you were experiencing it.
*  And that would be the same as actually experiencing it, because all that's happening is things that are happening in your neurons.
*  So I think there's two different things going on here.
*  One is a question of complexity, the principle question.
*  And that was your life cycle of a star. What was it? The life of a star?
*  Yeah. And this is something Dennett often presses.
*  And I think it's a little bit of a red herring.
*  It's maybe an unfortunate consequence of the way Jackson set up the thought experiment.
*  He said, you know, she knows everything physical, you know, every quark and every.
*  But I don't think you need to set it up like that.
*  Presumably, you know, the future neuroscientific theory is just going to be, you know, a natural extension of what we have today.
*  So I don't think it's implausible to think a normal human being could know that.
*  So I don't think so. I think we can set on one side these worries about in principle knowing the point is, as you accept to do some information here.
*  That you have to make changes to your brain to get that information.
*  And I'm suggesting if materialism is true, that's weird.
*  Why would you have to make changes to your brain to get the information?
*  So we're all let me put it, we're all agreeing that you have to make changes to have the experience.
*  But I suppose the way we're why do you have to have the experience to get the information?
*  That's the question. Yeah.
*  That doesn't seem even a little bit surprising to me.
*  Like I could tell you in gruesome detail the correct way to shoot a free throw in basketball.
*  And you can sit at your desk and you can study everything there is to know about shooting a free throw.
*  And if you've never shot a free throw before, you're not going to be very good at it.
*  Because the way that we learn things through our eyes and our ears and recording information is just different than how our body reacts to these things.
*  That's not surprising as a materialist.
*  OK, good, good.
*  Now what you're presenting, I think, is what's known as the ability hypothesis response, right?
*  Which is originally by what's his name?
*  Nemerov, Leonard Nemerov, was it?
*  And but it was defended by David Lewis, who's quite a big figure in philosophy, philosophy generally.
*  So anyway, the view is here.
*  So I keep trying to press on you.
*  Information, there's information Mary can't get in a black room.
*  But what Lewis says is, and Nemerov, she doesn't gain new information.
*  She gains new know how, new abilities.
*  That's what she learns.
*  She learns how to imagine red, categorize things as red, remember red and so on.
*  So she gains new know how.
*  Now that's a perfectly good response because then neuroscience gives you all the information.
*  She just gained some new abilities.
*  That's not a problem for materialism.
*  OK, so I think there are a couple of problems with this response.
*  Do you want a technical one or an intuitive one?
*  Give us both.
*  Give us whatever you think you want.
*  I'll let you decide.
*  Technical is fine.
*  We're not we have an hour long here.
*  You know, plenty of time.
*  The technical one is it seems you can put these sentences about what it's like to see red into deductive syllogisms.
*  So you could say Mary could say this is what it's like for me to see red.
*  Then this is what it's like for Billy to see red.
*  This is what it's like for me to see red.
*  Therefore, it is what it's like for Billy to see red.
*  So there's a valid truth preserving argument there.
*  Now, forget whether the premises are true or false.
*  But it seems to show that these what it's likeness sentences are truth claims.
*  And the problem with the ability hypothesis is it doesn't have any account of that.
*  It just talks about abilities.
*  But abilities are not the same as truth claims.
*  So that's the sort of.
*  Well, this is actually I mean, maybe maybe it would be helpful to talk a little bit about intrinsic natures, which I mentioned before.
*  And you talk about in the book, because I think that this is the fundamental underlying issue that we have that Galileo and I have with you and panpsychist.
*  The idea that Galileo is on my side.
*  Well, you know, I didn't write a book saying made an error.
*  So, you know, you've you've built your house.
*  You got to live in it. I'll stop interrupting.
*  I think. Yeah.
*  So well, I mean, why don't you say I shouldn't put words in your mouth.
*  Why don't you tell us what you mean by the idea that physics doesn't tell us physics tells us what things do, but it doesn't tell us about their intrinsic natures.
*  And this is also it goes back to Bertrand Russell.
*  Right. And yeah.
*  I actually learned from your book that Russell was one of the one of the big names in panpsychism.
*  I didn't know that. Yeah.
*  Well, actually, Russell, as I put in some of the footnotes, didn't quite have a panpsychist interpretation of it, but he didn't quite get there.
*  Yeah, it's as close as damage just because he had some funny terminological issues.
*  But anyway, yeah.
*  So I think actually there's been a real resurgence of interest in panpsychism in academic philosophy in the last eight to ten years.
*  It's gone from being laughed at in so far as it was thought of at all to being taken quite seriously.
*  And I think this is largely due to the rediscovery of this work, important work from the 1920s by Arthur Eddington, scientist and Bertrand Russell.
*  So I'm inclined to think these guys did in the 1920s for the science of consciousness, what Darwin did for the science of life in the 19th century.
*  And it's sort of a tragedy of history that it got kind of forgotten about.
*  And OK, so the starting point is, as you were just alluding to, that physics tells us a lot less than you might think about the nature of physical reality.
*  So in the public mind, physics is giving us this complete story of the nature of space and time and matter.
*  But what Russell and Eddington realized is actually upon reflection, it turns out that physical science is confined to telling us about the behavior of matter, about what it does.
*  So physics talks about mass and charge.
*  We characterize mass in terms of gravitational attraction, resistance to acceleration.
*  Charge is characterized in terms of attraction and repulsion.
*  This all concerns what particles or fields do, right?
*  Physics is completely silent on what philosophers like to call the intrinsic nature of a physical entity, how it is in and of itself, independently of its behavior.
*  And so this is sometimes called the problem of intrinsic natures.
*  It looks like there's this huge hole in our scientific story of the universe.
*  And then so what just the link to consciousness very briefly, I think the genius of Russell and Eddington was to bring together two problems that on the face of it have nothing much to do with each other.
*  The problem of consciousness and the problem of intrinsic natures.
*  So the problem of consciousness is roughly the need to find a place for consciousness in our scientific story.
*  The problem of intrinsic natures is that we have this huge hole in our scientific story of the universe.
*  So the unified solution is put consciousness in the hole.
*  So we're looking for a place for consciousness.
*  We've got this big hole. Put consciousness in the hole.
*  So the resulting theory is a kind of panpsychism.
*  You just matter or just physical stuff, fields maybe.
*  There's nothing spiritual or supernatural.
*  But physical reality can be described as it were from two perspectives.
*  Physical science describes it as it were from the outside, tells us rich information about its behavior.
*  But as it were from the inside, its intrinsic nature is constituted of forms of consciousness.
*  So this is a beautifully simple, elegant, unified way of integrating consciousness into our scientific worldview.
*  And in contrast to dualism, it's consistent with everything we know empirically.
*  So from my perspective, just final sentence, we've got this challenge of how do we bring together what we know empirically about the physical world from natural science and what we know, this qualitative reality we know from our immediate awareness of consciousness.
*  This gives us a way of bringing it together in a way that's entirely consistent with both.
*  So that's the big picture of the view I try to defend.
*  Yeah. And I think the reason why I wanted to bring that up right now is because it is the underlying, to me, the underlying source of all of our other disagreements in some sense.
*  I totally would buy the idea that once you've told me what the stuff does, you're done.
*  There isn't anything else. There is no such thing as the intrinsic nature of stuff.
*  And I think maybe this is where you can educate me.
*  I think that reflects back onto our discussion about Mary, the whether or not or just more more generally what it is like to be something.
*  I think what it is like to be something, what it's like to experience red ultimately is a description of certain things going on in our neurons and our bodies.
*  And I don't have a strong opinion about whether or not there are truth claims associated with that that are sort of intermined.
*  Like, you know, the old question of whether the red eye sees the same as the red you see, I'm not sure whether that has a sensible explanation.
*  But I do think that when I say I'm experiencing red, that not only correlates exactly with certain neurons doing something in my brain, but is just a way of saying that certain neurons are doing something in my brain.
*  So I think that that is the same as the intrinsic nature disagreement.
*  Let me just say one thing. I wouldn't.
*  I think you do have a coherent position and I wouldn't describe it as denying the reality of consciousness.
*  You had these dialogues in your book of sort of people think that's denying consciousness and maybe some of my anti-physicalist comrades would say that.
*  But if that view works out, I think it's clearly accepting the reality of consciousness.
*  You know, I just don't think it's ultimately coherent.
*  That was just a brief point. I'm not inclined to agree that this comes down to whether we need intrinsic natures.
*  You know, to my mind, that's as distinct and, you know, more contentious view.
*  I can imagine being persuaded. We could look at some of the arguments if you want to as to why we need to postulate intrinsic natures at all.
*  But I can imagine being persuaded that, sure, we don't need there's a coherent picture of the world in which there's no intrinsic natures.
*  And so I on this kind of view, things are just doings rather than beings.
*  You know, once you've said what it does, you've said everything.
*  But I still think I would think, well, does this.
*  Qualitative reality. What about these qualities?
*  We need some account of them.
*  And I haven't yet heard an explanation in physical science terms.
*  So I would push these arguments that they're in principle reasons to thinking that can't be done.
*  So I guess I would be inclined to think these are these are distinct issues.
*  I mean, I guess where I where it became unclear to me is when you bring up the qualitative features, the qualitative experiences and so forth,
*  I mean, that maybe I'm getting this wrong, but it kind of at least reminds me resonates with the idea that there is something over and above what the things are doing.
*  And maybe it's not intrinsic nature. Yeah.
*  It's still something over and above what things are doing.
*  So maybe put it like this.
*  I guess I think there are two reasons why we need intrinsic natures.
*  One, I'm not sure it's intelligible to have a picture of the world without them.
*  Forget about consciousness and we could get into those arguments maybe or not.
*  But the other is.
*  There is this reality we know about.
*  And it's hard and it's hard to see how you can account for it in causal structural terms.
*  But that's that's in a way that there's two steps to that argument.
*  One is there is this data we need to account for.
*  And secondly, to my mind, there are good arguments why it can't be accounted for in causal structural terms.
*  So I suppose there you get the implication that it's a kind of intrinsic nature.
*  Yeah. Yeah, maybe that's right.
*  But it's maybe it is worth.
*  I want to give you a chance to give the positive case an explanation for panpsychism, which we've kind of only alluded to so far.
*  But I think because I do think that this kind of divergence is at the heart of all of our divergences,
*  maybe it is worth saying some words about why you think that intrinsic natures really are.
*  If I if I knew all of the mathematical structures and causal relationships among the physical stuff of the universe and could say what everything did,
*  there would still be something lacking.
*  So I don't think there's anything lacking once that happens.
*  And you do. Tell me. Tell us why.
*  OK. Let's get into that argument.
*  But I think I've just clarified to myself what's going on.
*  So I think it's you seem to be saying that the the the the the the the the the the the whatever happens and everything.
*  You seem to be saying that the I believe in intrinsic nature's because I think consciousness is irreducible
*  Not the other way around right? So it's not like I start off saying oh there must be these intrinsic natures
*  It's because of consciousness but but also I do think there must be intrinsic nature so so maybe we could maybe maybe we could get
*  in fact, so I guess
*  People might be logically separate, but they're in the same spirit. That's all I would write right those two facts
*  Yeah, it's interesting thought it might be something I might have to think a little bit more about
*  So
*  People
*  Defending this this Russell Addington picture going right back to Russell have tried to defend this
*  This kind of argument to the conclusion that a world without intrinsic nature's is just unintelligible
*  And you know I go a little bit back and forward on these arguments. I have to say I'm not I'm not a
*  I'm not a hundred percent committed, but the thought is without intrinsic nature's
*  Everything ends up being defined in terms of everything else and you end up in a kind of vicious circle, so I have an appendix
*  To one of the chapters of a book so the thought is you know you start off saying
*  What's mass and you say you know let's just keep things simple. Let's ignore general relativity, and you just say oh, it's it's
*  You know it causes gravitational attraction
*  They say and they said okay, well what's what's attraction?
*  You say well, it's you know it's when I don't know the distance between bodies is decreased
*  and you say well, what's distance and then you kind of get another bunch of equations that
*  Explicates distance in terms of other physical properties like mass and charge and you quickly find yourself back in a circle and without any way of
*  Getting an independent grip on any of these properties
*  It looks like these definitions just don't get off the ground so the analogy I give in the book is
*  Suppose I've got three matchboxes
*  And I say there's this in the first one is a splurge in the second one is a bludge
*  And then the third one is a kerge
*  And you say what's a bludge and I say oh, that's easy. It's a the bludge is something that makes splurges
*  You say okay? Well, I don't know what that means until I know what a splurge is what's a splurge
*  And I say splurge is the thing that makes kerges
*  And you say well
*  I don't know what that means either to know what a kerges and I say well
*  It's a thing that makes splurges and you don't know what the hell is in the matchboxes
*  so I sort of think that's actually how and this is how Russell thought this is actually how physics works it everything's interdefined and
*  So without a kind of independent grip we don't really get an understanding of what any of these things are
*  So that was the kind of argument he pressed
*  What do you reckon yeah, I will just very quickly say why I did not find that argument convincing
*  But I'm glad that it's out there. I agree that an individual term like mass
*  Can't be defined without talking about other things. There's absolutely
*  interconnectedness but rather than sir excuse me rather than circularity
*  I would just say one defines an entire formal system
*  Space-time is a four-dimensional manifold Lorentz metric blah blah blah, and there's a whole bunch of
*  Individually very well defined parts of that formal system
*  And then one maps it on to the data of our experience and says we've explained the world. I don't think it's circular
*  I do think it's interconnected, so I'm not convinced there you go
*  But what if I say you know what is a field tell me what a field is Oh?
*  Field is a section of a fiber bundle. I mean
*  These are there is a mathematical formalism, and I can pinpoint individual parts of it
*  So I don't care to talk about the intrinsic nature of them
*  That's that's my escape hatch right if I don't care about what it really is if I just care about where it is in the math
*  Then I'm done
*  But I mean even if you're taking
*  Yes, if it this depends
*  There are a couple of different issues here one is
*  There are two subtly related views
*  I mean, I guess you're defending a kind of what's called ontic structuralism that in some sense is just structure
*  but there are two closely related views here one is a
*  Pure structuralism where there's just what can be captured mathematically
*  Another is
*  Causal structuralism, which is a little bit more modest. It's what can be captured with mathematics and causal terms
*  and on that view
*  We ultimately define the nature of things in terms of what they do
*  Would you say that you were going for the former or the latter I think of the former yeah
*  I'm not a fan of causal terms at fundamental ontology
*  right, right
*  So so the world can be just entirely captured in mathematical language
*  yeah, so there is the world and
*  There is a mathematical formal system, and there's an isomorphism between them and to you know
*  It's all complicated and philosophy is necessary because there's also our folk experience of the world
*  Which is like a third thing that we have to map onto both of those in interesting ways, but it's it's a coherent
*  Set of interconnections not a circular argument. That's that's the thing. Okay. Well, I think in that case, maybe we
*  Could just sympathetic to kind of human. I think maybe we've been talking slightly across purposes because
*  That argument is more an attack on people who?
*  Want to take
*  Causation as a fundamental feature and we define the nature of say an electron in terms of what it does
*  Yeah, I think that problem goes away a little bit
*  If you just think and in fact there has been a reply to there was a volume of essays on on this
*  This form of panpsychism and a listen a who's a philosopher very good philosopher of physics
*  Is replying in exactly these ways arguing that?
*  That you know, we could just have the wave function or something in the expressed in completely mathematical language
*  Just parenthetically I am the author of an idea called mad dog ever ready an ism where
*  literally all that exists is a
*  vector in a giant Hilbert space representing the universe and
*  Hamiltonian that tells us how it evolves and everything else space time matter
*  Particle fields are just particular human constructions to conveniently talk about what that wave function does over time
*  sure
*  Yeah, so so
*  So I guess at that point
*  What what I would say is okay, maybe
*  Are you familiar with Newman's problem
*  Have you heard that I've heard of it, but I couldn't explain it. So why don't you explain it? Yes
*  Well, the problem is I can't remember the details either but
*  Yeah, okay
*  So the I mean the way I've thought about these things is that the causal structuralism faces this regress problem and the more pure
*  structuralism faces Newman's problem, but
*  It's a while since I've looked at the details of so I don't think I'd be able to defend that but let's say let's say you
*  persuade me that
*  That the mad dog ever ready
*  That the mad dog everettianism you've just described is
*  Describes a possible reality
*  And that that theory can account for
*  Data all the data of observation experiments
*  Then I then I'd say fine that's that's fair enough, but I'd say well look there's this other Dayton
*  Well, how do you account for this?
*  of
*  What the qualitative reality of consciousness and and then we'd be back to the knowledge argument we'd be back to to
*  My claim that you can't account for that in the purely quantitative vocabulary. So so in a way look I just think
*  The reality of consciousness is a datum in its own right over and above the data of
*  Experiments and observation so if you've got a theory that can account for all the data of observation experiments, but you can't account for this
*  Then your theory doesn't work and you said I mean, I guess you've said okay, of course, you're not gonna want to deny
*  Consciousness but
*  You know in all of the cases that's an option, right?
*  That's if you know that there are lots of phenomena that are difficult to fit into our scientific worldview
*  You know facts about value and I know you're interested in facts about free will abstract objects
*  Solidity in some sense, maybe our folk notion of solidity or our folk notions of time in all of these cases
*  It's at least an option to either deny the phenomenon or
*  Revise our understanding of it, you know, maybe there aren't really facts about value. Maybe we're not really free in the way we think we are
*  Maybe time isn't how we thought it was but I think with consciousness
*  It's a reality that we know in such a direct way
*  That I don't think it's an option to either deny it or revise it
*  so I think it's it it has a very special place in our methodology and
*  because of that
*  one needs to be hesitant about whether
*  The stuff we postulated to account for observation experiments can also account for this and I haven't heard from you yet
*  A story about how that's done. You've said that it can do it, but you haven't told me how it does it
*  Well, I don't think we've done it yet. So there you go. I'm very happy to admit that
*  But my my the extent to which I'm impressed with materialism is just so vast that of course
*  Consciousness being involved with the most complicated structures
*  We know of in the universe will be the last thing that science successfully explains
*  Not because it requires something separate just because it's hard, you know, that's why it's hard
*  But anyway, I think we could get stuck here rather. I would I want you to
*  Really?
*  Here's the chance sure I mean, I think that's where it comes back to the Galileo point precisely
*  Maybe let's not get it. You know, it's that
*  Yeah, science is so impressive, but it's impressive
*  At a very limited task
*  Describing the behavior of matter roughly mathematical models
*  It was never in the business of accounting for subject these subjective qualities that were immediately aware of that's never what it's been doing
*  So like to say oh, it's it's been good at this one thing. So it's gonna be good at this other thing
*  I just think there's something
*  Confused going on there. I mean I have this analogy in my book that
*  When I was first my first year as a lecturer the head of department very kindly let me off administration
*  And I was pretty good at the other aspects of the job
*  And I was pretty good at the other aspects of the job was pretty good at teaching pretty good at research
*  The fact that I was good at teaching and research doesn't give you any reason to think I'm gonna be good at admin, right?
*  So similarly the fact that the fact that physics has been really good physical science more generally really good at these mathematical models to describe
*  Behavior. Why does that give you any reason to think it's gonna be able to capture these subjective qualities that we're immediately aware of
*  And anyway, but yeah, sorry no no actually that's wonderful. I'm glad you said that let me respond to it
*  And we'll see whether or not we can restrain ourselves from going
*  I
*  Think that's crucially important because when you have something like consciousness
*  It's like when you have any part of scientific explanation or you know broader philosophical explanation that isn't finished yet, right?
*  We admit that we don't have the full understanding none of us does and therefore as
*  Individual scholars and researchers we make bets
*  We have credences about what is the most likely future path of progress, right?
*  And I talked about this in my upcoming book. I kind of breezed through it in the big picture
*  But in something deeply hidden where I'm talking about quantum mechanics
*  I think that it helps illuminate why some people are cheerful ever ready ins and some people find it to be
*  Abhorrent and therefore go for hidden variables or something like that and it's because
*  We we do have the world of our experience
*  Are you know sort of objective data collecting experience and our subjective inner experience?
*  Let's lump it all into one thing and we haven't yet fully explained it and which is more likely
*  among the following two options number one is an explanation that is more or less
*  Close to the phenomena that we're observing like the structures within the explanation
*  There's a lot of them and it's kind of a complicated, you know set of things going on
*  But the map between those structures and what we experience and what we see is very clear and crisp and easy
*  That would be a hidden variable approach to quantum mechanics
*  Where of course there's particles and waves in the double slit experiment because there's particles and waves in my ontology
*  or the other option is
*  You have an extremely beautiful
*  austere simple powerful underlying formalism
*  But the road from there to explaining the world of our experience is long and fraught with peril, right? That's the ever ready in
*  perspective where you know
*  like I said
*  you just have one vector in a big Hilbert space and you have a lot of work to do to say why the world looks like
*  three-dimensional space plus time with fields and all that stuff and
*  Either one of those options is very much on the table and there is a matter of taste or style that comes into saying
*  Oh, I'm pretty sure it's this one, right?
*  And I think it likewise for consciousness like of course we have not explained consciousness in any convincing way as
*  materialists
*  but I
*  have no trouble believing that it will eventually happen because materialism is so beautiful and elegant and so powerful and and I
*  Get even if I don't agree with the perspective that says I just don't see how we'll ever get here from there
*  And you know, I think that's a perfectly valid
*  perspective and will I
*  Think the progress will be made and we'll figure it out
*  And do you think what do you think when we when we get the final physical explanation it will be able to?
*  Convey to a congenitally blind neuroscientist what it's like to see red
*  By going into manipulating their brain, yes
*  Not by talking to them
*  So it can't give all the just like I can't teach someone I can't teach someone to be a good free throw shooter by talking to
*  them either
*  Okay, this is where we're getting this I think you know, okay
*  Let me this is not a this is not getting back to it
*  But I mean I completely agree with that whole thing you've just said with every phenomena every phenomenon
*  Except consciousness because I think every other phenomenon is you know
*  capturing the causal structure of the universe, but this is
*  We don't know about it in that way
*  We know about it in a very different way
*  and so I think that gives us the
*  entitlement to give a different credence to it because you know, we have a very different epistemological relationship with it
*  I think we apprehend its reality directly and we know something about its reality directly
*  I think you know when I attend to the qualities in my experience
*  I know something about their nature. I
*  Don't have that with tables
*  You know if I had that with tables if I could magically know something about their nature
*  Then maybe you know
*  That would give me less credence the physical science can explain it, but I don't have that it's just but with consciousness
*  I think I have some direct access to its nature. And so that's why I think I can have very different
*  Credence in the possibility of physics except I ended up I ended up coming back to the argument
*  I said I wouldn't sorry. I know I'm biting my tongue. I have things to say what I really want to say is
*  Tell us what panpsychism actually says let's give the sales pitch. You're at a there's you're at a used car dealership and
*  It's your used consciousness theory dealership and someone's wandered onto the lot and you would like to sell them this
*  Panpsychist vehicle that you've been trying to move for a long time. What is your sales pitch?
*  Well, I mean I think in it in a way I've already described it that this
*  that
*  There's just matter. There's just what physical science describes it describes but
*  Let me emphasize actually how non-duelist it is
*  Because often when people hear about panpsychism they think and I think actually
*  You said this a little bit in your book actually that you think it's
*  Well, the the electron has its physical properties like mass charge and spin and it also has these consciousness properties and you rightfully said
*  You know that ought to show up in our in our physics, you know, there's these extra properties. That's not the view right the view is
*  Mass spin and charge are themselves forms of consciousness, right? So physics tells us what mass spin and charge do
*  But it doesn't tell us what they are what those what those properties are and so
*  So it's a radically non-duelistic account and by the very way it's set up
*  It's gonna be completely consistent with what with what we know scientifically
*  How would I sell it? I mean, let me just
*  Say can I say just briefly how I think about the science of consciousness?
*  Actually, could you could you do me a favor and tell the very charming story that you told in the book of your conversion experience?
*  Oh, no, my wife told me to take that out because she thought it was too cringy
*  No, no, it's the best part. Look, you know, it's a you have to
*  It's part of being a good sales pitch you don't have to tell if you don't want to but
*  through various
*  phases of
*  Always been obsessed by the problem of consciousness as far back as I can remember and
*  You know what thought I was a material materialist
*  Yeah, yeah claim to know what it's like to be a material
*  I guess I eventually came to the point of view that somewhat Donetti in point of view that if you're a materialist
*  You should you that's incompatible with the reality of the qualitative reality of consciousness and
*  Defended that for a while whilst sort of feeling that like I was living in bad faith that I was sort of not really believing
*  and yeah, just just one night and just
*  Certain vivid experiences got to me and I
*  Just decided this can't go on anymore. And I mean actually but actually
*  At that point I was taught as a philosophy undergraduate the only two options and materialism and dualism
*  And I thought both of these are hopeless and I was very disillusioned and I wrote my end-of-year
*  undergraduate dissertation on how the problem of consciousness can't be resolved and I went off and did something else and
*  Then I discussed, you know panpsychism was not taught those day and I discovered there is this
*  elegant middle way
*  That does accept the reality of consciousness
*  But it's completely consistent with our empirical knowledge of the world, so I think that was the
*  You say something like
*  mass charge and spin are
*  Properties of consciousness. Is that is that?
*  No, they are they are forms of consciousness forms of consciousness. Okay. I mean what I want to say is what in the world
*  Does that mean?
*  Well, I
*  Think I think nothing is so
*  Some people think you know, there's a mystery of what a consciousness is. I don't I don't think that's a mystery
*  I think you know what nothing is more
*  Obvious than you know, what a feeling you know what a feeling of pain is when you have it, you know
*  That you know that the mystery is how consciousness fits into our theory of the world. So, you know human consciousness is very rich and complex
*  Consciousness of horses less so mice less so, you know, we keep getting simpler and simpler forms of inorganic life
*  Maybe at some point the lights switch off
*  We have no consciousness at all, but
*  It seems at least coherent that as we get simpler and simpler forms of matter you have simpler and simpler forms of consciousness such as
*  When you get to the bottom, let's just assume for the sake of simplicity a particle ontology
*  Which depends like it's not necessarily have to commit to although, you know
*  You often talk about that one often talks that way for safety
*  An electron has an unimaginably simple form of experience. So, you know, we can't even imagine
*  Something so simple. So that seems to me a coherent view
*  You might think it's crazy, but it seems to be this a coherent view moreover. I think there's reason to take it seriously because
*  We know that consciousness is real
*  We have to fit it into reality somehow if you think materialism and dualism have got such deep problems that they're not really
*  Going to make it happen then this gives us a way of doing it that avoids all the problems and it feels a bit weird
*  Yeah, no, I mean weird obviously we're gonna have to accept if we talk about any of these things the weird is okay
*  But I really want to get a better if I were
*  If I were very cynical here be my problem
*  I have an electron. I have equations for what it does. It has a mass charge and spin
*  I have the direct equation. I have quantum field theory. I can tell you exactly what it will do
*  As the materialist physicist, I'm tempted to say
*  I'm done. I know what the electron is and how it behaves and you want to say and
*  It has
*  And it has some very very primitive limited form of conscious experience is that fair
*  But the depends on you my and that's not a further property i'm saying you've told me what
*  mass does
*  Yeah, but
*  You haven't told me what it is. That's the that's the right. So there's something I haven't told you yet
*  I guess maybe let's just put it that way. So there's something extra that I haven't yet told you sure
*  and
*  But that's something extra I haven't yet told you
*  Has no mathematical description. Yeah
*  Absolutely, that's right. And it also has
*  Does it have causal influences on the behavior of anything?
*  Yeah, the thought is
*  You've been telling me this cool story about
*  What mass does?
*  And then the panpsychist view is mass is a form of consciousness. So it's actually
*  It's it's this form of consciousness that's been doing all the stuff you've been talking about
*  I mean, it's not like there's the consciousness and then there's something else
*  There's just the forms of consciousness and you've been telling me what they do. So it's like, you know you
*  I don't know you you hear someone banging in the apartment downstairs and something's you know
*  Something's making this noise, but you don't know what it is and then you discover it's
*  An elephant, I don't know
*  So so you you physicists study?
*  What these properties do?
*  But on this view you're not saying what they are that's the
*  Yeah, but maybe maybe i'm um, not getting this exactly right is so mass is a form of consciousness. Yeah
*  Uh, is that because everything is a form of consciousness or these physical properties are forms of consciousness
*  Is the wave function of the universe a form of consciousness?
*  Yeah, so look it depends on what you think the fundamental ontology is that so the panpsychist view is
*  Whatever your fundamental physical story is that will give you some structure
*  But then you've got to ask well what realizes that structure
*  And what realizes that structure are forms of consciousness. So if you have a particle based ontology then
*  These particles will have intrinsic if you've got a wave. Yeah
*  Sorry if you've got a wave function ontology then you have to think about that the wave function has
*  Its intrinsic nature is consciousness involving
*  So that i was just asking does everything have this is this is part of the panpsychist
*  View that everything has
*  An aspect of consciousness everything at the fundamental level. So the panpsychists need not hold it like
*  rocks and socks and you know
*  beds are conscious
*  Not every arbitrary collection of things is conscious, but everything
*  has
*  components
*  Or its most basic parts are conscious or or the or the physical reality that underlies it at least has a consciousness involving nature
*  That's the view but but okay, but i'm just trying to get straight
*  I as a materialist who doesn't use those words have a theory of what does happen in the world
*  Your theory of what does happen in the world your theory as a panpsychist need not be any different from mine, right?
*  Right exactly. That's the that's that's taken to be the benefit of the view right? We we don't want
*  Our theory of consciousness to get in the way of physics, right? Yeah, right, but okay
*  So this is where you know, I think that the zombie thought experiment is actually helpful because if it's true that
*  There's different versions of the zombie thought experiment
*  So let me just always conditionalize on various assumptions here if it's true that given the
*  Atoms and particles and forces in me including in my brain and my neurons and so forth
*  I could in principle be laplace's demon and solve the laws of physics and say exactly what I would do
*  modulo quantum uncertainty and so forth
*  and
*  That would include things like showing me something red and me saying oh, yes, that is red
*  I am experiencing red. Yeah, and
*  There and all that goes through perfectly well within both of our different views of the world
*  Then i'm not quite sure what is added by the panpsychist
*  perspective
*  Um
*  In other words, let me let me give you the very short version of that
*  So if I
*  The zombie is david chalmers's idea of you know, a physical thing that acts exactly like things in the real world a physical
*  collection of atoms and so forth
*  But that does not have consciousness
*  And my point is if it exacts if it acts exactly the same that includes when you ask it
*  Do you have consciousness? Are you experiencing things? It says yes, and if you ask it, are you lying?
*  It says no, so clearly it honestly thinks it's conscious, but it's not by hypothesis. Yes, so
*  By that therefore none of us knows that we're not a zombie because zombies think that they're conscious just like we do and therefore
*  You've really added nothing
*  Okay, this sounds a little bit different to
*  What you said the first time? I mean the first time you seem to be saying well just
*  Brutally, what's the difference between a world that's physically identical and lacks consciousness and one that's
*  I mean, I don't know how to say it mcclain but in the sense that
*  When we describe physical reality we use these quantitative concepts
*  When we describe consciousness, we use these qualitative concepts. We talk about
*  You know colors and smells and and the qualitative character
*  It seems to perfectly coherent to
*  Hypothesize that you might have one without the other
*  But but coming to your
*  You know
*  A second argument as I as i'm understanding it
*  Well, doesn't this imply?
*  None of us would know we were conscious. I mean there are tricky issues here actually just as a preliminary thought
*  about the relationship between thought and consciousness, so
*  The dominant view in my philosophical tradition
*  Has been that thought has nothing to do with consciousness and you can see this because the dominant theories of thought
*  in the 20th century such as
*  Jerry Fodor or donald davidson or dennett
*  Have absolutely nothing to say about consciousness. So they think you can give a complete account of thought without talking about consciousness
*  And so on that view more about computation and so forth. Yeah some kind of functional behavioral facts or yeah
*  But very very very very broadly speaking
*  um, so on that view a zombie
*  Would would have thoughts and would think it's conscious as you say
*  But I mean i'm actually one of a growing minority of philosophers who think actually thought is a kind of consciousness
*  Uh, and and if that's true, then um, the zombie wouldn't have any thoughts at all. Um
*  so that's I mean that's one way you can go with this, but
*  Maybe that's getting into slightly contentious territory. But I mean the other thing to say is
*  Yeah, the zombie behaves in all the same ways but
*  I don't know about my consciousness. It's not the case that I know about my consciousness by observing myself
*  I know about it because i'm immediately aware of my own experiences
*  um, but that's just what a zombie would say
*  It would say that but it's it's not true of the zombie by stipulation. Um
*  It doesn't have this what justifies what grounds my knowledge of consciousness
*  Is my immediate awareness of my own pain?
*  um
*  And by stipulation, that's what a zombie
*  lacks, uh
*  Yeah, I don't know
*  Where to go with this other one to say that yeah
*  No, I think both of our positions are out there. That's all I ever ask for in the podcast is that people understand what both sides are saying
*  So let's let's uh be a little bit more. Um, you know future oriented and and proactive. How do you think?
*  What do you think of the uh prospects for consciousness and pen psychism?
*  I mean you try to end the book on an uplifting note and I think it's an interesting perspective to uh,
*  Conclude with
*  Sure, so I think you know
*  This view has been getting taken much more seriously in academic philosophy
*  Um, and you know part of the reason I wrote this book because i've written an academic book
*  Consciousness and fundamental reality, which is kind of reasonably well known
*  Uh bringing together a lot of this recent literature, you know, there's been a huge amount published on this view
*  but you know, I really want to get it out to a broader audience because
*  It's not really a complete view this rossel eddington view it's a it's a framework
*  Uh, and it will take
*  You know decades or centuries of interdisciplinary labor to fill in the details, you know, just as darwin's principle of natural selection is um
*  You know, it's a basic framework for understanding how life evolves, but then it takes, you know a century to get to dna
*  um
*  so
*  So really I think you know, this is going to be
*  You know, I just think
*  People are naturally conservative. It's it's hard to persuade people with arguments, but I just think you know
*  We need to get on with this if if enough people are on board with trying to do this
*  Uh, and there's you know, there's all very kind of very interesting work going on. Um
*  Well, let me just say actually maybe I could just say about how I think about the the science of consciousness
*  um
*  so and this relates to materialism as well because
*  um
*  I think the science of consciousness has to have an empirical aspect and a theoretical aspect
*  I think some people think you can just do the empirical bit
*  But I think you know neuroscience as vital as it is just gives you correlations
*  To move beyond that we need to build build a theory
*  um
*  And I think I think a theory of consciousness should be judged
*  By two constraints, uh, it's going a little bit beyond what I say in the book actually an an external constraint and an internal constraint
*  So the external constraint is just to fit the data
*  Obviously crucial the internal constraint is to try and minimize or ideally eliminate explanatory gaps
*  That is places in the theory where you're going from one set of facts to another with no account of how that happens
*  So the problem with materialism
*  Materialism isn't just looking at the neuroscience. It's a theory in its own right and it has an enormous on the face of it explanatory gap between the
*  quantitative properties and the qualitative reality of consciousness
*  I think already the russell eddington view
*  Makes progress there because we now have an intelligible account
*  of the relationship between
*  Physical states and conscious states conscious states are the intrinsic nature of physical states
*  So I think there's already explanatory progress there
*  But there's plenty of work to be done. And and so I mean the the crucial next step is
*  how we think about the relationship between
*  Particle consciousness or consciousness at lower levels and consciousness at higher levels. Is this a
*  Causal relationship in the sense that we need basic laws of nature to make the gap or is this a constitutive relationship?
*  um in the sense that you know
*  In some sense the higher level forms of consciousness come for free once you've got the more basic forms of consciousness
*  And how do we make sense of that? So there's lots of you know
*  Tricky issues here and there's already
*  Really interesting work going on. So hetta hasselmurk who's a research fellow at um
*  University of oslo spent a year
*  In recently in the lab of julio tannoni who is the founder of the integrated information theory of consciousness one of the most best
*  empirically supported theories of consciousness
*  Working that out in a um in the framework of ross leedington panpsychism
*  and what we end up with is
*  a view according to which in any system
*  The the consciousness intrinsic nature is at the level of which there's most integrated information. So I think so this
*  works with
*  The neuroscientific theory but like any neuroscientific theory if you've just got the neuroscience, you've just got a correlation
*  But interpreting it in this ross leedington framework
*  Interpreting it in this ross leedington framework moves beyond the bear correlation gives you a deeper explanation
*  You've got uh, well another thing I talk about in the book the luke rollofs who's uh, the university of bocham
*  Reflecting on whether split brain patients can help shed light on mental combinations. So these are the
*  curious cases where people have the corpus callosum in the middle of their brain split which
*  Allows the two hemispheres to communicate a radical treatment for epilepsy
*  And it seems to lead to a kind of peculiar fragmentation of consciousness
*  It ends up looking like there's sort of two conscious minds in one person
*  so rolloff's interest in this is well
*  This split brain cases are kind of the converse of mental combination and mental combination. We're trying to understand how distinct
*  conscious
*  Subjects can combine to a single unified conscious subject
*  Whereas in split brain cases, you've got a single conscious mind fragmenting into multiple conscious minds. So if we can sort of
*  Understand what's going on in the split brain case and as it were reverse engineer it this might shed light on mental combination
*  So there's what we need is philosophers in labs
*  Or philosophers thinking about how do we make sense of this panpsychist view in a wave function?
*  Fundamental view which i've been actually thinking about actually for something i'm writing for a
*  An op volume on quantum mechanics and consciousness. So, you know, I think
*  This needs to be an interdisciplinary labor. That's just in its birth and I think
*  people
*  You know, it's getting taken much more seriously in academic philosophy
*  Although, you know, you sometimes people not entirely comfortable with this
*  but I think rather than persuading people with the arguments if we just get on with the work I think history shows that once you
*  just get on and
*  Start doing some research and this bears fruit. I think that's when people start to listen a bit more
*  so so i'm very optimistic that
*  That there's a lot of interesting work to be done
*  So that was a bit long. Yeah. No, I like
*  I no no, it's what I was hoping for. Um, it
*  Does sound one way or the other whatever our bets are that's going to happen for what's going to happen in the future
*  I am optimistic that the right people are beginning to talk to each other and taking these problems seriously
*  Like I said, I am someone who believes in consciousness as a real thing. I would like to understand it
*  I don't think that we entirely do
*  final issue final question very quickly, uh
*  What do you think how do you conceptualize the possible moral or ethical implications of this kind of thing?
*  I know that we can't there's not a simple road from ought to is but everyone agrees that science and philosophy
*  Philosophical ideas about consciousness could have an impact on how we think about morality and ethics
*  Do you have special thoughts about that?
*  Yeah a little bit I took about this a little bit in in the in the final
*  More sort of experimental chapter of the book. I mean first I would say, you know
*  Of course as i'm sure you'd agree
*  We shouldn't be thinking about which view we'd most like to be true
*  We should be thinking about which view is most likely to be true
*  And I think there's you know, very good reasons for taking panpsychism seriously as the best
*  account of how consciousness fits into nature
*  but I am also
*  inclined to think that it's maybe a view that's
*  slightly better for our
*  Mental and spiritual health in the kind of broad sense. I mean, your materialism is pretty bleak in a way, you know, you've got a kind of
*  Mechanistic picture of nature and the cold immensity of empty space and uh
*  Whereas you know panpsychist view we are conscious creatures in a conscious universe
*  It's you know, it is somewhat we can feel a little bit perhaps more comfortable in our own skin
*  And and so, you know, actually also I think it has the potential perhaps something I talk about the book
*  To improve our relationship to the environment. I mean if you think
*  If you think trees and plants are just
*  Unfeeling mechanisms then I think inevitably
*  Your view of their value is
*  Indirect that their value is indirect in terms of you know
*  The effect it has on us conscious creatures looking pretty or more importantly maintaining our survival
*  But uh, you know if you think a tree is uh, you know
*  In some sense a conscious entity in its own right then I think that's a object of immediate moral concern, you know, it's a
*  Chopping down tree is something that has an immediate moral focus. So I do think
*  Perhaps this gives us
*  You know, we're in this environmental crisis that we can't seem to deal with for all sorts of reasons and this might help a little bit
*  Um how we relate to nature and the environment? Although of course
*  That shouldn't be the reason to take it seriously
*  No, that's right
*  You don't you don't accept a view because you want it to be true
*  But I think it's perfectly legitimate to say well, I think this view is true and i'm relieved and happy that that it is
*  I think that's sure perfectly legit. Yeah. All right. Uh, thanks so much. There's a lot to think about here philip goff
*  Thanks for being on the podcast. Thanks a lot. So let's be really enjoyed that vigorous debate. Thanks for having me
*  You
