Welcome to the May 2024 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). We take questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable number -- based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good -- and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

Here is the memorial to Dan Dennett at Ars Technica: https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/philosopher-daniel-dennett-dead-at-82/

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | May 2024
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVTEygcmy4U)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the May 2024 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape Podcast.
*  I'm your host Sean Carroll.
*  One of the downsides of doing a podcast for any number of years is that some of your former
*  guests will pass away and that is always a sad event.
*  Last year, of course, we had a couple of instances, Herb Gintis and Mari Rudy both died.
*  And already this year, two people who were former guests have passed away, Franz De Waal
*  and Daniel Dennett.
*  Franz De Waal was an amazingly successful and influential palaeontologist, not palaeontologist,
*  sorry, primatologist and anthropologist.
*  He studied primates and compared them to young humans and found fascinating commonalities
*  as well as differences.
*  And we did a great podcast with him that I had no idea that he was sick.
*  I don't even know a lot of the details of his passing away, but that was very sad.
*  Whereas Dan Dennett, you know, not only a hugely important philosopher for the 20th
*  and 21st century and a Mindscape guest, but also a personal friend.
*  So that hit very hard.
*  I was sitting at a table with Dan and a bunch of other philosophers just a few weeks ago
*  at Santa Fe and he was fine, right?
*  But you know, you reach a certain age, he'd already had a couple of heart issues that
*  were very, very serious.
*  And so this can happen.
*  I'm sure Dan would be the first one to say that we should appreciate what he did while
*  he was here, but the idea of dying is inevitable and we should move on and think about it.
*  But many people for this month's AMA asked me to say something about Dan and his influence
*  and his contributions and what he meant to me.
*  And so I'm going to do that right here in the intro before we get to the AMA itself.
*  I will mention that there was an article in Ars Technica that Jennifer Willett, my wife
*  and also science writer, contributed, sort of a memorial to Dan.
*  It wasn't like strictly an intellectual obituary or anything like that, but it was more personal,
*  more reflective both on his work and on his who he was as a person.
*  And you know, by the way, there was a New York Times article, obituary after Dan had
*  died that was just terrible.
*  I mean, it got all the philosophy wrong.
*  It said he was a staunch opponent of free will, even though he was actually the leading
*  compatibilist about free will in the world.
*  And mostly it quoted his enemies, people who had said terrible things about him in print.
*  I don't know what was going on with the New York Times obituary.
*  But Jennifer's article, which I will link to on the website, preposterousuniverse.com
*  slash podcast, you know, talks to she talked to a bunch of people and got some great quotes.
*  I just want to read you two quotes about Dan Dennett.
*  One was from David Wallace, who is another Mindscape guest.
*  And in fact, at this Santa Fe conference a few weeks ago, David was also there.
*  And I had the extreme privilege of introducing Dan to David Wallace.
*  They'd never met each other before, even though David was the first to say that Dan's
*  philosophy was enormously influential on him.
*  David's famous book on the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is titled
*  The Emergent Multiverse.
*  And his notion of emergence leans very, very heavily on Dan's idea of real patterns that
*  he that he talks about.
*  So David was very happy to meet him and said that his his philosophical ideas absolutely
*  permeated a lot of David's work.
*  And in fact, you know, I think one of the regrets of Dan passing away is that he didn't
*  really engage that much with physics over the course of his philosophical career.
*  And I was very interested in getting him more into physics.
*  And he was receptive to this. He was interested.
*  He wanted to learn more about it.
*  And, you know, alas, that's not going to happen right now.
*  In fact, it just it just really hurts me because I am finishing a paper with a student,
*  Dr. Charles De Chuth Parola, that is going to appear in a volume of essays dedicated
*  to responding to Dan's idea of real patterns and what they say about emergence.
*  And Dan was going to read all the papers that were contributed and then respond to them.
*  And I really wanted to hear what he had to say about what we were going to say.
*  And now we're we're not going to have that happen.
*  So it's it's very, very sad for all sorts of reasons.
*  And that's OK to be sad about it.
*  You can know it. You can accept it.
*  You can appreciate the inevitability of these things while still being sad about it.
*  Anyway, here is the quote from David Wallace that was in Jennifer's article.
*  To me, Dan Dennett exemplified what it means to do philosophy in an age of science.
*  He once said there was no such thing as philosophy free science,
*  only science that didn't interrogate its philosophical assumptions.
*  Equally, he saw more deeply than almost anyone that the deepest traditional questions
*  of philosophy from free will to consciousness, to metaphysics,
*  were irreversibly transformed by modern science, most especially by natural selection.
*  His approach, as much as his own towering contributions, has inspired generations of philosophers
*  far beyond cognitive science and the philosophy of mind.
*  His ideas have been influential in the interpretation of quantum theory, for instance.
*  He was one of the great philosophers of the last century, one of the very few whose work has been
*  transformative outside academic philosophy.
*  I think that last point is crucially important.
*  One of the things about Dan is that he's, you know, you can make a short list,
*  but he was certainly one of the most publicly influential philosophers that we had.
*  We don't have a lot. We have far fewer publicly recognizable philosophers than scientists.
*  And I don't know whether that's good or bad or whatever,
*  but Dan did his job in getting philosophical ideas, a lot of public engagement,
*  which I obviously think is super duper important.
*  In fact, most of his books were very intentionally written in a way that they were
*  intellectual contributions and also readable by the general public.
*  And that's one of the many ways in which he influenced me.
*  I really aspire to live up to that.
*  Sometimes I write books like the recent books, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe, are purely pedagogical.
*  But books like From Eternity to Here or The Big Picture or Something Deeply Hidden,
*  I'm very, very explicitly trying to make an academic level argument in a way that can be
*  appreciated and read by people without academic backgrounds.
*  And the guy who has done that the best was Dan Dennett.
*  And I know that, and he is the role model for doing that.
*  The other thing that David mentions in that little quote is that Dan,
*  naturalism was his guiding star.
*  He was interested in connecting the scientific image to the manifest image of the world.
*  These are phrases from Wilfred Sellers, but if you've ever heard me say those phrases,
*  the scientific image and the manifest image, I got them from Dan Dennett.
*  He's the one who talked that way and many, many things that he would say.
*  This is what makes a good thinker.
*  They'll say something, you'll go, oh, yeah, that's the right way to think about it, right?
*  Sometimes the mark of a great academic thinker is that you work very carefully through a long
*  involved argument and you come out the other side being impressed with the edifice that has been
*  built. Other times, you're circling around a kind of idea and someone can just pinpoint it,
*  put their fingers on it, go, yes, that's what I'm trying to get at.
*  And that was one of his geniuses. He was always very good at that.
*  The other quote I wanted to read was from Douglas Hofstadter.
*  Doug Hofstadter, obviously super famous guy, author of Girdle Escher Bach.
*  And after Dan passed away, they were very close collaborators.
*  And Hofstadter sent around an email to a bunch of people who he knew were friends of Dan,
*  a little reflections email. And I asked permission of Doug to let Jennifer quote it and he kindly
*  gave permission. So here is Douglas Hofstadter. Dan was a deep thinker about what it is to be human.
*  Quite early on, he arrived at what many would see as shocking conclusions about consciousness,
*  essentially that it is just an emergent effect of physical interactions of tiny inanimate
*  components. And from then on, he was a dead set opponent of dualism, the idea that there is an
*  ethereal nonphysical elixir called consciousness over and above the physical events taking place
*  in the enormously complex substrate of a human or animal brain, and perhaps that of a silicon
*  network as well. Dan thus totally rejected the notion of qualia, pure sensations of such things
*  as colors, tastes, and so forth. And his arguments against the mystique of qualia were subtle, but
*  very cogent. And I wanted to say that because I think that Doug Hofstadter puts into words,
*  better than I could, what Dan's primary preoccupation as a philosopher was, which
*  was understanding the mind and consciousness from a naturalist, physicalist point of view.
*  But he was the leading guy in trying to make the world think that we didn't need anything spooky
*  to understand consciousness, that we didn't need to change or violate the laws of physics.
*  And so that's not something that I personally have thought about that much. I completely agree
*  that you don't need to change the laws of physics, but Dan was much more at the detailed level,
*  talking to neuroscientists, etc., to see how it actually works in the brain. And he had his ideas,
*  and other people had different ideas, and who knows? I don't know whether we've really settled
*  on the right idea yet or come up with it, but that was what he cared about the most.
*  One question I've gotten is, what should I read by Dan Dennett? What were his most important books?
*  I think that the two bangers in terms of popularly accessible books are Consciousness Explained,
*  that was his sort of magnum opus, trying to understand consciousness, and Darwin's Dangerous
*  Idea, where he thinks a lot about evolution and its role. Dan probably became most famous in the
*  public eye for being one of the four horsemen of New Atheism, along with Richard Dawkins,
*  Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens. But those four people are not created equal in terms of
*  what they did for the idea of atheism, etc. Dan was the careful thinker among those four people.
*  They're all four smart people, but there's some efficaciousness in terms of rhetoric and
*  rabble-raising, if you want to call it that, that the four of them shared. But Dan was the
*  professional philosopher among that group, and he really thought through, okay, if you don't believe
*  in God, then how did all this wonderful complexity, in particular, conscious awareness, etc., come into
*  existence? There's a slightly more technical book that he's written called The Intentional Stance,
*  which I think is super important for thinking not only about consciousness, but also about
*  artificial intelligence and things like that. He was actually in the last year or two super interested
*  in AI and what it was doing. And the idea of intentional stance, I'm probably going to bungle
*  it here because I'm not an expert, but the basic idea is, at what point do you take a system that
*  is just a bunch of inanimate atoms collecting together, and at what point do you attribute to
*  it intentionality or agency? At what point do we say, okay, I'm going to treat this thing as
*  something that is thinking and planning for the future, something that we might call conscious,
*  or an agent, or having free will and things like that. So he thinks through those questions very,
*  very carefully. Anyway, it's a great loss to not have Dan around anymore. He was a wonderful person,
*  as well as a wonderful philosopher, mischievous, and he had a spark in his eyes, sparkle, twinkle,
*  in his eye at all times. And that's why he's such a great role model for so many, many other reasons.
*  I'm very glad that at least we have a lot of record of his writings, having him on videos and
*  things like that. He was one of the participants in the Moving Naturalism Forward workshop that I
*  organized a while back. We didn't agree about everything. You don't agree about everything.
*  I don't agree about anything with anyone, really. So it's not a surprise that I didn't agree with
*  Dan about everything. But honestly, I agree with him about most things. It was very, very easy to
*  talk to him about a whole bunch of things. And not going to be able to do that anymore, which is
*  terrible. But he would. There's a siren outside my window. Sorry about that. People sometimes ask,
*  why are there so many sirens outside your window? It's not because we live in a war zone. It's
*  because we live very close to a hospital. Those are ambulance sirens that you're hearing.
*  But anyway, yeah, so we're going to regret not having Dan around anymore. And life goes on and
*  more people will come up and do great things. And that's how things should be. So with that, let's go.
*  Alex Thou says, Can you comment on the college campus protests currently ongoing? Where do you
*  draw the line between freedom of expression and illegal activity? If you were a university leader
*  or administrator, how would you handle the current situation? And what are your thoughts on this?
*  And I think that's a very good question. I think that's a very good question. I think that's a
*  very good question. I think that's a very good question. I think that's a very good question.
*  Illegal activity. If you were a university leader or administrator, how would you handle the
*  situation differently? If at all? This is obviously a complicated situation. People don't like
*  complicated situations. They want to put situations into boxes that are relatively black or white.
*  I'm all in favor of campus protests. I think this is one of the things that college students are
*  good at doing, not putting up with some established way of being and trying to make the world a better
*  place and getting indignant about it. I mean, going to college, if you do it right,
*  it can be quite an experience intellectually, emotionally, in terms of how you think about the
*  world. For many people, when you go to college, you're living there. This is the first time in
*  your life, or maybe one of the small numbers of times in your life, where you're in a completely
*  different environment, completely different sets of people. You're not with the same people over
*  and over again. You're maybe not living with your family, and you're exposed to all these new ideas
*  from other students, from professors in classes, from books and things that you're reading and so
*  forth. It is no surprise that college students who are also at the same time still young and
*  energetic, right? They're not settled into ruts, are going to be outraged by things happening in
*  the world that they are catching on to and realizing are unjust and they want to change.
*  In general, I think that the first response of college administrators to protesting students
*  should be that that's good. That's part of what the college experience is all about. Of course,
*  another feature of being a college student is that you're not that wise in the ways of the world as
*  yet, right? You can get overly enthusiastic about things because you've recently discovered them and
*  you're a new convert and that happens. There was a thing going around on the internet which purported
*  to be a list of demands from students at Cornell as part of the recent protests. I don't even know
*  if it was legit or not, but it is emblematic of something that does happen, which is that
*  despite the fact that the protests were nominally about the conflict between Israel and Palestine
*  right now, there was a bunch of demands stuck in there about indigenous lands and having students
*  have the right to help choose faculty members and a bunch of things had nothing to do with what was
*  going on in Gaza, which illustrates, I think, a broader problem, which is that these kinds of
*  protests are often not very well targeted to actually make a difference, to actually get
*  something done. It is often unclear what the goals are, what the realistic things that could happen
*  would be, and often there's a spirit that compromises bad, right? There's a weird tension.
*  There are students protesting on the basis that they would like to see Israel and Palestine sit
*  down and work out their differences and compromise, but they themselves are unwilling to compromise
*  with Joe Biden, right? Because he's insufficiently radicalized about these particular ideas.
*  I'm getting onto my own little hobby horses here. I think that in the modern world, we're not very
*  good at compromising. We've given up or somewhat lost that ideal of democratic governance, where
*  we're supposed to talk to our enemies, right? You don't make peace with your friends. You make peace
*  with your enemies, and that's something that student protesters are not especially good at.
*  The strategic part of politics, who to compromise with, how to get your
*  goals actually to come true in some way. I think that you have to understand that the protests
*  are going to be kind of messy and chaotic and etc., and that's also okay. If the protests are just
*  like sitting in the yard, singing some songs, giving some demands out there, then I think that
*  the university administrators should bend over backwards to let them happen. One very obvious
*  thing is that a lot of administrators just don't talk to the protesters. Their first instinct seems
*  to be to call in the cops, which is not good for anybody. In Philadelphia, I know, when the
*  University of Pennsylvania called in the cops and the protesters, the cops said, no, they're like,
*  I don't see any evidence that anything actually violent or dangerous is happening here. Just go
*  and talk to them. You know that when the cops are saying, you're being a little bit too violent in
*  your reaction here, then maybe you should rethink your strategy a little bit. Of course it is
*  possible for protesters to go overboard. Well, then there's many different ways of going overboard.
*  One way of going overboard is just to say horrible things. There have been multiple examples of
*  protesters saying things online or on videos that are terribly anti-semitic or racist or whatever.
*  Those people exist. Those people are real, right, and they're saying terrible things,
*  and that doesn't necessarily undermine the legitimacy of the protest overall or of the cause.
*  All sides have bad people saying bad things about them. You should think about the best arguments
*  for both sides, not the worst arguments. When it comes to the students like damaging property or
*  stopping classes from going on, then it becomes a legitimately difficult case-by-case basis kind
*  of call, I think. On the one hand, it is true that protests, in order to get their message out,
*  will sometimes break the rules, right? That has been true forever. Certainly the Boston Tea Party
*  did not play by the rules that had been laid down. The various civil rights demonstrations did not
*  always play by the rules that the local communities had put up. Sometimes to make progress,
*  you have to break the rules, occupy a building, stay out even though you're told to go home,
*  things like that. On the other hand, again, I would personally want the protesters to think
*  strategically when they are getting in the way of people, when they are stopping people from having
*  classes, for example, or whatever, are the people who they are inconveniencing actually the ones
*  who have a power to do something, right? If you're going on strike in a more general circumstance,
*  are the people who that strike is inconveniencing the actual ones who have the power to offer you
*  better working conditions or salaries or whatever? I think that these strategic,
*  can you actually make the world a better place questions should be in the forefront of protesters
*  thoughts about how to best organize and what strategies to take. I am someone who doesn't
*  get that interested in sort of the virtue signaling aspects of doing a protest. I do think that a lot
*  of protesters are just there to sort of have their voices be heard more so than to make the world a
*  better place. I personally am about making the world a better place. So that's the balance that
*  you have to strike. I'm not sure that there is a simple set of rules you could hand down in a sort
*  of bureaucratic way that would cover all of the cases. You have to think on a case by case basis
*  what is actually going on. But the overall thing is I support the protesters. I support their rights
*  to have their voices be heard. I'm pretty much on one extreme when it comes to letting voices
*  be heard if that's what you're into. I think that you should let Nazis give talks on college
*  campuses if they're invited by some legitimate college campus group. I think you should let
*  people with all sorts of terrible ideas give talks and let them talk and then ignore them if you want
*  to give another talk if you want to do that and then let people think about it. That's what I would
*  think is the ideal situation. We can't always achieve it but we can try to work toward it.
*  That would be my goal. Mikkel Pickle says, your recent guests have pointed to counterfactual
*  reasoning as a key element of human advancement, either as mental time travel or considering the
*  consequences of different initial conditions or empathy for the plights of others etc. I've begun
*  to notice how often I do it and to suspect it's true that educability for example and perhaps our
*  overall success as a species depend upon it. However, I can't tell if it is required or most
*  efficient or if it just happens to be what I personally do. How important do you think
*  counterfactual reasoning is to effective prediction as individuals or to our past and future advancement
*  as a species? It's hard to answer. I mean the answer is super important basically but when you
*  ask how important is it, I'm not quite sure how to quantify it. But I do think that this idea
*  of counterfactual reasoning, maybe the first time we talked about it was with Malcolm MacIver when
*  he was talking about the initial evolutionary development of the capacity for counterfactual
*  reasoning when fish climbed onto land and could suddenly see a lot further than they could before.
*  And yeah, you're right. We've talked about people who have been thinking more specifically about how
*  humans use those capacities. It's hard to imagine something. Oh, Carl Friston we actually also
*  talked with about that issue because I was I remember joking with him that of my two cats,
*  Ariel and Caliban, one seems to be capable of counterfactual reasoning and one does not.
*  Caliban just seeks the local minimum. He just wants to be as happy as possible in the moment.
*  I don't think the idea of other moments ever occurs to him. Whereas Ariel is the stereotypical
*  cat who you know when you open a door that she demands to have open she's like I don't know do
*  I want to open that do I want to walk that threshold? I'm not quite sure. She's always
*  thinking about the possible bad consequences etc. And our feral cat, our outdoor cat Puck who is
*  hung around outside our yard for a while, he's super cautious right? This is what is keeping
*  him alive so he doesn't do anything until he like thinks about it 20 different ways.
*  So somewhere that's that's close to when this capacity in some minor key was first developed
*  evolutionarily. But anyway yeah absolutely possible absolutely crucial because I think that
*  I suspect and I'm just making stuff up I'm not an expert on this but I suspect that the parts of
*  the brain that are good at in general abstract symbolic reasoning are either the same as or
*  closely related to the parts of the brain that are that are good at counterfactual reasoning.
*  I don't know if you've ever done a podcast on it but back years ago I organized workshops on
*  the arrow of time where we were taught that you can do fMRI studies in the brain and you can show
*  that when people think about possible future events the literal part of the brain that is doing that
*  work conjuring up an imaginary hypothetical scenario is the same part of the brain that sort of puts a
*  scenario together when you're remembering things that actually did happen. So there's a sort of
*  separate modules in the brain for storing information about what happened in the past versus
*  literally putting on the show you know when we when we store the data of past memories we don't
*  store a videotape we store something closer to a screenplay and we put on a little show in our
*  brains and so that gives us a capacity to put on a hypothetical counterfactual show and I would not
*  be at all surprised if that was a crucial step towards develop developing abstract symbolic
*  reasoning which is of course super duper important for everything that humans are able to do.
*  It gives us that sort of touring machine universality that lets us think about the universe in
*  perhaps at least a maximally powerful way. I don't again I don't know the details.
*  I should ask someone who knows about this stuff. Colleen Edwards asks I asked this question of on
*  your quantum field theory thread regarding your upcoming book which I know you still have to get
*  to but I just can't stand the anticipation so I'll ask here in hopes of having an answer sooner.
*  So what Colleen is referring to is that next week's podcast will be a solo podcast based on
*  ideas from my upcoming book quanta and fields volume two of the biggest ideas in the universe.
*  The idea of the book is to explain quantum mechanics and more importantly quantum field
*  theory and particle physics in a way that is accessible to everyone but that shows you the
*  equations right. That's the trick and we'll see whether the trick works but that's that's the
*  goal in a short powerful package and but there's so many ideas in quantum field theory is that the
*  heart of modern physics that even in a solo podcast or a talk that I go around and giving
*  and give I cannot talk about all the good ideas. So for patreon supporters I ask the questions like
*  what are the most important ideas you would like me to talk about. That is what Colleen is referring
*  to when about the quantum field theory thread and just one of the many secret benefits of being a
*  patreon member here at mindscape. Oh I forgot to say I got distracted by other issues but of course
*  these AMA questions are supported by patreon members and they're the ones who get to ask them
*  if you would like to be a patreon member go to patreon.com slash Sean M Carol and you can see
*  all these secret threads and ask the questions also as well as get advertising free versions of
*  the podcast. So Colleen goes on as a non-physicist I'd like to know why does the field vibration
*  change to a particle when it is observed. This concept is still tough for me to grasp how can I
*  vibration change to a particle just like that. Is it possible to observe the vibration as it changes
*  into a particle. So I think I will talk about this hopefully I do talk about it in the book
*  in great detail and I'll hopefully talk about it next week but I think the rough thing to think is
*  it's not quite that a vibration is changing into a particle. The thing about quantum mechanics is
*  that what you observe is not what is right. If you think that what is is the wave function of
*  whatever things you're thinking about what you see when you look at the wave function depends
*  on certain observables you see position you see velocity so forget about quantum fields even for
*  an electron if I have the wave function of electron it could be spread out all over the place
*  and it's a particle but it's a quantum particle so it has no position but I can observe the position
*  and I get an answer I see oh there is a particle with a certain position or I can observe the
*  momentum and see ah there is a particle with a certain momentum can't do both at once because
*  of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So the real question is why when we observe quantum fields
*  do we see particles why is it that the thing we observe looks particle-like and so it's not that
*  it transforms into it I mean it kind of does because wave functions collapse and that's how we talk
*  about it but it's not like it's doing it by itself it's a function of that interaction it's how you
*  interact with the quantum fields that is making you see them as particles and there's a longer
*  story there and involves simple harmonic oscillators and things like that but I'll just put a little
*  tiny idea into your head to think about that will soften the journey to get there which is
*  think about how electrons particles forget about the the quantum field things just think about how
*  electrons have energy levels in atoms right the various orbitals that you study if you're a
*  chemist there's a lowest energy level there's the higher energy levels that are sort of more
*  funky looking orbitals and so forth that gives rise to the periodic table and all that stuff
*  where do those come from and what is the role of these orbitals you might say well look I have a
*  wave the wave function of the particle and it's surrounding the nucleus of the atom and I can
*  imagine all sorts of profiles for the wave right all sorts of wavy kinds of things but when you
*  have the equation in front of you the Schrodinger equation what you find is that only certain
*  profiles for that wave function have definite energies right there's a lowest energy answer
*  to the question what is the solution to the Schrodinger equation and there's a discrete set
*  of higher energy states there's a discrete set of orbitals so even though in principle the electron
*  wave function can have any shape at all in practice dynamically it goes to lower and lower energy
*  states and those energy states have definite shapes okay and the definite shapes they can have
*  form a discrete set even though the underlying wave is continuous much like and you will hear
*  this analogy again much like plucking a violin string with its ends held down there is a
*  fundamental tone and there are harmonics that have more vibrations in them but they come in a discrete
*  set so the softening the blow kind of hint I will give you is quantum fields are also like that even
*  though the quantum field need not be isolated around a nucleus of an atom or anything like that
*  it has vibrations that have definite energies and there's a discrete set of them and it turns out
*  this is a I literally say in the book it's a walks like a duck quacks like a duck situation the
*  discrete energy levels that a quantum field can have turn out to have all the properties of
*  particles right there's a a state with zero energy or the minimum energy state which we
*  interpret as empty space there's a state with one quantum worth of energy and you can sort of look
*  at it from different reference frames and it looks like it has momentum and it looks like a one particle
*  state and then there's the next highest energy states that have at least twice as much energy
*  why because they are interpreted as two particle states etc so it's a combination of those two
*  things number one solving the Schrodinger equation gets you these discrete energy levels
*  that kind of have particle-like behavior then number two when you measure when you observe the
*  quantum field you're generally looking for things that have some discrete amount of energy some
*  definite amount of energy I should say the wave function itself of the field might be a super
*  position of various different states of energy just like a radioactive nucleus can be in a super
*  position of I've decayed and I've not decayed but both of those are going to be things you observe
*  when you observe you look for locations of things and the locations the sort of localized excitations
*  map on to these discrete energy levels and we interpret them as particles so it's really that
*  they always are waves they look to us as particles because of the dynamics of the
*  Schrodinger equation applied to the quantum fields hopefully that's at least a little bit of help
*  Peter says what's the update on your bold.org fund and scholarship do you have any specific
*  goals relating to the number and amount of grants you hope to provide in the future
*  overall what was your experience with using that platform so yeah if you go to the web page
*  apostrousuniverse.com slash podcast on the right hand sidebar there's a link to a bold.org mindscape
*  big picture scholarship page and we've been we gave two scholarships last year sorry two scholarships
*  the previous year or I don't know whatever that year was and then one scholarship this year and
*  it was kind of my fault we should have given away two scholarships this year but I did the paperwork
*  badly or you know I didn't we didn't set work they have rules bold.org which organizes things
*  has rules that say like you can't change the number or amount of scholarships in midstream
*  you have to say ahead of time how many scholarships you're going to give so it was my fault not moving
*  quickly enough on that so I'm hopeful that next year we'll either be able to give away
*  multiple scholarships or maybe slightly larger scholarships cannot say enough good things about
*  you folks out there the listeners here who have been donating to that scholarship fund
*  in in really just ways that warm my heart it feels great that there's so much support out there
*  and the students are are extremely appreciative of this again I've not been very good at communicating
*  with them but they send me very nice thank you notes and I'm very hopeful that you know we're
*  helping some people who otherwise you know would find it hard to go to college and do these
*  wonderful things so thank you all for supporting the scholarship. Alan White says I understand
*  that an electron is a wave in the electron field I also know that if I solve Schrodinger's
*  equation subject to some boundary conditions I find a wave function for the electron that gives
*  the probability of the electron's location are these two waves the same? Aha yes another good
*  conceptual question that we will get to the answer is no they are not the same very briefly I'll say
*  this because I'll go into it in greater detail next week but in quantum mechanics as it was first
*  developed by Schrodinger and Heisenberg etc you start with a classical description of a point
*  particle call it an electron or whatever and you quantize it and there's different ways of quantizing
*  things in Schrodinger's way you would replace the particle with a location and a momentum
*  with a wave function that you can make observations of and get an answer for
*  where position or momentum is but the thing that you're quantizing is a particle and then after
*  you quantize it it is described by a wave function in quantum field theory by contrast
*  whether it's a field theory of electrons or photons or anything else the thing that you're
*  quantizing is a wave and then you quantize that wave what does that mean well just like for a
*  particle you assign a complex number to every possible position and then that complex number
*  squared is the probability that you observe it here for a wave for quantum field theory you assign
*  a complex number to every possible profile of the field and so you would you imagine you're
*  observing even though maybe it's not the actual observation that's easy to make but what do you
*  imagine observing is the profile of the field all throughout space all at once and then there's a
*  wave function of the field so that's like a waviness on top of waviness that gives you the
*  probability of doing that now the weird thing as we just discussed is that despite the fact that
*  you start with a field and then you quantize it to get a wave function of that field what it looks
*  like after doing that are particles one of the big lessons that i try to get across in the upcoming
*  book which is going to come out very soon is that there's nothing intrinsically discrete or
*  pixelated or lumpy or quantum in quantum mechanics it is all continuous and smooth until you start
*  asking about what we measure what we observe okay and so it's weird it's a weird fact we'll try to
*  explain it how you start with a wave function start with a wave a classical field construct a
*  wave function of that classical field and what you end up observing when you measure it are point
*  light particles just the miracle of quantum field theory and if it bothers you for electrons just
*  think about it for photons right that's where the photoelectric effect and the black body radiation
*  explanation that max planck came up with etc come in tiny vibrations in electromagnetic
*  field are observed as particles that we call photons even though the electromagnetic field
*  is certainly a field by itself classically brian says is there a way to get all the earliest
*  mindscape episodes on patreon or commercial free i only found them through your website and i really
*  do not want to listen to them with the commercials yes so they we started patreon later there's two
*  things going on here one is that we started patreon after starting mindscape so mindscape
*  started all by itself we started patreon so there were no ads at all mindscape to begin but then
*  you know we got sponsorship and so forth and they put ads in after the fact through the early ones
*  i honestly forget whether the various earliest episodes of mindscape are even on patreon but
*  there's a separate problem which is that the there are early episodes of mindscape that are supposed
*  to be on patreon which there's some technical glitch that erased them so the the blog posts
*  are there the entries but not the actual audio files and i've had ongoing discussions with patreon
*  back and forth where they went how to get them back they can't seem to find them i don't know
*  what's going on there it's not that many but it's an annoying amount so they said the only thing that
*  i can do is dig up the original audio files and re-upload them i have not yet done that i've been
*  busy doing other things i really do hope to do that at some point keep bugging me about it i'll
*  try to get around to it gs says i wanted to be a theoretical physicist studying the foundations of
*  quantum mechanics since i was a teenager but for reasons i won't get into i ended up getting a
*  degree in computer science and have been working in the tech industry instead for over a decade
*  i'm at the point in my life where i'm seriously considering going back to school to get a phd
*  and pursue a career as a theoretical physicist this would be a long and difficult route and it
*  would be only worth it to me if i actually ended up with a job where i could do theoretical physics
*  research as my day job it seems to me that as private companies have no interest in theoretical
*  physics becoming a professor is the only way to do this and positions are very limited if this is
*  correct then the risk of having to return to my old job after all the work of a painting a phd
*  is too high however i'm hoping there's some other career opportunities that i'm not aware of my
*  question is do i have the right idea about how difficult it would be to get a job in this field
*  or are you aware of other career paths that would allow one to do theoretical physics research
*  unfortunately gs i have very little good news for you here on either count it is difficult to
*  get a job in this field if you go to the very best graduate schools most people who graduate
*  with phds doing theoretical physics from those graduate schools do not end up as physics professors
*  many of them do it's not like it's an infinitesimal fraction but there's a lot of competition it's the
*  single biggest downside for me of life as an academic is that it's a constant series of
*  competitions not because people are evil or like competition but because there just aren't that
*  many jobs out there it's like being a professional musician or athlete or whatever there's far more
*  people applying for these jobs there's no way around that unless society dramatically changes
*  its allocation of resources and starts funding a lot more professors somewhere so it is hard
*  to get a job and sadly there aren't that many jobs outside academia it depends what you mean
*  by doing theoretical physics physics but particularly since you mentioned foundations
*  of quantum mechanics that's even harder than the average theoretical physics phd there are very very
*  few jobs in foundations of quantum mechanics there are closely related areas in gravity in
*  quantum field theory and particle physics and what have you but it's still a long road to ho so all
*  of these the the thing to keep in mind is all of these considerations are considerations of
*  probabilities there's nothing you can do that makes you guaranteed to get a job doing theoretical
*  physics or are guaranteed to not get a job there's always a chance but like you say there's not that
*  many positions outside of academia essentially none and the jobs in academia are very unlikely
*  i you know i am a big believer in pursuing thinking about theoretical physics or even
*  thinking originally about it and doing research in it even if you don't have it as your day job
*  i think that that's uh something that everyone can aspire to if that's what they want to do
*  and i'm not saying don't go back to school and get the phd the phd in physics i think is a
*  very useful thing no matter what job you end up doing but we admit that there are realities
*  there's uh where you are in your life what your income is what your family situation is etc
*  perfectly valid to take those into consideration so i wish i could give you better news than that
*  but that's i gotta be honest about these things sean conna says how often do you have to decline
*  invitations for podcast interviews etc what criteria do you look for in a podcast before
*  accepting to be interviewed all the time i decline invitations as you might guess i get a huge
*  number of invitations it's pretty easy to start a podcast pretty easy to find my email and ask me
*  to be on it and so i feel bad i would like to do them all but it's literally just a matter of
*  constraints doing the podcast doing mindscape uh is not my day job it's not what i spend most
*  of my time doing and it could take over my life if i let it so i have to be very very
*  uh very very disciplined i suppose is the word to keep the amount of time i spend podcasting in total
*  to be very limited per year and therefore if i'm spending a significant amount of time on mindscape
*  i'm not going to appear elsewhere as often i appear much less on other people's podcasts now
*  than i did before starting my own um so what criteria do i use i mean basically there's no
*  set list of questions or anything like that but if i am personal friends with somebody or if they've
*  been on my podcast etc then i will probably go on or if i'm trying to promote a new book and they
*  have a very big podcast with a very big reach i will probably go on or at least i will try to
*  that's about it and you know i i even at that i think that i'm doing more podcasts than i really
*  should which is okay because there's other people out there who are super interesting to get on your
*  podcast if anyone's listening who is starting a podcast interested in physics or philosophy or
*  academia or ideas more generally you know it would be terrible if every podcast was just podcasters
*  interviewing other podcasters that's very you know inbred and stagnant you want to interview
*  people who haven't been heard that much now i know that if you're trying to build an audience
*  getting big names on is definitely helpful getting people who have a podcast and therefore are
*  recognizable to the podcast listening audience is absolutely helpful i won't tell you not to do that
*  but i will advise not sticking to only doing that and by the way i don't mind getting invitations
*  to the podcast as long as you don't mind me saying no i'm happy to be invited you never know maybe
*  i'm in a soft touch kind of mood that day george says how did you come to believe in poetic
*  naturalism i'd love to hear a timeline of how your views on that reality on what reality is have
*  evolved over time i don't you know i'm not very good at remembering exactly my own ideas about
*  these kinds of things so you know as i've said before on the podcast i remember where i am now
*  but i have trouble telling you exactly how i get here this is why autobiographies are often not as
*  good as biographies in some sense but you know i i toyed with atheism and what i guess i would now
*  call naturalism back when i was in high school without committing it to it seriously uh it was
*  in college that i became a fervent or you know thoroughgoing atheist or naturalist
*  but i did have beliefs that i've since dramatically changed i was a moral realist for example i you
*  know i had the simple-minded view that you could just treat maximizing utility or whatever as a
*  scientific problem or even that you could take you know some criteria like survival of the fittest
*  turn it into moral principles these days with slightly better philosophical background i know
*  that that's not the case and you have to do better emergent levels being real i not sure whether i
*  should count mathematical objects as being real but i lean toward no on that one these are still
*  developing over time so i think that um yeah probably i don't know when i really sort of
*  started thinking of emergence in a serious way and therefore higher levels as having their own
*  kind of reality i was never against it but i don't think i've really ever really thought about it um
*  very carefully gc klepna says i have trouble understanding renormalization your video in
*  the series the biggest ideas in the universe was very helpful but i still had many questions one
*  of them would be how legitimate how of a i guess of a legitimate trick renormalization is are the
*  infinities really predicted by qft and do we have to add another element to our theory to make
*  answers finite or are they for example just a feature of perturbation theory and when doing
*  qft non-perturbatively they would disappear well i i i hope that i think that if you watch the video
*  that i did in the biggest ideas um of the of the biggest ideas of the universe in the universe you
*  should know what my answer to this is because i do think i gave it there which is that um until
*  mostly when we're doing quantum field theory we don't think that the theories we're working with
*  are the final theory of everything right you should think of the infinities uh that we
*  encounter in quantum field theory as placeholders for we don't have the final theory yet clearly
*  until we understand quantum gravity in the ultraviolet at high energies we don't have the final
*  theory yet right and therefore the infinities that we get which all come from looking at very very
*  short scales very very high energies but ignoring gravity kind of shouldn't worry you i mean that's
*  clearly inconsistent because when energies become important gravity is going to become
*  important when energies become high so therefore we should do what ken wilson taught us to do
*  and cut off our theories at some ultraviolet scale take whatever happens in that unknown ultraviolet
*  regime short distances high energies and bundle them up into their infrared effects and work with
*  an effective field theory if that was not clear in the video then it will be hopefully super duper
*  clear in the book because i really pushed at under at trying to explain that that is to me one of the
*  single biggest lessons in studying quantum field theory and therefore i talked about it a lot in
*  the biggest ideas there's a whole chapter devoted to exactly this idea meath m i f e says if we
*  consider that atoms are in reality more wave like than particle like is it income is it incorrect
*  to assume that during compression such as in a formation of a black hole particles simply come
*  closer and stick together is it rather kind of a superposition of waves it is very much like a
*  superposition of waves so people often ask this about you know if there's some limit to how much
*  we can fit into a region of space given the pali exclusion principle how can you make a black hole
*  or something like that but remember that the pali exclusion principle doesn't say there's a
*  limit on how many electrons we can fit into a region of space it says no two electrons
*  can have exactly the same quantum state so i can have as many electrons as i want in the same region
*  of space but they will have different wavelengths they will have different momenta every different
*  mode in the electron field corresponds to a particle with different momentum and therefore
*  different energies and i can pile a low momentum electron right on top of a high momentum electron
*  no problem so what happens in the field theory as the collapse happens and the density of matter
*  becomes higher and higher is that the waviness of the quantum field underlying the electron
*  becomes more and more important it goes from being just one or two particles to being a
*  superposition of many many kinds of particles of course we don't really know what happens for
*  reasons that we just said and we don't understand quantum gravity and therefore quantum field theory
*  in the high density high energy regime but there's no reason to think that anything we currently
*  talk about is somehow illegitimate or incompatible with what happens there
*  all right i'm going to group two questions together and hopefully it will make sense
*  aaron holder says at the risk of violating the no special relativity paradox requirement could you
*  please explain the twin paradox i've read too many contradictory explanations and i am confused
*  is it acceleration that causes the different experience of time and paul saldera says when
*  talking to people about physics the hardest concept to explain is space time do you have some intuitive
*  way to describe space time that people can more easily grasp for the latter question for paul's
*  question you know everyone's different everyone's going to have a different aha moment when it comes
*  to understanding the nature of space time i do think that many many discussions of special
*  relativity do a bad job by talking about things like length contraction and time dilation because
*  those are exactly sort of keeping the notions of time and space separate but acting as if they're
*  sort of weird and flexible and different than what you think that they are that is very very
*  difficult for people to wrap their minds around space time as a unified whole once you take it
*  seriously i think is much easier to wrap your mind around than time time dilation and length
*  contraction really think in terms of space time and you know when people say what do you mean by
*  space time i'm not quite sure what to say it is both space and time is that a set of events the
*  set of places you can be in the universe indexed both by where you are and when you are that doesn't
*  seem that difficult to grasp at all what is maybe difficult to grasp is the fact that they are
*  unified together and all that means is that in some very very specific sense there's no unique
*  preferred well-defined way of dividing space time into space and time and i think that's pretty easy
*  to understand also you know here on the earth we have put coordinates on the earth latitude and
*  longitude we put you know so the zero of latitude is at the north pole and the south pole and we go
*  from there right but everyone admits we could have put different coordinates on there we could
*  have rotated our coordinate system very easily that's what happens in space time choosing different
*  ways of slicing space time into space and time is exactly choosing a different coordinate system
*  so to aaron's question you know once again i do recommend reading the biggest ideas in the
*  universe volume one because i explained this in great detail or even for that matter from eternity
*  here where i explained it also but the twin paradox is an immediate consequence of accepting
*  the fact that the duration of time that you personally experience is a way of measuring the
*  the interval you have traversed through space time it is exactly the same as saying i have two points
*  in space and i can take the shortest distance path between them a straight line but i can also take
*  longer paths i can go on curvy paths nobody is surprised when two people go from the same point
*  a to the same point b but walk a different distance because they took different paths
*  that's all that's going on in the twin paradox one twin stays behind and does essentially straight
*  line motion through space time that is to say not moving in space only moving in time the other one
*  zips out and then comes back okay so that is a curved path through space time and the difference
*  between space and time is that whereas in space the shortest distance is the straight line in time
*  the longest time is the straight line that is the actual quantitative difference between space like
*  paths and time like paths so you can easily remember which twin is younger because the twin
*  that didn't move the twin that basically moved on a straight line maximized their time elapsed
*  and therefore the twin that didn't move will always be older than the twin that zoomed out and came
*  back it is not the acceleration that causes the different experiences of time it is the fact that
*  one path is straight and one path is curved of course the fact that one path is straight and
*  one path is curved is because one accelerated that is absolutely true but you can have exactly the
*  same amount of acceleration and very different path lengths depending on when those accelerations
*  happen it really is the length of the curve that matters christian hoffman says i've recently
*  learned about spinners and the spin statistics theorem good for you christian these are good
*  things to learn about in the few videos that i've watched they were regarded as rather mysterious
*  and wikipedia says that an elementary explanation for the spin statistics theorem cannot be given
*  what makes the spin statistics theorem so mysterious and why can't i have my elementary explanation
*  look i am not someone who believes that every interesting fact has an elementary explanation
*  you know sometimes we can really get insight into things and it took us a long time to discover
*  something but after the fact we can come up with some elementary explanation for it other times
*  you know we just can't you gotta you gotta accept that and one person's elementary explanation
*  might not be in other persons i think with the spin statistics theorem which by the way for those
*  of you out there who don't know it is a connection between the spin of various elementary particles
*  and guess what there's statistics but statistics in this case mean are they bosons which means they
*  like piling on top of each other you can fit as many particles in exactly the same quantum state
*  as you want or are they fermions which means that the pali exclusion principle which we just talked
*  about holds and you can only have one particle in each particular quantum state so when we say
*  bosons and fermions you will often be told that bosons have spin zero one two fermions have spin
*  one half three halves five halves etc that is true but that's not the definition of bosons and
*  fermions the definition is can they pile on top of each other or do they take up space the spin
*  statistics theorem tells us as a theorem of relativistic lorenz invariant quantum field
*  theory that the ones that have integer spins are going to be the ones that compile on top of each
*  other the ones that have half integer spins are the ones going to be going to be the ones that take
*  up space now i can give a hand-waving explanation for this no problem i do in guess what my upcoming
*  book the biggest ideas in the universe volume two quanta and fields and here is roughly the
*  hand-waving explanation it comes in two parts neither part will make sense by itself but you
*  have to read the book for that part one says take a single spin one half particle for example
*  and rotate it by 360 degrees ordinarily when you rotate something by 360 degrees it comes back to
*  where it started but spinners which are the mathematical description of electrons and other
*  spin half spin one half particles have this special feature that they pick up a minus sign
*  when they come back to their original starting point after being rotated by 360 degrees it doesn't
*  matter because what matters is the wave function squared right and so the minus sign doesn't really
*  make any difference similarly but not identically if you have two particles that are identical and
*  that are fermions when you exchange them with each other the overall thing picks up a minus sign these
*  are two different operations one says i have a spin one half particle and i rotate it by 360 degrees
*  the other one says that i have a fermion that is to say a particle that takes up space i have two
*  of them and i interchange them with each other two identical particles but it turns out that those
*  minus signs cancel each other out they're basically the same minus sign in some very real sense that
*  is the origin of the spin statistics theorem now very obviously that's not a proof of anything for
*  one thing the actual proof relies on relativity i didn't mention relativity there at all right so
*  the spin statistics theorem is famously something where there exists hand wavy discussions that make
*  it plausible that it's true and people often give those plausibility arguments but the actual
*  rigorous proof of it requires very very delicate operations in relativistic quantum field theory
*  if you want those very very nuanced delicate operations to be made elementary i'm not the
*  person to come to no i don't know how to do that and i don't know anyone who does know how to do
*  that sorry about that richard williams says i recently told my 11 year old about the people
*  living on one of the andaman islands that didn't know about the rest of the world he was shocked
*  that it was actually illegal to try to visit or contact them we both agreed that had we been born
*  there we would definitely want to know about the rest of humanity i remember finding out at a
*  similar age to him and also being shocked do you feel this policy is right is it analogous to the
*  prime directive in star trek or the culture's contact rules now i'm older and can see the
*  difficulties of any contact i'm definitely torn as to what is for the best so by the way explaining
*  the little side there at the end the prime directive in star trek says that you're not
*  supposed to meddle with the history of you know a pre-technological developing civilization that's
*  what the federation of planets is supposed to be doing they violate it all the time of course and
*  to make the shows interesting in ian banks's culture novels it is very much the opposite
*  the culture is this vast pan species civilization that is constantly meddling with other proto
*  pre-technological civilizations to try to make them develop more peacefully etc so it's not as
*  if everyone agrees on what the right way to do things are you know i think that the right answer
*  here would be you should ask them you should ask these people do they want to be contacted by the
*  outside world of course the the tension there is that it's hard to ask them if you can't contact
*  them my impression i don't know a lot about this i just remember sort of reading about it years ago
*  is that this particular tribe were contacted by you know another tribe who did know about the outside
*  world and were asked you know do you want to be part of this global world and they said no so if
*  that's true that i'm 100 behind in agreement with what exactly happened there but i don't know if
*  it's true i think that you should i'm agreeing with your with your intuitions i guess or your
*  inclination which is to try to give them a choice you know don't just think to ourselves that we
*  know what's best for them and what's best for them is not to know about us but if they don't want
*  to be contacted then that should absolutely be their right or they just want to be left alone
*  that should be their right even if we think they might be making a mistake
*  sheldon sulyman says i'm currently reading the disordered cosmos by shan dur prescott weinstein
*  it describes the walls that have always been in place to hinder and prevent anyone other than
*  white males from becoming physicists do you see significant changes now and what is being done
*  to encourage diversity in professional physics circles well i think that there are changes i
*  don't think the changes are specific to physics in particular i think there are changes in the
*  broader culture people are much more conscious of the existence of discrimination now than they
*  were before there are still racist and sexist people out there no doubt about it i think that
*  much of the problem comes from people who are racist and sexist and don't know it you know who
*  would swear on a stack of bibles that they were not racist and sexist but in various ways that
*  they might not even themselves be aware of make life harder for people who are in minorities of
*  various sorts but we are making progress and you know it's because the people who have been
*  discriminated against have raised a ruckus and that makes the problem more obvious and so there's
*  more i think that the the default these days is to be try to be very sensitive to those issues
*  doesn't mean we always succeed so i think it's getting better if you just look at the numbers
*  is still a long way from being equitable right now by equitable just so we i don't think there's a
*  lot of trolls listening to this podcast but there are some trolls out there i don't care what the
*  final percentages are i don't insist that we be 50 men and 50 women in our field or whatever it is
*  who cares i don't care about that what i care about is that everyone who wants to do it be given a
*  fair shake and right now the percentages are overwhelmingly in favor of the white men but
*  that's not the point the point is the reason why that is true is because there's a lot of
*  barriers a lot of walls up there for people who are not white men and i think that it makes perfect
*  sense to actively try to tear those walls down and restore some equitability sean perry asks a
*  priority question remember priority questions are granted to patreon supporters once in your life
*  you're able to ask a question that i will definitely try to answer most of the questions
*  that are asked i can't answer there's too many of them but priority questions i will always try to
*  get to so sean's question is location size and energy requirements aside in theory could a device
*  create a micro black hole as a means of storing information for an albeit short period of time
*  and could that information be read by collecting all of the hawking radiation as it dissipated
*  could the storage capacity be calculated and what would be the fidelity of the information
*  read with respect to its original state will this be the new form of data compression on the
*  quantum internet in a billion years so i can pretty confidently say no this will never be the correct
*  form of data compression if you believe that information is conserved then indeed the
*  information that you put into a black hole will eventually come out however note two things number
*  one at a practical level it comes out very very very slowly right typically well let's just say a
*  long time i don't want to estimate because it depends on the mass of the black hole and things
*  like that for astrophysical black holes it is a very large number of years but more importantly
*  it's scrambled it's completely in its least accessible form that information so it's absolutely
*  not how you want to store the information it's just a potentially possible way of doing it i should
*  also say i don't know whether or not it's even possible in practice to get the information out
*  you know getting the information out means measuring the system right measuring the
*  radiation that comes out of the black hole i presume that there are ways of doing that measurement
*  that give you enough information about what went in that you could be useful to you but i actually
*  don't know that for sure information is lost when you do a quantum measurement that's that's something
*  we understand very very well okay the great deceiver says here is a quote from one of my
*  favorite philosophers alan watts if this is the way things started if there was a big bang in the
*  beginning you're not something that's the result of the big bang you're not something that is
*  a sort of puppet on the end of the process you are still the process now maybe that's a bit of an
*  obvious simplistic idea but his point is that when we define ourselves as separate individuals we cut
*  ourselves off from the original force of the universe which has many negative or far-reaching
*  consequences historically sociologically and psychologically what truth is there in that do
*  you think it is it an important realization to be aware of as a scientist yeah you know yes and no
*  i'm not i'm not sure about this one um we're absolutely part of the universe right that no
*  one believes that more than naturalists do we are made of the same kind of physical stuff
*  physicalists maybe i could even say the same kind of physical stuff arranged in patterns that obey
*  exactly the same kind of laws of physics as anything else literally the atoms that are in
*  your body don't stay in your body forever they can be swapped in and out for other atoms and
*  you're still you because you are more of the pattern the process as as watts says what is
*  the implication of that though like what does that mean for your life i don't think it means
*  too much i think that he is trading off of some kind of feeling that if we are part of the bigger
*  process we should literally feel a connection to it in some direct way i'm not exactly sure what
*  what he's trying to get at that's one of the one of the benefits of speaking poetically is that
*  people can find it hard to pin you down and you can always have plausible deniability but i'm not
*  sure what that connection is i mean if every human being were literally different were made
*  of different kinds of materials and did not start from the same point as other things in the universe
*  that mean that i didn't need to care about them or take their feelings into consideration or
*  that i couldn't learn from talking to them i don't think so i hope not i think that there are other
*  reasons mostly to care about the rest of the universe other than we obey the same laws of
*  physics and were made of fundamentally the same stuff edward sackinger says i enjoyed reading your
*  book the biggest ideas in the universe space time and motion and i'm looking forward to the next
*  volume quanta and fields my question is about the short shield solution naively it seems to give the
*  space time metric around a point mass but you say in the book that it is the solution to einstein's
*  equation in empty space why does the mass at the center not count yeah this is a very good question
*  this is a something that maybe i should have said more clearly in the book because you know once you
*  come across that question early in your physics career you sort of understand the answer to it
*  you forget that it was a question but short shield's original idea was literally to imagine
*  something like the earth not even a point mass but you know something with some spherical symmetry
*  okay but maybe finite radius and think about the metric the solution to einstein's equation
*  outside of the earth okay so when we say the solution in empty space we don't mean it doesn't
*  matter that the earth is there because the earth provides the boundary conditions many times when
*  you have differential equations like einstein's equation is you can solve it in some region once
*  you are told what the conditions are on the boundary of that region so here we're solving
*  it in empty space with the boundary condition that's somewhere inside a spherical region that
*  we are removing from consideration there's a boundary condition reflecting the fact that
*  there is a planet there or a star or whatever so that's what we mean by solving an empty space
*  we're not solving the metric inside the earth or inside the sun and so forth now there's another
*  thing that happened that short shield did not anticipate which is that the actual solution
*  does not describe a point mass it just doesn't it describes a black hole if you go inside
*  and a black hole has a singularity that is not a point in the middle it is a moment in the future
*  it is a moment that you necessarily hit if you enter that event horizon but that's a higher level
*  more complicated question the point is that the reason why we say empty space is because we're
*  thinking about the region outside the gravitating body jonathan bird asks who is your biggest
*  inspiration as a bass player well i have to remove the word inspiration really from this question
*  because even though i own a bass guitar and i occasionally fool around with it i am in no sense
*  really a bass player so it's not like i am emulating the style of anybody else i'm just
*  not that good at it okay but i like different bass players of all sorts my sort of rock and
*  roll favorite bass players are kind of the standard people you know john entwistle is is
*  definitely one of the best my progressive rock guys chris squire getty lee more jazzy people
*  like yaco pistorius more modern people like flee for example and there's also of course a
*  whole bunch of great jazz bass players charles bingus and and many others charlie hayden
*  which that always makes me think when i think of you know charles bingus as a bass player
*  versus john entwistle as a bass player like it almost seems like they're playing different
*  instruments right and of course they are because bingus is playing an upright acoustic bass and
*  entwistle is playing electric bass but we still say they're bass players but it's a very different
*  kind of thing it reminds me of a clip i once saw on youtube of keith emerson the rock and roll
*  keyboard player who had very eclectic tastes in music and he would play classical and blues and
*  jazz and whatever he would play anything and he pioneered a certain kind of rock synthesizer
*  playing that is still heads and tails heads and tails no many leagues above anyone else i think
*  in the rock and roll keyboard playing space but he once went on a tv show hosted by oscar peterson
*  the great jazz piano player and they played together and you know keith played some of his
*  stuff but then the two of them sat down and did a duo performance where they were improvising jazz
*  and i i honestly say i felt bad for keith emerson because you know if you were listening
*  to them play and kind of thinking of it as jazz piano oscar peterson was kicking his ass he was
*  many many light years better than keith emerson was at this particular skill set i don't really
*  blame keith for that in fact i give him credit for going to that situation because this was not
*  his bread and butter this was not what he was trained to do you know his playing was much more
*  on the beat sort of you know direct and straightforward whereas peterson is kind of
*  swinging and playing around with it and being more jazzy in various ways but you know keith had the
*  courage to go up there and and do that i would i'm not quite sure how it would have fared had you
*  given oscar peterson a moog synthesizer and asked him to play something from tarqus or something
*  like that but um anyway the point is even saying the word bass player just like saying the word
*  keyboard player can be almost completely different job descriptions rich lp says i came across your
*  summer book talk in my area for quanta and fields while perusing the list of upcoming events at one
*  of my favorite local comedy clubs i really enjoyed the talk you gave on einstein's real equation for
*  volume one of the biggest ideas in the universe can you tell us a bit about your upcoming book
*  talks and any hints as to what this next book talk will cover well i think podcast listeners
*  will get a preview because i think that um the the solo podcast coming to advertise the book
*  will cover some of the same ideas um for a talk i you know you don't have as much time and in a talk
*  so you should aim for under an hour for the talk because there's always things that will drag you
*  on and you want some time for questions and things like that whereas in the podcast i go forever
*  but also in the talk i have visual aids right which is hugely helpful so the talk might be
*  more comprehensible in some ways for that reason but it will cover less stuff so i'm still not
*  sure even though the clock is ticking i am not sure exactly how best to optimize um those things
*  what i will cover in the podcast what i'll cover in the talk certainly i want to cover this very
*  basic question why when you start with the theory of fields and you quantize it you get something
*  that looks like particles okay i think that's the one thing that is very rarely talked about
*  and people are curious about okay beyond that i mean there's one direction to go in would be to
*  talk about effective field theory of normalization interactions and so forth a completely different
*  direction would be to focus on symmetries and symmetry breaking and confinement and phases and
*  things like that a third direction would be to do spin statistics and stuff like that like any one
*  of these is an hour-long talk right once you add on the basics intro stuff so i'm not sure tune in
*  come i haven't actually the clock is ticking once again but i need to update my website where i will
*  do that and then you will find a list of book tour events there are not that many of them i'm not
*  flying around the country this is a book tour up here in the northeast where i can hop on the
*  train and it's not you know it's a low low budget book tour let's put it that way
*  roland weber says my local bookstore has two editions of the biggest ideas in the universe
*  quanta and fields in the catalog one gets published on may 14th by penguin in the u.s
*  the other two days later and with a different cover by one world in the uk i assume the content is
*  identical but can you tell us something about the differences do the u.s publisher insist on a head
*  start and or a distinct cover yeah so the way it works just to fill you in is if you well so
*  i can only say the way it works for me okay other people will be different i live in the united
*  states my agent and my publisher are all in the united states so all of my negotiating and writing
*  and editing is with my u.s publisher who is done which is a part of penguin and we do all that and
*  it's a lot of work so you know the editors at dutton help me write the book and you know make
*  suggestions and stuff like that it's all very important part of the process and then they come
*  out with a version of the book but the way that they write the contract for the book they do not
*  insist on the rights to publish it outside the u.s so the agent separately sells the rights to the
*  uk for example and maybe i don't even know but i think that the uk publisher will also
*  sell it in canada and australia and commonwealth nations maybe i don't even know the details
*  but so one world in the uk has been publishing my books for a while now and they do a great job
*  but they're not involved in the editing process right so basically we send them the finished book
*  and then they come up with their own cover and i forget this is embarrassing i should know the
*  question is always do they anglicize the spellings of the letters in the book right do they put you
*  in the word favorite and things like that i don't think that they bother to do that these days but
*  some some publishers will i think anyway they're polite enough to to tell me like here's the cover
*  we're going to use but i don't have a lot of say like you know as a author you don't have that much
*  say over the cover of your book or even the title of your book you have say to the extent that they
*  will politely ask you your opinion and you can give your opinion but it's sort of their choice
*  at the end of the day so happily i've been pretty happy with the covers for my books i do think the
*  big picture had a cover which was not quite what i wanted but other of my other books and actually
*  particle the end of the universe was a weird cover but that was just because they were rushing to
*  get it out and they did a wonderful job of getting it out in such a short time scale but the biggest
*  ideas in the universe covers i think are great miles jenkins says in the february ama you were
*  asked how you thought complexity emerged in the universe from the known laws of physics i was
*  surprised that you rather shrugged and said you didn't know it made it sound like this was a new
*  and challenging area of investigation just getting started i had thought that the thermodynamic basis
*  of the formation of complex molecular structures as explained by former mindscape guest jeremy
*  england was fairly well established that is in my own understanding in an open thermodynamic system
*  like the surface of the earth where septillions of atoms and molecules collide more or less at
*  random and with varying levels of energy sometimes old chemical bonds are broken sometimes new bonds
*  are formed but any molecular structure whose formation in such a collision entailed the
*  dispersal of some amount of energy as heat is less likely to be reversed by a subsequent collision
*  in proportion to the amount of energy dispersed thus there's an evolutionary direction a kind of
*  survival of the dispersing ist that conduces to the formation of ever more complex structures
*  so the point miles is that everything that you said is 100 completely correct up until the last
*  half of the last sentence absolutely in in a environment that features dissipation and
*  increase of entropy structures will go down to lower energy states as they emit photons and heat
*  and basically radiate out of the universe but there's no guarantee that those lower energy
*  structures are somehow complex that's the whole point why is it that they become complex rather
*  than simple right you can easily invent toy models where entropy increases and everything remains
*  perfectly simple all along the way you can invent other models where complex structures grow for a
*  little while before by the way eventually disappearing again if you continue to increase
*  in entropy all the complexity goes away so the reason why it's an interesting open challenge is
*  because complex structures are temporary steps along the way from low entropy to high entropy
*  that may or may not be reached and so there's a very good question under what conditions are
*  they reached is are there some overarching rules about why they're reached how they're reached all
*  the stuff like that so there's a long way to go to completely understand this cedro stucchi says
*  does the quantum vacuum state in a quantum field theory have dynamics that could lead to many
*  world style branching i've heard i've heard people say that something could fluctuate out of the
*  quantum vacuum but i don't understand if such fluctuations could give rise to structures that
*  last over time you know interestingly this is not known that is to say you know sometimes i say
*  things are not known what i mean is there are people out there who think they know the answer
*  but there's other people out there who think they know the answer and they're both perfectly
*  respectable people they completely disagree with each other so as a field we physicists do not
*  agree on this question are there dynamical fluctuations in the vacuum state of a quantum
*  field theory i just gave a talk on it actually a couple months ago there was a memorial workshop
*  in honor of jim hartl who passed away last year and jim with murray gellman developed the
*  decoherent histories sorry decoherent histories formulation of quantum mechanics which i don't
*  think is a separate interpretation or foundational theory of quantum mechanics it's a it is a tool
*  that you can use to analyze what is basically the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  but anyway decoherent histories has this goal of thinking about the set of things that happen in
*  a quantum state in terms of the histories of things over time and whether or not you can divide
*  the evolving wave function into different histories that deco here from each other
*  and i wrote a paper with kim body and jason pollock about boltzmann brains fluctuating out
*  of the quantum vacuum and we said if you have truly reached the quantum vacuum state not just
*  approximately there but truly there then that state is static nothing happens in it it is the
*  same state from one moment to another and therefore you should not say that dynamics
*  happens in that state and in particular you should not say that things fluctuate into existence out
*  of that state so not everyone agrees seth loyd wrote a paper thereafter saying i don't agree
*  i think i can start with a static quantum state and i can find a set of histories that in the
*  decoherent histories formalism will deco here from each other and so my point in the talk that i
*  gave and this i'm not the first person to say this but i tried to say it clearly is that that
*  is too loose of a criterion the ability to find some decoherent histories because you can always
*  find many many many different sets of decoherent histories representing very different things
*  and in the decoherent histories formalism you can attach relative probabilities to the different
*  histories within the set but if you then pick a completely different set of histories you cannot
*  compare which set is more likely than the other they both really exist at the same time and so i
*  think you need more stringent criteria for saying that a dynamical fluctuation really happens and
*  this is a quintessentially natural philosophy question it's a question that
*  requires input from philosophical thinking as well as from physics so my answer is no there's
*  no dynamics in the quantum state but other people disagree if i can find the time i will take the
*  talk that i gave and write it up as a real paper and i will let you know when that happens eric
*  dovey says according to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is there an exact lord of the
*  rings world out there is there a star wars world except darth vader loves to sing in other words
*  what kinds of possibilities are we allowed to consider and what kinds are we not so the direct
*  answer to the latter question which is not exactly the same as the former question is we consider in
*  many worlds what happens in the schrodinger equation the schrodinger equation tells us that
*  there is a wave function that evolves over time and then you can ask how i can divide that wave
*  function into a set of decohered non-interacting worlds and those are the worlds that happen
*  it is nowhere close to saying everything happens it is what is predicted by the schrodinger equation
*  that is what happens now it is possible so certain by the way certain things certainly cannot happen
*  and it's obvious that they won't happen if you have a spin of an electron that is 100 in the spin
*  up state then it is not going to branch into spin up plus spin down it's just spin up that's all
*  there is there is zero probability that you're going to observe it to be spin down so that is
*  an example of something that wouldn't happen in the many worlds interpretation more robustly
*  there are conservation laws like conservation of electric charge that are not violated in many
*  worlds you'll never see charge popping in and out of existence but it is conceivable i think that
*  the details matter here i'm not going to promise you that it's true but it is conceivable that very
*  very weird looking things will happen in one branch of the wave function that resemble lord
*  of the rings or star wars or whatever in exactly the same way that when i put my coffee mug on the
*  table there's a chance that will quantum tunnel through the table that chance is super super super
*  super duper low and therefore we don't think about it and worry about it but maybe you could argue
*  that in many worlds there's a world in which it happens and these fantasy worlds can be thought of
*  as concatenations of many many many many super unlikely events but i will i will even if that's
*  possible i'm not saying it is possible i'm saying it's conceivable i'm saying i don't know because
*  you'd have to go through the details of seeing is there a decoherent branch of the wave function
*  the universe that looks like that and i don't know the answer but i would strongly strongly
*  advise not to worry about it i think this is a weird thing this goes beyond eric's question but
*  it is a weird thing when people come across the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  they begin to fret about the super duper unlikely worlds and i think that one of the major sort of
*  mental stumbling blocks about people accepting many worlds is just that the people who like many
*  worlds like myself i don't care about the worlds the worlds are not the point that's like they're a
*  byproduct right he ever was not trying to put in all these extra worlds into into quantum mechanics
*  the worlds were already there they were there in hillbritt space they were there once you imagine
*  you have a wave function representing a superposition of different possibilities all everett says is that
*  you don't have to get rid of them to understand what the theory predicts and it predicts exactly
*  what we see but the worlds are not the point okay even the even the likely worlds are not the point
*  the point is what we observe in our world and that this very simple underlying structure helps us
*  understand and explain what we see in our world and when it comes to the super duper unlikely worlds
*  they are there in exactly the way that the entire text of lord of the rings is somewhere to be found
*  in the digits of pi right if you keep writing out the digits of pi and it's a truly random number
*  then somewhere you're going to come across the exact text of the lord of the rings very much like
*  borges's library of babel right the problem as you know from thinking about that example is that you
*  also come across a huge number of things that are almost like that but not quite and how do you know
*  whether you're in the right one or not and furthermore you have to look a very very very very very
*  very long time to find any of them at all it's not what you it's not relevant it's not important
*  these worlds even if they're there their probability that you would by self-locating
*  uncertainty find yourself in one is so incredibly low that you can just ignore it trust me you can
*  just ignore it astro nobel says in the big picture you write that the absence of consistency across
*  sacred texts counts as counts as evidence against theism following the same reasoning we can notice
*  that mathematicians all over the world provided they are not making obvious mistakes eventually
*  will all agree about mathematical theories would then would that then not be a strong evidence in
*  favor of mathematical realism well it's some evidence in favor of mathematical realism in the
*  following sense if you noticed that mathematical texts across the world were inconsistent with
*  each other you would i think quite rightly take that as evidence against mathematical realism
*  right therefore the fact that they are consistent is certainly evidence for mathematical realism but
*  excuse me it is not strong evidence for mathematical realism and the reason why it's not strong
*  evidence is because it's a different kind of question the question about whether god exists or
*  not is fundamentally an empirical question in the sense that there are different possible worlds
*  a world with god a world without god and we are trying to decide whether or not we live in one
*  world or the other but they're both physically imaginable kinds of worlds people who believe in
*  mathematical realism don't think that there are possible worlds in which mathematical realism is
*  true and others in which it's not right they think it's a matter of principle they think it's sort of
*  an ontological metaphysical basic feature of mathematics that it is real so the question of
*  mathematical realism is just not analogous to the question of theism versus atheism so it's not
*  nearly as relevant this little piece of evidence that you bring forward ilia levav says could you
*  please explain the motivational thought behind your recent overlapping degrees of freedom paper
*  while there are a lot more almost orthogonal vectors in an n-dimensional Hilbert space than
*  strictly orthogonal surely it's still a finite number how does it help reconciling such a
*  Hilbert space with the uncountable dimensional Hilbert space of quantum field theory so ilia
*  is referring to a paper that collaborators and i oliver friedrich in particular just published or
*  just put on the archive we haven't yet published it yet still waiting for that referee report to
*  come in but you know we're trying to reconcile the limit on the number of quantum states in a
*  region of space time from the holographic principle with the counting that you would get from quantum
*  field theory and we point out that you can fit a lot of almost orthogonal but slightly overlapping
*  states into a vector space and therefore maybe that's what's going on that the quantum field
*  theory states are in fact not quite orthogonal to each other so we think there are more degrees of
*  freedom than there really are but the question is if you think that the quantum field theory
*  is infinite dimensional surely you can't fit all of them that's completely true but we don't think
*  that so the starting point for the kind of quantum field theory description that we're comparing our
*  holographic description to has a bunch of cutoffs on it there is you have a region of space so you
*  fix the size of the region that gives you an infrared cutoff a long distance cutoff the size
*  of the region you put an ultraviolet cutoff on you put a short distance cutoff on because you say that
*  we're not looking at vectors or at wavelengths smaller than the Planck scale and you also have
*  an energy cutoff you do not consider states that have so much energy that you make a black hole
*  because that is a feature of quantum gravity so once you do all of these cutoffs you're not strictly
*  dealing with a full quantum field theory you're dealing with a truncation of quantum field theory
*  that has a finite dimensional set of vectors so but that still those vectors that that set of
*  vectors is still more than you would get from the holographic bound so that's why you want them to
*  be slightly overlapping mike pencil says which of the following would you like to experience in your
*  lifetime a 4k photograph of a black hole the discovery of a single celled life on another
*  planet finding the dark matter particle or the sixers beating the celtics in the playoffs
*  uh i'm torn here i mean there's two obvious choices uh discovering life for the sixers beating the
*  celtics but so i'm wondering like if i if i choose the single celled life does that mean the sixers
*  never beat the celtics in the playoffs that would be very very sad to me because i think that the
*  sixers being the celtics in the playoffs is something i am likely to see sometime in my life
*  going forward maybe i'm wrong famous last words but okay anyway to the more serious ones
*  i think that discovering single celled life on another planet would definitely 100 be the easy
*  choice here because it's a different kind of thing a photograph of black hole is great but i think i
*  know what black holes look like so i'm not expecting surprises there finding the dark matter particle
*  has greater chances of being a surprise because even though we think we know that there's dark
*  matter we don't know what exactly it is so finding which particular kind of particle it is would be
*  very educational but still we have a lot of good candidates for what it could be and finding that
*  it was one of those candidates would be like very very interesting but okay then you know we we we
*  guessed right somebody guessed right um whereas finding life on another planet of course people
*  have proposed that that's true but what kind of life is it there's an enormous amount to learn
*  from doing that just learning the fact that life is not so rare that it only exists here in the
*  solar system would be enormously enormously educational to us so finding a single cell
*  life anywhere else in the universe would be far and away i think the most exciting and interesting
*  result there i'm going to group two questions together one is from peter gaffney who says if
*  space is expanding is time also in some sense expanding and what does that mean and christopher
*  burke says i hear about the universe expanding in the spatial sense not in a relativistic sense but
*  in that distances between objects are getting bigger one of the issues discovered from the cosmic
*  microwave background was that normal expansion wasn't enough to allow for the uniformity of the
*  universe verse so inflation is the current solution my question has the expansion or contraction of
*  time been considered in addition to or instead of inflation the idea the initial phase change was
*  time why wouldn't this work so both questions are in some sense saying can time change or expand
*  as well as space but the answer is no that's an easy question it can't expand in the same
*  space and in the same sense as space is expanding and you know i'm going to give into the temptation
*  to give the glib explanation of that and then i will try to amplify it a little bit
*  look what do you mean by expand when you say space is expanding you mean that the distance
*  between galaxies who are far away from each other is getting bigger as a function of time
*  that's what it means so what would it possibly mean for time to expand how can time change as
*  a function of time time always travels at one second per second okay so there is no room in
*  the description of what you mean by time for it to expand in the same sense that space does
*  in yet other words there are different ways to measure time but they're consistent with each
*  other if you move on the same kind of trajectory through the universe and you measure time with
*  an hourglass and a ticking clock and your heartbeat and whatever to the extent that your
*  instruments are accurate they will always give you the same answer so that's what it means
*  operationally to say the time takes along at one second per second at the mathematical level
*  if you know general relativity this is immediately obvious this question you just write down the
*  metric of an expanding universe or spanning or contracting it doesn't really matter and you could
*  choose you know there is a part of that metric tensor the thing that tells you the geometry of
*  space time that tells you the rate of the time coordinate passing as opposed to the proper time
*  of some observer and of course the time coordinate can pass at whatever time you want coordinates are
*  arbitrary you can make them up but you immediately notice that i could change variables to use the
*  proper time of an observer as my time coordinate and then time cannot expand what can happen
*  is that the coordinate time can have a different relationship to proper time of observers as a
*  function of space as a function of where you are in the universe that's why you get things
*  like gravitational time dilation in black holes and things like that but time itself expanding
*  is kind of a non-starter as a concept chris gunter says what is a scalar doublet and how does it
*  differ from a vector in a two-dimensional abstract space so this is a technical question that i'll
*  answer very quickly again read my book coming out just next week quanta and fields goes into
*  this in great detail the higgs boson field that you will read about if you know about the higgs
*  boson the field before spontaneous symmetry breaking is described as a scalar doublet a complex
*  scalar doublet what that means is there are two scalar fields and they're related to each other
*  by some symmetry transformation indeed the symmetry is labeled su2 that is the su2 that
*  appears when people say the standard model is an su3 cross su2 cross u1 symmetry group and so yeah
*  it's a vector in an abstract two-dimensional space it is exactly that it does not differ from that
*  it's just that when you have a group like su2 you can have different representations of that group
*  right so just a little while ago when we're talking about spinners and the spin statistics
*  theorem we mentioned that the electron's wave function has the feature that if you rotate the
*  electron by 360 degrees it picks up a minus sign the higgs boson's wave function has the feature
*  that if you rotate it by 360 degrees it stays exactly the same it doesn't change at all so
*  there's the same symmetry group rotations in three-dimensional space but fields behave differently
*  under those symmetry groups and that's called different representations of the group so the
*  reason why we use language like scalar doublet rather than just saying this has an su2 symmetry
*  is because the su2 symmetry can be represented in different ways a doublet a two-dimensional
*  vector is just one such representation shambles says from what i see of the effective altruism
*  movement i'm not really seeing anything more effective than old-fashioned charity directed
*  at negating immediate suffering of crises to be truly of or crises to be truly effective surely
*  it needs to be addressing climate change and global poverty which the movement seems keen
*  to shy away from would love to hear any thoughts you have about it so my foremost thought there's
*  two foremost thoughts i have about effective altruism one is the idea is a good one the idea
*  as stated that if you want to be giving money to charity to be thinking altruistically it makes
*  more sense to do some cost benefit analysis and to figure out where your money or your donations
*  can do the most good i don't see how you can argue with that you might choose not to actually take
*  that path you might prefer to give to your local cat shelter rather than descending malaria nets
*  to africa that's perfectly okay but knowing what the most effective way to alleviate suffering
*  would be sounds like a good thing the other immediate con comment is that the fact that
*  it's a movement is bad i think that there are ideas that movements can take up or not but you
*  have to keep the idea separate from the movement that is trying to put that idea into practice
*  and i think that in the case of effective altruism number one those lines are blurred
*  the people who are thinking about the ideas think of themselves as part of a movement
*  and number two they have therefore empirically fallen into the trap that movements fall into
*  where they sort of become corrupt and go south right and that's why you get effective altruism
*  getting mixed up with people like sam bankman freed who built a lot of people out of money
*  because they you know went away from the idea of just making charities more effective and
*  started thinking exactly along the lines you're talking about thinking more globally but rather
*  than thinking about climate change and poverty they started thinking about existential risks
*  and artificial intelligence taking over the world and things like that more science fictiony kinds
*  of things and came up with ex post facto rationalizations of some really bad behavior
*  so you know look i think it's perfectly okay to think about these bigger picture worries and
*  it's perfectly okay to think about the threat of ai or other existential risks also perfectly
*  okay to think about climate change global poverty etc that's that's not instead of eliminating
*  poverty or you know handing out malaria nets or giving shots to people in poor areas you can do
*  all of those things this is why i'm not a utilitarian i do not think that the right way
*  to do things is just to find the one way to maximize utility and just do that right i think
*  that doing lots of good things is actually having a having a pluralistic rich ecosystem of good
*  things being done is ultimately better morally superior kevin james says in your april ama you
*  describe spin glasses and it reminded me of the resonance of molecules with aromatic rings such
*  as benzene is this perhaps a good real world example of that sort of system where it is trying
*  to achieve the lowest energy state i mean roughly speaking no it's not because lots of systems
*  try to achieve a lowest energy state a spin glass is enormously more complex than a single molecule
*  with an aromatic ring such as benzene there's many the fact that it has many many sites with spins
*  and the spins have different kinds of couplings to each other enables that complexity in a very
*  specific way that's where the interestingness and uniqueness of spin glasses really comes from
*  whereas a single ring of benzene has a small number of particles relatively speaking
*  marie dunn says in a long ago ama you were kind enough to answer a question by explaining that
*  the charge of a closed universe must be zero because all electric field lines must close
*  through through similar logic is it possible to say that in a closed universe all photons that
*  are emitted must eventually be absorbed nope it is not i mean in a closed universe you know
*  photons either are absorbed or they travel on forever in a closed universe both are possible
*  because a closed universe just has a spherical topology maybe that's one example of a closed
*  universe could have a toroidal topology or whatever and there's no obstacle to the photon just going
*  around the circle or the sphere or the torus many many times so no it's not quite an analogous case
*  the photon let's put it this way the photon is traveling through time as well as space
*  whereas the electrical field lines stretch through space at every moment of time
*  dazad says that dazad wrote in terms of maxwell's demon but i think it was really
*  laplace's demon who was intended so i'm going to replace that by saying laplace's demon even if
*  supplied with full information about the current situation of every particle in a system would
*  presumably need to solve the three-body problem to be able to determine the future or past states of
*  all but the simplest systems does this in any way undermine the usefulness of laplace's demon as a
*  thought experiment no it does not because a three-body problem is chaotic which means that small
*  errors in initial conditions can lead to large differences in final states but the entire idea
*  of laplace's demon is that there are zero errors in past states and there's zero errors in the
*  calculation of how the things evolve forward look laplace's demon doesn't exist there is no
*  laplace's demon it's just a metaphor for saying the universe is deterministic and conserves
*  information so don't get upset if you think that no thing other than the universe could do this
*  calculation it's just really the universe think of laplace's demon that way domino says how can we
*  tell that a photon has been redshifted versus simply having a lower energy level or just being
*  read in the first place well that's a good question i mean in principle you can't if you just had one
*  photon that came from something you didn't know anything about in the universe you wouldn't know
*  what its initial redshift what its initial wavelength was and therefore what its redshift had
*  been what you're looking for is many photons from a source so that you can single out spectral lines
*  the nice thing about quantum mechanics is that electrons in atoms have discrete energy levels we
*  can calculate what they are and therefore if you have a known atom whether it's hydrogen or anything
*  else and a known transition let's say between the lowest energy state and the second lowest energy
*  state you know exactly what the energy of the photon was and therefore its wavelength at the
*  moment when it was emitted and so you can see these spectral lines either in emission or absorption
*  in galaxies and various other things and that's how you know what the photons frequency or wavelength
*  was when it was first emitted and the redshift is just a comparison of that with what it looks
*  like when you observe it andrew k says how can time be emergent if t is in the schrodinger equation
*  well a couple ways one is of course so anyway i should back up and explain this people who don't
*  know the schrodinger equation is thought of as this complicated equation for quantum mechanics
*  but basically it's the time evolution equation in quantum mechanics it says that if you have a
*  quantum state it evolves with respect to time in a certain way depending on the energy the hamiltonian
*  so t for time appears right there in the schrodinger equation it is a fundamental part of the theory it
*  is not emergent in any sense so there's two ways the time could nevertheless be emergent one way is
*  maybe the schrodinger equation is not right okay maybe you have something deeper than actual
*  quantum mechanics that's absolutely possible but until you tell me what that actual thing is it's
*  hard for me to be specific about how that would happen the other is that the schrodinger equation
*  is in some sense still right but if the equation says the hamiltonian h operating on the quantum
*  state tells you the time derivative of the the quantum state then what if the hamiltonian is
*  just zero what if the hamiltonian annihilates the quantum state as we say then h psi equals zero
*  rather than h psi equals d by dt psi so in that case it's still a special case of the schrodinger
*  equation but time has disappeared from the equation and indeed this is not just hypothetical in
*  attempts to quantize general relativity for a closed universe anyway you get the wheeler de
*  equation which is precisely of the form h psi equals zero and then you get what is called the
*  problem of time in quantum gravity where did the time coordinate go and the answer is has to be
*  emergent in some way i'm not going to talk about ways it could be emergent but it has to do
*  there's different options having to do with entanglement and things like that but it does
*  explain why time could be emergent even though it appears in the schrodinger equation
*  um excuse me kyle capasares says when writing your textbook space time and geometry how did you
*  decide what the end of chapter exercises would be were they a combination of questions you devised
*  and variations of well-known problems from other relativity books yes they are exactly that i will
*  confess that in the book which i'm generally very proud of um i could have put more work into the
*  end of chapter exercises and added more of them in particular um i was just trying to get you know
*  really focus on the actual content of the text and there's other books out there including most
*  especially the famous problem book on relativity and gravitation which i think at least for a while
*  princeton university press had made publicly available for free i'm not sure if that's still
*  the case but there's lots of relativity problems out there so i didn't put too much effort into
*  coming up with clever ones but some of them i invented some of them i got from other people
*  giving them to me some of them were just sort of classics that will appear in other books
*  jose gascon says i am a computational chemist i use software to solve the electronic structure
*  of large molecules calculations typically scale as n cubed or higher i presume n is a number of
*  molecules so for large systems with a number of atoms maybe i'm not yeah number of atoms
*  for large systems like proteins such calculations become prohibitive this is due to the non-separability
*  of the schrodinger equation do you think we will ever make a breakthrough perhaps with alternative
*  quantum theories to solve the schrodinger equation efficiently without the need for enormous
*  superconducting capabilities well i don't think that alternative quantum theories are going to be
*  the way to do it i don't know much about algorithms so i'm very open to the possibility there's some
*  clever algorithms some clever change of variables that for specific problems will make solving the
*  schrodinger equation easier look you know if you have a free scalar field which of course is a
*  trivial problem much easier than yours but it's much easier if you take the fourier transform
*  if you look about if you look at the field in momentum space as a sum of modes of fixed
*  wavelength rather than in position space so that's a simple solution but maybe more clever ones work
*  for molecules that's that i don't know about that's very possible the other thing worth mentioning
*  is of course this is the perfect place to look for applications of quantum computers quantum
*  mechanics is hard quantum computers are slightly different than classical ones we've been struggling
*  to find examples where a quantum computer is worth building because it is clearly better than a
*  classical computer and one very very plausible answer is when you're studying quantum systems
*  such as molecules such as complicated molecules like proteins so i would i would think about
*  learning quantum computers and how they might help with these complicated problems people are
*  already on the case of course so you wouldn't be alone troy l asks a priority question this may be
*  dumb and really basic but what do we mean when we say the universe is 14.8 billion years old by the
*  way i think you mean 13.8 billion years old which we often round up to just say 14 billion years old
*  if time is relative and how do we reach that number what is the frame of reference does it mean
*  simply that were we to run our clocks backward we reach the singularity of the universe at minus
*  13.8 billion years earth time is this a dumb question so no it's not a dumb question at all
*  because like you say time is relative more specifically as we talked about with the twin
*  paradox two different clocks that move on different trajectories through the universe will end up
*  reading different amounts of time elapsed so how can it be that we have a single number for what
*  the age of the universe is and the answer is in the real world there is a reference frame that
*  is preferred the reference frame that is at rest with respect to the rest of the stuff in the
*  universe we don't live in empty space we have stuff in the universe we have the cosmic microwave
*  background radiation we have other stars and galaxies there is more or less a rest frame for
*  all that stuff more specifically there's a frame in which the cosmic microwave background seems to
*  be at rest so when we say the age of different things in the history of the universe including
*  the big bang itself we mean as it would be measured in that reference frame that's all we mean
*  madeline car says do you think that consciousness itself has any necessary function and or effect
*  in the physical world or is it simply a byproduct or epiphenomenon of independent physical processes
*  what proof is there to lead one way or the other i think actually i'm going to group this question
*  because there's a question later on about um compatibilism and i forget where it is is later
*  on the file i didn't group this in when i was organizing so i'm going to do it in in real time
*  now uh what is compatibilist free will right that was that was the question that is asked later on
*  and so um compatibilist free will says that you talk about the human beings at the emergent higher
*  level as agents that have the ability to make choices it can be also true that there are lower
*  level descriptions whether in terms of neurons or elementary particles or whatever but you are allowed
*  to and can and should think about the higher level for its own sake in addition to making sure that
*  it is compatible with the lower levels so both free will and consciousness in my view are
*  manifestly real at that higher level i don't know about you madeline but i am conscious i am aware
*  of my surroundings i have experiences and so forth what i mean by that statement is that the best way
*  of talking about myself as well as other beings is that they are conscious creatures and what that
*  means is that indeed there uh is causal power to that fact it is it has different implications for
*  the world if i say someone is conscious of a certain state of affairs or they're not conscious
*  of a certain state of affairs right that leads me to make different predictions about how they
*  will behave in the world so consciousness or free will for that matter have as much causal impact
*  in the world as tables and chairs do they are not fundamental they're not there in the standard
*  model of particle physics but once we coarse grain and look purely at the higher level they play a
*  very clearly important role they're also not there if you look at the fundamental level but that
*  doesn't mean that they're not real that's the poetic naturalist point of view that we were
*  talking about earlier so read the big picture for more tese van renen says list oops i i scrolled
*  by accident t-sen renin says listening to the podcast and reading your books i'm always impressed
*  by the way you concisely and clearly explain or express the most complex concepts and ideas
*  this also clearly shows when you summarize what a guest just said and usually come up with an easier
*  or more accessible way to convey the same information could you perhaps explain what it is you do or
*  don't do to achieve this well thank you that's a very nice compliment i mean i don't know what is
*  going on there i'm not i'm not following some matchy formula or anything like that i do you know
*  as i've often said one of the nice things about mindscape is not only am i the interviewer but
*  i'm also the the booker i choose who to who to ask to come on so i'm genuinely interested in what they
*  have to say and you know in in some very real sense i'm simple minded about the things that i
*  think i understand i understand things when i can clearly see what is being said and how the different
*  concepts fit together so when i'm talking to somebody or when i'm just thinking about something
*  and trying to explain it to somebody else i am trying to simplify i'm trying to boil down things
*  to their essences to strip away the parts that don't matter and to get to what does matter part
*  of that actually you know i'm just making this up i haven't thought about it very deeply but
*  part of it might be related to the fact that i care about talking to a broader audience right that i
*  care about doing podcasts and writing books because there you can't get away with the various
*  shortcuts and jargon words and things like that that the ruts that we fall into as professionals
*  thinking about these things you have to simplify as much as you possibly can so you build up a
*  sort of muscle that helps you take a complicated thing and simplify it down to the essence maybe
*  that's true i'm just sort of spitballing there ryan vaughn says as a physics layperson it appears
*  to me that there's a bifurcation of the field into theorists and experimentalists is that in fact the
*  case and if so why can expertise in designing practical real world experiments constrain one's
*  ability to think freely about new theoretical concepts i don't think it's the latter i just
*  think that the fields are very big now i mean there clearly is a difference between theorists
*  and experimentalists but their tasks are different coming up with theories solving the equations you
*  know coming up with approximations and things like that is a different job than building an
*  instrument collecting the data processing the data understanding backgrounds and things like that
*  back in the day the number of theories and the complication of the experiments were such that
*  one person or one group of people could do both and now it's just harder because the theories are
*  more involved in the experiments are more involved it's like saying you know can expertise in driving
*  a race car constrain one's ability to be a michelin star chef no there those two things are
*  completely possible but they are both time consuming right so very few people are michelin star chefs
*  and professional race car drivers that's why not many people are high level theoretical physicists
*  and high level experimental physicists nothing more difficult than that the best ones in each
*  camp talk to each other but they're not the same person okay we're going to group two
*  questions together let's see if they make sense nikola evanov says in your episode with david
*  deutch he stated that quantum field theory seems wrong to him because the field seemed
*  discontinuous when two commuting not causally linked space-like separated field points suddenly
*  become non-commuting i.e. causally linked when crossing the light-like borders of their respective
*  light cones this apparent jump in the quantum state of the fields bothers him to the best of
*  your knowledge has anyone suggested a physical mechanism that could provide a possible explanation
*  for this perceived discontinuity of the quantum fields and then nanu says if we ever found the
*  theory of quantum gravity how do you think this achievement would impact our understanding of
*  quantum field theory and the infinities that it encompasses there seem to be conceptual
*  discrepancies between infinite numbers of degrees of freedom in quantum field theory
*  and finite number of degrees of freedom and gravity or black holes it's hard enough to
*  imagine that quantum field theory has significant gaps since experiments are delivered with high
*  precision so my question is how would finding quantum gravity impact our understanding of
*  quantum field theory the reason why i'm grouping these two questions is because the answer to
*  question one might be implicit in question two in quantum field theory by which we mean
*  quantum field theory in flat spacetime okay let's just take that we have spacetime as a fixed
*  background so we're not trying to do quantum gravity so we're using now the phrase quantum
*  field theory as something separate from quantum gravity there are discontinuities so what what
*  nikola is referring to is if you poke a quantum field at one point in spacetime there are influences
*  ripples that that are strictly inside the light cone that's just you can't move faster than the
*  speed of light right and that actually shows up even in the vacuum state even if you don't
*  poke the quantum field but just ask what are the correlations between what the quantum field is
*  doing at two different points you get different answers depending on whether they are causally
*  connected or not does that bother you so it bothers david deutsch it doesn't bother me it
*  doesn't bother most people who do quantum field theory this is a fact that is not one of the more
*  bothersome facts honestly about quantum field theory but also it is probably not fundamentally
*  true because gravity exists okay so because there is quantum gravity the idea of spacetime being a
*  fixed background with well-defined light cones is probably just an approximation and therefore
*  probably these things that seem infinite or sharp or discontinuous in the quantum field theory limit
*  might be smoothed out and blurred and less troublesome when you also include quantum gravity
*  so to nandu's question yeah i think that quantum gravity might have an important
*  back reaction or important influence on how we think about quantum field theory
*  one very simple way that it does it is just to change how we conceptually worry about what
*  happens at short distances and high energies namely at the very least we shouldn't be surprised
*  to not understand what happens at short distances and high energies because gravity is going to be
*  important at those levels this paper that i recently wrote on non-overlapping degrees of
*  freedom is one attempt among others to ask whether or not that influence of gravity might extend
*  to longer distances and lower energies the infrared regime not just the ultraviolet regime
*  because that's where we can do experimental probes we don't know what those i mean it's a very
*  speculative paper that's much harder to say what the impacts of quantum gravity could be
*  but it's worth looking because that might give us some crucial empirical clues
*  matthew wright says in last month's ask me anything you said you'd reveal which episode of yours in
*  the last year was recorded in person if we reminded you what is it so actually i looked back and there
*  were two of them the one i was thinking of was tim maudlin because tim was actually visiting
*  baltimore at the time and he came to my house and we recorded the episode right here in the same place
*  i'm recording it right now but i'd forgotten there was another episode recently which is bill
*  egginton who of course is a hopkins professor so we recorded that one in his office in on the
*  hopkins campus so i don't know whether the audio quality or the style of conversation was any
*  different for those but those were actually in person tim converse says i take it that we don't
*  currently know of any experiments that would help us decide between say the many worlds interpretation
*  and the copenhagen interpretation as they both predict the same experimental results
*  do you believe that this will always be the case or is there a possibility of finding differential
*  experimental support for one or the other well i think that the honest answer here is i don't
*  think the copenhagen interpretation is a well-defined theory so i think that it is
*  just incomplete it is completely unfair to ask a complete and well-defined theory like many worlds
*  to be experimentally compared with a vague and incomplete theory like copenhagen there are other
*  complete theories that are not many worlds like bohme and mechanics or grw theory and there the
*  situations are different grw is a is a situation where wave functions objectively collapse at
*  random intervals and yes those random collapses have experimentally testable implications that
*  we are trying to experimentally test the interesting case is bohme and mechanics versus many worlds
*  now someone like david wallace would argue that bohme and mechanics is actually not perfectly
*  well defined because we don't know how to do it with quantum field theory yet and quantum field
*  theory is our best theory of nature so until we can actually get a version of hidden variable
*  bohme and mechanics that plays nicely with quantum field theory we're not sure what to say
*  but putting that aside the people who are advocates of bohme and mechanics would would argue that where
*  it is well defined it gives you the same experimental predictions as many worlds does and there are
*  arguments i understand what the arguments are for that i'm not completely convinced by them
*  there might be loopholes i don't think that people have tried nearly as hard as they could
*  to find possible experimental discrepancies or differences between many worlds and bohme and
*  mechanics so i encourage people to try to do that i'm not going to spend much time doing it myself
*  because i'm not that interested in bohme and mechanics but if i were interested in bohme and
*  mechanics i would be bending over backwards to rather than show that it gives exactly the same
*  experimental predictions as as many worlds to show that it gives something different that would be
*  super duper interesting p walder says universal teleology seems a popular explanation for accounting
*  for meaning in life e.g. bostrom gulf musser azarian etc what is your take on the notion that
*  the universe through some darwinian like process is evolving and that consciousness is an outcome
*  of such a process i mean there's a lot going on here one is that of course the universe is evolving
*  that's what the universe does it evolving just means changing with time so yes the universe is
*  evolving is the universe undergoing natural selection la la darwin i mean darwinian evolution
*  natural selection is a very particular type of change over time it requires that you have
*  entities called organisms that have information about their structure that they can pass on
*  to subsequent generations in some kind of hereditary fashion but with modification with either sexual
*  mixing of genes or mutations or etc like all that setup is very specific if you're not doing that
*  then you're not doing darwin okay so things that are not biological that are not darwinian can
*  change over time you know the continents on the on the earth move around over time they evolve
*  but they're not being naturally selected in any sense and the other thing to say is of course
*  the whole point of darwinian natural selection is that is that it is not teleological there is no
*  goal to natural selection it adapts to whatever situation it finds itself in but it doesn't see
*  into the future and say oh i'm going to adapt my dna or my genomes because something is going to
*  happen in the future or because i want to achieve some goal it is really moment to moment simply
*  selecting on what kind of genomes work for the situations you find yourself in and i think that's
*  it works very very well i think that's a perfectly good explanation read dan denett's book darwin's
*  dangerous idea for the to really drive home the fact that it is explicitly non-teleological
*  and it works really well so i see zero reason in nature whether it's in physics or biology or
*  anywhere else to invoke say some sort of teleological aspect to the fundamental dynamics
*  bart shipper says never would have asked you this but on your latest appearance on lex friedman's
*  podcast you mentioned that you really want to be asked for relationship advice in your amas so i'm
*  happy to oblige by the way i was partly joking about that but i'm very welcome to be asked for
*  relationship advice i don't necessarily promise it will be good advice that i give i'm not very
*  good at giving advice in general you know that's why asking answering factual questions is easier
*  for me than asking advice questions but i sometimes try to give it my best shot anyway bart says
*  i'm a recently single 35 year old father of two adorable little troublemakers i work as a software
*  engineer and have pretty typical nerdy hobbies like board games etc i'm a bit of an introvert
*  so going to random parties etc is not my idea of fun these character traits were also part of
*  the reason of the breakup of my relationship i'm a bit worried i'll have a difficult time
*  meeting women and sometimes fear i'll be alone for the rest of my life do you have any advice
*  on how to approach this given that society tends to look more positively towards the extrovert
*  outgoing type and introverted people have kind of by definition a harder time meeting each other
*  i don't have a lot of advice for this kind of situation i am also you know myself kind of
*  introverted in the sense that going to random parties etc and mingling with strangers is not
*  my idea of a good time i am a someone who has the ability to act extrovertedly or to you know speak
*  in public and things like that but but the typical introvert traits of those activities
*  draining your energy and you need to go and be alone and recharge are very very much my way of
*  being but my point of saying this is that being introverted doesn't mean that you can't mingle
*  and socialize those are skills those are not automatically bequeathed to people just by virtue
*  of being born you can work at them and you can get better and there are different ways to do it
*  you know i think and i think i get one more relationship advice question later in the ama
*  and i will i will echo something i'm going to say there here which is the single best way to meet
*  people and um eventually lead to some kind of romantic involvement is to just try to meet
*  people without explicitly trying to make it lead to romantic involvement just try to meet people
*  meet men and women people who you like to talk to in different um circumstances people who you share
*  interests with you can do that on the internet you can do it in person um you can do it by trying to
*  do it you can doing it by letting it happen it is true that it's much harder when you're 35 than
*  when you're 23 and you're in college or you know just starting a job or whatever it does become
*  harder for all sorts of reasons but jennifer and i met when we were 40 uh and we met through you
*  know mutual interests online we both had physics blogs right so you never know what the actual
*  thing is going to be but neither one of us were on the prowl looking for someone to marry or even
*  to be romantically involved with we just were interested in what each other were doing and
*  that's how it worked out um i tend to think that that's how it usually works out when it works out
*  well in other words that you're not specifically looking for someone to get married to you're
*  looking for people to share interests with and to bond with in different ways um you do have to put
*  yourself out there a little bit right that is you know there's no easy way around that even if you
*  would personally be most happy just sitting at home watching netflix and eating pizza
*  you have to actually go out there and meet new people and and talk to them there are people you
*  know there are groups where people play board games and watch movies and talk about them and
*  so forth think about ways to do that you know so it's it's a mixture of taking a breath and
*  working up the gumption to put yourself out there in some way and relaxing about the romance part
*  of it just think about it as living your life maybe you don't meet a romantic partner but you
*  meet a lot of interesting people this way that would be there's certainly worse things that would
*  happen than that zach mckinney says in response to your solo episode comments about the societal
*  impact of brain computer interfaces and artificial intelligence what aspects of natural human
*  cognition do you believe are the most important to preserve and cultivate in a world increasingly
*  dominated by artificial and augmented intelligence to what extent should we individually and
*  collectively invest in developing and maintaining the cognitive capabilities that can be easily
*  replicated or surpassed by ai relative to learning to using such technologies as effectively as
*  possible or honing human capacities that cannot yet be effectively automated i think this is a good
*  and important question but a hard one to answer because the capabilities of ais are still very
*  much in flux right so they're getting better at certain things it's hard but important to
*  extrapolate those improvements to where they will eventually go you know i think it's it's super
*  clear that ais are much better at mimicking human behavior now than most of us five or ten years
*  ago would have guessed they could be but still falling very short of being human behavior they
*  still make all sorts of elementary mistakes so are those elementary mistakes easily fixable or not
*  there's a whole bunch of people who think that those mistakes that ais continue to make are
*  fundamentally part of the package and they're not going to be easily fixable others are much
*  more optimistic and think that's just a technology problem and we'll eventually get there so i don't
*  know what the capabilities are having said that yes i think it makes perfect sense when a new tool
*  forget about ai is a specific thing whenever a new tool comes along that makes some existing human
*  task much much easier we stop worrying about training people to do that task and let the tool
*  do the task i think doing your multiplication tables now is much less important than it would
*  have been 200 years ago we all have calculators on our phones right other i'm sure you can think
*  about manual labor tasks that are much less important now that we can automate them and i
*  think the same thing will be true with ai you might personally take pleasure or pride in any sort of
*  things that you can do but if there is some ai that can do it just as well then we can free
*  ourselves to do other things by letting the ai do the things that we don't want to do i'm entirely
*  in favor of adapting to that in whatever way seems best suited to what those capabilities turn out to
*  be nicolo mus mesi mus mesi says in some descriptions of special relativity the speed
*  of light limit is linked to causality surpassing light speed would allow effects to happen before
*  their causes which is impossible but how is that a problem given that causality is a macroscopic
*  emergent property rather than a basic physical law i think that the thing to be honest about here
*  is that physicists talking about relativity have borrowed the word causality but changed its meaning
*  without telling you okay so before relativity came along or even before newtonian mechanics came along
*  if you were aristotle and you were thinking about cause and effect relations you know aristotle had
*  all sorts of different notions of causality or really explanations is what he meant but
*  one form of causation is just the idea that there are events in the universe that we call causes
*  which are linked subsequently later in time to events that we call effects right there are causes
*  and then there are effects and that relationship is intrinsically time directed we always think
*  that the cause comes before the effect in our everyday lives and so when relativity comes along
*  we notice so sorry maybe maybe the thing to say is this in a purely newtonian world
*  before relativity came along that would be the end of the story causes come first effects come later
*  when relativity comes along now we have a third category right from every event there is a past
*  and a future but also space like separated events events that you could reach that are not in your
*  past but you could only reach them by going faster than the speed of light and so physicists
*  have taken that idea and adapted the idea that causes come before effects to say that causality
*  limits effects from moving faster than the speed of light right because if you are space like
*  separated if two points are not related by either a past or future directed curve then you can choose
*  different coordinate systems in which those two points are in the path one point is in the past
*  or one point is in the future or at the same time there's no fact of the matter about which
*  the field the the event is in the future or in the past it depends on your coordinate system depends
*  on your frame of reference so therefore physicists have just adapted the word right so when physicists
*  in a quantum field theory book or in a general relativity book talk about causality all they mean
*  is that you can't travel faster than the speed of light you can hopefully see how that descends from
*  the Aristotelian view that causes precede effects but it's a slightly different idea
*  that's okay we often borrow the same terminology to refer to slightly different ideas
*  okay i'm going to group two questions together once again slightly different questions but
*  hopefully you'll see the connection schreiber bike says i find i agree with you on the vast majority
*  of things but i'm having trouble with the many worlds interpretation the simplicity of the
*  schrodinger equation creating a new universe every time an observation takes place is wonderful but
*  it asks a lot my bayesian priors put low credence on models that require the creation of universes
*  just like ours either more than once or some high number of times per second i know a lot happens
*  beyond the world i perceive directly but in my mind the frequent creation of universes like ours
*  is too much what am i missing and then mark kumeri says i am thinking about electromagnetic fields
*  i turn on my tv and start watching the nba and nhl playoffs i then think about everyone around me
*  doing the same people speaking on the phone someone listening to the mindscape podcast etc
*  it seems inconceivable that all that information is somehow just vibrations in a field and is
*  really there in the space in front of me so these two questions are not obviously related but let me
*  answer the second one and i see i hope that you will see how it plays into the first one
*  when you say it it just seems inconceivable mark that all the information about the signals that
*  we're receiving on our tvs etc are just somehow vibrations in the field why is that so inconceivable
*  what is so hard i think all you're really saying is that your intuition is a little bit strained
*  that it seems like a lot of information contained in this very abstract intangible
*  field surrounding all of us and indeed there's a tremendous amount going on if you think about the
*  electromagnetic field at any one point in fact just the electric field forget about the magnetic
*  field make your life easy what do you mean you mean that if you placed an electron at that point
*  and it would jiggle around because it is being pushed by this fluctuating field called the electric
*  field and that electric field that is pushing around the electron is a combination of all sorts
*  of waves the light waves coming that you see with your eyes but also the radio waves
*  and microwaves that are sending signals around infrared light from your remote control and what
*  have you and to decode to extract all that information from the jiggles of the electron
*  would require you know some time domain data and then a bunch of four-day transforms and
*  quite elaborate mechanisms but we can do it we can build the technology that that does it
*  and if you imagine that at every point in space there's a field vibrating in a certain way
*  it shouldn't be that hard to imagine or to accept that there's an enormous amount of information
*  contained i mean after all there's an infinite number of points in space and an infinite number
*  of ways an electron can jiggle so there's a lot of capacity for the electromagnetic field to convey
*  information there's really nothing for me to say other than you should stretch your
*  ability to accept very very big numbers like the amount of information contained in the fluctuating
*  electromagnetic field hopefully you see how this connects to schreiber bike's question about
*  many worlds all you're saying at the end of the day is that wow that's a lot of worlds i don't
*  like it i don't see where they come from it seems like it seems like a burden to create all those
*  worlds right so many worlds but that's just your intuition that only has
*  experience with one world right like what in the world should your intuition have to say about this
*  question you can write down the equation the equation is reliable your intuition has no right
*  to be thought of as reliable in this particular circumstance remember you didn't put in the worlds
*  all you did was take the schrodinger equation at face value put it this way as i often do
*  if you believe that an electron can be in a superposition of spin up and spin down
*  which quantum mechanics taken as realist about the wave function asks that you believe
*  then you should be able to believe that the universe can be in a superposition of many
*  different things it's just a matter of scale once you start believing in superpositions
*  it's just a matter of scale once you start believing in superpositions you can't it makes
*  no sense it is clearly your lack of imagination to be able to say i believe that electrons can be
*  in superpositions but not that the universe can be in superpositions the equations don't care
*  they're able to describe one just as well as the other the relevant question becomes does that
*  superposition of the universe being in different states come to pass is it created by the time
*  evolution of the universe and the answer is yes you can easily show that does happen all the time
*  so you know suck it up i don't know i mean if you're of course it's very very different from
*  anything that we experience in our everyday lives but that's not a principled reason to doubt this
*  theory and if you really doubt it anyway then come up with a better theory that would be awesome if
*  someone could come up with a better theory no one would mind that aj says do you subscribe to any
*  substacks or have any thoughts on substack versus newspapers magazines i do not subscribe to
*  substacks myself i do you know read social media blue sky is my current favorite but i read different
*  ones and they link to substacks quite often so i'll read that but my thoughts are are kind of
*  mixed you know on the one hand it's amazing to have the freedom both to choose to read a bunch
*  of interesting people and for anyone to write right whether it's substack or anything else the
*  ability to go on the internet start your own blog or newsletter or whatever is absolutely an improvement
*  over the inability to do that that we used to have on the other hand you know it does let you
*  hide in a bubble if you want it lets you read conspiracy theorists or disinformation experts
*  and if you if that's if you want that to be your news diet then you can be exposed to that if you
*  want so there is in other words a useful role for curation and editing and so forth like those things
*  that might go away if we entirely move to individuals blabbing on their substacks will be a loss
*  as opposed to newspapers and tv stations that actually have editors as well as reporters
*  of course another thing that is a loss is that the reporting aspect is supported by an institution
*  right newspapers think that they have a duty to report the whatever is the relevant news for their
*  beat that they're covering and they put resources into it they can pay reporters to go places find
*  information and so forth the substack or blog model kind of rewards you for sitting back and
*  you know talking about stuff not for climbing in your car and visiting some place and collecting
*  more information people do it people still do it anyway but there becomes this greater emphasis
*  on punditry and commentary compared to original news reporting and as someone who's married to
*  a journalist i'm not making this up the the amount of resources and jobs given to people
*  actually doing reporting has absolutely cratered in the last 20 years because of the internet and
*  this is absolutely independent of anything else by itself that's bad okay so there's good aspects
*  and bad aspects i don't know how it's all going to wash out i hope that we still do have 50 years
*  from now something called a reliable mainstream media no media mainstream or otherwise is perfectly
*  reliable but we can work to make it better and i think we should mario butay says when you cover
*  the topic of adscft from time to time you bring the conversation back to earth by saying but this
*  is not the real world reminding everyone that we don't live in a universe of two plus one dimensions
*  with a negative cosmological constant would you apply the same argument as strongly when referring
*  to the six dimensional space dimensions of string theory no absolutely not because we might very well
*  live in a world with the extra six additional space dimensions of string theory they can just
*  be compactified and we don't see them there's a huge difference between saying maybe something
*  is there we just don't know like the extra dimensions of string theory and saying this
*  is a situation which we know is not true like adscft and ads the curvature of space is dominated by a
*  negative vacuum energy in our universe we have if anything a positive vacuum energy certainly not
*  a negative one so that's just wrong that's not just speculative and unsure that's just incorrect
*  it's still very worth doing adscft even though it's not the real world because we might learn
*  something about qualities of quantum gravity etc that are then relevant to the real world
*  ultimately it's the real world we care about and that real world may or may not be described by
*  string theory with its extra dimensions we just don't know spencer hargis says do you remember
*  any ideas that struck you as incredibly exciting but which seconds later you realized wouldn't work
*  and never told us all how often has this occurred seconds later is an exaggeration right usually if
*  i'm very excited the idea lasts for more than a few seconds you know my memory for these things
*  is not that good as anyone who listens to the amas over and over again will have gathered you know my
*  memory for my own intellectual development is terrible like my memory for many things is
*  terrible my memory for the plots of books and movies is terrible so i don't remember when it
*  was that i got certain opinions so usually if i have an idea and it doesn't pan out i forget about
*  it and move on to something else a famous counter example where i do remember is trying to modify
*  gravity to get rid of dark matter and dark energy i had this idea and i've talked about this before
*  so i won't dwell on it but i had this idea that both dark matter and dark energy come to be
*  important in regimes of the universe where the curvature of space time is small either because
*  you're far away from the center of a galaxy or because you're late in the history of the universe
*  where the matter and energy has diluted away so if you could modify the dynamics of einstein's
*  equation in a regime where the curvature was small rather than in the regime where the curvature is
*  large where everyone expects it to be modified then maybe you could help explain away both dark
*  matter and dark energy and i played around with that and it didn't work so i came up with a
*  modification it worked for making the universe accelerate and potentially explaining away the
*  dark energy did not work for explaining away the dark matter so i got very sad it was only when my
*  collaborators came to me and we realized independently that this idea of just explaining the acceleration
*  of the universe was intrinsically important if even if you couldn't also explain away the dark
*  matter that we wrote the paper and that became a very highly cited paper so that that's always nice
*  uh pete falconer says i've been revisiting roger penrose's the road to reality after a hiatus around
*  15 years and stumbled upon an intriguing comment regarding supersymmetry in the book penrose
*  suggests the one relation one reason to question theories of supersymmetry is that the expected
*  mass relationship between the higgs eno and the higgs boson he posits that according to suzy the
*  higgs eno should have a lower mass than the yet to be discovered at that time higgs boson which
*  prompts his question if the higgs eno is lighter why hasn't been it been detected already the actual
*  quote is from section 13.2 it seems to be postulated that of the two partners the one that has the
*  smaller spin by one half h bar is deemed to be the exceedingly more massive of the pair
*  look roger penrose is a genius mathematical physicist and he was a former mindscape guest
*  and he's contributed an enormous amount to our understanding of general relativity as well as
*  some pure mathy things very deserving winner of the nobel prize but he's he has weird ideas
*  about a whole bunch of things and this is an example and this is an example um and there's
*  other examples in that book that are sort of you know especially disappointing that his ideas are
*  so weird i mean he has weird ideas about consciousness and quantum mechanics but you can you can you can
*  excuse that because quantum mechanics and consciousness are both things we don't understand
*  that well supersymmetry we understand pretty well all he had to do was ask somebody when he says
*  it seems to be postulated that of the two partners the one that has the smaller spin is
*  exceedingly more massive that's just wrong that is not what is postulated you work out in the
*  model of some particular supersymmetric theory what are the masses of the partner of the ordinary
*  particles and their superpartners and what where he gets this impression from is the fact that in
*  the standard model we have spin zero particle um the higgs spin one half particles all the fermions
*  electrons quarks and so forth and spin one particles right the gauge bosons for both the spin one half
*  particles and the spin one particles we can find superpartners of lower spin by a half for the spin
*  zero particle the superpartners will have to have higher spin because you already at zero
*  so that's that's fine that's okay but the actual thing is that typically and even this is not
*  entirely true but typically when you break supersymmetry it's the superpartners that are
*  going to become more massive not the ones that have smaller spin he just could have asked somebody
*  this is a completely made up fake worry i don't i don't know why he didn't i mean he's at oxford
*  there's plenty of people who are experts on supersymmetry at oxford
*  sean connor says do you find it challenging to devote enough time to your personal relationships
*  and work simultaneously how do you manage to make enough time for your partner your professional
*  goals and hobbies slash overall leisure well it's a challenge it's not specifically a challenge to
*  balance personal life and work i'm actually pretty good at that i'm not you know i like my work so i
*  work a lot i work hard but i have no trouble carving out time for personal fun things i would
*  like to be more flexible in my personal fun things like my schedule is a little bit cramped so we
*  have to you know oh we'll have a date night a week and a half from now kind of thing it's hard to be
*  spontaneous we have a very good friend of ours who is a neighbor here in baltimore damon who's always
*  like texting us at 7 p.m and saying like you know come meet me for drinks and we're like ah
*  we're doing something or we're just too tired or whatever i wish i could be more spontaneous than
*  that but within the different categories you know there's always over subscription there's always
*  too many things i want to do and i'm not very good at balancing things so it's catch is catch can i'm
*  not very systematic about these things it's basically whichever thing is is pressing upon me
*  in the work side of thing of things more desperately than i'm going to actually devote
*  time to i don't have anything more systematic to offer than that sorry about that eric stromquist
*  says is decoherence really needed to isolate worlds under the everett interpretation i doubt everett
*  himself thought so since ze didn't discover decoherence until 1970 i should have in retrospect
*  joined this question to the one earlier about dynamical fluctuations in empty space
*  because i think that they are related so the answer is you're absolutely right that everett
*  did not rely on decoherence to isolate worlds in the everett interpretation but i do of course we
*  know about um decoherence because ze and others since 1970 have really explained it to us and to me
*  it helps i mean one of the clear things about decoherence is not only that it tells you that
*  worlds in the everett interpretation will remain separate from each other but it tells you which
*  worlds remain separate from each other by solving the pointer basis problem by explaining why the
*  states that we see in the classical limit look like ones that have sort of semi-classical behavior
*  where objects have definite locations in space etc this is work that was done by ze but also
*  zurek and many others over the years so to me decoherence plays a huge role in the everett
*  interpretation and indeed david wallace's book will teach you the same thing the reason why i
*  related to the question of what happens in empty space is in some sense that doesn't happen in
*  these decoherent histories in a static quantum field theory vacuum state i mean they do decohered
*  from each other in some technical sense but the pointer basis discussion is absent from that thing
*  and so i'm just talking out loud because this is stuff that i don't understand or or anyone else
*  does so my guess is that the ultimate answer to the question of what happens in empty space
*  is going to be that nothing happens in empty space because you don't have the kind of entropy producing
*  splitting branching process complete with conventional decoherence alize and zurek etc
*  that you're familiar with from pointer bases and their states in the real world
*  i would like to develop that suspicion into a more complete theory but haven't done that yet
*  ash right says since writing the big picture is there any topic from the book that you
*  substantially updated your thinking on i've grabbed a copy of my mom for mother's day
*  and wanted to let her know that there are want to let her know if there are any areas to take with
*  an extra grain of salt um you're the best son or ash i'm guessing your son or daughter you're the
*  best child that your mother's going to very much appreciate the gift that you're giving her for
*  mother's day the big picture there's nothing in the book that i would take back right now
*  like any book like anything i ever do there are parts of the book that i would try to improve on
*  i guess the two things that i would want to improve on but they're still consistent with
*  what i've said i would like to improve on the discussion of emergence because i understand
*  emergence better now than i did everything again everything i said in the book i think is true but
*  i can say it better more convincingly now but it's still nothing that i would take back and the other
*  is in the section where i talk about um meaningfulness and purpose in life again i agree still agree
*  with everything i say but i was trying too hard to say things that i think are sort of indisputably
*  true and therefore maybe i didn't go out on a limb as much as i should have about okay because i was
*  trying to say like purpose and meaning are not out there in the world you have to construct them
*  for yourself and i completely agree with that but okay what do you construct for yourself and i was
*  pretty um coy about that because i want to be a pluralist and let different people construct
*  different things but i think maybe the book would have been better had i been more um explicitly
*  suggesting here's something that you can do to help build purpose and meaning in your life i'm
*  not exactly sure what that would have been but if i were to produce a second edition i would i would
*  put more effort into doing that kyle stevens says my understanding of your my understanding was of
*  your statement that the universe is a vector in hillbritt space is that you are suggesting that
*  the universe is a purely mathematical structure you also seem to reject platonism and disagree
*  with max tegmark's proposal of the mathematical multiverse what then makes the existence of the
*  mathematical structure that gives rise to our universe more real than any other mathematical
*  structure so i think i must be doing something wrong here because um you're not the first person
*  kyle to say that they get that picture from me and it's not i'm not trying to say that the universe
*  is a purely mathematical structure i've never tried to say that i don't think that the universe
*  is the universe i think that the universe is a unique thing the the set of all reality is not
*  something you can say it is something else it's itself there's only one version of it there's only
*  one copy of it you can describe it you can say what properties it has and so when i say it's a
*  vector in hillbritt space what i mean is it follows the properties of a mathematical vector
*  in hillbritt space i can reconstruct or represent is the right word features of the universe in
*  terms of features of this mathematical object a vector in hillbritt space it but to me that's just
*  obvious and yet people don't seem to get that from what i'm saying so clearly it's my job to
*  be more explicit about this in my mind here is the analogy imagine that i draw a circle and i'm very
*  good at drawing circles i'm not very good at drawing circles in the real world but imagine that we're
*  very good i drew a circle on a piece of paper and i say here is a circle and you say oh you're saying
*  that is the platonic abstract idea of the set of all points of a fixed radius from a single origin
*  point in a two-dimensional space and i say no that's not what i meant of course this is just
*  a particular representation of a circle it is not the abstract mathematical idea i thought you got
*  the difference so i didn't explicitly spell it out okay that's what i'm saying about the universe as
*  a vector in hillbritt space i can represent it as a vector in hillbritt space but the universe is
*  the universe i don't know i don't not sure that means anything to say it is a mathematical structure
*  it's just the universe lucas cost says i've heard you say that science can't determine moral values
*  but do you think that we can in principle lean on scientific knowledge to help us develop well
*  justified moral beliefs if we accept that the goal is not absolute moral certainty but instead to
*  develop well justified beliefs about moral questions then can the science have something
*  meaningful to say on morality of course science can have something meaningful to say about morality
*  in the sense that if we have moral goals if we have a moral theory that says this action would
*  be more moral than that action it had better be comparable compatible with the real world right
*  so i mean let's imagine that you had some moral theory that prioritized happiness
*  we could absolutely do science to show that this makes people happy that doesn't make people happy
*  right what science can't do is help us come up with those goals in the first place the way to
*  think about it the poetic naturalist way to think about it is there is a world there is the physical
*  world of which we are a part science describes that science helps us explain the physical world
*  both at fundamental levels and immersion levels and the scientific explanation is sort of rigid
*  there's a correct one and there are many many incorrect ones morality is a set of judgments
*  it's saying that this hypothetical action would be labeled as bad that hypothetical action would
*  be labeled as good there's no way by just measuring what the world is to figure out what those labels
*  should be but of course we can use scientific knowledge to actually achieve what those moral
*  goals are i'm going to group two questions together because they're basically the same question
*  ken wolf says in new scientist i read an article describing a new variation on the many worlds
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics that they simply refer to as the many more worlds interpretation
*  there were a couple of quotes from you that suggested you were at least familiar with it
*  the part of their description that struck me was a more or less arbitrary division of the world into
*  subsystems some of which could lead to subsystems that behave in a classical way i find this
*  puzzling since you always seem to describe the ever interpretation as positing a division of
*  universe that behaves in an approximately classical way into two complete universes that diverge in
*  one way and are from that point invisible to each other i feel that this is some more fundamental
*  difference in this many many many more worlds interpretation that i am missing can you shed
*  any light on this and girolamo costaldo says what are your thoughts on the recent many more
*  worlds hypothesis so i i've heard questions about this before i got confused by this i was like i
*  was quoted in a new scientist article i don't know what this is about so i finally figured out what
*  it's about i haven't read the article i haven't seen the article even though i was quoted in it
*  and i did talk to the reporter about it but it it's about a paper that was written by andy albrecht
*  in some of his collaborations on what the same exact topic that ashmeet singh and i wrote a
*  paper on earlier and we called quantum mere ology it's not a new interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  it's not even a modification of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics it's just a
*  question within many worlds which is how do you take the wave function of the universe or the
*  quantum state of the universe and divide it up into subsystems that's it that's all that it's about
*  there's nothing more in the interpretation than that it's just many worlds it's a question about
*  many worlds the difference is in the paper that i wrote with ashmeet we proposed two criteria
*  for dividing the world up into subsystems what we're looking for is subsystems that will behave
*  more or less classically so you have a system that is going to behave more or less classically and
*  then you have the environment which is everything else so i am part of the system that you might
*  have here in this room all the photons that are hitting me right now are part of the environment
*  and i trace out all those photons to get classical looking behavior for myself
*  but something that is not clear if you're not a if you don't know quantum mechanics at the
*  mathematical level is that that division of what's going on in my room right now into like me table
*  photons etc is something that we choose it is not fixed by nature we could divide the world up in
*  many many different ways most of those ways would make no sense most of those ways would not give
*  you a well-defined fact of the matter about what each subsystem is doing indeed this was a point
*  that dan denet made in his paper about real patterns that's why david welles relied on that
*  paper when he wrote his paper his book about the emergent multiverse about the many worlds
*  interpretation anyway ashmeet and i suggested that when you have a classical subsystem and an
*  environment what that means is two things one is that the system if it is localized so if like you
*  have the earth and it has a weight there's a wave function for the earth but the earth remains pretty
*  localized around its center of mass coordinate right so if it's localized it remains it doesn't
*  spread out its wave function and then the other one is that it remains more or less unentangled
*  with the environment so if you have schrodinger's cat and so you have a cat that is in a super
*  position of two macroscopically distinguishable states that instantly becomes entangled with
*  the environment because the environment interacts with those two states differently whereas if the
*  cat is in just a single classical looking macroscopically coherent looking state photons are
*  absorbed or bounce off of it but they don't become entangled because entanglement means you're
*  interacting differently with different parts of the wave function so you have those two criteria
*  and we claimed that those two criteria localized states remain localized and unentangled states
*  remain unentangled are enough to uniquely pick out what is the right way to make a classical
*  subsystem what this new paper by albrecht and collaborators says is that there is not a unique
*  way to divide the world into subsystems but they also don't have two criteria they only have the
*  one they only have the fact that the initially unentangled states remain unentangled i think i
*  have not read the paper super duper carefully i think that's the difference they have less
*  stringent requirements on what they mean by a way to dividing the world up into subsystems
*  and therefore they don't get uniqueness that makes perfect sense then we can argue about whether or
*  not you should have those two criteria or not and that's a perfectly legit scientific question
*  but to help ken understand his question the what is going on here is taking a single world
*  and dividing it up into subsystems it's not literally about how many worlds there are
*  unless it's you know it's not that there are many more worlds at once let's put it that way
*  it's that if you don't believe there is a unique way of dividing the wave function up into subsystems
*  then you could have a single wave function with different ways of dividing it up into subsystems
*  and therefore different ways of dividing it up into worlds right so it's not that there's are
*  more worlds at any one time in any one division it's not that you're slicing the world more finely
*  it's that there are different ways of slicing the wave function of the universe up into worlds
*  like i said i don't really think that's true but that's what is supposed to be going on here it's
*  not in any sense a different interpretation of quantum mechanics it's still saying there's one
*  wave function that obeys the schrodinger equation and so you know i think that it's a i say positive
*  things about it because i want people to be asking this question i think this is a centrally important
*  question that ashmead and i wrote about and some other people wrote about who we cited but not very
*  many people have written about this question and so i'm happy to have other people talking about it
*  even if they reach different conclusions than we are that's how science works we're gonna all write
*  papers and talk about it and discuss it and hopefully the right answer will come out in the
*  process rob butler says i found the episode with matt strassler really interesting one thing that
*  was slightly glossed over at the very end of the episode was regarding the mass of protons and
*  neutrons he said that the higgs field is responsible for the mass of elementary particles but protons
*  and neutrons get their mass from somewhere else but didn't elaborate aren't protons and neutrons
*  made from quarks well no not exactly they're not really made of quarks this is something that you
*  could read matt's book to find more details about you could read my upcoming book to get more details
*  about or you can read my previous book particle at the end of the universe to get more details about
*  there's a short version and a longer version i'll give this short version and then hint at
*  the longer version the short version is that in the protons and neutrons there are quarks but
*  there are also gluons holding the quarks together unlike an atom where you have electrons and
*  nucleons held together by photons in the protons and neutrons those gluons in the protons and
*  neutrons those gluons matter the strong nuclear force is a huge contributor to the ultimate mass
*  of the protons and neutrons that's just different from atoms so therefore it turns out that the
*  actual mass of a proton and neutron is mostly gluons in some very real sense it's not the quarks and
*  it's not the quarks if you added up the masses of the up and down quarks and protons and neutrons
*  the number you would get is much smaller than the total mass of a proton or neutron the slightly
*  longer answer would be that really inside a proton or a neutron inside a nucleon in other words
*  is a regime where thinking about quantum fields as particles is not a good approximation anymore
*  so in my book i discuss in some detail about when you should think of quantum fields as
*  particles and when you shouldn't and what's really going on in the protons and neutrons are complicated
*  interacting combinations of the quantum fields representing the up quark the down quark and
*  the gluons and at the end of the day you're going to get a mass but that mass is not going to be
*  related in any simple way to the masses of the underlying particles that you would imagine
*  thinking about if you just had one field at a time raj says is it possible that the learning
*  of or about the universe that we humans do is actually just fulfilling some kind of evolutionary
*  need for building a framework of reality or are we actually transcending biological limitations
*  and reaching far beyond with our unique brains and invented math i don't know what that second one
*  means um certainly we're fulfilling some kind of evolutionary need for building a framework of
*  reality that's part of our survival here on earth i don't know what it means to be transcending our
*  biological limitations um yeah so so i don't think it's just anything i don't see what the word just
*  is doing in there we are we are physical creatures we are obeying the laws of physics and we are also
*  being the biological reality of natural selection we can explain what happens inside our bodies
*  because of that and through biological time we can see how greater and greater capacities to
*  understand the universe have been developed and they serve a very obvious biological purpose the
*  more we understand the world the better off we can survive in it and live in it and i think that
*  that sort of fits together very nicely adriana sasarman says does faith have a role in science
*  not necessarily in the religious context but the concept of believing in something without needing
*  proof um i mean almost entirely no is the short answer it depends on what you mean by the word
*  faith here i know that you tried to define it a little bit but there's still some fuzziness there
*  um scientists don't accept things on faith we hypothesize and then we test our hypotheses
*  and but we do have certain preconditions for imagining that science works right like if we
*  are living in a simulation or we are brains in a vat being taunted by an evil demon then the
*  conclusions that science reaches will not actually completely correctly represent the true external
*  reality okay so i think that science has some preconceptions and preconditions some assumptions
*  under which it works but it's not faith because any of those assumptions could be undermined if
*  we live in a simulation or our brains and vats it could be revealed that that is true or we could
*  even discover it scientifically we do need some very very weak assumptions about the intelligibility
*  of the universe the idea that the universe makes sense is just an assumption that science has to
*  make but again it's not faith because you know we would be willing to change our minds if good
*  reason came along uh to do so robert grinez says i have been a patreon subscriber since pretty much
*  the beginning i've learned so much burdened with religious education i grew up in a constant
*  state of existential terror how can we be here how could we not be here the more i have learned the
*  less afraid i became i've heard several times on the podcast people writing to express the same
*  fears and looking for solace at a planetarium years ago i was overwhelmed by the scale of
*  the universe and gripping the armrests in panic near the end the voice talked about a colony of
*  microbes that lived under the hood of a mushroom they lived only one earth day the elders would
*  tell the children that historians say at some point the light in the sky would go out nightfall
*  and they would perish the children were inconsolable until they were told that the
*  stories also assured them the light will someday return i felt it by the way that sounds like an
*  isaac azimov story called nightfall i felt at peace without a god in afterlife to lean on the
*  concept of the heat death of the universe is pretty bleak it doesn't seem right that the cycle of life
*  should simply peter out in your solo episode you talked about the notion of little big bangs
*  self-generating out the universe at maximum entropy i got a similar good feeling from that
*  perhaps if another listener comes to you for consolation from these fears you could tell them
*  about this possibility it could make a difference yeah it could make a difference but i wouldn't
*  want to rely on that you know the idea that the universe regenerates sometime in the future that
*  there are future big bangs and multiple universes or similar related ideas that the universe is
*  bouncing and cyclic and lasts forever in that way these are as we were just talking about
*  scientific hypotheses they may or may not be true i would not want my feelings about the worthiness
*  of the life i am living to rely on the possible truth or falsity of those scientific conjectures
*  we don't know whether they're true or not they might be false and i think that the meaningfulness
*  of life is actually contained in the actual span of the life we live these theories that we're
*  talking about are talking about things that will happen billions and billions and billions of
*  trillions of trillions of quadrillions of google years in the future they have no real connection
*  to my life here on earth so i don't even though maybe it is true that explaining those scenarios
*  could help some people you know deal with and accept the reality of the natural world
*  part of me wants to say they shouldn't i think that's the sort of a false consciousness that's
*  not really the reason why you should find meaningfulness in the world it should be about
*  the life you're living here finite as it is that's why in the big picture i have a chapter that
*  emphasizes that the average human lifespan is about three billion heartbeats i don't want people to
*  look away from the finitude of our lives i want to face up to it and accept it and use that to
*  construct something truly meaningful during the three billion heartbeats that we have here
*  jeff b says what are the statements about which you have a credence of absolutely zero percent
*  or 100 well you know very few effectively i want to say none but i think that it turns exactly
*  on what you mean okay you did put the word absolutely in there which which makes a difference
*  and makes me say none because if you have credence of zero percent or 100 in anything then you're
*  making it impossible to change your mind right you're not allowed to change your mind as a good
*  baysian no new evidence could possibly change your mind about anything so i don't want to have zero
*  percent or 100 credence about anything but in the real world my credences about some things are so
*  enormously small or enormously large that for all intents and purposes i'm not worried about changing
*  my mind about it i don't dwell on the possibility so i don't have a list of those statements but
*  you know they're they're pretty obvious ones i think cubit says i understand that a dice roll
*  is a classical phenomenon and we therefore do not expect an equal branching into six worlds
*  the apparent randomness is just based on our incomplete information about the initial state
*  and the chaotic time evolution which amplifies is amplifies changes in this state however one
*  could argue that even the quantum mechanical uncertainty in the initial state will be amplified
*  by this mechanism thereby leading indeed to six branches with roughly equal weight is there a
*  simple counter argument this is something i don't know a lot about but i will mention that andy
*  albrecht who we just mentioned in the many in many more worlds interpretation context has written
*  about this andy wants to claim that in the real world when we do flip coins or roll dice or do or
*  shuffle a deck of cards or do other things that we think about are truly random looking like if you
*  shuffle a deck of cards badly or if you flip a coin in such a way that you are a practiced
*  magician who can always get the same outcome of the coin flip then okay that's different
*  but if you do things in ways that most people would recognize as effectively random and he wants to
*  argue that it is always quantum mechanics that is at the basis of that randomness in other words
*  that there truly are worlds of roughly equal magnitude where all the outcomes come to be and
*  the argument is based on very very small quantum uncertainties growing through essentially chaotic
*  dynamics just from the signals passing through the neurons in your brain to your fingers that are
*  rolling the die or flipping the coin or whatever i have done zero work to think about work on or
*  understand this claim so i can't tell you whether it is true or not but i think it's a perfectly open
*  possibility that is worth looking into if you care about this kind of thing that's all i will say
*  mark foskey says if you don't accept ethical realism what stands do you take towards others
*  who violate ethical principles that you personally hold when you get indignant when one person hurts
*  another do you regard that as an irrational emotional response and try instead just to be
*  sad rather than angry because no objective moral code is being violated no i do not do that i get
*  angry and i think it is perfectly rational for me to get angry because that's the nature of having
*  a moral code whether that moral code is objective or not the the word objective is playing no role
*  in that sentence if i have a moral code then i believe that certain things are right and certain
*  things are wrong not objectively i didn't say objective i said i believe right it is a it is a
*  systematization and a turning into a rational codification of my moral intuitions and then i
*  believe that other people should obey those moral intuitions that's what i think okay now other
*  people will have incompatible moral intuitions and the point of being an anti-realist is that
*  the two of us have irreconcilable differences we can talk to each other we can try to persuade
*  each other and often that works in the real world but there is not either an empirical experiment
*  or an airtight logical argument that we can give that forces one person to change their mind
*  okay but nevertheless that doesn't stop us from having our opinions our feelings about these
*  things so people who are moral realists you know think that unless something is objective it doesn't
*  exist but that's just not true that's not true logically metaphysically or etc
*  again i talk about this in great length that the in the big picture you can read about the idea of
*  moral constructivism which is different than moral relativism in exactly this way
*  paul hess says matter can change state at different temperatures and pressures in the
*  dense early universe could dark matter have been in a different state and maybe interacted in a
*  more significant way that left a footprint well i'm not sure what footprint you're thinking about
*  but yes dark matter could absolutely be in a different state i mean it almost certainly was
*  in a different state dark matter well i shouldn't say almost certainly we don't know enough about
*  what the right theory of dark matter was but let's say that you have the conventional weakly
*  interacting massive particle dark matter in the very early universe that dark matter was interacting
*  with each other moving relativistically etc at some point it freezes out as we say it stops
*  interacting and it becomes non-relativistic and usually it becomes non-relativistic first
*  freezes out later if it's a cold dark matter candidate but the point is yes dark matter
*  undergoes changes of phase as time goes on what we seem to be told by the data is that there's no
*  that there's kind of a robust vanilla feature of the dark matter where at the end of the day
*  it is a a cold non-interacting particle that is distributed in a certain way called you know
*  adiabatic gaussian initial conditions and there's not much more to say beyond that if dark matter
*  had interesting interactions either early on or later on we might be able to see that but we
*  haven't seen any evidence for it as yet voltaire oh asks a priority question i have delved deep
*  into the big questions through science and philosophy and have still not found an answer
*  to why something not nothing it is so weird that i we or anything exists all the scientific and
*  philosophical answers still leave me unsatisfied boltzmann brains etc how do you feel about
*  existence i did write a paper about this you can google why is there something rather than nothing
*  sean carroll and you can read my paper about it the short version is i don't think there's an answer
*  to why there is something rather than nothing i think you have to think carefully about what you
*  are asking for when you ask a why question there's no logical reason why every why question has to
*  have an answer in other words why there has to be a reason why every fact of the universe is the way
*  it is the argument for that is just that i could easily imagine a different kind of universe in
*  which different things happened right and so there are going to be some features of the universe that
*  are contingent that are just brute facts and i think that the existence of the universe itself
*  is exactly that kind of thing it is true but it's not something where we're going to find an answer
*  here's why it's true and you just have to learn to live with that just like the finitude of the
*  universe there are things or the existence of many many worlds or whatever right the universe
*  isn't there to make us happy and the universe certainly isn't there to conform to our intuitions
*  developed over biological time or the decades we have here on earth you got to learn to stretch
*  your intuitions and to live with what the universe actually is telling you anonymous asks a priority
*  question in a youtube video entitled the nature of reality alan wallace suggests that consciousness
*  exists beyond mind and is somewhat unexplainable you object so this is a dialogue i had with alan
*  wallace that he's referring to uh you object saying no one can explain the mechanism by which this
*  unexplainable phenomena of consciousness interacts with the human mind please comment on the following
*  attempt to bridge these two views and the anonymous writes a lot of paragraphs even if it's a priority
*  question i gotta mention you still have to obey the rules of the ama one of the rules is keep it
*  short so i'm going to try to edit it down to a short version in another lecture you present the
*  core theory one of the terms included addresses all known frequencies of electromagnetic forces
*  there are several research papers which report success in measuring chi energy and placing it
*  in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum my hypothesis is that what wallace
*  refers to as an unexplainable consciousness is in fact a measurable electromagnetic force
*  i mean maybe i'm highly doubtful for several reasons um number one i guess yeah for for one
*  basic reason i'm perfectly happy with imagining that there are electromagnetic forces that
*  influence us because that is obviously manifestly true no one argues with that there certainly are
*  electromagnetic forces they certainly do influence us i think that when people talk about a consciousness
*  that exists beyond mind or when people talk about chi energy etc they have something in mind that
*  is different than electromagnetic forces they do not have equations of motion for their consciousness
*  or their chi field or whatever they would feel cheapened if you said oh yes here's my equation
*  for how this field works whereas i have equations for the evolution of the electromagnetic forces
*  it's right there in the core theory it's purely physics it's purely mechanistic um there's nothing
*  spooky about it we actually understand the electromagnetic field super duper well
*  so i'm perfectly happy with attaching different labels to electromagnetic forces i suspect that
*  these other people who want consciousness to be other than physical would not be happy with that
*  identification callen says i recently watched your appearance on lex friedman's podcasts
*  lex friedman's podcast sorry it's getting late folks um in it you said you wish people asked
*  you more questions regarding relationships although i think you were saying it somewhat jokingly
*  i thought i'd ask you i was saying it jokingly but with a serious joking intent like i don't
*  care whether people don't i'm not really insulted that was the joke but i'm very happy if people
*  want to do it and i may or may not pick your questions that's what i meant anyway callen
*  continues i've been with my girlfriend for almost six years now and sometimes it can be a struggle
*  to keep things fresh we have a three-year-old daughter so that can definitely make it a
*  challenge to make time especially with work and studies how do you and your lovely wife jennifer
*  keep things fresh and keep the spark alive so to speak i know some people think that if you love
*  someone that you're in a relationship it's like some disney story with no rough patches but i
*  don't think it works that way so what's your advice generally on having a good relationship
*  with your significant other yeah so this is another case even though i i requested or solicited
*  romantic advice questions the real answer is always that everybody is different and you have
*  to find your road you have to figure out the way to make it work for you so therefore i can't tell
*  you what to do i can offer a few hints as to how it works for us one is that we're just super lucky
*  jennifer and i to be as compatible as we are and we don't have many rough patches to speak of so
*  there's not a lot of work to be done in getting over them but that's not very helpful advice
*  i can think of two slightly more tangible pieces of advice first in terms of keeping your relationship
*  fresh and your relationship interesting i think the primary thing is to keep your life interesting
*  if you two individuals lead interesting lives then it will naturally happen that your relationship
*  becomes interesting i mean you want to spend time together but you also want to lead separate lives
*  you want to have separate interests that you can then talk about when you come together right you
*  don't want to watch all the same movies and tv shows or read all the same books or meet all the
*  same people you want to be a little bit independent so that you can come and share something that the
*  other one has not known about right you want to do interesting things again it has nothing to do
*  with the fact that you're in a relationship you just want to live a life that includes all sorts
*  of different things happening so that you look forward to new things happening with anticipation
*  and if you're in a successful relationship you will anticipate sharing that either the recollection
*  of it afterward or the experience of it in the moment with your partner in a very natural way so
*  keeping your life interesting is the simplest route to keeping your relationship fresh
*  the other one is you know in terms of rough patches and so forth
*  i'm not exactly sure how to put this exactly right because it seems kind of obvious to me but maybe
*  it's not what actual people always do which is you have to orient yourself either naturally or
*  by training yourself to get pleasure out of making the other person happy right it's never going to
*  be the case that the things that make you happy are exactly the same as the thing that makes your
*  partner happy you're different human beings that's perfectly natural some of them you will want to be
*  able to do and your partner will just let you do them okay others you're going to want to have
*  to share that experience as we said but in terms of what brings you happiness some part of that
*  has to be doing nice things or otherwise making your partner happy you can't be completely selfish
*  in other words to put it more basically you your relationship success can't be about well they're
*  not paying enough attention to me they're not making me happy enough unless you're doing
*  everything to make them happy if you actually take pleasure if you actually find fulfillment
*  in making your partner happy then the relationship is going to be good you know doing nice things for
*  them listening to them understanding what it is that they think would actually make them happy
*  rather than telling them what should make them happy you know all those sorts of things
*  i'm not sure if it's very useful advice because to me it's just sort of being a good person
*  is is the way to do it so keep your relationship fresh by having an interesting life keep your
*  relationship happy by being a good person that's as blase as my advice gets this is why i'm not
*  a good relationship columnist sorry connor caustic says it's easy to arrive at the concept of infinity
*  but is there anything we've observed in nature that is definitely infinite infinitely small would
*  count eg a singularity no absolutely not the reason why infinity comes up in physics is because
*  we extrapolate right think about the integers no one has ever seen all the integers zero one two
*  three four five minus one minus two minus three etc the reason why we say the set of integers is
*  infinite is because we write down an integer or some finite number of them plus a rule for
*  generating more and we say and the rule never stops right so we have a generative procedure
*  for constructing this infinity but that doesn't mean we've seen it or experienced it and that's
*  even just the integers much less the continuum of real numbers etc so in physics we find that our
*  mathematical models that best fit the world often take advantage of this idea of a smooth continuum
*  of numbers or an infinite number of integers or whatever but you don't again you don't see it
*  because you're extending your your theory covers a whole bunch of cases that you haven't personally
*  experienced it is absolutely possible that there is no infinity in nature i recently wrote a paper
*  suggesting exactly that but it's it doesn't quite work doesn't quite exactly work it almost works
*  but there's a slight problems there on the other hand maybe it does i think it is more likely than
*  not that infinity does exist in nature but we human beings are finite so i don't even know what
*  it would mean to literally observe an infinity that is to observe anything where we can be
*  absolutely definitive about saying that this quantity that we're observing is infinite rather
*  than just really big i'm not sure if human beings have the capacity to draw the distinction in a
*  reliable way physics kitten says as you pointed out in your crisis in physics podcast the
*  cosmological constant is 120 orders of magnitude lower than we think it should be by computing the
*  zero point energy of empty space doesn't this cause you to increase your credence that we are
*  living in a simulation i mean maybe but an infinitesimal amount it does not have a very big
*  effect look there's plenty of puzzles in physics at any one moment in the history of physics there
*  were plenty of puzzles we didn't know the answer to if at every moment you said well i guess that's
*  probably evidence we live in a simulation you would have been wrong almost all the time right
*  now there are features of the universe that we don't have good explanations for like the value
*  of the vacuum energy to instantly leap saying ah therefore it's evidence we live in a simulation
*  i think that's just not a very good way to make progress i can think of plenty of plausible well
*  at least conceivable physical mechanisms that would explain the small cosmological constant
*  without relying on living in a simulation furthermore i don't know why a simulator would
*  want to make the cosmological constant that small so in terms of the likelihood functions
*  maybe there's a small boost to the likelihood that we live in a simulation coming from the
*  cosmological constant being small but it's not a very appreciable one it doesn't change my
*  credences that strongly lack mirror says as a software developer i'd be fascinated to
*  learn about the software that applies to your day-to-day physics work for example what programs
*  do you find helpful what are you trying to do when you use them and how do they help you do that
*  you know as i've said i am mostly a pencil and paper theorist so the single you know the two
*  most important pieces of software i have well all right what are the most important pieces of
*  software i have and i'm going to put aside the podcast okay because you said day-to-day physics
*  work gmail chrome
*  lottech actually i need to use microsoft word a lot because i i don't just write physics papers
*  right so for anything in the real world you still need to use microsoft word although i use scrivener
*  if i'm writing a book length project but lottech is certainly my preferred way of writing anything
*  with equations in it the biggest ideas in the universe had to be written in microsoft word
*  that's the only thing that the publishers would accept and it has been a terrible terrible
*  experience to try to get those equations right in microsoft word i have to tell you
*  and i draw things in affinity designer that's a you know a illustration program so i draw figures
*  and things like that and i use mathematica to write to do simple numerical calculations plus
*  occasionally i'm forced to do some python coding very simple python coding and i do use
*  um either chat gpt or github copilot to help have ai proposed little ways of writing subroutines
*  it only works if you're writing something that other people have written already right so it's
*  basically an elaborate way of copying other people's code as far as i can tell but again
*  mostly my actual work is done at the blackboard or in my ipad notability is super important for
*  me on my ipad i have notability which is a way of both writing uh with the apple pencil writing
*  documents marking up pdfs signing documents things like that so i think at the end of the day the
*  answer is my software use is highly non-sophisticated and nothing that should impress anybody else
*  by the way i will mention that i'm an old school programmer when i grew up it was for tran and
*  basic that i was programming in i mean i took classes and learned to program in assembly
*  language and a little bit of c plus i think i've forgotten all of that by now uh probably i could
*  remember a little bit of for tran and basic but obviously it's been a very very long time since
*  i've done that i could have you know again if i had been i've always been very bad at thinking
*  carefully about what to do in the future given what i was doing in the present like i did a lot
*  of programming as an undergraduate and then very little as a graduate student but some and then
*  almost none ever since then but i easily could have been on the forefront of programming because
*  we know my undergraduate days were in the early 80s when it was not overwhelmed with people doing
*  it but i'm perfectly happy having chosen to do more pencil and paper kinds of things
*  nomad 666 says can you please explain compatibilist free will and what does free will really mean
*  is it having ultimate control over our internal and external actions and do we or can we even have
*  control over our internal and external actions all the time so this is what i mentioned earlier
*  when we were talking about consciousness as an emergent phenomenon i think that that's what
*  compatibilist free will is i've said it many many times i will say it again compatibilist free will
*  to me simply means that the best description of human beings at the level of human beings
*  includes the idea that human beings make choices through deliberation over different possibilities
*  that's what it means i keep saying that people don't seem to get it the people who don't believe
*  in compatibilist free will i've never met one who could tell me what compatible is free will
*  means they have some weird version of it that exists in their brains i'm sure they're out there
*  i'm sure there are people i'm just saying that i've never had that experience myself i don't want
*  to go into that again but the reason why i wanted to answer this question is because the different
*  there are different reasons why people struggle with this concept and i think that
*  it does actually require thinking philosophically carefully about things so in nomad's question
*  he says he or she says is it having ultimate control over our internal and external actions
*  and do we or can we even have control over internal and external actions all the time
*  okay so what do you mean by we that's the philosophy question here right you're by
*  using that word you're presuming that there is some concept that maps on to the word you or i
*  or we or whatever right that there is some person that there is some in nature some object that is
*  usefully described as being this particular person okay so you're gonna have to be careful
*  if you want to ask these questions if you want to relate that person to their internal and external
*  actions i'm not even sure what internal actions means like it doesn't mean i can control my
*  heartbeat or anything like that so i'm not sure what that means my external actions yes you know
*  at the level of talking about the world in terms of human beings and tables and chairs i say look
*  this person made this action because they chose to do it and and i don't get people who somehow
*  pretend not to understand what that sentence means you know sam harris when i was on his podcast
*  you know literally said like have you ever made a choice yeah i made all sorts of choices like
*  what does that mean you have to be redefining what it means to be a person and making choices
*  you have to be forgetting that that is a way of talking about human beings and pretending that
*  what i'm really saying is have you sort of superseded the laws of physics in the motion
*  of the atoms in your body no i have not superseded the laws of physics in any way but i i'm not talking
*  about atoms in my body i'm talking about me as a person me as a person makes choices that's the way
*  the compatibilists talk i shouldn't say that that's the way everyone talks compatibilists just admit
*  it and says it's okay to talk that way mark says did you meet and know cormac mccarthy at the san
*  fe institute as exhilarating as high level cross-pollination can be is there a real potential
*  downside in being distracted away from your particular discipline a drift towards cocktail
*  party intellectualism i didn't actually ever meet cormac mccarthy at sfi we didn't we didn't happen
*  to overlap just by chance plenty of people who i knew who visited there did interact with him
*  quite a bit i'm all in favor of this interdisciplinary cross-pollination i think it's
*  called having an interesting intellectual life you know i'm not sure why we would be worried that
*  we're being distracted away from more serious things the question you know there's always a
*  question of what have you produced if your job is being an intellectual being a creator being an
*  academic being a scholar however you want to put it you know it's nice to imagine sitting in your
*  reading room in your smoking jacket reading some books and contemplating great ideas but that's
*  fun that's not what you're paid to do what you're paid to do is produce okay so i'm all in favor of
*  judging people on the base of what they produce what papers have you written what books have you
*  written what contributions have you made etc that's fine but how they get there is up to them i think
*  i think that some ways of making huge intellectual progress involve being very focused and narrow
*  minded just thinking about this particular problem to the exclusion of all other problems
*  hitting away at that problem for years and years and years i mean arguably i don't know the details
*  but arguably someone someone like andrew wiles solving fermat's last theorem proving fermat's
*  last theorem is just a matter of taking one problem and beating away at it for a very very long time
*  but there are other people who get great insights from absolutely interdisciplinary cross-pollination
*  jeffrey west former mindscape guest taking ideas from biology and physics and network theory and
*  putting them together to come up with a new explanation for alimetric scaling laws there you
*  go so i don't care how you get there i care about where you go and many different people will get
*  there different ways and have fun doing it in different ways so therefore i am all in favor of
*  it i see no downsides gregory kusnik says have your wine buying habits changed since leaving
*  california yes for the worse actually that's not quite true it's been more difficult you know
*  california you can just get all the wine you want it's very easy we were huge fans of knl wines if
*  you live in la or maybe they i think they also have a san francisco outpost knl is great they
*  have an elaborate website with many different wines and they actually taste the wines and tell
*  you about them which is very helpful when you're buying them and then they will deliver them to
*  your house like you just buy them online and deliver the wines that's the way life should be
*  maryland is much more uptight about that kind of thing so fortunately there is a total wine
*  store not too far away nothing in baltimore is very far away from anything else that's very much
*  unlike la you can actually travel anywhere in baltimore very easily so we often go to total
*  wine and they have a huge wonderful selection including of the kinds of wines that we really
*  like the owner of total wine is now running for senate in maryland i don't think that i'll be
*  voting for him he seems like a decent enough fellow but i kind of like his opponent in the
*  primary a little bit more but i haven't actually i haven't yet taken the time to look into that
*  carefully there it's one of those things where their policy proposals seem to be more or less
*  exactly the same so it's a matter of you know who do you trust or so forth so it's a little
*  bit harder to judge and there's some other online places that you can order wine but i think there
*  is one place i order wine from online they do deliver it i think it's illegal that they deliver
*  it i think you're not allowed to just ship a case of wine to someone in maryland and therefore most
*  places won't do it but some places will just do it and i never actually got in trouble by it so
*  i do it anyway you know just so people know like our wine buying habits such as they are are not
*  that sophisticated we we go through a lot of wine it's almost always in the 2030 maybe 40 bottle
*  range we're not drinking 300 bottles of wine on the regular much as i would like to that and first
*  class plane tickets would be the my major uh living habits if i suddenly became super duper wealthy
*  like my house and my job i love and i wouldn't even change even the cars i'm driving i'm perfectly
*  happy with i would buy nicer wine i would get nicer plane tickets i would get i guess after
*  talking to derrick guy on the podcast maybe i'd start wearing bespoke suits if i became very wealthy
*  also um okay timothy pageant asks a priority question a well-known physicist in a recent
*  interview said quantum mechanics is a deterministic theory absolutely physics is deterministic
*  schrodinger's equation defines exactly the underlying physical quantity of the wave function
*  with exact precision the measurements may be probabilistic but it is defined with 100
*  accuracy i mean completely so my question is he entirely correct to claim the universe is
*  fundamentally deterministic is it not true to view the universe is somehow fundamentally
*  probabilistic in some meaningful sense look these are one this is one of the questions that depends
*  on your perspective on the foundations of quantum mechanics in many worlds there's a very clear
*  answer to this question but it's come it comes in two parts the first part is the wave function of
*  the universe evolves perfectly deterministically it just obeys the schrodinger equation which is
*  reversible deterministic information conserving etc but our observational measurements are not
*  predictable so that's why i'm confused by this quote where your physicist says the schrodinger
*  equation defines underlying physical and with exact precision the measurements may be probabilistic
*  but it is defined with 100 accuracy so yeah but measurement outcomes matter that's what we actually
*  observe in the universe so in many worlds the wave function is defined precisely but the experience
*  of any one person is not deterministic so therefore from the perspective of an individual the world
*  is not deterministic in many worlds in something like the pilot wave theories bohmian mechanics
*  theories it is a very similar situation actually the underlying dynamics are perfectly deterministic
*  but because the hidden variables are hidden the best predictions we can make about the universe
*  are probabilistic it's a little subtle in that case because from the god's eye view you might say
*  well then i could know what the hidden variables are and then you could literally predict what the
*  future measurement outcomes would be that's not true in many worlds but also you don't have the
*  god's eye view and you never will so therefore the the actual in practice distinctions are very minimal
*  is it true yeah of course but then the final thing is maybe neither one of these is right you know
*  maybe there's other options in quantum mechanics where things are fundamentally
*  indeterministic and so forth so i think i don't i we don't know whether or not the ultimate laws
*  of physics are deterministic or probabilistic because we don't know what the ultimate laws
*  of physics are we do know that the experiences of human beings looking at the universe are not
*  deterministic they are not predictable on the basis of the laws of physics as we understand them
*  there you go philip grant says if you had to recommend someone inside or outside physics
*  whose views you consistently disagree with but are consistently worth listening to who would you
*  choose you know i think there's lots of people uh it depends what you mean by consistently disagree
*  with like obviously i think you it's okay to want people to have some underlying shared values for
*  someone who you want to talk with all the time um you know you want to be engaged in a good faith
*  seeking of the truth even though your individual tentative conclusions about what the truth is
*  might be very different than somebody else's yeah i i don't have any interest in talking with people
*  who disagree with me because they are bad faith grifters or con men okay that's that's not really
*  my goal um but i have people on the podcast who i disagree with about important things
*  david chalmers was on the podcast completely disagree with him about consciousness which is
*  what we talked about um i mean david and dan denet had uh huge disagreements and they were
*  also great friends and david was really uh broken up when when dan died for example tim maudlin and
*  i disagree about everything about physics but we have a very useful conversations i'm always happy
*  to talk to tim he's a super smart guy um i had a good time talking to neil ferguson on the podcast
*  about more political things even though we disagree about those um there are religious people i went
*  to a catholic university and talked to you know all bunch of religious people who i disagree with
*  deeply about things so you know um there's lots of people out there i think it's more about
*  sincerity intelligence um open-mindedness you know the you know they might think something but
*  they want to think it for reasons that they're willing to change their minds about if they have
*  good reasons to do so that's what i look for in someone to talk to johnny says what is the work
*  you're most proud or happy about could be a book or paper even just teaching someone um
*  that's always hard you know i i have different i there's nothing i've ever done that i'm perfectly
*  happy with let's put it that way there's very few things i've ever done that i'm perfectly unhappy
*  with also um you know in terms of books i think the big picture is my favorite book uh you know
*  that was the one that i sort of always wanted to write and i think i did a pretty good job writing
*  it for the most part it's one of those books when i pick it up and i leaf through it for some reason
*  i'm like yeah okay i did a pretty good job there in terms of scientific papers you know ironically
*  the paper i wrote with jennifer chen on uh the arrow of time and time symmetric universe
*  number one we never got it published not because we couldn't get it published we easily could have
*  gotten it published but the timing was bad i left the university of chicago she graduated and so
*  forth and we just never submitted the revised version to the journal and like i didn't we didn't
*  care that much so that never happened and also i disagree you know i think that i would have
*  improved there's certain parts of the paper where the calculations could be done better than they
*  were the underlying spirit of the paper though i think is both um an interesting new idea and
*  could even be right about this large scale structure of the universe right it's not often
*  that you have an original idea about the structure of the universe that has a chance of being right
*  i don't know what that chance is but it's still to me the most fair and compelling version of a
*  cosmological theory that tries to account for the arrow of time so i like it for that reason
*  there's other things i like for for different reasons you know i wrote a paper with alan
*  goof and eddie farhi and ken olem on time machines closed time light curves and two plus one dimensional
*  gravity where i did something that was very mathematically clever right and that always
*  feels good but no one cared about that paper so it's not like a major contribution to science or
*  anything but you know i did something good that that always is nice to have a feeling about
*  marco touser says i sometimes have the impression that public intellectuals and science communicators
*  overestimate the breadth of their reach how much you know about the demographics of your audience
*  what fraction of degrees in physics phd's etc i'm not sure why where you get the impression
*  that public intellectuals and science communicators overestimate the breadth of their reach because i
*  no idea what the breadth is estimated to be much less what it is you know i don't know like
*  literally right now as i'm talking i'm alone in a room talking to a machine talking to a
*  microphone that is recording in the on the computer i can't see what the results are right you know
*  when i put the podcast out there i get i don't know dozens of responses on you know patreon and
*  on the website and on youtube and whatever i know that the typical numbers for the people who listen
*  to an episode of the podcast are of order 100 000 people about 50 50 in the u.s and elsewhere
*  don't have any real information about their education level their ages their genders or
*  anything like that for books i have approximately you know the number of books i've sold and it's
*  i you know my my best-selling book has sold more copies than a typical podcast episode but my
*  worst-selling books have sold less so that's the rough order of magnitude there it's not very big
*  you know 100 000 people is not very big in the history of the world but of course if 100 000
*  people listen to each episode it's not the same 100 000 people uh likewise for the reading of the
*  books for the watching of the youtube lectures i think my most i don't know what my most watched
*  youtube lecture is but it's well over a million views right so that's that's getting to be serious
*  numbers when it's well over a million views it was a million people who watched me on the colbert
*  report although it was only just telling jokes for five minutes right um but i you know the
*  general relativity episode of the biggest ideas in the universe is um an hour and a half of me
*  doing tensor calculus and it has over 800 000 views last i checked which was a while ago which
*  which warms my heart it really does still i don't think that's in any way a huge reach compared to
*  the number of people in the united states much less the people number of people in the world
*  so no i don't think that the reach is very big in any um objective sense compared to actual
*  celebrities or well-known people etc so that's okay i'm you know i'm not if if 100 000 people
*  listen to this ask me anything episode of mindscape my my you know response to that fact is not
*  oh my god why don't i reach 10 million people this is terrible my response is oh my god i'm
*  reaching 100 000 people that is awesome it's a lot more than i reach you know when i teach a class or
*  anything like that so that's why i consistently say over and over again i'm hugely grateful
*  and and warmly appreciative of everyone who listens to mindscape last question of this ama
*  is from joshua rubin who says what is your favorite poem so i'm actually going to give you a
*  uh little bonus for sitting through this whole ama which is i'm going to read two poems to you
*  how about that um because i don't have a really favorite poem i i'm not a super poetry guy like
*  i'm not a big expert um but i like it you know when i'm reading good my relationship to poetry
*  is exactly my the same as the relationship that i have to classical music i like it when i hear
*  good stuff but i'm by no means a connoisseur or an aficionado um so i'll read what used to be my
*  favorite poem when i was younger um it's by william butler yates it's a famous one they're both
*  famous ones these are not like plucked from obscurity or anything like that so this is when
*  you are old which you may have heard of and he says pardon you know the these are medium-length
*  poems so um you don't need to listen you can turn it off that's fine when you are old and gray and
*  full of sleep and nodding by the fire take down this book and slowly read and dream of the soft
*  look your eyes had once and of their shadows deep how many loved your moments of glad grace and loved
*  your beauty with love false or true but one man loved the pilgrim's soul in you and loved the sorrows
*  of your changing face and bending down beside the glowing bars murmur a little sadly how love fled
*  and paced upon the mountains or ahead and hid his face amid a crowd of stars so that's yeah maybe
*  a shortish mediumish poem but very beautifully written yates was a genius uh this is you know
*  the tiny bit of pride i have in my quasi irish heritage goes back to their literary prowess
*  yates is pretty good at manipulating words um and it's beautiful and it's a love poem in some sense
*  and i i appreciated it for a long time before because i'm not very good at reading poetry like
*  this is not my expertise it took a long time for me to figure out how really deplorable was the
*  sentiment being expressed here of course yates is expressing love okay in very beautiful moving
*  powerful language but basically at the end what is being revealed is he's revealing he's talking
*  about the love he had for someone else who didn't love him back uh or at least who maybe loved him
*  for a while and then stopped loving him and then basically what he's saying is you blew it he's
*  saying you're going to regret not loving me back that's not a very good um sentiment to really
*  place a whole poet poem on like he's still yates is still a little peeved that this person didn't
*  love him back as much as he thought he deserved it's a little selfish i think so i moved on from
*  that poem and i went back in time here's another one which i read in college and but this is it
*  had the opposite effect i read it and i thought it was kind of fun but didn't love it and then the
*  more i thought about it the more i loved it and this is a classic by john dunn one of the
*  metaphysical poets called the sun rising it's a little longer so put up with me busy old fool
*  unruly son why dost thou thus through windows and through curtains call on us must to thy motions
*  lovers seasons run saucy pedantic wretch go chide late school boys and sour apprentices
*  go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride call country ants to harvest offices love all
*  alike no season knows nor climb nor hours days month which are the rags of time thy beams so
*  reverend and strong why shouldst thou think i could eclipse and cloud them with a wink
*  but that i would not lose her sight so long if her eyes have not blinded thine look and tomorrow
*  late tell me whether both the indias of spice and mine be thou where there let be where thou
*  left them or lie here with me ask for those kings whom thou sawedst yesterday and thou
*  shalt hear all here in one bed lay she's all states and all princes i nothing else is princes
*  do but play us compared to this all honors mimic all wealth alchemy thou son art half as happy as
*  we in that the world's contracted thus thine age asks ease and since thy duties be to warm the world
*  that's done in warming us shine here to us and thou art everywhere this bed thy center is
*  these walls thy sphere so if you get the spirit of it he's talking to the son and he's saying that
*  you know he's he's in love and he's he's sort of blissfully in love and honestly and truly in love
*  so much so that he's exaggerating the idea that when you're in love all that really exists is you
*  and the person you love so he's saying basically look son i can turn you off just by blinking my
*  eyes by closing my eyelids and you disappear you're not that big a deal in fact your only point is to
*  keep me and my lover here warm right now that that's all that matters and he does it in very
*  you know lovely language also and so in my more mature phase of life as i am now in someone in a
*  in a good and happy relationship this is what is a good love poem to me the the sort of teasing
*  way in which you can sort of metaphorically express that all that matters is you and the person you're
*  in love with and we know that you can't maintain that 24 7 that's okay but in the moment that's how
*  you're feeling can't think of a better way to end the ama than that thanks for listening
*  huge thanks to all the patreon supporters who support mindscape see you next week
*  you
*  you
