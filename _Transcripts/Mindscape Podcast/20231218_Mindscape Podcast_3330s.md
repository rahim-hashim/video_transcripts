The final Mindscape podcast of each year is devoted to a short, reflective Holiday Message. This year the theme is Immortality: whether it's an attractive idea, and whether the laws of physics and cosmology would allow for it in principle. (Spoiler: they do not.) Mindscape will return as usual on January 1, 2024. Happy holidays everyone!

# Mindscape Holiday Message 2023 | Reflections on Immortality
**Mindscape Podcast:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT9hbba8Q3g)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the 2023 holiday message from the Mindscape podcast. I'm your
*  host Sean Carroll. Every year we do this holiday message because basically I take roughly two
*  weeks off for holiday time. So next week really will take off. There will be no Mindscape
*  podcast released on Christmas Day itself. But the previous week we do the holiday message,
*  which is supposed to be a short, shorter than usual anyway, little solo podcast, not quite
*  a full blown podcast, not something that deserves to be a solo episode all by itself, but a
*  little brief reflection on something interesting that is either on my mind at the moment or
*  happened during the year or many things happened during the year or whatever it happens to
*  be. So this year I thought that there was something interesting that I participated
*  in this year. Back in September I was a speaker at a workshop at the Santa Fe Institute devoted
*  to the topic of immortality. Yes, you heard that correctly. Immortality, living forever.
*  This was the topic. And I love this fact about the Santa Fe Institute that they're willing
*  to be that adventurous, I guess maybe is the word, to try something different, extraordinarily
*  interdisciplinary. So this is an idea that was actually hatched by David Krakauer, previous
*  Mindscape guest, and Caitlin McShay, who is also at SFI. And they brought together a bunch
*  of people, scientists, but also literary artists type people, people from a variety of different
*  humanities, as well as social sciences and physical sciences backgrounds, and just said,
*  immortality, let's talk about it. What does it mean? What are the prospects? Would it be good or
*  bad, etc.? Very specifically, it was not about mortality. Mortality dying is something that we
*  don't want to face up to, but okay, we do talk about the prospect of it. And it's very important
*  to and as I've said several times, I don't think we do a very good job in our culture right now.
*  But immortality, we don't talk about that much, probably because it's not very realistic to
*  be frank. But would it be a good idea if we could do it? How close can we come to doing it? And
*  that those are the kinds of things that got talked about at the workshop. So very little of the
*  workshop actually, in retrospect, was literally about immortality. You know, immortality is one
*  of those words that carries implications of the infinite living literally forever. Most of the
*  people who rose to the occasion to give talks, including a few previous mindscape guests like
*  Jeffrey West, talked about longevity, longevity of individuals, of ideas of cities, and so forth.
*  My job was to bring the cosmic perspective here and to kind of be a downer to say that even in
*  principle, as far as we understand the universe right now, true immortality is really not quite
*  possible. Maybe the universe can be eternal and infinite, but what we think of as human mortality
*  can't. But it was a wonderful workshop overall. It was very stimulating, people coming from
*  completely different angles on this question, really thinking it through, even though it sounds
*  a little silly at first glance. It's important to face up to what one of my old philosophy
*  professors called limit concepts. You know, push yourself to the limit of what you're comfortable
*  thinking about or contemplating and look at what you learn, look at what you bring back. What does
*  this tell you about yourself and your more realistic concerns here in the world? So that's
*  what we're going to do here in this particular holiday message. So let's go.
*  The first question to confront when you're told to think about immortality is, what does that mean?
*  What is the definition of immortality? And you might say, I know what that is. It's easy. It's
*  living forever. That's what it means to be immortal. But okay, what do you mean by living? In other
*  words, some people at the workshop raised the issue that if the universe is eternal and you
*  have some version, and we have to be careful of what we mean by some version of Laplace's demon
*  going on, then in some sense, you live forever. If there's a famous example that physicists always
*  use when they talk about the black hole information loss paradox, right? They say, look, if you have a
*  book and you throw it into a fire and the book burns, then the information that was in the book
*  is lost in practice to you. You don't know what the book says anymore. But in principle, if all the
*  laws of physics are being obeyed, then the specific ways in which the book burned are implicated in
*  the specific kind of heat and light and ashes that were produced by that fire. So if you had infinite
*  capacity to figure out what all that information was and also to reconstruct it, etc., you could
*  read what was in the book. This is of course exactly what Laplace's demon would have to do,
*  the hypothetical vast intelligence proposed by Pierre-Simon Laplace that could know the position
*  and velocity of every particle in a classical universe and use that to completely know both
*  the past and the future. There's some complications here depending on your favorite version of quantum
*  mechanics, etc. But the point remains that in some sense, modern physics thinks that the
*  information contained in you persists through time. This doesn't count as immortality. That is my
*  first message. We talked about this. I think most people actually agree with me on this one. But
*  trying to get exactly straight what it does mean. So, you know, what does it mean to say that you
*  have died? I mean, the information that is in your brain, etc., is still contained in the universe,
*  so what exactly happens? And if you really dig into it, I would definitely be someone who argued
*  that you at this moment is not exactly the same person as you five minutes ago, much less five
*  years ago. We change over time. So if on the one hand, we're always changing over time, inevitably,
*  and on the other hand, the information contained within us in principle persists out there in the
*  universe, then either we live for just a moment or for forever, right? Of course, the reconciliation
*  to all this silliness is to admit that we are talking about the macroscopic world. We're talking
*  about an emergent level of reality when we talk about people and their lives and deaths. So in
*  fact, what happens is forgetting about Laplace's demon and microscopic information, various parts
*  of the universe come together to give rise to you, a person, and we call that being born or being
*  conceived or whatever moment you want to attach to the first moment when you were really being you,
*  and then you live your life. And over the course of living your life, there is accessible information
*  about you. By accessible, I mean we're not being Laplace's demon. We're not pretending to know
*  where every single molecule in your body is, but maybe I can know roughly where you're located,
*  how tall you are, what your hair color is. I can talk to you about your wants and needs and things
*  like that. That's the accessible information that defines who you are as a macroscopic person. And
*  over the course of your lifetime, that accessible information comes and goes. And then once you
*  reach death, at least in the current way that it's understood at our current moment of technological
*  progress, that information about who you were, your hopes and dreams, etc., is no longer accessible
*  from you, right? It's no longer accessible from your body. Maybe you wrote it down in a diary or
*  something, but we don't count that as you. We don't count that as being immortal. So I think that as
*  long as we understand this sort of macroscopic emergent perspective, it makes sense to say that
*  real human beings have some kind of finite lifespan. I think it's also very important here
*  to imagine that these real human beings we're talking about have a kind of finite memory, right?
*  Like there's some psychological continuity. It is not absolute. We do not remember everything that
*  happened to us, but it is not absent either. If we did remember nothing about what happened to us from
*  moment to moment in time, then this notion of individual identity and psychological continuity
*  over time wouldn't be that useful, right? So I think that as long as we have this macroscopic
*  perspective and we admit that even though we change over time, we don't change utterly over time. We
*  keep some information, some memory, some common characteristics of who we are from moment to moment,
*  I think is perfectly well defined to say that people have a lifespan, and as far as we know,
*  that lifespan is not infinite. Now, some of you will know there is a possible loop loophole here
*  in the case of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, right? Famously, there's this
*  idea of quantum immortality. Max Tegmark, another previous guest, and others have talked about
*  quantum immortality. And there's different ways to play this game, but roughly speaking, the idea is
*  that you are this collection of atoms and other excitations of elementary fields that make up the
*  universe. You obey the rules of quantum mechanics, let's say, and let's say that we believe in the
*  many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, then different things happen to us. So on different
*  branches, we might act in slightly different ways. We might respond to other kinds of branching
*  events where quantum measurements are made, Geiger counters, universe splitter apps on our iPhones,
*  or what have you. So we are slightly different people descended from us on all these different
*  branches of the wave function. And either you can play this game different ways, like I said,
*  but you can either bring this about by some quantum random number generator hooked up to a device
*  that will kill you, or just by letting time evolve and seeing what happens, one way or the other,
*  you can argue that there will always be one branch of the wave function on which you remain
*  alive indefinitely long, even if in the overwhelming majority of branches of the wave functions,
*  you will die, there might be one branch in which you live forever, essentially. Now, I don't think
*  that this is a very illuminating thought experiment personally, I think that the technical parts of it
*  are all plausibly correct as far as we know. We don't specifically know how many branches of the
*  wave function there are, if there's a finite number that changes things from an infinite number
*  and so forth. But let's grant all the assumptions of the thought experiment. And imagine that
*  somewhere out there in the many branches of the wave function of the universe, you do live forever,
*  there is some kind of quantum immortality, then longtime listeners will know that I'm going to say,
*  I don't care about that, mostly for the reason that if you want to believe in many worlds at all,
*  if you want to accept that as the correct theory of the world in which we personally do live,
*  then you have to accept a couple things. One is that not all the worlds count equally,
*  okay? There is an amplitude, there is a wave function squared, which plays the role of how
*  many copies there are, right? That's why you get the Born rule. When you say, I'm going to have a
*  probability, I'm going to predict the outcome of a quantum measurement probabilistically,
*  I'm going to say it's two-thirds for this, one-third for that. In many worlds, both outcomes
*  actually come true. So why in the world would you say there's a probability of two-thirds versus
*  one-third? The answer is that the two-thirds branch counts more in a very quantifiable way.
*  And if you accept that, then these branches on which you live forever count enormously tiny
*  amounts, like infinitesimally almost immeasurably tiny amounts. It's not something that should
*  affect your everyday life in any way, the prospect of this living forever. And as I've said before,
*  many times, including by the way, in my new Wondrium course on the many worlds of quantum mechanics,
*  when we think about why it would be bad to die, if you think that way, you're thinking about it now.
*  There is some value right now into thinking that I'm not going to die within the next couple of
*  minutes. Okay? So even in a classical universe where there's only one world, there's not many
*  worlds or anything like that, you still want to live a long time, even though once you're dead,
*  you're not going to care about it. The reason to be upset about the prospect of death, which is a
*  perfectly legitimate reaction to have, is not because once you're dead, you will be sad. That
*  was never the idea. The prospect of dying in the future is upsetting to me now. And so the same
*  thing is true with quantum immortality. The idea that there is a branch of the wave function where
*  a version of me will continue forever is completely swamped by the fact that on most branches of the
*  wave function, the overwhelming majority of them, there is no version of me that is continuing
*  forever. So I feel about that in exactly the same way that I would feel about living in a single
*  universe where I had a finite lifespan. And of course, the other thing to keep in mind is that
*  these different versions of you are not all you. They are your descendants in time. You have to
*  update what you mean by personal identity if you're going to accept many worlds. So it's cold
*  comfort to think there's other people who share a common past with you that are going to live
*  forever, but you're not. So I think that there is no solace to be found in the many worlds
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics if what we want is to live forever. Now, that's a little
*  bit of science I wanted to get out of the way, not because it's really what I care about in this
*  brief podcast, but because people will be thinking about it. Once they hear it's me talking,
*  and once they hear immortality in the title, they want to hear about the quantum immortality
*  thing. That's my take on it. I want to actually be a little bit more down to earth here. First,
*  let's ask whether or not in the real world that there was actual immortality, not just quantum
*  immortality, if there was a feasible chance that I could live on a lot of branches of the wave
*  function for effectively forever, what would that be like? And for that matter, would it be good?
*  So there was one person, I'm very sorry I forget who it was, there was a person at the Santa Fe
*  workshop who had the very, very good idea of taking a poll of the people in the room. And
*  remember, the people in the room are selected to be in some way interested in the topic of
*  immortality one way or the other. I mean, they didn't volunteer, they were asked and they said,
*  okay, I'll go. So they were chosen as people who might have thoughts about immortality,
*  let's put it that way. And the poll question was very simple. If you could live for 10,000 years,
*  and let's say that you are as healthy for all those 10,000 years as you ever have been, okay,
*  so you don't just decline in capabilities for all those millennia ahead of you, would you want to?
*  Would you want to live for 10,000 years? A sizable majority of the room said no, they would not want
*  to live for 10,000 years. That's too long. I was one of the minority there. I absolutely voted to
*  live for 10,000 years. I mean, I am absolutely impressed by the number of things that I want
*  to do in life that I don't have time to do, right? So the idea of 10,000 years to kind of relax and
*  get it all done, that's very, very appealing to me. The specific number 10,000 years is very hard
*  to judge. If you think very roughly speaking that we all live for on average order of magnitude for
*  one century, for 100 years, that's multiplying the average human lifespan by 100. It's very hard to
*  judge whether you would go a little bit crazy. And if you look into literature, which people
*  at the workshop were absolutely interested in doing, it is very interesting how many cautionary
*  tales there are about immortality. There's a story by Jorge Luis Borges, who we talked recently
*  about on the podcast with William Egginton. He wrote a story called The Immortals. There it is.
*  And I'm not going to spoil it for you. It's a short story. You can find it on the internet very
*  easily. But suffice it to say, there are characters in the story who are immortal, and they're not
*  living very enjoyable lives. In fact, they're called troglodytes. It's sort of for various
*  reasons, right? Like you run out of things to be interested in, and even more, you're not in a hurry.
*  Right? If there's some experience you want to have, according to Borges, but you're going to
*  live forever, what's your motivation really to get it done anytime soon? Right? It'll come around
*  once in a while eventually. So I think that's quite plausible that you would actually feel that way if
*  you were literally going to live forever. My favorite example of this kind of story, which I'm
*  sure I mentioned on the podcast before, but I can't remember when, is Julian Barnes in his book,
*  The History of the World in Ten and a Half Chapters. The last chapter is called The Dream,
*  and it's a guy dies and he goes to heaven, so he can be immortal. So there's the gimmick in
*  Julian Barnes' version of heaven is you get anything you want, and you can live forever,
*  but we're not going to tell you what you want. You have to invent what you want. So I like that
*  version of it because it faces the reality of our finitude, right? Like time is infinite,
*  possibility is infinite, but our imaginations, or maybe to be more fair, our desires or our
*  interests are finite. We human beings are finite. So you're placed in a situation in heaven where
*  you get anything you want, and the particular guy we're looking at here is not the most
*  imaginative person in the world in the context of the Julian Barnes story. It's in a novel,
*  History of the World in Ten and a Half Chapters, but the novel consists of a series of stories
*  that are more or less unrelated. So basically he's a middle-class English bloke, and he wants to,
*  you know, have breakfast foods for dinner every day and have sex with a lot of beautiful women
*  and meet all of his celebrity, favorite celebrities, and then he wants to play golf
*  every day and get holes in one. And if you have enough time and you can do anything you want,
*  then you can do all those things, right? And at some point, given that you are finite,
*  and I think that this is just very, very telling, at some point you run out of things to be interested
*  in. This is a much broader lesson in my mind. We sometimes talk about eternity or infinity or
*  immortality as human beings. We don't really think about it deeply enough. We kind of tend to conflate
*  immortality with longevity, with big numbers with infinite numbers, right? But they're not really
*  the same thing. And we human beings, at least at the moment, at least in the kind of form that
*  human beings are known to have, are finite. And that includes our desires and our hopes and our
*  ability to imagine. So our hero, our protagonist in the Julian Barnes story, eventually asks his
*  guardian angel. He says, like, is there any option to no longer persist, to basically die, right? To
*  stop being here in heaven? And the angel says, yes, that is absolutely an option that you can take.
*  And he says, wow, that's kind of amazing. Has anyone ever taken this option, like to give up on heaven?
*  And the angel says, everyone takes the option. That's what's going to happen, says Julian Barnes.
*  We are not going to want to actually be immortal. And I don't know, though, about 10,000 years.
*  That's the interesting question. How long would you want to live? I completely agree that you would
*  not want to live for infinity years. But I think 10,000 years you might want to live. Finally, of course,
*  on The Good Place, the TV show that was recently quite popular, I encourage everyone to watch The
*  Good Place. It was a great show. And at the end of the show, they came to a similar conclusion. Again,
*  I'm not going to spoil it. I kind of spoiled the Julian Barnes story, but I'll let you watch The
*  Good Place. They had to confront exactly the same kind of question, and they did it in a very
*  interesting way. So I think that, again, there's a difference between living forever and living for
*  10,000 years. I don't want to live forever, but I personally do want to live for 10,000 years. I'm
*  interested in what mindscape listeners might think about this. By the way, one of the people who was
*  at the workshop was Ted Chiang, who was a science fiction writer, excellent writer, wrote a lot of
*  good stories, including ones on which movies were based, like Arrival, for example. I can highly
*  recommend his books. And he's actually spending time now at SFI, hanging out with the Santa Fe
*  people. And he gave a little talk where he made an impassioned plea for why immortality would be bad.
*  But it was communally based. It was not individually based. So it wasn't that you would get bored.
*  It was kind of more along the Borges line. He was saying that society would sort of stagnate.
*  We would fall into a rut. There is something to be said. There is an evolutionary reason why,
*  and not just biological evolution, but social evolution, why people need to die.
*  Because people get stuck. People are very successful in one mode or another, and they're
*  going to keep trying that. And new ideas bubble up from younger people. And if you have immortality
*  or effective immortality in your society, there are no younger people. You got to say, look, sorry,
*  we cannot have kids or anything like that, or we'll just exponentially grow in numbers. That
*  would be bad. So no more kids, no more ideas, no more young people, no more youth with their energy
*  and so forth. There is a footnote here about youthful energy, which I think I personally think
*  youthful energy is really, really important. And there's a whole political, social kind of commentary
*  to have that I'm not going to go into right now about the weirdness with which certain culture war
*  battles are fought on the grounds of what the kids in the universities and the colleges these days
*  are doing. I think that kids in universities and colleges, they're not kids anymore. They're
*  grownups by the time they're in university, but they still have that energy, that drive,
*  that desire to make a difference in the world. Sometimes that's going to lead them to go too far,
*  to be extreme, to go a step beyond where they should go. And by all means, they should be told,
*  don't go there. But we still need to let them make those mistakes. We need to encourage that
*  youthful energy and that willingness to change the world. Okay, that little footnote is now gone.
*  I disagreed with Ted about falling into a rut a little bit. I mean, I think there are ways to,
*  you know, it's kind of a silly argument because we're not going to be immortal or anything like
*  that. I think that there would be ways to keep society interesting and new and novel, even without
*  actual new young people being created. There could still be new ideas that are being created,
*  but I get it. I get the argument. I think it's very valid. So I think that the point of this
*  little digression, this long digression is that it's not obvious that immortality is a good thing.
*  We need to sit and think about whether we want it as well as what I'm going to eventually get to here.
*  The point of this little podcast is can we possibly get it? But one final thing before
*  we get there is that there's different kinds of immortality, of course, right? Ernest Hemingway
*  famously said that everyone dies twice when they stop breathing and the last time anyone ever
*  thinks about them or says their name. Sometimes this quote is attributed to Banksy, but Banksy
*  was clearly quoting Hemingway here. You can have a legacy, right? You can physically be dead,
*  but you can live on in the impact that you've had on the world. It reminds me there was a recent
*  Ask Me Anything question by Mark, with no last name, which asked whether or not I cared how long
*  I will be remembered, right? So there's two different ways in which we're going to die.
*  We're going to die because we literally physically die and then because everyone forgets us.
*  I think that this is one of the many ways that you can emphasize the stark reality of the end
*  of our lives, right? It's not just that you stop existing, but all sorts of things associated with
*  you come to an end. If you like to read books, there is a last book you will read. There is a
*  last time you will see the person you fall in love with. There is a last meal that you will have.
*  There is a last good idea that you will have. And then after you're dead, there's a last time
*  someone thinks about you, a last time someone says your name out loud, a last time someone reads
*  about you in a book or anything like that. These are all implications of the finitude of human life.
*  Of course, Hemingway is trying to say some people last longer than others. Some people,
*  they're going to keep reading my books, whoever he was talking to. I'm not sure about that.
*  But my answer for the AMA question was I don't really care about that. I'm very much about the
*  time that I have where I'm conscious here on earth living my life. I'm much less interested
*  in what's going on after I am dead. In fact, there was a wonderful little intervention by Scott Small,
*  who was another person at the workshop. He was a neuroscientist, and he mentioned the idea of a
*  ceremony of forgetting, probably in the context of ceremonies of atonement, you know, forgetting
*  our sins, forgetting the bad things that we've done, but the more general idea of letting things
*  go into the past. I think this is sympathetic with what Ted Chiang was saying. If you take
*  mortality seriously, if you don't struggle against the inevitable passing of ourselves
*  and our memories, then rather than doing that, let's honor it. Let's say, OK, we remembered you for a
*  long time. We're not going to think about you anymore. We're going to honor your memory by
*  forgetting, by moving on, because life continues for the people who are still around. I thought
*  that was very touching, probably difficult to pull off in practice, but it does raise the question of
*  what can we do in practice, right? OK, so we've been talking about whether or not immortality would
*  be good or not, how to think about the implications of it, et cetera, but it doesn't matter if you
*  can't do it, right? Then we're sort of wasting our time in telling each other stories. Again,
*  maybe it matters in the sense that I mentioned earlier that we help ourselves conceptualize the
*  finite life we have, and that's fine, but is it just that kind of thought experiment usefulness,
*  or is there some realistic prospect that we could live forever? By the way, I do like to emphasize
*  that as far as I can tell, the idea of extending our lives much longer than they currently exist
*  is very realistic. Not necessarily within my lifetime, but this is a biology problem,
*  not a physics problem. There's no problem as far as the laws of physics are concerned with repairing
*  yourself as a biological organism. It's not built into what our biological capacities actually are,
*  but that's OK. We can change them, right? That's what medicine and biology are all about.
*  One of the first podcasts I did, or at least in the first couple of months, was with Colleen Murphy,
*  who is a researcher at Princeton, and I was happy to see she just has a new book out called How We
*  Age. So I strongly encourage you, if you're interested in this life extension question,
*  read what Colleen says. She's not a crazy person. She's actually a very serious scientist,
*  and she will give you both what is plausible and what we cannot do based on actual experiments that
*  have been done. But if you're asking, you know, a thousand years from now, how long can we extend
*  our lives for? We have no idea, and the answer might very well be effectively forever as far as
*  I know. I think it's, you know, it's important given what we were talking about last week with
*  Adam Frank and aliens and so forth, it's important to recognize that if you are contemplating
*  interstellar travel and going, ah, it's not really realistic, it will take thousands of years.
*  You know, maybe our lifespan is tens of thousands of years or millions of years,
*  so maybe that becomes totally realistic. But even that is very different than infinity years. It's
*  not quite immortal, right? So let's actually think, and now I can talk about the science that I tried
*  to bring to the workshop on the cosmology and physics side of things, right? Let's be very,
*  very honest and ask, would it be in principle possible to live forever in some recognizable
*  way? Given that we human beings are biological organisms, as I said on a recent podcast, we are
*  quasi homeostatic, non-equilibrium systems embedded in entropy gradient. And the fact that
*  the entropy of the universe is increasing is crucially important to life, right? Life on Earth
*  in particular is possible because the sun is a hot spot in an otherwise cold sky. That's a reflection
*  of the fact that we are very, very far from thermal equilibrium. We are non-equilibrium processes.
*  If you took all of the information contained in me and you wrote it in a book and then, you know,
*  put the book on the shelf, that book would not be me, right? There's nothing happening. There's
*  no time evolution. There's no development. There's no increase in memory or experience or anything
*  like that. To be alive, to be human, to be a living organism in the way that we think about it,
*  it is necessary for time to pass and for you to accumulate memories and experiences and knowledge
*  as well as making predictions about the future. And that is all very strongly based on the arrow
*  of time. And the arrow of time, as you all know from listening to the podcast, comes about because
*  our universe used to have very low entropy. Entropy thought of as a way of counting how many
*  microstates look a certain way in the macroscopic configuration of the universe. Our early universe
*  was hot, dense, smooth, rapidly expanding. Turns out that's a very, very tiny number of microstates
*  look that way compared to the number of states of the universe that look the way that our universe
*  looks today. And in turn, that, the number of states that look like the universe today,
*  is very, very small compared to how many, how we could look. That is to say, we are continuing to
*  approach thermal equilibrium. The actual thing that is happening is the universe expands from
*  a hot, dense state. It cools off. Gravity pulls things together. We make some black holes. Black
*  holes have huge amounts of entropy. We also make galaxies and planets and stars, as well as life
*  and so forth. And eventually, it all goes away. That's the big lesson that I have for you here.
*  Not necessarily a cheerful one, but all of that churning, interestingness and complexity in the
*  current universe will eventually disappear. Stars will burn their fuel. It's going to take a long
*  time. Okay, so the universe today is, again, order of magnitude 10 to the 10 years old.
*  The last star will probably peter out around 10 to the 15 years from now. So that's plenty of time
*  to do lots of interesting things. But eventually, those stars are going to die. They'll fall into
*  black holes. The black holes will evaporate, and the evaporation products will scatter across the
*  universe. We discovered back in 1998 that our universe is not only expanding, but accelerating.
*  We attribute that to vacuum energy, to the cosmological constant, to the energy of empty
*  space. And there's going to be nothing but empty space left if you go far enough into the future.
*  All the black holes will evaporate into photons and things like that. Those photons will be
*  stretched by the expansion of the universe into essential non-existence for all intents and
*  purposes. That's the high entropy state of the future universe. That's thermal equilibrium.
*  In fact, I'm sure I mentioned this one before also, but one of my favorite papers was with
*  Aidan Chatwin Davis. We wrote a paper that related this particular feature of the universe in the
*  presence of a cosmological constant or a non-zero vacuum energy. The universe empties out and becomes
*  smooth and featureless. We related that to thermal equilibrium, to the thermodynamic tendency of
*  entropy to increase in a box of gas until you reach equilibrium, and then it just stays at that
*  constant amount. We wrote a very fun paper that said that you can actually prove what is called
*  the cosmic no-hair theorem. The cosmic no-hair theorem, originally coming from Bob Wald,
*  showed that if you have a universe with a positive cosmological constant that does not
*  re-collapse, then eventually it just empties out. You get nothing but empty space. Dissider space
*  is the technical term. That's a result in general relativity. What Aidan and I did is not use general
*  relativity. We did not use Einstein's equation of general relativity. Instead, we used a definition
*  of entropy that is applicable to a situation where you have both gravity, so there's entropy
*  in the gravitational field, but also you have matter, you have stuff, you have photons and
*  things like that. There's both matter, entropy, and gravitational entropy. This definition was
*  written down by, I was amused to remember, two former Mindscape guests, Rafael Busso and Neda
*  Engelhardt. They collaborated on a paper together. They wrote down this definition of entropy that
*  applies in cosmological situations. What Aidan and I did is to say, okay, if this particular
*  definition of entropy simply rises for a while and asymptotes to a constant finite value,
*  what does that imply about the expansion of the universe? We proved that it implies that
*  you approach dissider space, just like the cosmic no-hair theorem. You approach an empty universe
*  with exponentially growing expansion, etc. That is the highest entropy state the universe can be in.
*  Empty space, nothing going on. So what that means is, back to reality now, the fact that we're not
*  there, the fact that we're not in empty space, the fact that we are lower entropy than that,
*  allows life to exist. The initial low entropy of the universe is a resource that we are using up.
*  We are increasing the entropy of the universe, approaching that final empty thermal equilibrium
*  state, and we have a finite amount of that resource to use. We need low entropy energy.
*  Technically, you might call it free energy in the technical physics term, but it's not like
*  energy for free. It's energy that is available to do useful things. We use free energy to metabolize,
*  to act, to think, to live. That's the usefulness of having the sun there as a hot spot in a cold
*  sky. We need that in order for life to exist. You see how this is relevant to the question of
*  immortality. Now, as I've often talked about often, one way of thinking about this universal process
*  is that complexity comes into existence and then evaporates away. There is a simple initial state
*  for the universe. There is a simple final state for the universe. Complexity comes in the middle,
*  and that's where we are right now. People, when I say that, always want to know, are we exactly at
*  the top of the complexity curve, or are we slightly past it, or before it, or what? We don't know. I
*  don't know a good way to quantify that. I do have one little piece of information that maybe is
*  relevant that I shared with everyone at Santa Fe. One thing that you can actually calculate is
*  the rate of star formation in the universe. So how many stars, and when I say in the universe,
*  I mean in our observable universe. So the total amount of stuff is finite. We're looking at some
*  co-moving volume with a certain number of atoms inside and asking how many stars are produced.
*  And you can look out there in galaxies and star-forming regions, there's plenty of stars being
*  produced. But then you do it carefully, and you learn that we are past the era of peak star
*  formation in our universe. Star formation peaked around four or five billion years after the Big
*  Bang, and now we're 15, we're 14 billion years after the Big Bang. Star formation rates have
*  been declining for almost 10 billion years. So that does not mean the complexity is declining,
*  but it means that that kind of, the particular kind of complexity definitely is not increasing
*  over time, right? Like all the stars, most of the stars that have ever been formed in the history
*  of our universe, that will ever be formed, have already been formed. This is a reminder,
*  and I'm not saying this because I want it to be true, this is just what science is telling us.
*  The interesting part of the life of our universe is finite. You know, you can judge what
*  exactly the number is in different ways, but it's not going to last forever. The universe started
*  simple, complexity comes into existence and flourishes for a while, but that while is finite.
*  We will eventually evaporate, dissolve into the surrounding thermal equilibrium. That is the sad
*  science message that I had to bring to the folks at Santa Fe. We can even quantify this a little bit.
*  Those of you who are physicists out there might know there's a famous paper by Freeman Dyson from
*  back in 1979. Freeman Dyson, famous physicist, wrote a paper called Time Without End, Physics and
*  Biology in an Open Universe. I think this paper is famous anyway. It was clearly not famous enough
*  because no one else at the workshop had heard about it besides me, but what Dyson was saying is that
*  let's imagine, so he's 1979, he's writing this, right? So they didn't know a lot about the future
*  history of the universe. Maybe it will re-collapse, maybe it will expand forever and so forth.
*  Certainly the idea of the cosmological constant and eternal acceleration was known in principle,
*  but was not considered a leading candidate, so people didn't pay a lot of attention.
*  So Dyson says, what if the universe is open? That is to say, he's imagining that the total amount of
*  matter in the universe is not enough to cause the universe to stop expanding and then re-collapse.
*  The universe will last forever. So that's the kind of universe in which you might say, well,
*  maybe there's a hope for being immortal, right? The universe lasts forever. But also, it's expanding,
*  again, not thinking about vacuum energy or the cosmological constant, but the temperature is
*  going down, the density of matter is going down. So you might worry that we run out of energy,
*  we run out of stuff. And Dyson's insight, his argument was, you could live forever in an open
*  universe because if you think that it takes a certain amount of energy to have a thought,
*  well, what you can do is just have thoughts that take less and less energy but take more and more
*  time. So basically, Dyson argues there's a competition. If you allow yourself to count as
*  a thought, you know, a certain amount of energy expended, but you give yourself more and more time
*  for it to happen, what is the sum that you do? Do you get to fit an infinite number of thoughts
*  into the universe, into this infinitely old universe? And he says the answer is yes.
*  The universe is getting less and less dense, colder and colder and colder, but you can still
*  fit an infinite number of thoughts into it. Very interesting. And you might think at first that
*  adding a cosmological constant to this question doesn't change it very much. It's still an open
*  universe. It's still cooling off, but not that much differently than it would an ordinary open
*  universe. But there is a physics difference that actually matters because, as I said,
*  the state that we approach is not Minkowski space, which would be empty space with nothing in it at
*  all, but it is De Sitter space, empty space with a cosmological constant in it. And then our
*  observable universe has an upper limit on its entropy. So the observable universe starts with
*  a very small entropy and then increases, but only to a finite amount. That's kind of an important
*  thing. That's a very different situation than what Dyson had considered. And I looked a little bit
*  for, you know, was there anyone talking about this important impact on Dyson's argument,
*  but I couldn't find anyone. Probably it's out there somewhere. I'm probably not completely
*  original on what I'm about to say, but the entropy of our observable universe has an upper bound,
*  which we think is about 10 to the 122. The universe will expand and thermalize, equilibrate
*  to that kind of state where there's a finite entropy around us. What that means is there is
*  an upper limit on life because that thinking, you know, Dyson was worried about energy,
*  not about entropy. So he imagined thinking, you know, more and more slowly using up less and less
*  energy. But computation, the kind of computation that is relevant to life and thinking increases
*  the entropy of the universe. Roughly speaking, every bit of information that is processed
*  increases the entropy of the universe by one. Okay. Now you can argue about this. There's details.
*  There are reversible computations and things like that. But the fact is that the kind of
*  computations that are relevant to thinking, remembering, predicting the future, stuff like
*  that do generate entropy. They increase the entropy of the universe around you. So if thinking and
*  therefore if living and thinking increase the entropy of the universe and there's an upper
*  limit to the entropy of the universe, then guess what? There's an upper limit on how much life
*  there can be in the future history of our universe. So how much life can you fit into the rest of the
*  universe? And here this is just, you know, my back of the envelope calculation. Again, someone
*  probably did this more carefully, but here's what I came up with. If you ask about the total entropy
*  production of a single human lifetime, you can actually look up the numbers. Human beings increase
*  the entropy of the universe around them by about 10 to the 23 bits per second. I don't know where
*  that number comes from. It's mostly the infrared radiation that we're giving off. Okay. And that's
*  safely above the number of computations that we're doing. The number of computations in a human brain
*  is roughly 10 to the 20 bits per second. And I said that every computation increases the entropy
*  by one. So the fact that the computation rate is 10 to the 20 bits per second, the entropy production
*  is 10 to the 23 bits per second is perfectly consistent. It's just saying that most of our
*  entropy production does not come from thinking, which is probably quite realistic, right? Like
*  we're also just sweating and radiating out into the universe just by maintaining our temperature
*  and things like that. So, okay, let's take the total entropy production of a human being
*  and let's multiply it by a century, right, for the typical human lifetime. And let's get 10 to the 29
*  as the number of bits of entropy generated in a typical human lifetime. Call that a human life
*  equivalent, 10 to the 29 bits per lifetime. History to date, if you just count the number of human
*  beings who have existed, is about 10 to the 11 human life equivalents, actually actual human
*  lives as a matter of fact in that case. But we're imagining that maybe in the future it's not actual
*  human lives, it's, you know, in the matrix or something like that or some kind of collective
*  intelligence, who knows? We're just talking about the entropy production in a typical human lifespan
*  now projecting it into however that might be instantiated into the future. Well, if you have
*  the earth lasting for a long time before the sun expands, right, let's be down to earth here.
*  Let's take the number of humans now, about 10 to the 10 humans on the earth today, and let's imagine
*  that we exist just here on earth, we don't colonize the sky, okay, and we last until the sun blows up.
*  Then that's about 10 to the 8th centuries, 10 to the 10 humans right now, so that's 10 to the 18
*  human life equivalents. So in other words, we've had 10 to the 11 human life equivalents so far in
*  history, another 10 to the 18 to go, so we're nowhere near everything that could be accomplished
*  just here on earth as long as we don't do something dumb like ruining the earth while we're here on it.
*  That's still nothing compared to what happens if we do colonize the stars, if we go out into the sky,
*  fill the Milky Way galaxies, 10 to the 11 planets for the rest of the lifetime of the stars in our
*  galaxy, we get up to 10 to the 34 human life equivalents. So this is how many human life
*  equivalents could be experienced by life forms in our Milky Way galaxy between now and when the last
*  star dies, 10 to the 15 years from now, 10 to the 34, way bigger than the 10 to the 11 that have
*  actually existed here on earth. And finally, just to, you know, blow our minds a little bit,
*  I said that there's an upper bound on the total amount of entropy we can fit in the universe,
*  10 to the 122, how many human life equivalents does that count as? Well, if it's 10 to the 29 bits
*  per lifespan of a human being, that's 10 to the 93 human life equivalents that we can fit into the
*  universe. That's a very, very large number, 10 to the 93. So if we did nothing but harness all
*  of the resources in the observable universe and put them to the task of thinking, of acting like
*  human beings, whatever that means, to think and learn and love and write poetry and whatever,
*  you could do that for 10 to the 93 human life equivalents, which it's not realistic that,
*  but that's the upper bound. We're not trying to be realistic and say that's what would happen.
*  That is the maximum number you can contemplate. And 10 to the 93 human life equivalents is a
*  very big number, but it is finite. That's the final lesson here. The final lesson here is given
*  that our universe is moving toward thermal equilibrium, that it is cooling off and getting
*  smoother and getting eventually kind of bland and featureless and going toward a situation where
*  life itself cannot exist. It doesn't matter how clever you are. It doesn't matter how you
*  marshal the resources around you to sort of say, well, I'm going to like build a bunker.
*  I'm going to pack enough food to last longer than the universe, et cetera, et cetera. You can't do it
*  unless you die, unless you literally don't exist. As long as you are still existing like a human
*  being, still having thoughts, still increasing the entropy of the universe, there is an upper bound
*  to doing that. It's a bound that is very, very far away, completely irrelevant to our current
*  existence here on earth, but it is there. So the bad news from cosmology is immortality of human beings
*  or even of the human race is not a foreseeable prospect. You can still live a long time. Don't
*  get me wrong, but true immortality is beyond our grasp. There's one little footnote here with which
*  I will close this whole holiday reflection, holiday message, which is, okay, is it possible that the
*  last loophole maybe is maybe we human beings will just equilibrate into the universe around us,
*  but could the universe be immortal? Could it last forever? Yeah, that's absolutely possible.
*  It's absolutely possible for the universe to last forever. The conventional picture is that we just,
*  of course, expand from the Big Bang, from the hot, dense state, our entropy increases toward
*  the future, and eventually we hit the sitter space, and then nothing ever happens, but nothing ever
*  happens for an infinite amount of time. So that is absolutely a kind of immortality, right?
*  But if you think about why the early universe had low entropy in the first place, that's a big mystery
*  that we don't have a good answer to. As most listeners know, I wrote a paper back almost 20
*  years ago now with Jennifer Chen that proposed a large-scale model of the universe, large-scale
*  cosmological scenario in which most of space and time is precisely local thermal equilibrium,
*  to sitter space, empty space, nothing there, nothing going on. But if we add to that
*  the possibility that there can be a quantum fluctuation that creates a little baby universe
*  in some local region of space, even if the rate at which such fluctuations happen is very, very,
*  very small, you have infinity years to wait. So eventually you will get lots of baby universes,
*  and they will inside them, actually typically a baby universe will just re-collapse right away,
*  but if conditions are just right, it can expand and inflate and have its own arrow of time. It
*  can expand and cool and have an initially low entropy just in the baby universe before it
*  expands and thermal equilibrium eventually happens, and there's a temporary period where
*  life can exist in that baby universe before it eventually goes back to its quiescent empty state.
*  And in this scenario, there will be an infinite number of those baby universes in which that
*  happens. So I kind of like this scenario for, I like it because it helps explain why the early
*  universe had low entropy, but I like its implications for immortality. And this is,
*  you know, the happy conclusion I came to when I was thinking about what to say at the Santa Fe
*  workshop. In this scenario, the universe lasts forever, but most of it is dead, right? Most of
*  it is empty space, nothing going on. There are brief little fluctuations where complex systems,
*  including living creatures, can come into existence in the baby universes and in their aftermaths.
*  But that makes, that's a, there's a good news, bad news situation here. The good news is that,
*  that will happen forever. So there will always be future beings in our future light cone,
*  the future of our universe. There will be thought, there will be love, there will be caring and
*  meaningfulness and purpose, at least temporarily in regions of space and time that will exist in
*  the future of our universe. That's the good news. The other news, which I'm not going to necessarily
*  call good or bad, is that no information is passed from universe to universe. The process
*  of the quantum fluctuation that makes the baby universe doesn't rely or depend or care about
*  what came before. It is a completely, it's blind to what the conditions of the universe were
*  that created it. So whatever universe is created, and again, our universe might very well be one of
*  these universes that came about by this mechanism, it doesn't know what happened before. We can
*  hypothesize about it, we could, that's what we're doing right now, or we can think about it, we can
*  say the existence of a pre-existing universe is the best way of making sense of the universe we see,
*  but we can't know. We can't talk to them, we can't communicate with them, nor can they communicate
*  with us. So in some sense, this kind of cosmological scenario is the ultimate ceremony of forgetting.
*  It is the ultimate way that the universe renews itself, rejuvenates itself by forcing us not to
*  stick around in a way that Teh Chang would be happy about. We can't impose our thoughts and
*  preferences and so forth on our far, far, far future life forms because they can't possibly know
*  about us. We have forgotten, they have forgotten us, we have forgotten whoever came before us,
*  and maybe this is the universe's way of saying that's how it should be. You shouldn't have the
*  baggage of an infinite past, nor should you be able to put constraints on the infinite future.
*  That's a good way for the universe to keep going forever while still maintaining some freshness
*  about the whole situation. That's the holiday message for this year. I hope that you had a good
*  2023. Nothing's happening next week for Mindscape, so we'll see you in January. Have a great holiday.
*  Take care.
