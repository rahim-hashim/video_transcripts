Human beings are small compared to the universe, but we're very important to ourselves. Humanism can be thought of as the idea that human beings are themselves the source of meaningfulness and mattering in our lives, rather than those being granted to us by some higher power. In today's episode, Sarah Bakewell discusses the origin and evolution of this dramatic idea. Humanism turns out to be a complex thing; there are religious humanists and atheistic anti-humanists. Her new book is Humanly Possible: 700 Years of Humanist Freethinking, Inquiry, and Hope.

Sarah Bakewell did postgraduate work in philosophy and artificial intelligence before becoming a full-time author. Among her previous books are How to Live: a life of Montaigne, and At the Existentialist Cafe. She has been awarded the National Book Critics Circle award in biography, as well as the Windham-Campbell Prize in non-fiction.

# Mindscape 231 | Sarah Bakewell on the History of Humanism
**Mindscape Podcast:** [March 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtGr-b8TVoE)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  Several years ago when I wrote my book, The Big Picture, its idea was to describe and
*  defend, articulate naturalism, right? The idea that the world is a fundamentally natural
*  thing, no supernatural aspects or anything like that. And it's a weird task because
*  you have to both say, well, here's what we have learned, here's what we know, but
*  also when it comes to the things we don't yet know, our best future understandings are
*  going to continue to be naturalistic. And so that's the case that I tried to make.
*  But as you might expect within naturalism, people disagree with each other about very
*  important things. So the particular line I took was that the universe, the physical world,
*  it just is. It exists, it obeys its rules, it has its stuff, it obeys the laws of physics
*  and so forth, but it doesn't judge you, it doesn't care, it doesn't evaluate you.
*  This is a moral anti-realist position. There is no set of rules out there given to us by
*  the universe that helps us differentiate between right and wrong, good and bad, things like
*  that. The universe in some sense doesn't care about us human beings. But that's not
*  a reason to be nihilistic or depressed or anything like that because we human beings
*  care about we human beings. So it's not that there is no such thing as right and wrong
*  or meaning to life or anything like that. It's just that those things are invented
*  by human beings, not handed to us either by the universe or by God or something outside
*  the universe. So this particular point of view, which again is not necessarily completely
*  accepted, there are people who disagree, fits in very well with the tradition not just
*  of naturalism but of humanism. Humanism in some sense, it's the very old tradition
*  of emphasizing human beings rather than the divine or something like that. It's not
*  necessarily atheistic. You can be religious and humanist, but there's a sort of natural
*  affinity if you don't believe in God for putting human beings at the center of what
*  does matter. You could also think that human beings are insignificant in the universe and
*  that would make you kind of non-humanist. But a humanist says as far as evaluating what
*  matters to human beings, where that evaluation comes from is also from human beings. So it's
*  a fascinating history because it is not how human beings were thinking thousands of years
*  ago. We were in large extent very supernaturalistic, right? Human beings 2,000 years ago were
*  pretty prone to thinking that human beings themselves were not the source of meaning
*  and mattering in the universe. That idea had to develop over the years through, at least
*  in the West, through the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and so forth. In the East around
*  the world, there was of course different paths that were taken and the history is always
*  fascinating because these ideas don't spring fully formed in their final form. They develop
*  over time. So today's guest is Sarah Bakewell who is a journalist, writer, scholar who thinks
*  about the history of these things. In fact, if you liked our recent previous talk on existentialism
*  with Sky Cleary, Sarah is the author of a book called The Existentialist Cafe which
*  you could check out. But her new book is called Humanly Possible, 700 Years of Humanist Freethinking,
*  Inquiry and Hope. So we talk about precisely this history of humanism going back to the
*  1300s in Europe. We touch a little bit about the ancient Greeks in India, China and so
*  forth but really her story starts in the 1300s with literary humanism, Petrarch, Boccaccio,
*  people like that, going up through a whole bunch of different strains of thought from
*  Shakespeare to Voltaire, Thomas Paine and so forth up to the current day, Zora Neale
*  Hurston, Bertrand Russell, people like that, science, Darwin, Huxley, how we should think
*  about our place in the universe if the idea of a place in the universe is something that
*  comes particularly from human beings. And where is the place for humanism right now?
*  Is it important? Has it become the default? Is it being overly ignored? Is there a vital
*  movement there? What do we do if we think that humanism is important? Or if we don't,
*  how do we combat it? That might be something some of you are thinking right now. But anyway,
*  the history one way or the other, no matter where you come down on these big issues, is
*  a fascinating one so let's go.
*  Sarah Bakewell, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thanks very much. It's lovely to be here.
*  So you've written a new book on the history of humanism. Why don't you tell us the title
*  of the book exactly?
*  It's Humanly Possible, the title, and the subtitle is 700 years of humanist freethinking,
*  inquiry and hope.
*  I like the theme of optimism that runs through the book as a characteristic feature of humanism.
*  But of course, this is one of those interviews where the first question to ask is just perfectly
*  obvious, namely, what do you mean, humanism? What is the definition of that? I can imagine
*  people disputing different possible definitions.
*  It's very much disputed and actually the first line of the book is what is humanism?
*  And I'm actually quoting, and this is quite a good way into talking about that, I think,
*  I'm quoting a comic novel by David Nobbs, who's a sort of English comic novelist best
*  known for The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin. But this was a book called Second from the
*  Last in the Sacrace where he was kind of drawing on his own experiences of being at school.
*  And he has this scene where in this imaginary school, some students decide to set up a
*  humanist society and they have their inaugural meeting. And of course, in the inaugural meeting,
*  this is the first question they ask, what is humanism? To which it immediately degenerates
*  into total chaos because they all have different ideas of what humanism is. So one of them
*  says it's the Renaissance's attempt to escape from medieval scholasticism and the church
*  and to go back to sort of literary studies and free thinking. And then another one says,
*  well no, doesn't it mean being kind and nice to people and bandaging animals and things?
*  And another one says, well that's not humanism. Humanism is trying to live without belief
*  in the supernatural and taking human life and human connections to each other as the
*  basis of our morality. And to which the other one responds, are you saying that it's not
*  good to bandage animals and look after people and things? And it just goes on. But the thing
*  is they've actually nailed all of the main definitions of humanism there. And my starting
*  point is rather than saying, well no, humanism is not that, it's this, I prefer to say, well
*  actually it's all of those things. And they are all brought together by the word human
*  that's at the centre of the word humanism. So you have, for example, one of the meanings
*  that is very familiar, especially in the English speaking world in general, is this idea of
*  living without the dogmas of religion and probably without religious faith.
*  Sure.
*  But at least without putting that centrally and very much foregrounding human relationships,
*  moral obligation to each other, a sense of community and things like that as the basis
*  of our morality. But of course there's this whole, I mean at the other extreme of quite
*  a range of meanings, it was used through much of history of this sort of Europe from really
*  late medieval times through what we, the early modern era or the Renaissance we might call
*  it, to mean people who specialised in, well the humanities, and we still call specialists
*  in the humanities humanists. They are the people who specialise in the human studies,
*  so that means literature, the arts, culture, history, the historical understanding of things,
*  a whole huge range of stuff to do with human culture. And again, that it just has the sense
*  of human at the centre of it. So I think there's a fantastic range and I really believe in,
*  at least for me in my book, in trying to be inclusive in all these definitions, to try
*  and take the broadest, most connective sense of humanism that I can. But there is still
*  a core, there's definitely a core at the heart of it and it's there in the word human.
*  So you're not here to tell us what the once and for all right definition is so much as
*  to be inclusive and ecumenical about the positive aspects of all these definitions?
*  I'm definitely looking for a rich sense. I think all these meanings of humanism can enrich
*  each other and really lead us to think about, well what is the idea of the distinctively
*  human, cultural or ethical realm, which I think all these kinds of humanism have in
*  common that they foreground that. So there's the physical world of course, there's the
*  world that is studied by science, there's the sort of physical reality of which we're
*  a part with and undeniably and there may or may not be, according to some people's beliefs,
*  purely spiritual realm, the realm of gods and the transcendent abstractions perhaps.
*  And then there's the realm of culture, language, you know, songs, dances, stories, the many
*  ways in which we respond to each other, educate each other, entertain each other, have moral
*  obligations to each other, the entire realm of culture. And humanists are definitely,
*  I think, united by a real interest in that realm in all kinds of ways. So yes, the only
*  connect is my motto, it's kind of I try to look for connections because I think that's,
*  well for me at least, I find that so interesting.
*  I think there's definitely been maybe a slight shift in the immediate connotation of the
*  word when we think about Renaissance humanists. It was more about thinking about human beings,
*  writing fiction and stories about them, centering the human experience. And maybe today there's
*  more of a secularism, atheism, agnosticism implication that comes along?
*  Well, really, what I'm trying to do is to draw the connections between some of those
*  things and in fact, you know, it's even more the sort of the earliest meaning of the word
*  in Italian, uministi, was literally just based on those who teach and study the human studies.
*  And what that meant actually was quite specific. It was things like grammar, eloquence, rhetoric.
*  It was drawing on the classical Greek and Roman sense of what you needed for public
*  life and to be a good person and passing that down the generations of the... So of course,
*  it's come a very long way since that meaning, but each step of those transformations, I
*  think, is connected. So for example, those people, although they were fascinated by the
*  humanities and by rhetoric, eloquence and all the rest of it, they were also fascinated
*  by the idea of moral revival on the basis of these ancient sources of finding a better
*  way to manage society, finding a better way for each of us to govern ourselves in our
*  relationships with our communities, with our world. So the moral meaning, the literary,
*  if you like, meaning and by extension, I think the secular meaning is there. Of course, they
*  were certainly not unbelievers, most of those people through most of European history because
*  that was very rare. I mean, to be an absolutely overt, outspoken, direct atheist was extremely
*  rare. There's a lot of debate about how rare it really was. But the emphasis was on the
*  human world, the way in which we manage society, as I say, all of those sort of political,
*  social and communicative skills, so literature, eloquence and things like that, not on theology,
*  which tended to be very much set apart. In fact, it was actually, people would say, well,
*  I just speak of human things and I leave divine things to theologians. So there was that separation
*  of realms even then.
*  I can relate one tiny relevant story here, which is that my wife, Jennifer Willett, is
*  a winner of the Humanists of the Year award from the American Humanist Association. And
*  when she got the notice, she said, maybe they mean you to me because I'm the more outspoken
*  atheist secularist. But I thought it was brilliant because her life's work has been devoted to
*  writing about science, but in a way that centers human beings and tells stories and relates
*  it to us. And I thought that was an ideal example of humanism in action. So I thought
*  that was a brilliant choice.
*  Absolutely. I mean, I think, and you know, that's great that she got that award. And
*  that sounds like a very, very good reason for giving it. I mean, although I imagine
*  the same thing could be said of you as well, that you could be a great science communicator,
*  science philosophy. I think I like to see that connection too, because as I say, on
*  the one hand, you've got the realm of theology and the realm of the human. But the other
*  great division in those kind of three parts is this idea of the realm of the physical
*  the realm of science. And I think sometimes we're encouraged to think that scientific
*  thought is entirely set apart from human feelings, human thought, human responses to the world,
*  ethics, values, all of that. And I mean, I don't think it is. I'm not a relativist when
*  it comes to science in the sense I don't feel like scientific method is somehow purely
*  subjective. I think that's, I really don't agree with that. But I think that our desire
*  to use scientific method to explore the world, to explore the nature of the universe is itself
*  very much a part of our humanity. What we are as human beings is deeply bound up with
*  our interest in science and our scientific instinct, if you like. So I love to see those
*  potential gulfs being bridged. And that's so yeah, brilliant.
*  I do want to get to the actual history here. But maybe maybe one more clarifying question
*  would be given all these wonderfully good aspects of humanism, as you've laid them out,
*  who would ever not be a humanist? Well, what does it mean to who's the who's the other
*  side? Who are the anti humanists both early and today?
*  They are anti humanists and always have been and it's equally hard to define what that
*  means too, because it does. I mean, it sounds like self evidently a bad thing. And it's
*  not it may not be because actually quite often those might be people who are reminding us
*  not to be too vain about ourselves not to be too carried away on saying humans are wonderful,
*  which is something I don't think humanists do usually say, but there have been some who
*  have expressed themselves in those terms, you know, humanism, how, how, what a piece
*  of work is man, you know, how, how excellent we are. Well, you know, anti humanists are
*  there to say, hang on a minute. Are you sure about that? And I think also they, they do
*  sort of remind us of the of the less rational parts that you know, we can't pride ourselves
*  on being too rational, too good at getting on with each other in society. Let's, you
*  know, remember that there are all these bad things that happen. And that we do. And so
*  I think there's a really useful sort of constant response and interrelationship between humanism
*  and anti humanism. I think they, they naturally tend to call each other up because as soon
*  as somebody says anything strongly humanistic or anti humanistic, it naturally calls up
*  a response. But this is all part of what we always do as human beings, which is thinking
*  about ourselves trying to figure out what kind of creatures we are and how we should
*  be living in this world. So yeah, definitely, I think you could never have one without the
*  other. And some humanists are more optimistic than others. Some are maybe naively so. And
*  this is something that, again, the anti humanists are there to remind us not to be naive. But,
*  but not all, you know, a lot of humanists have had a much more nuanced sense. And to
*  me, my great case of that, and we might be jumping ahead of any kind of chronological
*  sequence. But is Michel de Montaigne, who is, I've written a book about him before.
*  He's a great, somebody I find endlessly fascinating as a writer, 16th century essayist. He was
*  certainly a humanist in all kinds of ways. There's a literary, somebody who read deeply
*  in the literature of classical and contemporary authors who considered what he read, reinvented
*  it kind of for his world. And he was a humanist in that he was fascinated by human life, by
*  his own human character he wrote about all the time. But he is also, he wrote pages and
*  pages on how we shouldn't get up ourselves basically, because we do terrible, stupid
*  things all the time. And the other animals are much better at all kinds of things than
*  we are. And he draws on Plutarch, who assembled a great mass of stories of animals who build
*  better, birds build nests, they do a much better job of it than we ever do within our
*  buildings and things like that. So Montaigne is somebody who, to my mind, sums up that
*  those two, exactly that tension between humanism and anti-humanism, the tension between, he
*  is a humanist, but he's not always an optimistic one. And he gives a much more nuanced view.
*  And as you said, you know, especially back in those days, to be a humanist was not to be an
*  atheist in the way that we would recognise it right now. But you also mentioned that there
*  is a strain in religious thought, maybe not all religions or whatever, but there's a kind
*  of religious thought that is deeply anti-humanist, where they say the fundamental nature of humans
*  is to be fallen, is to be sinners, is to be falling short. And we need to look outside
*  humanity for salvation, right? I mean, am I correct in saying that that is more or less
*  unambiguously not what a humanist would want to say?
*  Yeah, I think that's pretty safe to say that's not a humanist view. And William James, who wrote
*  sort of great varieties of religious experience, analysing religion, lost a bit from a
*  psychological point of view, said that this, for him, this is the basic structure of
*  religion. First, it tells us that there's something wrong with us, deeply wrong with us,
*  then it tells us that this is the way to fix it. And it holds up the religious, well, dogma
*  or consolation, or whatever you want to call it, or appeal to a higher authority. I mean, I
*  may have made, I'm kind of unsure myself whether would it really be right to say that all
*  religion has that? I'm not sure that I would say that. But you can certainly find it in
*  Christianity, of course, if you go back to St. Augustine, he invented the concept of original
*  sin. And it's certainly there in original sin. I mean, that's what original sin is, even
*  newborn babies are born wrong, and need redemption from the Jesus Christ and, and from
*  God. I think that's, you know, it's religion is, that's such a blanket term, there is so much
*  going on in religion, there is a humanist strand in religion. A lot of people argue quite
*  strongly for that. Others argue that no, that's kind of, you know, you can't really see that
*  much humanism in religion. And it's a bit of an abuse of the term. I don't agree with either
*  extreme, you know, I think that religion tends towards a kind of more humanist strands when it
*  really focuses on human well being and life here on earth amongst each other, and what we can do
*  for each other, rather than this idea that there's something terribly wrong, and that the main
*  thing we have to do is pray to be redeemed from it.
*  Okay, good. With all of that background out of the way, thank you very much. You know, I'm sure I
*  don't know whether you want to elaborate, but I'm sure there were precursors to what we think of as
*  humanism in ancient Greece, in ancient China, or India, or elsewhere in the world. But arguably,
*  your story starts in the 1300s in Italy. And so how did it start? Why did it start? What were they
*  reacting against?
*  I kind of started it there because it has to start somewhere. And it is quite a traditional place to
*  start telling the story of humanism. And with good reason, because there was all sorts of what we
*  could certainly regard as humanist activity going on before that, well through the previous
*  centuries. But what really changes in the 1300s, among a small group of people is they start
*  explicitly thinking of themselves as recovering from some kind of dark age, a term which they
*  basically coin in order to renew the modern world by reaching back to the lost or half lost or not
*  quite lost writings of the ancients, meaning mostly Latin authors and also Greek authors, which
*  they had great difficulty in reading still because very few people could read Greek. But they
*  explicitly began... So I'm really talking about the sort of people that stand out in this story are
*  Petrarch, we always call him in English, Francesco Petrarch, who was born in Italy, and his family
*  were sort of refugees from Florence due to political upheaval there. They, he actually grew up
*  in Avignon or just near Avignon in France where they had to flee to. And he devoted his life to
*  literature, which he had to battle for a little bit because his father, who was basically a notary
*  expected his son to follow into the legal world. He didn't want to do that. He wanted to read and
*  write and collect books. And that's exactly what he managed to do all his life.
*  So some things never change.
*  I know.
*  Children not living up to the expectations of their parents is never going to go away.
*  Well, that's it. I mean, you can rebel by sort of going out and taking drugs or getting drunk or
*  something. Or you can rebel by going out and buying manuscripts of Cicero, which is what Petrarch
*  did. And he managed to make quite a good life for himself by really working for patrons, which was
*  sometimes involved with the church, sometimes just sort of, you know, private nobility, who really
*  funded his activities. So he got to spend his time collecting what he could find. And this meant
*  often going around monasteries, which did have fantastic collections of books, often including
*  secular works from the ancient world, or at least copied and handed down by generations of
*  copyists from the ancient world. And so Petrarch sort of collected these, studied them, edited them,
*  began all again, it's back to the humanities, all the things that we now associate with the humanities,
*  this close work on texts and then generally literary and moral study and political.
*  And the other one of that time that I do find a very sort of fascinating character is Giovanni
*  Boccaccio, who became a friend of Petrarch, slightly younger generation. And he too did the
*  same thing going around monasteries, digging up these manuscripts or, you know, sort of
*  blagging his way into getting hold of them, doing copies of them, sharing them with friends and with
*  Petrarch. It was kind of a bit of an industry, you know, it was tremendous energy that they put into
*  it. But as I say, they really saw themselves as starting a new beginning. And that makes them
*  quite a good point to start in looking at that story of humanism. But they were also
*  writers themselves. They weren't just collecting old manuscripts. So they were starting something.
*  Very much so. They wrote in almost every genre imaginable. I mean, Petrarch is remembered,
*  particularly for his sonnets in poetry, but he wrote other kinds of poetry and lots of prose.
*  And really my favourite writings of his were his letters to his friends, which he then at a certain
*  point in his life decided to collect and assemble into a volume and copy out and improve on a little
*  bit, quite a lot of polishing out went on. And then he made that into a sort of a collection,
*  which he then distributed among his friends for their enjoyment and interest, full of details of
*  his life, his world, his concerns. Some of the letters were addressed to the ancient authors
*  that he loved. So he'd write to them quite familiarly as if they were friends as well and
*  sort of tell them off a bit for doing things that they shouldn't have. And Bocacho also wrote a very
*  wide range of stuff. We remember him mainly for the Decameron, which is this hundred tales of a
*  tremendous range. Again, a lot of them are quite bawdy and just good fun, romps really, and others
*  are really quite serious and they're meant to be taken as moral lessons. So he's showing off the
*  range of what he can do. And so what made those two figures and their contemporaries specifically
*  humanist in your view? Well, it is the way that they saw themselves as recovering the past. And
*  through these manuscripts, this manuscript hunting, this reading of the ancient authors,
*  recovering the past and then reinventing it, reinvigorating it for a new generation. So there
*  was certainly that sense of hope in the future. Not much hope in their present. It was very
*  difficult too, because they lived in a very difficult time. The 14th century was really a
*  terrible time in much of Europe, not least because the plague spread through all those areas in the
*  middle of their lives. And it was devastating, absolutely devastating to people's sense of
*  security in life as well as just literally devastating to many cities and populations.
*  So tough times, but they saw themselves as using the power of literature, the power of
*  these ancient arts of good government and good speaking, good writing, beautiful
*  eloquence in writing and speech, using those as a way of renewing human life.
*  It's interesting that you mentioned the plague, because it obviously was on everyone's mind at
*  the time. And whenever we talk about grand historical shifts in how people think and talk
*  and what have you, I'm fascinated by, do the ideas themselves lead to these shifts, or are
*  there external factors that nudge them along? In the case of the 1300s, on the one hand,
*  it's the end of the dark ages, the beginning of the Renaissance. At the other hand, it's the end
*  of the Islamic golden age in a world where the Islamic world was tightly interacting with the
*  European world at the time. So do you give credit mostly to the thinkers and their ideas here,
*  or were there external conditions that help explain why it was then and there?
*  I think it's tremendously complex. And I also think that the point that you're making is also
*  absolutely essential as a reminder that this whole idea of the being a dark ages or some sort of,
*  you know, terrible time before the Renaissance brought light to anything is a very Eurocentric
*  idea, because it only makes sense from the point of view of mainly of Western Europe.
*  So, and in fact, you know, it's not an idea that really stands up to a lot of scrutiny,
*  as is always the case with these pretty sweeping characterisations of particular
*  eras as being one thing or another, because they're always vastly more complex in the
*  chain of cause and effect, the relationships of different cultures to each other,
*  cross fertilisation of cultures. All of this was going on and was very, there's definitely
*  one simple story. You know, you don't, I mean, in a way, I sort of take Petra,
*  Pimbo, Caccio in their own sense of themselves, but not uncritically, you know, I think that
*  we can look at them under all sorts of different lights and see a whole
*  load of factors that went into what made up their world.
*  It does seem that one little bit of technology was absolutely crucial was simply books, right? I mean,
*  we had books for a long time, but the idea of sharing texts back and forth was, you know,
*  it wasn't their version of social media, but it did, it was absolutely necessary to make these
*  shifts happen. Even more specifically, a crucial thing was the arrival of paper technology in
*  Europe. They'd had it, of course, in China for much longer. Before that, they had to use
*  parchment made from, you know, calf skin and the skin of other animals, tremendously expensive
*  and labour intensive to manufacture. I mean, you could hardly call it manufacture,
*  it was a terribly painstaking process. And, of course, that material was so valuable that
*  quite often in order to have a fresh bit of parchment for writing or copying some new text
*  in the monasteries and their scriptoria, they would scrub off an old piece of writing in order
*  to get themselves a piece of parchment that they could reuse. And that process certainly contributed
*  to our loss of quite a few texts, especially if they felt that they wanted to write something
*  sacred and that it was better to scrub off an old bit of something from the classical world,
*  pre-Christian, which didn't mention, you know, it wasn't in line with it. I think that can be
*  exaggerated in the sense of, yeah, these monasteries did also actually preserve those
*  pre-Christian texts and often did a very good job of it. But, you know, definitely, yeah, there was
*  an element of, we desperately need parchment, which of these precious things are we going to erase?
*  In order to have it. So paper was, of course, paper was brilliant. It was much, much
*  cheaper and more readily available. And when these first stirrings of humanism arose,
*  we're in a very deeply religious culture at the time. Was there backlash or did people even
*  realize that, oh, this was going to go bad places in terms of the established religious hierarchy?
*  Almost never, because usually it wasn't really any kind of direct challenge to Christianity at
*  all. I mean, it was taking place. A lot of these people worked for the church. They were part of
*  especially in Rome, but also elsewhere. They often were associated in some way. They often had taken
*  orders in one way, though, because the church was such a centre of intellectual activity. There
*  wasn't really much choice, but they probably, you know, you don't get the sense that they did
*  it particularly reluctantly. I mean, it just wasn't there. But there are some exceptions
*  where people did write things which antagonised the church greatly or challenged the church's
*  claim to authority. And one of my favourite of the humanists, this is into the 15th century now,
*  so it's later than Petro and Boca, was Lorenzo Valla, who wrote a fantastic total takedown
*  of this bogus document that was called the Donation of Constantine, which supposedly
*  recorded this moment when the Emperor Constantine signed a document bequeathing to the Pope and all
*  their successors control over the whole of the Western Empire, really, Italy and all sorts of
*  other lands all over Western Europe. And in fact, it was a total fabrication. It had been, you know,
*  put together years after it was supposed to be. And Valla used these humanistic skills to expose
*  the fraud. He particularly used, he was a philologist, so he was an expert in the Latin
*  and also Greek. His Greek was very good. But he used his knowledge of Latin, not just as a timeless
*  thing, but Latin as a language that had evolved and been used differently in later medieval times
*  from the way that it had been used in early medieval times in the fourth century when it
*  was supposedly written, to point out that it couldn't possibly have been written then,
*  because the words that were used just weren't used at that time. And there were all sorts of clues in
*  text which he pointed out saying, well, this document is not what it's claimed to be. And that
*  therefore, of course, was a big challenge to the church's claim over all the territory that it said
*  it had been basically bequeathed forever. So I mean, in some sense, can we look at that as
*  almost a precursor to science and as sort of a new way of thinking in the sense that it's not
*  pure logic or rationalism in the old sense, nor is it revelation or anything like that. It's
*  looking at the evidence, comparing different hypotheses and seeing where it takes you.
*  Yeah, it's definitely using those tools. And it's kind of using, but it's using literary tools. So
*  it's using knowledge of language, cultural tools, more than study of the natural worlds. But
*  certainly, it's using them in a way that points out contradictions. It points out, I think that,
*  I mean, of course, medieval, scholastic intellectuals did, they did point out
*  contradictions, they did have a very good knowledge of language. What's new is this sense of
*  a historical way of looking at what has come down to us. So thinking historically, thinking
*  this text has come from somewhere. And what has gone into it? How was it made? Who made it? And why?
*  And we're seeing really the beginning, almost less of science, I'd say we're seeing the real
*  beginning of history of historians in the modern sense. And certainly of that kind of critical
*  history, that history that investigates the evidence and foregrounds the evidence and then
*  asks, well, what is the hypothesis here? What's likely? What's not likely?
*  I'm very happy to count history as a subset of science. So that's a battle with me. But it also
*  points to another kind of big deal at that time. You've already mentioned books and paper, but also
*  education reform, right? Different ways of organizing the curriculum and different ways
*  of teaching things. The birth of the university may be part of this whole story.
*  Yeah, again, that sort of goes back to an earlier era, that's for sure. The university, but,
*  and also, of course, very much drew on the Arabic world. That was really where that began.
*  But what's new again in the education is this idea of being educated for the good life,
*  being educated for to be a good human being, to be a fully realized human being, and somebody who's
*  able to take up their place in society, because of course, it was mostly the elite and almost
*  entirely men who were being educated in this way. And they were being educated to become wise
*  princes and heads of whatever it was that they were going to be called on to do. So perhaps working
*  in the city administration. It's actually very similar to the training of the civil service
*  people that went on in much earlier time in China, which is a lot of Confucian writing,
*  is very much focused on how do you learn. It's not just about learning the various rules and
*  how to use the bureaucratic documents. And although that was a large part of their training
*  went on for years and years and years, it's about how do you become a good person? Because if you're
*  a good ruler, other people, the people below you in the community will want to emulate you,
*  and they'll become better, and everybody will be better off. And cultivating humanity, they have
*  this word Rin, which means humanity, conscience, being a good person. There's a huge range of
*  meanings in that word. And really the same thing can be found in lots of the writings of the
*  humanists of the Renaissance. And they in turn are drawing on the writings of the Roman world,
*  which also stressed, and the Greeks as well, who also stressed virtue, being a good person. So this
*  becomes at the center of education, public life, and humanity, human virtue. At the risk of maybe
*  being parochial and too much caught up in my own time, is there a worry that we're losing
*  that conception of education, that modern universities and high schools for that matter
*  are focused on giving technical skills to students and less focused on turning them into good human
*  beings? Well, definitely where we start to see that concern absolutely being expressed all over
*  the places in the 19th century, and even actually the late 18th century, you start getting philosophers
*  of education and public commentators of all sorts saying, we're just teaching skills,
*  we're just teaching people, training them for jobs and careers, maybe, but it's in a very fragmented
*  way. What we're not doing is training people to be whole human beings. They're fascinated by
*  wholeness in that time, like complete fulfillment, development, wholeness as a human being. That's
*  what education should be doing primarily. And also doing it, it meant a fair bit of freedom that
*  students should, it should come from within them. They shouldn't just be drummed in with skills and
*  skill sets and bits of knowledge. They should be encouraged. The job of an educator is to,
*  literally the meaning of educate is to draw out, to lead out what's in the student,
*  what's in the person as they develop. It's, which is like sort of, actually, funnily enough,
*  in Italian, it's that same meaning, which means to lead and you're sort of leading out, so you're
*  leading out what's in the student. So that, I knew concern about fragmentary education or education
*  that is simply skills-based, simply education for a purpose of churning out people who can do
*  whatever's required of them in society, rather than encouraging people as they grow up to develop
*  into fully realized human beings, fully integrated human beings, rich, with a rich interior life as
*  well and able to play a really valuable role in society. That became the new ideal. And I think
*  that was drawing on the ideas of the earlier humanists. So there's a real chain of inspiration
*  going between those different centuries. We're definitely still talking about the same issues
*  today, absolutely. And as always, there's no real right answer because, I mean, there are
*  criticisms that could be made of this renaissance ideal of the humanistic education, because for
*  starters, it was definitely for an elite who were expected to govern. Well, I mean, you know, we
*  actually see quite, that is still going on in the modern world. I mean, there's this sort of,
*  there's a kind of Oxford University path that is a bit infamous here in the UK, because it's,
*  this is where so many in the government and often perhaps people who are sort of maintaining,
*  they have those skills, they have a certain polish, they can sling around Latin quotations.
*  But do they, how much they really know about the struggles of ordinary people. So there's still
*  that tension, still that debate that's going through to do with elitism, to do with the question
*  of elitism. And related to that is, again, going back to that renaissance education,
*  very few women got it. There were a few. Queen Elizabeth I was a prime example of that.
*  She's pretty good. Yeah, she got a great education. She also, you know, was kind of insisted on it
*  herself, I think, but she did get a good education. Now that was actually largely because she was
*  destined to govern. She was expected to govern. So she needed that training in how to do it.
*  So yeah, I think this is didn't have that at all, because they were not expected to have any kind
*  of public life. They were expected to live a purely private life in the family. This is in
*  danger of being a whole other podcast topic, but it's so fascinating to me. I don't want to let it
*  go quite yet. I mean, as you're pointing out the ideal of a humanistic education, a full one,
*  a broad one. It's very interesting, because I never really, never really dwelled on the fact that it
*  was meant for prospective leaders, right? It was obviously for an elite, it was for a tiny number
*  of people, and in particular, the ones who were going to be leaders. And so that was the justification
*  for why you would have this broad education. And today we have more of an ideal of universal
*  education. And we put less emphasis on the broadly humanistic aspects of it. But so maybe there's a
*  gap there that remains to be filled where people make the strong argument for why every person
*  deserves a broad humanistic education. Yeah. And also another thing I'd add to that is that
*  it didn't really include anything that we would call science. It didn't include it, arguably,
*  and I think this has been argued, they got a more kind of scientific education in,
*  under medieval scholasticism than they did under the humanistic ideal, because that was very focused
*  on good government, good literary skills, and all the rest of it. There really wasn't much science
*  at all. Of course, science, as we know it now, didn't exist yet. But yeah, there wasn't what we
*  would now call science really, just was pretty absent. And it was in the 19th century again,
*  where educators started to say, well, maybe it's more useful, the most important thing is to give
*  everybody a good grounding in scientific thought. And that means not just the actual, you know,
*  knowledge of science, but how to think scientifically, how to ask questions
*  scientifically, how to test hypotheses, how to, you know, those are great thinking skills.
*  And some of them reacted against that humanistic education by saying, well, it's just to,
*  I mean, what's the point of learning Latin and ancient Greek when you could be learning
*  about the physical world that's all around us? And of course, I mean, I think as always,
*  I'm inclined to say, well, why can't we have it all? Yeah, there's room for both here.
*  Okay, sorry for that digression, but I do think it's important. But let's, since we're trying to
*  squeeze many centuries of human development into a tiny amount of time, take us from the Renaissance
*  to the Enlightenment, which when I was a kid, I always used to think that they were the same
*  thing, but they're clearly very, very different things. But the humanist strand continues through
*  there. It does. And there's a whole kind of meandering. I mean, there's a, there are periods
*  between those two, which are very interesting as well. But I do think it's, I do quite sort of
*  think jumping to the Enlightenment is not a bad idea, because that's when you start to see,
*  certainly you start to see the rise of scientific thinking. So we're talking 18th century,
*  there's a kind of long enlightenment that's that sometimes is traced back to the 17th century.
*  And various philosophers and scientists, of course, very much that were beginning to,
*  you know, revolutionize science in that era. But the height of it was the 18th century. And
*  one strand is using reason, using scientific method, being having a great belief in the power
*  of that. But the thing that I think is specifically humanistic about that is that it's having a belief
*  in the power of that to improve human lives, to improve human well-being, and the fact that they
*  wanted to foreground that question of human well-being. So one of the figures that leaps out
*  in that is Voltaire, a great figure of the Enlightenment, who really believed that
*  we should do everything that we can to instead of sort of trying to find ways of justifying
*  by reference to some divine principle, the fact of human suffering, we should actually do what
*  we can to, of course, you can never banish human suffering at all, but to reduce it and to
*  minimize it, to make it a little bit less widespread than it is, or to provide ways of sort of,
*  well, yeah, just making the bee less suffering. He was very famously very shocked by the
*  earthquake. This is sort of the earthquake in Lisbon of 1755, which shocked a lot of people
*  around Europe physically, of course. But I mean, it actually was felt as far afield as like Sweden
*  and Scotland, they could feel this earthquake from Portugal. Of course, the destruction in Lisbon
*  and around it was absolutely horrific. And so many people died either instantly or because of
*  the fires and just civic breakdown that followed. Voltaire wrote several things, most famously
*  Condéed, his little, it's a sort of fable, but he also wrote a poem about it. And he wrote
*  entries in his philosophical dictionary about this question of when terrible things happen.
*  And he took aim at this justification that was put forward by the philosopher Leibniz, but,
*  you know, it was sort of cited by, in other contexts as well, this idea that, well, it's
*  often quoted as always for the best in the best of all possible worlds. The idea behind it was that,
*  well, clearly God, he could have made there not be an earthquake. He didn't. But since God is
*  benevolent, and since, you know, I'm sure he would have stopped it if he could. Clearly he can't,
*  clearly there's some very good reason that only God knows about, which means that a world in which
*  that earthquake didn't happen would be somehow worse. And far be it from us as mere human beings
*  to dispute that, you know, clearly something's going on that's far above us and we couldn't
*  possibly understand. So it's this justifying the ways of God to man. It's this referring of,
*  we just have to accept, we just have to refer it upwards. Well, I mean, Voltaire was very annoyed
*  by that attitude because he said, well, whether that's true or not, first of all, we've got a
*  perfect right to bewail our fate and complain and gnash our teeth at the sufferings that we
*  undergo in life. And secondly, why not actually do something practical to make it just less likely
*  to happen, less destructive when these things happen? We can't stop earthquakes. But as we've
*  improved on vastly since then, there's a lot that can be done to build to a higher quality
*  so that buildings don't fall down so much, to provide better civic management, actually,
*  which is vital, of course, in the aftermath of disaster. And since long after Voltaire,
*  we've sort of developed a certain ability to see earthquakes coming. As we know, none of this works
*  always. Still, horror, absolute horrors happen. But it was later called Meliorism. This actually
*  wasn't a term of Voltaire's or anything. Apparently, the novelist George Eliot was
*  the first or possibly the second actually to be quoted as using this term. It just means
*  we can make things a bit better. We can't make a perfect world. We can't solve everything. We
*  can use our ingenuity, our technology, our political skills, our management of situations,
*  our ability to predict things. We can use those to make things a little bit better. And I think
*  that idea is, to me, it's the humanist idea at the heart of a lot of what happened in the Enlightenment.
*  So the Enlightenment's often been seen largely in terms of people adulating the idea of reason
*  and being besotted by the idea that we can be reasonable. But I think a lot of Enlightenment
*  thinkers actually were just saying, let's just try to be more reasonable than we currently are,
*  because it improves human life if we do. I like the idea that plagues and earthquakes
*  play such a large role in the flourishing of humanism throughout history. But yeah,
*  so it's supposed to be such a cheerful philosophy. It's supposed to be. It's just a chapter of
*  disasters. But it actually makes sense upon reflection because I would take part of humanism
*  to sort of, like you just said, accept the responsibility of trying to make things better.
*  You know, an anti-humanist or non-humanist philosophy can kind of offload that to, if not
*  explicitly God, to destiny, to providence, to fate, or whatever it is. Whereas a humanist has got to
*  say, well, look, there's randomness, but we still have to do the best we can in the face of that.
*  That's absolutely right. That idea of responsibility, taking responsibility for
*  ourselves collectively and individually. I mean, you know, there are disasters. There'll always be
*  disasters, but it's really up to us to try and respond to these in a way that's as helpful as
*  possible. You can sort of start to see the connection with the worldview that doesn't put
*  divine order at the center of things. The worldview that starts to put human, not only well-being,
*  but also actually human decision-making, human action and responsible choices at the heart of
*  things instead from our point of view. The realm in which some sort of divine battle between God
*  or Satan, for example, might be going on is like, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. It really
*  doesn't have much to do with us on a day-to-day basis. We have to think about ways to build
*  better buildings so they don't fall down, so on and so. Yeah.
*  This was the period when you said earlier about the Renaissance humanists. None of them were
*  loudly, explicitly atheists, but now in the 18th century, we begin to get some loud, explicit
*  atheists. Voltaire was not one, as far as I can tell. That's right. You give a lot of prominence
*  to David Hume, one of my favorite philosophers. He was, yeah. Yeah, you refer to him as merciless,
*  but there's an anecdote, I'm not sure if it's true or not, of Hume visiting the salons of Paris
*  and saying something like, none of us here is explicitly atheist and all of his hosts are like,
*  no, we all are, except for you. Well, how did that transition happen?
*  There was a philosophy that came to be called Deism, which provided a very good cover for
*  any atheist who wanted cover because it basically said exactly that, that there probably is a God
*  we're not saying there's not a God, you know, there's the deity, but he just, he or it or
*  whatever doesn't enter into everyday human life. There's no direct, everything in the actual world
*  and in our lives goes on separately from that. And so of course, if you're an atheist, but you
*  don't want to say so, because being explicitly atheist was quite dangerous still, it really was
*  very dangerous. So it could get you into all sorts of trouble if you directly challenge the idea of
*  the being a God at all. But you could just set that aside and then go on to talk about human life as
*  if God and everything connected with that sort of transcendent realm was completely irrelevant.
*  Of course, I don't think that all of the people that we think of as daists were simply using it
*  as a cover. The problem is that we just can't really know, it's terribly difficult to know,
*  because obviously, if they didn't record that in their writings, then, you know, they're not
*  going to write down on a piece of paper, well, I'm pretending to be a daist, but really, I'm an atheist,
*  or very, very rarely. But there is some where we do have a pretty good inkling. I mean,
*  another great enlightenment philosopher and thinker, Didger, Denis Didger was probably,
*  I mean, gives quite a lot of sign of probably being an atheist. He had to bury or leave
*  unpublished a lot of his writings where that was suggested. And as I say, David Hume, who,
*  you know, did make it about as explicit as he could. But even then, not entirely. But, you know,
*  he was known in, he lived in Edinburgh, and he was known as the great infidel and the great atheist.
*  So he had a reputation. But there was, nevertheless, a looming blind spot, which, of course,
*  you're going to talk about, which is that even the people who would have identified as humanists
*  would narrowly define humanity, the part of humanity that deserves the right and respect,
*  the rights and respect that everyone should get, white, male, certain age, certain proclivities,
*  etc. And, you know, it took people who were not in those categories to raise their hand and say,
*  wait a minute, you know, we're human beings, too. That's an important story in the history
*  of humanism. Absolutely. Yeah. And that is, I mean, the Enlightenment is particularly
*  ambiguous in that regard, because some of the apparently most critically minded and rational,
*  and, you know, sort of you would expect better of them, frankly, Enlightenment thinkers,
*  were perfectly capable of saying that, of course, this didn't apply to, and then there's a whole
*  list of, you know, sort of colonised peoples or people of African origin or anybody, basically,
*  who wasn't of European origin. And, of course, women are the great, just half the human race
*  is absolutely left out of it for much of it. But what you begin to see is people who are,
*  take black women, for example, starting to say, well, there's us, okay, you know, we're human,
*  too. But often they use, and where I find it particularly interesting is where they use the,
*  some of the tools of humanistic thought or Enlightenment thought precisely to think critically
*  about the received idea that women don't really count and to start to investigate that and to
*  query it. And they do it on the basis of a lot of humanistic philosophy. So somebody like Mary
*  Wollstonecraft, author of Indication of the Rights of Women in the late 18th century,
*  used the kind of the same critical thinking about, you know, how did things come to be this way that,
*  for example, I was talking about Lorenzo Valla, who used the sort of historical thought, and she
*  does the same. It's like, well, if you might think that women seem a bit vapid, and they are
*  uneducated, and they lack confidence. Well, think about why are they uneducated? It's because you
*  haven't given them an education. You know, why do they lack confidence? It's because they're
*  constantly told that they should be modest and retiring and that they shouldn't express their
*  opinions. And so it's starting to think in a kind of genealogical way or a historical way about,
*  you know, why is this? So there's that. And another humanistic strand, I think, is
*  starting to appeal to an idea of the being something, a kind of, I mean, the phrase of
*  dignity is often used in the context of the dignity of human rights or the dignity of
*  human essence somehow, that we all, all of us have an essential dignity and essential humanity, which
*  for all, however diverse many aspects of our lives are, there's also something that we all
*  share, which is our humanity, and nobody should be seen as having any less of that than anybody else.
*  And so then you sort of start to see this argument coming, which will end with things like the
*  Declaration of Human Rights, where that's a central idea in the mid-20th century. But it's
*  feminists and all kinds of other voices are starting to come in and say,
*  there is an essential humanity. So you can't, Mary Wollstonecraft says, you can't talk about
*  the being particularly female virtues, for example, and male, and then not even male virtues,
*  but kind of human virtues. So there's human virtues. And then there's the particular ones
*  that women are supposed to have, which just happen to be all very negative. So it's all like
*  modesty, sort of silence, not talking too much, I'll rest. But there are, she says, it's not,
*  we all have or should have human virtues. We should all be educated to have human,
*  where if you're human beings, your virtues are human virtues. And the total sum of the virtues of
*  humanity include the traditional female ones and the traditional male ones. So it's, these are all
*  very humanistic concerns. Humanists had always been very interested in the question of what makes
*  a good human being, what is it to be virtuous, what's needed in the public realm in terms of
*  training people to be good, training people to be completely, to be knowledgeable, to be eloquent,
*  to be able to take part in decision making in society. All of these things are starting to be
*  brought up in the context of not being exclusive. So there's less and less of the idea of the human
*  as something exclusive and more inclusive. It's certainly not a straightforward story,
*  because there's a tremendous amount of backwards and forwards. There's confusions, there's
*  inconsistencies. You get somebody might be very good at arguing for women, but actually hopeless
*  on questions of race. And so it's a tremendously complicated process.
*  And it's not just like one smooth progress, that's for sure. But what is being seen is a great
*  diversifying of the whole humanist picture, which is still going on today, because we're still,
*  of course, this is a never ending dole. There's no point where you can say, well, we've arrived,
*  we've sorted out the whole problem list. But exclusion, I mean, of course not.
*  One of the stories in your book that I really liked, which is not quite contemporary, but
*  I think anything that happens after I'm born is the modern world. So Mary Whitehouse was a
*  conservative British activist, and she argued against what she called the humanist gay lobby.
*  And as you point out, there wasn't any humanist gay lobby. But once she started complaining about
*  it, a bunch of people got together and started one because that sounded like a really good idea.
*  Exactly. Yes. And it's now affiliated with that. The organization is now affiliated with
*  Humanist UK. And I was told that they took the slogan, born of Mary, because they were born out
*  of this case that was brought against the magazine Gay News by Mary Whitehouse.
*  And that was in the 60s? 70s?
*  No, no, it was, yes, hang on. It was, I'm trying to remember, actually, I've forgotten. No,
*  it was the 70s. I think it was 73 or something. Yeah. It's early 70s.
*  Living memory anyway.
*  Early 70s.
*  So, I mean, yeah, again, we're still trying to compress a lot of human history here. So we've
*  become enlightened, we've liberated different parts of the world, different segments of humanity.
*  In some sense, if you would just tell the story of the 20th century, the political story,
*  there's these wars and both the World Wars and the Cold War. Can we think of fascism,
*  Nazism, Stalinism, in some sense, as fundamentally anti-humanist movements, but in a kind of a
*  different way because they're sort of valorizing the state or the system rather than the individual
*  human being? Yeah, well, I think that's absolutely right. That's exactly what makes them anti-humanist
*  because it has the same structure in a way. There's something wrong with, like deeply wrong,
*  not just details that are wrong. There's something profoundly out of kilter about
*  human life as we find it. What's needed is a strong, authoritative other thing. And that thing
*  might be in communism, of course, it's the Marxist dialectic, the dictatorship of the proletariat.
*  It's an abstraction. It's a theory that's going to revolutionize human life and make us into these
*  shining light of the post-revolutionary world where everybody is fulfilled and nobody is alienated
*  anymore. And of course, the reality turns out to be quite the opposite of that inevitably because
*  it's imposing an abstract idea. It's imposing the state again. The state is what guarantees
*  are with that. So the state is being set up as having an absolute authority over individual
*  choices. I mean, if you're part of a revolutionary state, you can't just live your little individual
*  choices. That can't be tolerated because everything must be subordinated to this goal. And of course,
*  in Nazism, what you've got and fascism of all kinds, you've got the nation playing that role.
*  You've got national destiny. Plus you've got the figure of the dictator. So you've got Mussolini,
*  we've got Hitler playing that absolute role. Individual freedom, individual choices, individual
*  responsibility, the kind of humanist basis for morality that relies on our fellow feeling,
*  our empathy or our sense of responsibility to other people. All of that goes because it's all
*  to be subordinated to the needs of the state. Profoundly anti-humanistic, I think, those
*  movements. So how, I guess we didn't say this explicitly, how crucial is the idea of individualism
*  to humanism? I mean, I could imagine claiming that I'm a humanist, but being a humanist who
*  puts front and center some group of human beings rather than individual human beings.
*  CK Yeah, individualism is a problematic concept because it can also be associated with this
*  idea of individual self-assertion, the justification of, I mean, I think sort of Ayn Rand
*  and idea that an individual, or a kind of Nietzschean Superman, Ubermensch, that can
*  just assert themselves and have everything they want. So it's a kind of neoliberalism
*  in the market idea that this basically might is right. Well, definitely that kind of individualism
*  would not be particularly humanistic, I think. And individualism in itself is a very, when you
*  sort of go back through the centuries in history, it becomes very hard to talk about individualism.
*  It's a very modern concept that doesn't always make a lot of sense when you're talking about
*  different historical times. When does it really arise? I think it's a sort of concept of the
*  individual is, well, it becomes a very 19th century concept. And liberal philosophy,
*  there are several liberal thinkers who were deeply humanistic because they did
*  think about the individual, but they also thought about it in the context of
*  having a sort of the well-being of all at heart. So it's, if individual people are,
*  basically the state steps out of their lives as much as is possible, except to prevent them harming
*  each other. So to prevent abuses, that's the role of the state is to prevent anybody's freedom being
*  brutally curtailed by somebody else's. But within that, basically people should be able to develop
*  as they want to by having, running their personal lives the way that they want to, as long as they
*  don't harm anybody else. You know, this is the central idea, I think, of liberalism, which is
*  very humanistic. So, I mean, to say that all humanism is individualistic, I think is not,
*  is just not quite right, because it's kind of, it blurs some of the historical developments,
*  and it also gets dangerously mixed up with this rather arrogant idea of the individual as being
*  able to do whatever they like, which is totally inconsistent with the humanist idea that we
*  are basically sort of morally responsible to each other, that we have a responsibility to
*  the people that we live among, and not only people, but also to other animals, to the rest of the
*  natural world, to the very foundations of life. So, yeah, it's complicated, as with so many things,
*  it ends up being, it's complicated, is the answer. It is complicated, but I think that,
*  I think you put your figure on something that does make sense to me, the idea that what we think of
*  is classical liberalism emphasizes the individual and their rights and their flourishing, whereas
*  the humanist tradition has individuals as very important, but cares a lot about helping other
*  individuals. I mean, you mentioned the M. Forrester quote of only connect, you know,
*  it's individuals matter, but not in the sense that they matter individually, but as you know,
*  the object of our care. Well, really, if I had to say what is my favorite quote from the,
*  well, I tell you what, actually, favorite two quotes, I think, from the whole of humanist thought,
*  one is from Terence, the Afro-Roman playwright of the ancient world, who said a very famous line of,
*  I am human, I consider nothing human alien to me, we're all connected. The other one that I was
*  originally going to say was from the 19th century, free thinker, Robert G. Ingersoll, apparently,
*  it was pronounced Ingersoll, not Ingersoll, because his enemies used to call him In-ger-soll,
*  because he was injuring people's souls, apparently, by going around preaching a
*  secularist free thinking message, preaching, that's not the right word there. And he came
*  up with what he called the happiness credo, it was his belief about how to be happy. And he said,
*  the time to be happy is now, the place to be happy is here. He starts it happiness is the only good,
*  the time to be happy is now, the place to be happy is here. And the way to be happy is to make
*  others so. Can't leave out that last line. Yeah, exactly. It all goes together. Happiness is for
*  this world, not for some imagined paradise beyond. It's the here and now. But it's, yeah, the path
*  to happiness lies through being connected to each other and loving human being alien to us.
*  So let's just leap up to the present day. Now, we're in a situation where, okay, we've in some
*  sense, won the battles against fascism and Stalinism and so forth. I hope so. Maybe.
*  But I'm not sure. Yeah, I know. I know. I should, even as I spoke those words, I was
*  bringing them back. But there's a different frontier. People now talk about transhumanism
*  and post-humanism. There's a technological frontier uploading ourselves into the matrix,
*  frolicking in virtual reality. Do you see these technological advances as
*  tools to further the humanist cause or potential challenges to them?
*  I think that at the moment, it's of course, it's all very theoretical at the moment. I mean,
*  we're dealing with the arrival, the imminence and arrival in many ways of artificial intelligence,
*  things that are not human, but have some kind of intelligence. This is something we're going to
*  have to wrestle with for sure in relation to what it is to be a human being and what humans need
*  as opposed to what machines might need. But this sort of wilder shores of transhumanism,
*  the idea that we will merge with machine intelligence or with a kind of abstract
*  spiritual or intellectual mentalism in the universe, not need bodies anymore.
*  I find it kind of fun and fascinating as an idea, but I think that it misses so much about what it
*  is to be human. And this is where humanism is there to remind us that being human, of course,
*  it's a bodily thing, but it's also we're connected to our societies that we grow up in,
*  the people that we know, the people that we live among, and to all the details of our cultural
*  lives as the whole planet. We have this tremendous cultural inheritance from each other,
*  from all the things that have happened in the past, books that people have written, the art,
*  music, everything else. That is this tremendous humanistic realm of human culture.
*  Just the details of our everyday lives, all of that. I mean, it's as if this transhumanist
*  idea treats all of that as being something that could just be cast aside. And then there would be
*  a pure human essence of some sort that could just float about in a purely mental realm
*  as an abstraction. And I think that there's something that is really sad about that,
*  I now feel. I used to feel, but that was quite exciting when I used to read science fiction.
*  I still do read science fiction. I love it. But that particular idea is to seem like, wow,
*  cosmic, transcendent. Who wouldn't want to be? Have a mind that's basically almost identical
*  with the whole universe. And now I think, well, yeah, but what about all the things I love? What
*  about reading Petrarch's letters? What about looking at artworks? What about just having a
*  cup of tea with my wife or patting the dog? And all of that, the texture of life, the intertwined
*  nature of our reality with each other and with the particulars of the planet that we live on,
*  is sort of treated as dispensable. And I think that there's something, you're kind of talking
*  again about something rather similar to this idea that all of the detail of this life is something
*  in the old kind of idea of the religious, the totally dedicated religious life would be that
*  you set aside all of that as, you know, don't enjoy it. Don't enjoy eating, drinking, listening
*  to music or whatever it may be, because you should always just be thinking about the paradise
*  that lies beyond. And you see a very similar structure really in some of this transhumanist
*  dream that it's all of that detail doesn't matter. There's going to be something better.
*  And that's not humanist.
*  Yeah, I'm extremely sympathetic here. And, you know, to wind things up, maybe I don't even have
*  a question, but let me just say some things that what you just said sparks in my brain. And you
*  can respond to it. Because, you know, to be more specific, you mentioned the science fictional
*  ways of thinking you mentioned in the book, particularly Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End,
*  where the human beings are visited by aliens, and ultimately, they all sort of transcend into this
*  higher realm. And it's not that different than a lot of ideas about joining the matrix and,
*  you know, being free of our bodily wants. And it's not that different from classical views of heaven,
*  where we get a reward in there's words about eternity and infinity and things like that.
*  And what I feel about these is that they really neglect the crucial central point about being
*  human, which is our finitude and the struggles, the embodiment that we have in the world,
*  and just the need to be fed and to walk and to touch and to be sad sometimes. And I struggle
*  myself because I want to be open to new things and better things. And I don't know what they
*  would be like. But I do feel like like you just said that some of this narrative is just glossing
*  over what makes us us and it wouldn't be as good as people are imagining.
*  I mean, it would be good in a different way, perhaps even, but it would be good in a way that
*  is no longer recognisably human, I think, but with the loss of all that, to which, as I say,
*  I would also add our social nature, we're extremely social animals, we have, I mean,
*  we are nothing without, it's very hard to imagine a life completely separated from any kind of social
*  contact. You wouldn't even know where to start with that idea of what that would be like,
*  especially if you're talking about from childhood, from the beginning, I mean, we're formed
*  by social contact. If you sort of imagine something better that somehow leaves all that behind,
*  you know, there was this strand in medieval thinking, some of the more extreme
*  I mean, theological writings of the sort of, well, various times in medieval writing that
*  wrestling with the problem of, okay, you live a good life and you go to heaven. What about your
*  relatives and beloved ones and children or whatever who have not had a good life, and they're going to
*  hell? How are you supposed to feel about that? And some people even said, well, actually, it's
*  fine, because you'll be so transformed when you go to heaven that you'll be able to sort of lean
*  over as it were and look down on them in hell, and just watch them with total detachment, or even
*  pleasure, as if you're just sort of, you watch them ride around in the fires of hell, and you can even
*  take pleasure in it, because you will be so changed. And I think that really touches on this
*  issue with the transhumanist idea is that we will be so changed that we won't miss all of
*  the people we love, because we're going to be sort of this transcendent thing. I'm always suspicious
*  of anything that promises any kind of transcendent reality. Well, maybe then the lesson is that
*  whether it's education or liberation or technology, there's more need for top flight humanism than
*  ever before. That would be, yeah, I hope so. I hope there's going to be a tremendous call for humanists
*  at every level of society. Maybe that is a bit optimistic. We can be optimistic. That's okay.
*  It's the end of the podcast. It's the time to be optimistic. So, Sarah Bakewell, thanks so much
*  for being on the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you very much indeed. I really enjoyed it.
