Blog post with audio player, show notes, and transcript: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2025/06/30/320-solo-complexity-and-the-universe/
Our universe started out looking very simple: hot, dense, smooth, rapidly expanding. According to our best current model, it will end up looking simple once again: cold, dark, empty. It's in between -- now, roughly speaking -- that things look complex. I have been working to understand the stages by which complexity comes into existence, thrives, and eventually disappears. Without going into technical details, in this solo episode I give an overview of the general picture and the clues we are looking at to better understand the process of complexogenesis.

# Mindscape 320 | Solo: Complexity and the Universe
**Mindscape Podcast:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. Podcasting, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=0.0s)]
*  like the subject of today's episode, is a complex system. Many things happen, you cannot [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6.16s)]
*  always know what is going on, sometimes the schedule kind of gets away from you and you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=11.9s)]
*  decide that this would be the right time for a solo episode. This is a fancy way of saying [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=17.12s)]
*  that I'm behind on actually recording episodes because of various things that happened. So [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=23.1s)]
*  why not just do it myself? That's always a strategy that is available to us. And I'm [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=27.58s)]
*  recording this from Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I'm doing one of my regular visits to the Santa [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=33.9s)]
*  Fe Institute as part of being a fractal faculty there. So complexity is on my mind. We had a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=38.42s)]
*  very nice meeting just last week on science and history, both of things which involve complexity [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=44.58s)]
*  in different ways and it was stimulating to hear historians and scientists come together. But what [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=51.14s)]
*  I've been thinking about for a long time is complexity and the universe. And I know that in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=56.9s)]
*  bits and pieces, I've talked about this in AMAs and other solo episodes, even in books and things [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=61.66s)]
*  I've written. But I've even given talks on it. You can find talks online on YouTube that are [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=66.66s)]
*  pretty close, similar at least to what this solo episode is going to be like. But I thought it'd [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=72.18s)]
*  be good to take a step back, not really talk about specific individual research level ideas. I have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=76.94s)]
*  some of those, but they're very vague and they're not very far along right now. So rather than that, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=84.26s)]
*  talk about the big picture of this question of how complexity comes to be in the universe. Some of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  you may know I already wrote a paper on that topic with Scott Aronson and Lauren Willett quite a [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=96.86s)]
*  while ago. And we still haven't published the paper, but we're still working on that. It's like 10 [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  years later. Don't worry, we'll get there. Science doesn't care when you actually publish it, it [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=107.34s)]
*  cares about the truth, right? But there's many, many places to go beyond what we did in that very [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=111.78s)]
*  simple paper, which I'll describe later in the episode. So there's a lot of fronts on which one [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=117.54s)]
*  can attack the problem of how complexity comes into existence in the universe over time. And I'm [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=123.86s)]
*  saying this as someone who, you know, knows a lot about this subject in some ways, but not nearly [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=131.46s)]
*  everything in other ways. I've not been doing complexity research all my life. I have been doing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=137.74s)]
*  universe research all of my professional life. So I know more about cosmology than the average [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=142.66s)]
*  complexity person, more about fundamental physics, less about unequilibrium dynamics and computer [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  science theory and statistical mechanics and complexity theory and all those things. So we're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  trying to put them together in a novel way and we'll see what happens. So I thought that it would be [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=158.62s)]
*  fun to just sort of lay out the general picture as I see it and also places we're hoping to go, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=163.7s)]
*  questions that are still open, things we're trying to learn about, calculations maybe we would like [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=170.66s)]
*  to do, ideas to keep in mind as we're doing all of these things. So that's what this episode will [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=176.66s)]
*  be about. Complexogenesis, I sometimes call it. We talk about baryogenesis, the origin of baryons [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=182.17999999999998s)]
*  in the universe. Complexogenesis is the origin of complexity in the universe. The very, very early [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=187.94s)]
*  universe was a simple place. The current universe is a very complex place, at least in parts of it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=194.1s)]
*  How did that happen? Is there any scientific quantitative rigorous understanding we can put [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=200.26s)]
*  to that? I'll give you my take on that. Other people will have their own takes. Let me also take [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=204.42s)]
*  this opportunity to quickly say that you could be a Patreon supporter of the Mindscape Podcast. Just [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=210.66s)]
*  go to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll and join up to support the podcast. Get a lot of benefits, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=217.06s)]
*  including being able to ask the Ask Me Anything questions that we do once a month. And also, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=224.1s)]
*  there's other ways to support Mindscape that are completely free, like leaving reviews at iTunes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=228.9s)]
*  or Spotify or I don't know, wherever one leaves reviews of podcasts, spread the word, let other [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=234.02s)]
*  people know that this podcast is worth listening to. We've been doing it for a long time now. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=240.02s)]
*  I enormously appreciate the support that the Mindscape audience has given to the podcast. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=245.46s)]
*  Of course, if you want to talk about the origin of complexity, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=270.18s)]
*  the very first thing you have to do or one of the first things is tell me what you mean [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=273.86s)]
*  by complexity. Give me the definitions of complexity. And people argue over that. So, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=278.42s)]
*  of course, there's multiple definitions out there. I kind of don't care. But one of my goals in this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=283.7s)]
*  presentation is not to tell you what the right definition of complexity is. It's to take the [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=290.74s)]
*  fact that complexity has all sorts of different aspects to it. Some we know when we see, others [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=297.38s)]
*  we perceive by thinking about it more carefully and include all of them. There's this picture, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=304.1s)]
*  as I'll say, where the universe starts without any complexity at all, in a very real sense, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=309.62s)]
*  and all sorts of different kinds of complexity develop over time. And we're going to see how [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=314.82s)]
*  that happens as a set of stages, bit by bit. You get certain kinds of complexity develop and then [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=320.26s)]
*  maybe other more sophisticated kinds happen later on. Not everyone sees it that way. Of course, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=326.42s)]
*  David Kracauer, who is the president here at Santa Fe Institute and former Mindscape guest, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=332.42s)]
*  made the point in our conversation that he considers complexity to be sort of real complexity [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=337.3s)]
*  only when a system can be considered to be teleonomic. That is to say, to have some goals [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=343.54s)]
*  of its own. The picture being that at some point in the history of the universe, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=349.38s)]
*  physical systems develop the capacity for having information content gathered and thinking about [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=354.5s)]
*  the future and moving towards some goal. And those are all characteristic of complexity. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=362.02s)]
*  And he's worried a little bit that if you just include everything in the definition of complexity, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=366.74s)]
*  even things like spin glasses that Giorgio Parisi recently won the Nobel Prize for, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=372.41999999999996s)]
*  then it all just becomes a subset of physics and you're missing important things. Well, you know, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=377.78s)]
*  so my attitude, which I don't think is substantively in disagreement, but we put our [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=382.9s)]
*  emphases in different places, is that everything is a physical system. There are no non-physical [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=387.94s)]
*  systems. There are different ways of talking about physical systems, since some of those ways might [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=392.73999999999995s)]
*  be biological or mental or whatever. And there should be a unified picture. I'm very interested [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  in both the fundamental levels of reality and the higher emergent levels and in particular [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=403.62s)]
*  understanding how they're compatible with each other, how the higher levels are constrained by [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=408.98s)]
*  the fact that they supervene on the lower levels in some very real way. Furthermore, I think that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=414.82s)]
*  this idea of telonomic matter or advanced sort of complex systems that can adapt to circumstances [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=421.86s)]
*  and things like that is great and important. You need to get there, but you're not just going to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=428.82s)]
*  leap into it right away, right? You're not just going to have some random collection of molecules [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=433.3s)]
*  or at least the best way to make collections of matter like that or not have random collections [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=437.78s)]
*  of molecules, simply spontaneously organize into that. It's going to happen by stages. So we'd like [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=442.17999999999995s)]
*  to understand what those stages are, even if the earliest stages don't look telonomic or information [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=447.85999999999996s)]
*  processing at all. Okay, with that little throat clearing out of the way, and again, without even [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=453.78s)]
*  defining quite yet what we mean by complexity, let's think about the evolution of complexity [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=461.29999999999995s)]
*  over time. We think that some parts of the universe do grow more complex, right? The biosphere [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=466.74s)]
*  grows more complex over the past 400 years. The universe grows more complex over the past 14 [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=474.98s)]
*  billion years. Again, not because there is some goal of doing it, not because the laws of physics [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=482.34000000000003s)]
*  direct it to happen, but through some features that are importantly dependent on both the laws [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=489.86s)]
*  of physics and the initial conditions. This is why cosmology is relevant to talking about [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=497.62s)]
*  complexogenesis. There's an initial value problem here. Those of you who listen to me or to Mindscape [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  many times will know that it's a very parallel discussion to discussion of entropy and the arrow [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=509.14s)]
*  time. Entropy is a feature of macroscopic collections of matter under one of the various [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=516.1800000000001s)]
*  ways of defining entropy. There's many ways of defining entropy, just like there are many ways [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=523.38s)]
*  of talking about complexity. Boltzmann's definition, the definition that is on Ludwig [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=526.74s)]
*  Boltzmann's tombstone, is to say that there are certain things you can observe about a physical [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=531.3000000000001s)]
*  system and there are many, many different configurations of the microscopic constituents [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=536.5s)]
*  of that system that are compatible with those macroscopic observations. Let's chunk up all [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=540.98s)]
*  of the possible microscopic states of the system into macrostates. Macrostates are sets of possible [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=547.38s)]
*  microscopic configurations that look the same to us macroscopically. Then it is a feature of the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=554.98s)]
*  world, which we can try to explain, but that's a job for a different podcast, that at early times, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=561.78s)]
*  soon after the Big Bang, by the standard way of thinking about macrostates and microstates in the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=567.62s)]
*  universe, the universe had a very, very low entropy. The status of why that's true is certainly [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=573.0600000000001s)]
*  very interesting and not something we're going to go on to. We're going to just take it as given [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=580.1s)]
*  for this particular discussion. Then, simply because there are more ways to be high entropy [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=584.02s)]
*  than to be low entropy, it's the most natural thing in the world if entropy increases over time [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=590.26s)]
*  from that initial low entropy past to the future. We are nowhere near done in that process. Roughly [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=595.54s)]
*  speaking, we don't know about the future of the universe because there's things we don't know [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=602.8199999999999s)]
*  about physics and conditions and things like that, but we have a standard picture of what the universe [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=607.62s)]
*  might look like. Roughly speaking, about 10 to the 100 years from now, we will reach maximum [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=613.62s)]
*  entropy, a thermal equilibrium state of the universe. Right now, we're only 10 to the 10 [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=621.14s)]
*  years after the Big Bang, so 10 to the 100 years is very far in the future. But the rate at which [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=626.98s)]
*  interesting things happen slow down. Even though we're only a tiny fraction of the beginning of [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=633.06s)]
*  the history of the universe, a lot of interesting things have happened in those 14 billion years. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=638.98s)]
*  To cosmologists, 14 billion and 10 billion are the same number. 1.4 times 10 to the 10 and 10 to the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  10 are not numbers we need to worry about distinguishing cosmologically speaking. Sometimes [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=649.14s)]
*  I'll just say the universe is 10 to the 10 billion years old. The reason why I'm retelling that story [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=653.6999999999999s)]
*  is both because it's important to the complexity story, but also it parallels the kind of discussion [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=660.58s)]
*  we have because we're not introducing new laws of physics. We're asking what are the features of the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=666.02s)]
*  laws of physics that give rise to this behavior? Certainly, the initial conditions of the universe [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=671.78s)]
*  are playing a very important role here. Now, in the biological case, just to pre-figure or foreshadow [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=677.94s)]
*  or a little bit, again, there's nothing in Darwinian evolution that says you're supposed to go [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=685.94s)]
*  towards higher levels of complexity. We had Michael Wong on the podcast not too long ago, and he and [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=692.6600000000001s)]
*  Bob Hazen and their collaborators suggested a sort of law of increasing complexity, but it's only a [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=699.5400000000001s)]
*  provisional law that only supposed to work under certain circumstances, and it's not even proven [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=704.66s)]
*  as a law. It's sort of a conjecture if you like, and we're not going to get into that because we're [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=710.26s)]
*  thinking even bigger picture than they are right now. But the point is that it's well known that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=715.14s)]
*  individual biological species sometimes lose complexity. Biological species are trying to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=720.74s)]
*  adapt themselves to their environment. If a species that was living in the sunlight [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=727.14s)]
*  changes its environment, so now it's living underground and there is no sunlight, it might [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=733.54s)]
*  lose the ability to see. It might lose vision because it's using up resources on maintaining [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=737.4599999999999s)]
*  that little bit of complex structure that doesn't need anymore. So there's nothing in biological [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=743.2199999999999s)]
*  evolution that says we need more complexity. Rather, in biological evolution, you're exploring a [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=747.86s)]
*  space of states, a space of genomes, of biological creatures, where we haven't explored nearly all of [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=755.14s)]
*  it, and we never will. It's too big, okay? So there's plenty of room for discovering new biological [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=761.38s)]
*  innovations, and those can happen in part of the biosphere and not other parts. So just like it's [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=769.14s)]
*  very natural for entropy to increase over time, it's also very natural for biological complexity [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=774.98s)]
*  to increase over time until you reach some sort of saturation point. And just like right now in the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=781.14s)]
*  history of the universe, we're nowhere near that saturation point. Right now in the history of the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=787.22s)]
*  biosphere, we're nowhere near that saturation point. The difference is there can be events [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=790.98s)]
*  that are maybe not completely improbable that dramatically decrease biological complexity, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=796.4200000000001s)]
*  catastrophes, whether self-imposed or imposed from somewhere else in the universe. It's not a law [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=802.26s)]
*  of nature, it's just a tendency, and sometimes that tendency can be reversed. So let's compare [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=808.02s)]
*  those two sort of stories, the story of increasing entropy and the story of increasing complexity. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=814.5799999999999s)]
*  And again, I'm very honest about not having defined complexity yet. It's right now in the eye of the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=820.5s)]
*  beholder. We can get to different definitions later. The example I use, and I love using it, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=825.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to keep using it, and many of you already heard me use it, is cream mixing into coffee. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=830.8199999999999s)]
*  Okay, so imagine in your head, for the lucky few out there who haven't heard me give this [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=837.14s)]
*  example before, a cup of coffee with coffee at the bottom and cream on the top. Okay, that is a [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=843.22s)]
*  low entropy configuration of cream and coffee because it's a very specific kind of arrangement. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=849.22s)]
*  You can rearrange the cream molecules within each other, and you wouldn't notice it macroscopically. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=854.82s)]
*  You can rearrange the coffee molecules within each other, and you wouldn't notice it macroscopically, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=860.82s)]
*  but you can't mix cream with coffee without noticing. Okay, so that's why it's a low entropy [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=866.4200000000001s)]
*  state. You can then mix it. You put a spoon in there, or you just let it mix itself over time. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=872.18s)]
*  Maybe it's in a mixer or something, and it will become all mixed up, and now it's in a high [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=877.2199999999999s)]
*  entropy state. And the high entropy state is everything's mixed together. Everything looks [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  perfectly uniform. It's very conventionally true of very high entropy states that they are featureless, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=886.9799999999999s)]
*  right? Because if there were features in the high entropy state, you could sort of mix them together [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=894.7399999999999s)]
*  and increase the entropy. So the completely mixed cream and coffee situation is high entropy, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=899.54s)]
*  and voila! We have the second law of thermodynamics that entropy tends to increase in closed systems [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=905.62s)]
*  over time. From completely unmixed to completely mixed is a journey of increasing entropy. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=911.86s)]
*  Whereas, if we think about the complexity of this system, and again without defining it, we're just [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=919.78s)]
*  going to follow our noses and say, look, when the cream and the coffee are completely separate, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=924.42s)]
*  that's a pretty simple configuration. Because intuitively, it was easy for me to precisely [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=930.26s)]
*  describe it to you. Namely, all the creams on the top and all the coffees on the bottom. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=938.3399999999999s)]
*  Macroscopically, there's nothing more interesting going on. Microscopically, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=942.9s)]
*  maybe I need to tell you the position and velocity of every molecule in there, okay? But it's, so [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=947.3s)]
*  already we've learned something. There's something about complexity that is a coarse-grained [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=952.9s)]
*  macroscopic phenomenon, right? At the level of the microstates, at the level of the position [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=959.22s)]
*  and velocity of every molecule or atom or elementary particle in that cup of coffee, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=966.1s)]
*  there's nothing that distinguishes the amount of information you need to convey the state of the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=971.06s)]
*  system from one moment to the other, whether it's mixed or unmixed. It doesn't matter. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=976.5799999999999s)]
*  This is very much like saying that Laplace's demon doesn't know about entropy, because entropy [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=979.62s)]
*  is a coarse-grained phenomenon. Entropy is an example of something I can say about a system given [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=986.1s)]
*  wildly incomplete information. And likewise, Laplace's demon has complete information, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=991.78s)]
*  so it doesn't need to talk that language. Complexity is a similar thing. The reason why [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=997.62s)]
*  the cream and the coffee completely separate is simple because there exists a highly compressed [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1002.58s)]
*  description that tells you everything about the macroscopic configuration. Likewise, when you've [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1008.5s)]
*  mixed everything together, and now the cream and coffee is all mixed in, it's a high entropy [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1014.74s)]
*  configuration, it is still very simple because again, I've given you the complete macroscopic [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1018.58s)]
*  description. If you think about complexity, so here's one version of complexity is, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1024.9s)]
*  first, coarse-grain the system. Ignore all the microscopic specificities that you don't really [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1030.58s)]
*  care about from your macroscopic point of view, and then ask me how much information do I need [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1036.82s)]
*  to give you to completely specify the state of the system. That is one version of complexity. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1044.4199999999998s)]
*  In this particular example, even though it is low entropy at the beginning and high entropy at the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1052.98s)]
*  end, it is simple. That is to say, low complexity at the beginning and also low complexity at the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1058.1s)]
*  end. The punchline, of course, is that in the middle where the coffee and cream have begun [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1064.18s)]
*  to mix into each other, and maybe you see like some tendrils of cream and coffee or some swirls [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1070.66s)]
*  turbulence in there or something like that, there to precisely tell you where exactly all of the [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1075.6200000000001s)]
*  cream and coffee, the different layers of darkness and brightness and so forth would appear to you in [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1083.54s)]
*  an image would require a lot more information. That's when it looks complex. This behavior is, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1090.02s)]
*  I would say, quasi robust. By this behavior, I mean the idea that in a closed system, you start [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1098.1s)]
*  with low entropy and entropy simply increases, but you start simple and complexity can grow and then [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1103.78s)]
*  decrease. That is quasi robust in the sense that it doesn't have to happen, but it's a very natural [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1110.66s)]
*  thing for that to happen. Complexity can happen at medium entropy configurations of stuff, and in this [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1117.38s)]
*  case, it actually does. That's interesting. The idea, very roughly, is that entropy increases, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1124.42s)]
*  but complexity comes and goes. Now, number one, that's certainly not a very sophisticated [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1132.0200000000002s)]
*  version of complexity. There's no teleonomy there. There's no substructure. There's no power laws. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1139.38s)]
*  There's no hierarchical network or anything like all the various things that conventionally go [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1144.8999999999999s)]
*  along with discussions of complexity. None of that is there. What we're talking about is literally [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1149.7s)]
*  an amount of information that needed to specify a macroscopic configuration. This is quite literal. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1154.34s)]
*  You could actually do this experiment with the cream and the coffee, take a picture of it on your [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1160.26s)]
*  iPhone, and save the images of the cream and coffee separate, halfway mixed together, and completely [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1165.22s)]
*  mixed together. If you all do it right, and you can do this, it doesn't need to be cream and coffee, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1171.38s)]
*  whatever fluids you like, as long as they're distinguishable. The image that you save on your [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1176.74s)]
*  phone of the medium entropy configuration where they're half mixed together will have a larger [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1182.66s)]
*  file size than the files of the simple configurations where the cream and coffee are either all [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1189.5400000000002s)]
*  distinct or all mixed together, because there is a more efficient compression algorithm [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1196.18s)]
*  when the cream and coffee are completely separate or completely mixed together, because there's [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1202.8200000000002s)]
*  big parts of the picture that look the same macroscopically, and your compression algorithm [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1206.98s)]
*  that is JPEG or GIF or whatever is taking advantage of exactly that. This very simple-minded [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1212.66s)]
*  version of complexity is literally tracked by how much we can compress the macroscopic information. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1220.98s)]
*  There is a tension between the fact that entropy increases over time, and the fact that complexity [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1230.26s)]
*  comes into existence in the biosphere. This is a well-known tension that has been exploited by [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1237.22s)]
*  people who want to teach creationism in schools. There's an argument that biological evolution is [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1245.14s)]
*  incompatible with the second law of thermodynamics. This argument is complete bullshit. It's very, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1251.94s)]
*  very wrong, but there's still something that remains to be explained, so I want to be very, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1258.66s)]
*  very careful and explicit about this. The fact that complex structures like you and me, like other [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1264.1000000000001s)]
*  animals and plants and so forth, come into existence in the biosphere is completely 100% [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1272.1s)]
*  compatible with the second law of thermodynamics, even though the intuitive everyday language [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1278.4199999999998s)]
*  gloss on the second law would say disorderliness increases over time. The tension is, if the whole [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1287.1399999999999s)]
*  universe is going through a process by which disorderliness is increasing over time, how can [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1293.78s)]
*  it ever come to be that things like you and me, which are exquisitely organized biological machines, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1300.26s)]
*  would pop up in the mechanistic, non-teleological, not goal-directed evolution of ordinary physical [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1306.74s)]
*  stuff? It doesn't seem like the origin of life, or the later evolution of life from simple single-celled [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1314.9s)]
*  things into complex multicellular things, is an example of entropy increasing. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1323.86s)]
*  Now the answer there is very well known to anyone who knows anything about this, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1329.6200000000001s)]
*  which is that the Earth and the biosphere are not closed systems. I even said it when I quoted the [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1333.54s)]
*  second law, in a closed system entropy increases over time. The Earth is not a closed system, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1340.66s)]
*  the Earth gets light from the Sun, and it's very, very important that the Sun is a hot spot in a cold [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1346.9s)]
*  sky that provides a source of energy, but it's a source of low entropy energy. The Earth gets light [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1354.5s)]
*  from the Sun, it does things with it, and then it gives back the energy to the universe, okay? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1362.5s)]
*  And it gives back the same amount of energy, roughly speaking. These days it gives back a [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1369.22s)]
*  little less because of global climate change. We are keeping a little bit more energy than we give [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1373.54s)]
*  back to the universe, but that's a tiny perturbation on the overall flux of energy. The important [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1378.98s)]
*  thing is that we give that energy back to the universe in a much higher entropy form. For every [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1384.42s)]
*  one photon we get from the Sun, which is typically a visible light wavelength photon, we give back 20 [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1389.78s)]
*  photons to the universe, 20 infrared wavelength light photons, and that's 20 times the entropy, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1396.74s)]
*  roughly speaking. So even though it is true that if you ignored the flux of radiation from the Sun [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1404.1000000000001s)]
*  and then back to the universe, the biosphere coming into existence represents a decrease of [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1410.66s)]
*  entropy. It's not a net decrease of entropy in any sense whatsoever. It's parasitic upon the fact [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1416.5800000000002s)]
*  that the whole picture, including the light we get from the Sun, is absolutely increasing entropy [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1423.46s)]
*  over time. It's exactly like, say, the second law of thermodynamics does not prevent you from [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1430.5s)]
*  cleaning up your room. Cleaning up your room lowers the entropy of the configuration of stuff [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1436.18s)]
*  in your room, but it doesn't lower the entropy of the universe because you are doing work, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1441.38s)]
*  you are sweating and cursing and whatever it takes, and if you were very very careful [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1446.26s)]
*  about accounting for all the entropy you see that it's going up. Okay, so when I say there's a [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1450.26s)]
*  tension between the existence of complex biological structures and increasing entropy, it's only an [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1455.22s)]
*  apparent tension. If you really understand what's going on with the entropy budget, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1461.38s)]
*  there's no conflict at all. Nevertheless, if you've gone beyond the sort of culture war [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1466.02s)]
*  political battles about teaching evolution in schools and are just asking the science question, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1473.54s)]
*  even though there's no contradiction with the second law to say that entropy is increasing and [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1479.06s)]
*  biological complexity is also developing here in the biosphere, it's also not obvious why it happens. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1485.78s)]
*  It's allowed to happen, but that doesn't mean it will happen. It's a little bit trickier than that. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1492.66s)]
*  There's, you know, the moon gets light from the Sun and radiates it back to the universe, but it [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1498.1s)]
*  doesn't develop life in any obvious way. So this raises the questions of complexogenesis. Where [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1503.3s)]
*  exactly does all that complexity come from? What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1510.02s)]
*  these kinds of complexity to develop? Okay, that's all warm up. That's all inspirational pep talk. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1515.62s)]
*  And now we can start thinking about the universe more specifically, more seriously. 14 billion [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1521.78s)]
*  years ago, there was something called the Big Bang. There's a whole nother discussion to be had about [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1526.7399999999998s)]
*  what you mean by the Big Bang. We're not going to talk about singularities in the beginning of the [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1530.58s)]
*  universe. We can start talking a few seconds after the actual Big Bang event. If you want, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1534.02s)]
*  we can talk about the part of the universe where we actually know something about it. We do know [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1539.2199999999998s)]
*  something about the universe just a few seconds after the Big Bang because of Big Bang [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1544.18s)]
*  nucleosynthesis. The early universe was a nuclear reactor and a fusion reactor that was turning [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1548.8200000000002s)]
*  hydrogen, sorry, yeah, hydrogen and neutrons into helium and other light elements. And you can see [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1555.38s)]
*  the effects of that and you can predict exactly the relative ratios of protons to helium nuclei [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1561.3s)]
*  and so forth. And you can see in the current universe, in parts of the universe, which have [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1567.3s)]
*  been relatively undisturbed by the appearance of stars and things like that, that the abundance [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1571.78s)]
*  of helium and other light elements today matches what we predict from general relativity and from [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1577.62s)]
*  our knowledge of the contents of the universe from those nuclear fusion reactions a few seconds or [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1583.46s)]
*  minutes after the Big Bang. So we know that there might have been before that something like [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1588.34s)]
*  inflation or something like that, a period at a much shorter period of time, 10 to the minus 30 [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1594.26s)]
*  seconds or whatever, when the universe didn't have particles at all. It was dominated by some [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1600.02s)]
*  inflaton field, okay, and that is more or less smooth and featureless and then it reheats as we [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1605.46s)]
*  say and turns into this gas of hot particles. But we don't know that for sure. So we'll think about [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1613.86s)]
*  that. We'll keep that as an option, but I'm just letting you know that that's the part of the [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1619.94s)]
*  history of the universe, which we don't have 100% control over. If inflation did happen, so let's [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1623.22s)]
*  talk as if it did for a while, if you take the universe as it is today and you take sort of the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1629.54s)]
*  volume that we can see, right, you know, maybe 20 billion light years in every direction, and then [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1635.94s)]
*  you shrink that down under our extrapolation of the expansion of the universe given general [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1641.62s)]
*  relativity and its matter content. So you shrink it down to what it was in some tiny fraction of a [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1647.06s)]
*  second and you say you claim that inflation happened, okay, let's imagine that it happened. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1652.42s)]
*  You don't need to, it's not going to really matter for anything that we're going to say here except [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1658.34s)]
*  for one thing, which I'll be specific about in a second, but mostly it's just something we can [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1661.1399999999999s)]
*  ask about right now. The thing about inflation is there's not a lot of particles moving around, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1666.6599999999999s)]
*  right, it's just one big scalar field and there's essentially no specificity to the configuration [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1672.98s)]
*  of that scalar field. It's very boring, it's a lot going on. It corresponds to a low entropy [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1680.34s)]
*  configuration. In fact, roughly speaking, all of the entropy comes from gravity, comes from [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1687.3s)]
*  space time, okay. This is one of the reasons why this whole discussion of gravity and cosmology is [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1693.78s)]
*  slightly complicated because cosmology, where you have the whole universe as your subject of interest, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1700.34s)]
*  is a case where gravity matters and gravity matters for entropy in particular, and entropy [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1706.6599999999999s)]
*  and gravity are two subjects which we don't have 100% confidence talking about. We have some [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1713.38s)]
*  knowledge of, given what Stephen Hawking did and Gary Gibbons did in the 1970s, so we're going to [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1718.3400000000001s)]
*  wave our hands a little bit, but all of this is to say it is perfectly adequate to our current [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1724.3400000000001s)]
*  purposes to say that the entropy of the universe during the inflationary era was maybe something [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1730.18s)]
*  like 10 to the power 10, okay. It could have been 10 to the power 1, it could have been 10 to the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1735.3000000000002s)]
*  power 20. None of this really matters for our current discussion, it's just what will be a [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1741.1399999999999s)]
*  very low number compared to what the entropy is a little bit later on. The reason for the uncertainty [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1746.4199999999998s)]
*  is that we don't know much about the specifics of inflation, okay. We have lots of different [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1752.5s)]
*  possibilities for how inflation could have happened and so forth, but let's just keep that [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1757.94s)]
*  number 10 to the 10 as a number out there for the entropy at the very, very early times, 10 to the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1764.58s)]
*  minus 30 seconds after the big bang. Then once you reheat the inflationary energy into ordinary [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1770.02s)]
*  matter and radiation, then in our observable patch of universe, I'm calling the universe, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1776.82s)]
*  I'm going to be a little bit sloppy about this, I can't help it, sorry. When I say the entropy in [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1782.9s)]
*  the universe, I mean what I said before, which is the region of space that corresponds to our [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1786.9s)]
*  currently observable universe, perhaps extrapolated backward or forward in time, okay. So I don't have [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1792.9s)]
*  any idea what the entropy is outside our observable universe, so I'm not talking about that. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1799.86s)]
*  Even though I don't have complete observational evidence over what our universe was like in the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1806.8999999999999s)]
*  very far past or the very far future, I can use our standard picture of cosmology to talk about what [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1812.1799999999998s)]
*  the understanding of entropy would be under that picture. So if cosmology turns out to be different [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1818.1799999999998s)]
*  because of some future discovery, then we can rehab the conversation. But anyway, within what [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1823.1399999999999s)]
*  we call the co-moving volume, the volume of space that corresponds to the volume of space we can [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1827.86s)]
*  observe today, there are about 10 to the power 88 particles in the universe today. Almost all those [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1834.58s)]
*  particles are either photons or neutrinos. How do we know this? Sometimes it's because of direct [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1841.62s)]
*  observation, like with the photons, they're mostly in the cosmic microwave background, and we can [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1847.06s)]
*  actually just detect them and count them. With the neutrinos, it's harder, but we can make a prediction [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1850.9799999999998s)]
*  once again based on known physics, and we can test that prediction against the data. The number of [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1856.42s)]
*  neutrinos, so you might say, look, neutrinos, you might have heard the neutrinos come in different [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1861.22s)]
*  forms. There are electron neutrinos, and there are muon neutrinos, there are tau neutrinos. How do we [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1866.9s)]
*  know how many of them there are? And how do we know there aren't other kinds of neutrinos that [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1873.38s)]
*  aren't included in our current knowledge? These are excellent questions, but cosmologists are not [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1877.46s)]
*  idiots. They thought of these questions. They have a theory that predicts how many neutrinos there [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1882.9s)]
*  should be if there are only three different kinds, and that theory says, look, at very early times, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1888.18s)]
*  there were roughly equal numbers of photons and each kind of neutrino, because they're created [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1894.66s)]
*  equal, right? These are all essentially massless particles. Neutrinos have tiny masses, but compared [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1900.66s)]
*  to the energies in the very, very early universe, the mass of the neutrinos is essentially zero. It's [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1907.38s)]
*  negligible. What happens is there's various events in the history of the universe, like electrons [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1911.7s)]
*  and positrons coming together and annihilating. We know that they annihilate into photons, so you [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1918.18s)]
*  create more photons in the universe, but you don't create more neutrinos. So even though there are [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1924.02s)]
*  three kinds of neutrinos and only one kind of photon, we actually think that there are more [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1929.46s)]
*  photons in the universe than neutrinos. None of this matters, okay? I'm just telling you that I'm [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1933.7s)]
*  not cheating you. I'm just trying to give you reason to believe that I'm not lying to you. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1938.98s)]
*  We've thought about all of these issues. The point is there are roughly 10 to the 88 particles [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1943.06s)]
*  in the universe, and mostly photons and neutrinos. Why? Because they're light and they don't annihilate [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1947.6200000000001s)]
*  with each other and go away, okay? So they're easy to make. They're hard to kill. That's why there's [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1953.8600000000001s)]
*  mostly photons and neutrinos. Things like electrons and protons and neutrons, well, you know, neutrons [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1958.02s)]
*  are unstable. They just go away. Unless you capture a neutron in a nucleus, it's not going [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1964.4199999999998s)]
*  to last very long. So of the heavy particles, we mostly have protons and electrons, and they're [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1969.4599999999998s)]
*  roughly 10 to the 80th of them compared to the 10 to the 88th of the photons and the neutrinos. So [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1976.6599999999999s)]
*  100 million times as many photons as there are protons or electrons. Now, there could be dark [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1984.6599999999999s)]
*  matter in the universe. That's absolutely possible. How much of it is there? We know the [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1990.82s)]
*  density of dark matter in terms of grams per cubic centimeter. We don't know the mass of individual [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=1996.6599999999999s)]
*  dark matter particles. If the mass is larger than that of a proton, which in most dark matter models [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2004.1s)]
*  it is, then the number of particles in dark matter is much smaller than the number of either photons [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2009.46s)]
*  or protons. So we don't need to worry about it. If the mass is much lighter, then it's a trickier [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2016.34s)]
*  story, but you might expect that you get approximately the same order of magnitude of light dark matter [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2021.62s)]
*  particles as you do photons or neutrinos. All of which is to say the entropy of the universe in [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2027.78s)]
*  our co-moving volume, as far as our best cosmological models predict right now, is about 10 to the 88th. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2035.1399999999999s)]
*  And that is true today. The entropy of the photons and neutrinos is about that. It was also true [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2041.6200000000001s)]
*  soon after the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, when we made all of those light particles and we actually [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2048.1800000000003s)]
*  had some observational data about what was going on. So all of that is to say, if we're tracking [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2053.62s)]
*  the entropy of the universe over time, the entropy of our co-moving volume of universe, it starts at [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2062.58s)]
*  maybe 10 to the 10. It eventually, not too long, grows to something like 10 to the 88th, because [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2068.5s)]
*  the entropy of a gas of particles is to within order of magnitude the number of particles that [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2074.18s)]
*  are in there. If it's a thermal distribution, which it is in this case. So the entropy goes up, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2080.74s)]
*  right? It goes 10 to the 10 to 10 to 88. That's good. That's what the second law of thermodynamics [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2085.94s)]
*  says should happen. And there's only two more events in the history of entropy in the universe [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2090.42s)]
*  that really matter. One is that you make black holes. Stephen Hawking told us that black holes [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2096.66s)]
*  have entropy. There's a simple formula. If you have a million solar mass black hole, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2102.98s)]
*  the entropy of it is approximately 10 to the power 90. The entropy goes like the area of the event [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2109.8599999999997s)]
*  horizon, which goes like the Schwarzschild radius squared. Entropy goes like distance squared. And [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2116.02s)]
*  the Schwarzschild radius goes like the mass. So the entropy is roughly proportional to the mass [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2121.94s)]
*  squared of the black hole. We think that big galaxies like the Milky Way, like other big spiral [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2127.3s)]
*  galaxies in the universe, each one of them has at the center a supermassive black hole. Supermassive [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2133.62s)]
*  means a million solar masses or more. The biggest supermassive black holes have a entropy of something [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2139.06s)]
*  of masses of something like a billion times the mass of the sun. So if a single million solar mass [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2145.54s)]
*  black hole has an entropy of 10 to the 90, and the whole universe back before there were any black [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2152.5s)]
*  holes had an entropy of 10 to the 88, then entropy has certainly gone up because there's a bunch of [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2159.14s)]
*  black holes in the universe. The little black holes don't matter. They're subdominant as far [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2164.5s)]
*  as entropy is concerned because the entropy goes like the mass squared. And so we can basically [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2169.14s)]
*  do an inventory of all the big black holes in the universe. Again, within cosmological precision, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2175.14s)]
*  to an order of magnitude or two, the total entropy of the universe today, the co-moving universe, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2180.2599999999998s)]
*  the co-moving volume in which we can observe, is about 10 to the 103. Okay, all of which is just to [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2185.54s)]
*  convince you the entropy is still going up. 10 to the 10 to 10 to 88 to 10 to the 103. Now eventually, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2191.7s)]
*  if you keep going forward in time, those black holes will evaporate. In fact, all the matter in [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2197.7799999999997s)]
*  the universe will fall into black holes, and the black holes are going to evaporate. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2202.34s)]
*  This is what happens 10 to the 100 years from now. The last supermassive black hole, according to our [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2206.1000000000004s)]
*  best estimates today, will evaporate and go away. And then you might think the entropy is zero, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2211.7000000000003s)]
*  or maybe you think it's big because of all the particles that were made from the black holes [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2217.94s)]
*  and stuff like that. Here's where we're in uncharted territory. We truly don't know. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2221.94s)]
*  But quantum gravity matters in these circumstances. The thing that I like to do, the estimate I like [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2227.94s)]
*  to put on the amount of entropy in the observable universe, comes from quantum gravity, comes from [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2234.6600000000003s)]
*  at least semi-classical quantum gravity, exactly as Hawking proves that a black hole has entropy [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2239.0600000000004s)]
*  proportional to the area of its event horizon. If you live in a cosmological universe with a positive [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2245.86s)]
*  vacuum energy, a positive cosmological constant, like we think we probably do, even though we don't [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2251.78s)]
*  know for sure, but we think we probably do, then there's a horizon around us. And that volume of [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2257.3s)]
*  universe with a horizon around it has an entropy proportional to the area of that horizon. And that [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2264.26s)]
*  horizon is big. It gives us an entropy of something like 10 to the 120 something like that. So again, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2270.02s)]
*  it's higher. The entropy goes up over time from 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 88, 10 to the 103, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2276.6600000000003s)]
*  10 to the 122. So it's a story of increasing entropy. And then past that, you just have an [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2281.38s)]
*  empty universe, nothing in it, decider space, technically, because you have a positive cosmological [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2287.86s)]
*  constant. And maybe that lasts forever. Maybe there's some future cosmological weirdness. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2293.3s)]
*  Remember, we had Katie Mack on the show a while back talking about possible future scenarios [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2297.62s)]
*  for the universe. Doesn't matter. We're perfectly content with thinking about only the first 10 to [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2302.5s)]
*  the 100 years of the history of the universe. And we have a pretty good handle on what could happen [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2308.9s)]
*  there. Okay. So that's just a reminder of what we know about cosmology. And as you know, from what [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2312.58s)]
*  I just said, entropy goes up over time. And we even have an understanding of why, as I said, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2320.1800000000003s)]
*  Boltzmann's definition of entropy says it's the number of microstates that fit into a macrostate. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2325.78s)]
*  And I've told you what those numbers are. Okay, so entropy increasing in time is something that [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2330.9s)]
*  makes perfect sense to us. So now we can start thinking about the complexity. And the complexity is [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2335.78s)]
*  we're using the I know it when I see it kind of attitude. And I think that it's pretty clear what [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2342.5800000000004s)]
*  actually does happen at those early times. It's exactly like the cup of coffee. I'm trying to [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2350.02s)]
*  figure out the right way to say this. The early universe, as we currently understand it, was [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2354.5s)]
*  essentially featureless. It looked the same everywhere. It is exactly like everything. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2358.82s)]
*  It looks high entropy if you didn't know about gravity. This causes a lot of people confusion. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2364.5s)]
*  Even professional cosmologists, they say, Look, the early universe looks like it's in thermal [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2370.5s)]
*  equilibrium state. It's low. It's at that's a high entropy state. But of course, it evolves into much [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2374.82s)]
*  higher entropy state. How can that happen? And they confuse themselves by thinking about the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2379.78s)]
*  expansion of the universe, giving it more room to grow. But it's all wrong. The thing is that that [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2383.78s)]
*  smoothness of the early universe is actually low entropy because gravity was really strong. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2389.46s)]
*  And there's much more room to make black holes and inhomogeneities in the configuration of matter [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2395.38s)]
*  when gravity is strong than when gravity is weak. Okay, the early universe really did have low [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2401.78s)]
*  entropy. But it was also simple is the point. It's a low entropy and simple configuration. If I say, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2407.38s)]
*  you know, a second after the Big Bang, the universe is hot, dense and smooth and rapidly [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2413.94s)]
*  expanding. As long as I attach numbers to how hot it was, how dense it was, how rapidly expanding it [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2419.06s)]
*  is, you're done. I've completely described the universe to you. If we imagine that we're allowed [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2424.9s)]
*  for our present purposes to think of complexity as how much information does it take to completely [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2431.06s)]
*  specify the macroscopic configuration of the system, the answer is a very, very small amount [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2436.9s)]
*  of information for the early universe. Now skip ahead to the future of the universe, right? We said [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2442.1s)]
*  what's going to happen is all the matter in the galaxy is going to fall into the black hole. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2447.94s)]
*  Black hole is going to evaporate into a thin gruel of particles. The universe continues to expand. So [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2451.7s)]
*  even that thin gruel of particles sort of dilutes away to nothingness and we're left with literally [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2456.74s)]
*  nothing but empty space. There it is. That's the description of the universe in the far future. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2461.06s)]
*  It's empty space with a certain [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2466.98s)]
*  with a certain vacuum energy, with a certain cosmological constant. It's a very, very simple [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2476.66s)]
*  description. So again, simple at the beginning, simple at the end. Now, right now in the history [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2480.7400000000002s)]
*  of the universe is when the universe is complex. Because if you wanted to describe what was happening [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2487.94s)]
*  in the universe today, you would have to tell me all sorts of details about galaxies and stars and [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2494.66s)]
*  maybe even individual planets and life on them and internets and books and podcasts and all these [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2501.14s)]
*  things, right? Those are all part of the macro state of the universe and it's enormously complex. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2506.8999999999996s)]
*  Even if I cannot give you a number, sorry about that. I would love to be able to [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2512.5s)]
*  attach quantitatively a number to that, but that is beyond my pay grade right now. That's something [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2517.3799999999997s)]
*  that is very worth thinking about trying to do. I can do it for the cream and the coffee. I can't [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2522.9s)]
*  really do it for the universe. It's too complicated. But clearly, the phenomena are so dramatic that we [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2528.1s)]
*  don't need to be utterly quantitative about them to say that the universe has the same complexity [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2535.62s)]
*  growth curve that the cup of coffee does. It starts low, it goes high today, and then it's going to [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2542.7400000000002s)]
*  diminish into the future. Everyone always wants to know when I say this, how close are we to the [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2548.58s)]
*  peak right now? But I can't answer that really precisely because we don't have this quantitative [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2555.62s)]
*  way of measuring it. It depends on your coarse graining, right? It depends like for the cream [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2561.46s)]
*  and the coffee, you can kind of just pick some scale at which you observe what's going on and [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2568.34s)]
*  then coarse grain within that scale. It's much harder to do with the universe. The dynamic range [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2574.34s)]
*  of interesting things going on in the universe is much larger than that. So I am not able to tell you [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2579.06s)]
*  how close we are to peak complexity. Also, presumably because it depends on questions like [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2585.54s)]
*  how much life is there elsewhere in the universe? How much technological advancement? How much [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2590.82s)]
*  technological advancement could there be? You and I are in a civilization that is really just the [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2595.54s)]
*  beginning of technological advancement. So if technology and interconnectedness of a culture [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2601.46s)]
*  contributes a lot to the quantitative complexity of the universe, then I have no way of measuring [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2609.38s)]
*  that right now. Sorry. I can tell you one tidbit for what it's worth. You can forget about life [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2615.06s)]
*  and technology and things like that and just look at stars. The creation of stars is in some sense [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2622.1s)]
*  an example of a structure coming into existence that requires more information to precisely tell [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2629.38s)]
*  you how many stars are there, where are they, things like that. So it's a version of complexity [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2636.5s)]
*  and you might think, well, maybe we're just at the beginning of the star forming [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2641.3s)]
*  era in the history of the universe. And the answer to that one is no, we are not at the beginning [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2645.38s)]
*  of the star forming era in the history of the universe. The peak star formation rate was about [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2650.1s)]
*  four billion years after the big bang. Most of the stars that will be ever formed in the history [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2656.98s)]
*  of our universe have already been formed. We are in a slow down era in terms of the formation of [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2665.38s)]
*  stars in our universe. Stars shine for billions of years. The ones that were made almost 10 billion [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2672.18s)]
*  years ago, many of them are still shining, especially the low mass ones. So we're in a [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2678.7400000000002s)]
*  star rich universe, but we're not making a lot more stars now. Most of the star formation has [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2682.5s)]
*  already happened. Does that mean that we're past peak complexity? Again, that depends on details [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2687.86s)]
*  I don't know the answer to, but it's something to keep in mind. Okay, so the star formation thing is [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2692.42s)]
*  like one factoid to keep in mind. Remember, we're not giving you, I'm not presuming to give you the [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2699.46s)]
*  once and for all comprehensive picture of complexogenesis or the evolution of complexity [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2704.66s)]
*  in the universe. We're groping toward that. This is how science gets done. This is science in [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2708.9s)]
*  progress. We're taking some facts, some data, some observations, some factoids, and we're asking what [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2713.62s)]
*  is the bigger picture into which they all fit. So peak star formation, okay, that's one factoid. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2722.1s)]
*  Another is think a little bit more in detail about this process of structure formation in [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2728.26s)]
*  the universe. The universe starts very smooth, simple. Galaxies and stars and planets form over [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2735.86s)]
*  time. Eventually they will sweep away. In early days of my era of cosmology, one would do [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2742.5s)]
*  simulations of large scale structure, which only included dark matter in them. Okay, and the nice [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2752.58s)]
*  thing about dark matter is that number one, it's most of the matter in the universe, but also [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2757.54s)]
*  number two, it's simple. It's just gravity pushing it around. You don't get dark matter, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2762.02s)]
*  stars, supernovae, interstellar materials, magnetic fields, any of those complicated things. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2766.58s)]
*  These days, a really good cosmological simulation is going to include more than just dark matter, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2773.22s)]
*  but back in the day you would just look at dark matter. What happens is you start with a box of [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2778.98s)]
*  dark matter in your computer, not real dark matter, simulated dark matter, which is more or less [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2784.74s)]
*  smooth but not perfectly. What happens is as the universe expands and grows, gravity pulls together [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2790.02s)]
*  these slightly overdense regions into very overdense regions. It evacuates the regions which [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2796.82s)]
*  are slightly under dense. As I like to say, it turns up the contrast knob in the universe. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2803.62s)]
*  From our perspective of apparent complexity, the complexity that you get just by looking at the [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2808.98s)]
*  system, complexity goes up under that process. Of course, it's a much richer story if you start [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2814.5s)]
*  including all the details because you don't just increase the contrast. You start making new things [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2822.58s)]
*  that didn't exist before, not just galaxies, but also stars, planets, et cetera. There it's not [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2830.1s)]
*  just gravity. It's a balance of forces. This is where things get really interesting in terms [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2835.46s)]
*  of complexity coming into existence. Gravity is kind of a dumb force. It's long range, which makes [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2841.46s)]
*  it important in astrophysics and cosmology. It just accumulates the more matter you get. It doesn't [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2848.7400000000002s)]
*  cancel out like electromagnetism does. With electromagnetism, you have positive charges [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2853.94s)]
*  and negative charges. The earth has no net electric field around it, but has a net gravitational field. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2859.86s)]
*  Because there's only mass, there's not positive and negative charges, all gravity does is pull [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2866.66s)]
*  things together. If you have something like dark energy, it can push things apart, but in terms of [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2872.1s)]
*  particles or bodies, celestial objects, it just pulls them together. There's not a lot of room, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2877.06s)]
*  conceptually, for gravity all by itself to create truly complex structures. You get a little bit of [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2884.02s)]
*  an increase in apparent complexity, much like in the coffee cup, but you're not going to make [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2890.7400000000002s)]
*  a living being just out of the force of gravity. What you have in practice is that gravity does the [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2895.4599999999996s)]
*  initial work of pulling things together, but eventually other forces kick in. I mean forces [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2903.06s)]
*  in a broad sense. I know that sometimes in particle physics, we talk about the four forces of nature. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2910.3399999999997s)]
*  We talk about gravity, electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2915.8599999999997s)]
*  That's always been a fake. That's always been a sort of shorthand for saying that there are four [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2920.5s)]
*  different kinds of gauge bosons in the universe, but you also have the Higgs boson. Does that [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2926.66s)]
*  count as a force? Yeah, kind of it does, kind of it doesn't. What about the Pauli exclusion principle [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2933.62s)]
*  that says that two electrons or two fermions more generally cannot be in precisely the same [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2939.54s)]
*  quantum state? That leads to a force. It leads to the Pauli force, the electron degeneracy force, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2946.66s)]
*  if you want to call it that, a Fermi pressure in some sense. That's in some sense the most important [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2953.62s)]
*  force in our everyday lives. That's what keeps solid matter solid, the fact that electrons cannot [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2959.7s)]
*  be in the same quantum state. Otherwise, atoms could just be exactly on top of each other. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2965.7s)]
*  Atoms take up space because of the Pauli exclusion principle. That's a really important force in the [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2970.66s)]
*  scheme of things, even though it doesn't count as one of the four elementary particle physics forces. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2977.7s)]
*  The reason for that is that the word force is not actually fundamental in modern quantum field [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2983.22s)]
*  theory. There are quantum fields and they obey the equations that they obey. We human beings later on [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2988.98s)]
*  in our macroscopic lives find it convenient to refer to certain things as forces and certain [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=2996.82s)]
*  things as not forces, but who cares? That's not fundamental, that's not deep. In the broader [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3002.1000000000004s)]
*  conception of the word force, the fact that matter takes up space is crucially important. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3007.3s)]
*  Planets congeal, coalesce out of the intergalactic, the primordial soup in some sense, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3013.78s)]
*  and they only stop coalescing because they have pressure inside because they're solid. Stars coalesce, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3023.06s)]
*  they stop coalescing for a different reason, not because they're solid, but because nuclear [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3030.66s)]
*  reactions start going on in the center of the stars. Those nuclear reactions give rise to heat, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3037.46s)]
*  which gives rise to pressure, and you solve some equations. If you were an astronomy graduate [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3044.2599999999998s)]
*  student like I was, you would solve equations for hydrostatic equilibrium to understand stellar [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3049.14s)]
*  structure when you were in graduate school in a simple model. In some sense, planets and stars [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3055.46s)]
*  look similar, but in some sense they're very different. They're supported by very different [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3061.94s)]
*  kinds of things, thermal forces versus simply material solid forces. I'm pointing this out just [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3065.94s)]
*  to emphasize that there's a transition of some sort, because we're taking clues from what we see [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3073.7s)]
*  in the universe, there's a transition of some sort from simply gravity pulling things together to an [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3079.46s)]
*  interplay between a simply attractive force like gravity and a repulsive force like the pressure [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3086.3399999999997s)]
*  that you get inside a planet or a star. It's this interplay, this competition between two forces, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3092.02s)]
*  that allows complexity to really become interesting. If all you had in the world was gravity, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3098.42s)]
*  you wouldn't make very, very complex interesting structures, but we have a richer world than that. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3104.9s)]
*  Easy to say, easy to point to that feature of the world. What we want to do is understand in more [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3110.5s)]
*  detail what is precisely the features of these competing forces that allow complexity to come [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3115.78s)]
*  into existence. I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to give you the answer, but [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3121.3s)]
*  that's the kind of thing we're thinking about. Okay, so that was fact number two. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3124.66s)]
*  Fact number three, first fact was star formation slowing down, second fact was competition of [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3128.5s)]
*  forces. Third fact is the way that we're talking about complexogenesis is a particular way, and [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3134.1s)]
*  certainly my favorite way, but not the only way. What do I mean by that? The way that I'm talking [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3140.8199999999997s)]
*  about it is to imagine that in the early universe, we can debate exactly about what the word early [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3148.5s)]
*  means there, but in some sense of the word early universe, there was a configuration that was pretty [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3154.34s)]
*  darn smooth, but not exactly smooth. It was not exactly smooth, and therefore over cosmological [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3158.9s)]
*  time, regions that were just a little bit more dense than average could coalesce under the force [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3167.06s)]
*  of gravity and become denser, whereas other regions emptied out, and that leads to an increase in the [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3174.02s)]
*  apparent complexity of the configuration, but the later complexity is sort of inherent in the earlier [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3179.78s)]
*  configuration. In the approximation where all of the relevant physics is classical, that's a pretty [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3188.26s)]
*  good approximation on astrophysical scales, but there will always be exceptions. You could be [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3196.26s)]
*  Laplace's demon, right? You can imagine that the underlying physics is deterministic, if you knew, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3201.46s)]
*  and this is how you can simulate. When you simulate large-scale structure, it's a classical [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3207.22s)]
*  simulation. You're not really doing quantum mechanics there. You have a bunch of point particles, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3211.9399999999996s)]
*  and they have gravity, and maybe you can somehow simulate stars forming and supernovae exploding, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3216.98s)]
*  and things like that, but it's all mostly classical. Whatever complexity you get at [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3223.7799999999997s)]
*  late times was kind of inherent there in early times because the laws of physics are deterministic. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3232.18s)]
*  What we're saying is that the initial conditions have all of the capacity for the complexity to [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3239.22s)]
*  eventually come into existence, and all that's going on is that the ordinary laws of physics [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3249.14s)]
*  are bringing to life that sort of potential complexity. This is a very different picture [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3255.62s)]
*  than someone like Stephen Wolfram would advocate. Wolfram, another Mindscape guest, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3260.98s)]
*  we didn't talk too much about this aspect of his work, but one of his famous claims is that [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3266.26s)]
*  complexity in the universe can be thought of as arising in a way analogous to, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3272.82s)]
*  it's a little vague, but that's okay. You can be vague in the early days of constructing a bold new [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3278.34s)]
*  physical model, analogous to cellular automata. If you know the famous pictures that Wolfram [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3283.46s)]
*  always has in his books and in his talks and things like that of these grids, these two by two [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3290.74s)]
*  grids where you start at the top with some initial condition and then you evolve downward in time, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3296.2599999999998s)]
*  because he's a computer scientist, and you get black and white pixels lighting up according to [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3300.74s)]
*  some rule. Different cellular automata will have different rules, and what Wolfram was able to show [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3306.58s)]
*  is that you can start in a cellular automaton from extremely simple initial conditions, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3313.22s)]
*  ones that are basically if you have like a row of cubes or squares and the squares are either [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3320.5s)]
*  white or black, maybe all of them are white except for one, is black. It's very, very simple initial [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3326.2599999999998s)]
*  conditions. Then you just apply the update rule from the cellular automata to that and you get [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3331.7799999999997s)]
*  completely bizarre looking chaotic complex behavior later on. So that is super interesting [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3337.7s)]
*  in its own right. It's showing how complexity can arise out of simplicity, but there all of the work [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3345.7s)]
*  is being done by the dynamical law, by the rule that takes you from one configuration at one moment [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3353.22s)]
*  in time to the next configuration at the next moment in time. There the complexity was not [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3360.1s)]
*  inherent in the initial condition, it's inherent in the rules. It's absolutely [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3365.86s)]
*  allowed to contemplate that the complexity in the real world comes from something like that. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3374.9s)]
*  It's just completely incompatible with everything that we know about the fundamental laws of physics [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3380.42s)]
*  today. The laws of physics as we know them are deterministic except for wave function collapse, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3384.9s)]
*  of course that's a whole other thing, but they're mostly deterministic. Cosmologically speaking, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3390.82s)]
*  if you evolve the universe from a few years after the Big Bang to a few billion years after the Big [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3398.1000000000004s)]
*  Bang, it's very ordinary deterministic laws of physics that are giving rise to the increased [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3404.1800000000003s)]
*  complexity because it's all there in the initial condition. So maybe a Wolfram-esque attitude is [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3410.42s)]
*  going to eventually be the right one, but I'm always in this mode of being what John Wheeler [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3417.3s)]
*  called radically conservative. You start conservative in the sense that you stick with [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3423.22s)]
*  everything you know about the laws of physics, but then you're radical and that you push them as far [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3426.98s)]
*  as you can. So we're sticking with known laws of physics mostly, and in that picture, complexity [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3431.14s)]
*  does not arise from the laws, it arises from the initial conditions. Now I keep hesitating [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3436.98s)]
*  and stumbling because the world is fundamentally quantum mechanical. The things I just said are [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3444.2599999999998s)]
*  only true classically, and quantum mechanically things are a little bit different. Wave functions [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3449.86s)]
*  do collapse, or if like me you're an Everettian, decoherence happens and the wave function of the [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3455.7799999999997s)]
*  universe branches. And it turns out that this branching of the wave function is not just [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3461.38s)]
*  something that we can say, yeah it happens occasionally but it's not important. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3466.58s)]
*  In very interesting cosmological models, branching of the wave function is 100% [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3470.98s)]
*  necessary for this story of complexity that we're telling right now. In fact, this is a kind of a [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3476.66s)]
*  cool thing that I don't know if anyone has ever really emphasized when talking about cosmology. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3483.54s)]
*  If you believe in inflation, if you think that the universe underwent this period at very early [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3488.34s)]
*  times and was dominated by some almost constant dark energy, some super high energy dark energy, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3493.54s)]
*  whether it's an inflaton or something else, we have a story about how that initial configuration [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3500.02s)]
*  evolves into the present universe. And you may have heard this claim that galaxy formation [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3506.98s)]
*  ultimately comes from quantum fluctuations in the early universe. What does that mean? That means [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3513.06s)]
*  the quantum state during inflation is incredibly simple. And like we already said, it's incredibly [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3518.66s)]
*  low entropy. It's not just approximately smooth, it's exactly smooth. That's the difference. The [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3526.26s)]
*  quantum state of the universe during inflation is basically the vacuum state. It's basically as [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3533.14s)]
*  simple as it could possibly be. So where does all this initial condition data from which the later [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3538.58s)]
*  galaxies and planets arise, where does it come from? The answer is branching and decoherence. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3545.7s)]
*  The universe essentially observes itself. If you want to split the universe into sort of [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3553.7s)]
*  an environment part and a system part, maybe the system part is the large scale fluctuations in [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3559.8599999999997s)]
*  density. The environment part is the small scale configuration of individual photons and things [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3565.06s)]
*  like that. The initial wave function of the universe during inflation is kind of like a [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3570.1s)]
*  simple harmonic oscillator. It's a vacuum state, it's perfectly featureless, it's simple and so [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3577.06s)]
*  forth. And then after reheating, when you turn all that inflation energy into hot, dense matter, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3581.86s)]
*  and part of that matter acts like an environment, part acts like the system that has density [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3589.54s)]
*  fluctuations and things like that, you branch the wave function of the universe. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3594.58s)]
*  And what you're doing is you're branching an initially simple overall wave function of the [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3599.86s)]
*  universe into a combination of branches. And in each branch, things look complex and specific. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3605.22s)]
*  So this sounds a little bit kind of wild and new agey, but if you hang around cosmologists [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3614.1s)]
*  and they ever show you the picture of the cosmic microwave background, if you look at the image [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3621.22s)]
*  that you get from the Planck satellite or the WMAC satellite of the cosmic microwave background, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3625.9399999999996s)]
*  density fluctuations in the early universe, this is data. This is really what the universe looked [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3631.22s)]
*  like a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, very tiny fluctuations in temperature, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3636.58s)]
*  one part in 10 to the 5, from point to point. And it looks kind of random. It looks like some [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3642.18s)]
*  blotches of a little hot spot, cold spot, et cetera. And it is random statistically. We can [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3647.94s)]
*  be very, very specific about the power spectrum, the probability distribution of fluctuations. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3653.06s)]
*  So that map that you're seeing of density fluctuations or temperature fluctuations in [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3661.78s)]
*  the cosmic microwave background, we think is one particular realization of a random process. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3668.02s)]
*  And in this language of wave functions and branching, what that means is it's one particular [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3677.06s)]
*  observation, measurement of the initially featureless wave function of the universe. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3683.14s)]
*  So the early universe was truly simple in this picture, and we are only living on one branch of [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3690.3399999999997s)]
*  it that looks potentially complex. So quantum mechanics and the splitting of the universe into [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3697.14s)]
*  branches via decoherence plays a crucially important role in this story of complexogenesis. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3703.14s)]
*  We're still thinking about complexity so far in this very lowbrow sense, very simplistic way, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3710.2599999999998s)]
*  just like how complex does a system look? Okay, we're not worried about functions or interdependent [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3715.3799999999997s)]
*  motions of subsystems or much less, you know, goals or adaptations or anything like that. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3721.3799999999997s)]
*  But we're not done thinking about this sort of dumb version of complexity yet. So we said that [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3728.42s)]
*  it seems sensible and true that a closed system will start in low entropy and the entry will go [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3734.58s)]
*  up until it hits thermal equilibrium. It starts simple, then complexity can develop, and then the [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3741.94s)]
*  complexity will eventually go away. You will look simple again at the end of the day. This is true [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3747.62s)]
*  whether you are a cup of coffee with cream or whether you are the whole universe, right? So [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3752.1800000000003s)]
*  there's some robustness, but it's not inevitable. Okay, so think about the cup of coffee again. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3756.5s)]
*  Think about not stirring the cream into the coffee. Think about just letting it sit there. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3762.9s)]
*  You're not at zero temperature. It's not frozen, your cup of coffee, right? So individual coffee [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3769.62s)]
*  molecules and cream molecules will move around. They'll have their random thermal motions. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3774.34s)]
*  If you waited long enough, and it might be a long time to wait, but we have time, the cream and the [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3779.62s)]
*  coffee will mix into each other. They will gradually diffuse into each other. Unlike if you [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3784.82s)]
*  stir it with a spoon, there could be a sort of very gradual kind of simple transition from all [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3791.1400000000003s)]
*  the cream on top and all the coffee on the bottom to everything being mixed together. If you then [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3798.34s)]
*  plotted on a plot, on a graph, if you did some quantification of the complexity of that [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3803.94s)]
*  configuration, which you can do in that case, this is what Scott Aronson, Lauren Ouellette and I did [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3811.7s)]
*  in our paper. We defined a quantity called the apparent complexity of an image, which just says [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3817.46s)]
*  coarse-grained the image into cubes or whatever, and then compress it. Ask what is its algorithmic [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3825.7s)]
*  compressibility. There's this famous notion from Komolgorov and Chaitin called algorithmic [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3832.98s)]
*  compressibility. It says given some string, which an image is really a string, so you can take an [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3839.86s)]
*  image and just list what the value of the image is in every pixel, given a string, what is the shortest [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3845.06s)]
*  possible computer program that would output that string? If you had a simulation, this is what we [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3853.7000000000003s)]
*  actually did in our paper, you have a simulation. You have what we call the coffee automaton. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3860.98s)]
*  You have a grid n by n, and you have some white pixels and some black pixels, and they're going [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3867.38s)]
*  to mix together. Just like Laplace's demon, if you kept track of every white pixel and every black pixel, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3872.26s)]
*  there would be equal numbers of them, and you just have to tell me where every pixel was. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3878.6600000000003s)]
*  The total amount of information you would give me to specify the microstate of the theory never [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3883.2200000000003s)]
*  changes over time. You just have to tell me for every pixel what is its value. What we did is look [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3888.7400000000002s)]
*  at coarse-grained versions of that, which we said, okay, we have an n by n grid, but we're going to [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3894.98s)]
*  take some chunk of it, 10 by 10, a little part of it, and chunk the big n by n grid into 10 by 10 [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3899.94s)]
*  subgrids, and then average what's going on. This is exactly what your eyeballs do when you look at [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3907.54s)]
*  the cream and the coffee. You don't see every atom or every molecule. You see a coarse-grained [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3913.38s)]
*  version of, oh, that's pretty dark, that's pretty light, there must be a certain amount of coffee, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3918.58s)]
*  a certain amount of cream, etc. Then what this does is it's the difference between a random number [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3922.58s)]
*  and an ordered number. Let's pause to think about this. Pause to think about the concept [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3931.22s)]
*  of apparent complexity, which is what Scott and Lauren and I defined. If you have a number, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3935.7s)]
*  let's say you have a billion-digit number, and the number is a billion zeros all in a row. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3942.2599999999998s)]
*  Is that simple or complex? Well, that's pretty simple. I just gave you the whole number. I just [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3949.46s)]
*  told you zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, right? By ordinary standards, by the standards of [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3954.2599999999998s)]
*  Komalgrove complexity, I could output that number by writing a little computer program that said [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3959.22s)]
*  print quote zero and then do that a billion times or a quadrillion times, whatever. However, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3964.18s)]
*  long the number is, the computer program to print it out is pretty short. Whereas, what if you had [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3970.98s)]
*  just a random number, a random billion-digit number, billion digits of decimal representation [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3978.02s)]
*  of the number. The number is 3580199, etc. for a billion different digits. The shortest program [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3986.98s)]
*  that outputs that looks like print quote and then the number. You can't get shorter than that. It's [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=3996.1s)]
*  at least a billion characters long. If it's a quadrillion-digit number, then it's a quadrillion [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4002.42s)]
*  characters long, etc. That's why the algorithmic complexity of Komalgrove and Chaiten is [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4006.82s)]
*  interesting because it's asking you the question, is there a computer sciency way of compressing [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4012.9s)]
*  your description of how to output that number? If it's just a random number, then no, there's no way [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4019.94s)]
*  to compress it. You have to just tell me the whole number. But a random number doesn't have any [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4026.1000000000004s)]
*  structure to it. It doesn't feel to us like complexity. That's why we're defining apparent [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4031.06s)]
*  complexity. In the case of the digits of the number, let's say you have a billion-digit number, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4037.7s)]
*  but you don't tell me every number, every digit. Rather, you chunk it into sub-numbers, let's say [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4043.14s)]
*  a hundred digits long. Then you take the average of what's going on in those hundred digits. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4051.46s)]
*  If it's truly a random number, then in the hundred digits, if you take the average of it, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4058.18s)]
*  it's going to be five or four and a half or whatever. Maybe four or five fluctuating up and [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4064.8199999999997s)]
*  down. But there's much less variation in the average from place to place of a random number. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4070.74s)]
*  Whereas if there's a structured number that has zeros like 10 times in a row, but then one 10 [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4078.98s)]
*  times in a row and two 10 times in a row, where there's a little bit of compressibility, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4086.5s)]
*  then you are able to, even after coarse graining, then there's an output. I should have been more [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4091.62s)]
*  clear about this. I didn't complete the thought with the averaging. If you average over a hundred [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4099.78s)]
*  digits and you just get the same average again and again, then the Komolgorov complexity of that [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4104.02s)]
*  number is small. The Komolgorov complexity of the billion digit number is big. You have to tell me [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4111.06s)]
*  what every one of the digits are. But if the average of every hundred length digit substring [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4117.06s)]
*  is the same, then it's easy to output that. You can output the same number again and again, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4122.9800000000005s)]
*  just like if the whole number is just zero again and again and again. The apparent complexity of [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4128.5s)]
*  a random number is low. The apparent complexity of a string of a billion zeros is low. The [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4134.9s)]
*  apparent complexity of an intermediate number that has some structure but is not completely random [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4142.82s)]
*  or completely ordered will be high. It's just like the cup of coffee. It's capturing what we want to [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4148.099999999999s)]
*  do. Anyway, this was a slightly technical discourse from the Discursion. That's not the word I'm [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4154.42s)]
*  looking for. Detour, I guess, from what I'm trying to talk about here. The point is we do have, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4162.34s)]
*  in the case of the coffee or the automaton, a very quantitative way of telling you what the value of [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4169.3s)]
*  the complexity is. There's one little footnote there. This is what we can do in a solo podcast [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4176.9800000000005s)]
*  that I wouldn't have time to do in a seminar or something like that, or a public lecture, I guess. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4183.46s)]
*  In a seminar, I better do this. There is a footnote to Komolgorov complexity, which is that it is [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4188.9s)]
*  uncomputable, which is a problem. Komolgorov complexity is uncomputable for cool computer [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4194.0199999999995s)]
*  science reasons that go back to the halting problem of Alan Turing and his friends. You might think [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4200.82s)]
*  that for some string of numbers, you want to calculate its Komolgorov complexity. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4208.42s)]
*  So you say, what is the shortest program that will output it? Well, I don't know, but if I have a [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4213.54s)]
*  certain well-defined programming language, I could simply cycle through all the computer programs. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4219.139999999999s)]
*  I could make the shortest program and then the next shortest program and try all of them until [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4224.98s)]
*  I get to one that outputs this number. That would be my algorithm for finding the shortest program [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4229.38s)]
*  to output this number. The problem with that algorithm is it is doomed to fail because of what [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4234.82s)]
*  is called the halting problem. In computer science, famously, there is no general purpose way [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4239.86s)]
*  of looking at a computer program and telling me whether it will ever halt or not. If I try to [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4245.86s)]
*  just cycle through all the computer programs, starting with the shortest one and letting them [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4252.58s)]
*  get longer, I might hit ones that seem to go for a long time and they're not stopping. I might want [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4256.42s)]
*  to say, uh-oh, is this just an endless loop that I'm stuck in this computer program? In which case, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4262.58s)]
*  I could stop it, abort the process and start a new computer program. But in general, I never know. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4266.9s)]
*  Maybe it's just taking me a really long time. One of the features of Komodo Grove complexity is [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4273.62s)]
*  it depends on the length of the computer program but not on the amount of time that it runs. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4278.099999999999s)]
*  This makes, from a formal, strictly mathematical perspective, it makes the Komodo Grove complexity [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4284.66s)]
*  uncomputable. It is, however, estimatable in a large fraction of interesting cases. That's why [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4290.66s)]
*  in practice, you can have efficient, useful compression algorithms. Rather than actually [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4298.9800000000005s)]
*  calculating the Komodo Grove complexity of a coarse-grained image to define apparent complexity, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4305.62s)]
*  we just compressed it. We used GZIP and then we tested that the specific compression algorithm [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4310.82s)]
*  that we used didn't really matter. You get the same answer in all the different cases. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4316.26s)]
*  Okay, good. All of which is to say, in this simple-minded case of just the grid of squares being [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4321.06s)]
*  yes or no or zero or one or white or black or whatever, given a coarse-graining and giving a [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4328.34s)]
*  compression algorithm, we can calculate the apparent complexity and given a dynamical ski [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4333.46s)]
*  for letting that algorithm run over time and having the coffee molecules and the cream molecules mix [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4339.860000000001s)]
*  in with each other, we could plot the growth and then eventual decay of complexity. The prediction [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4346.66s)]
*  is the complexity starts low, it goes up, and then it goes back down again. But like I said, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4352.9s)]
*  you can imagine dynamics for the cream and the coffee where it doesn't go up. If you just have [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4359.54s)]
*  cream and coffee molecules mixing in with each other, like diffusing independently with no spoon [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4365.86s)]
*  stirring it or anything like that, then maybe it doesn't ever look very complex. This is the [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4372.179999999999s)]
*  reason why we have to revise our paper that we initially submitted because there was a bug in our [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4377.86s)]
*  way of measuring the complexity of these images and we fixed it, but we didn't revise the paper [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4384.099999999999s)]
*  yet. So that's upcoming, I promise. One of the reasons why I keep talking about it in public is [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4390.099999999999s)]
*  to guilt myself into actually doing the work of revising the paper and putting it back in the [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4394.42s)]
*  revised version online. Here's the trick. You can come up in the coffee automaton, where it's just [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4399.139999999999s)]
*  a bunch of white squares and black squares and some update rule that says how do the white and [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4406.42s)]
*  black squares move throughout the grid. You can come up with different rules. One rule might be [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4412.42s)]
*  that for every two nearest neighbors, there is a percentage chance per time step that they will [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4418.82s)]
*  interchange with each other. If it's two black squares, they interchange, doesn't make any [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4426.18s)]
*  difference. But if they're white and black and they interchange, then it does make a difference [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4429.78s)]
*  to the overall image. You can just run that algorithm and guess what? You never get any [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4432.98s)]
*  complexity in that particular algorithm. That is kind of like the particles diffusing in the real [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4438.419999999999s)]
*  cream and coffee with each other. It's just smooth and featureless and it never looks complex. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4445.86s)]
*  We were eventually able, and this will appear in the revised version, we came up with a [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4451.0599999999995s)]
*  different algorithm which we call the tectonic model, which says the following, that rather than [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4455.62s)]
*  individual squares in the grid, you look at two nearest neighbors and ask if there's a percentage [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4461.14s)]
*  chance that they will interchange with each other, you look at a finite sized block of the grid and [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4466.660000000001s)]
*  you randomly choose both the size of the block and the orientation. Is it horizontal or vertical? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4474.18s)]
*  And then you randomly move it to the left or to the right. We're careful that there are rules that [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4479.38s)]
*  you keep the total number of white and black squares constant. Basically, you put it on a [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4486.02s)]
*  torus and trust me, we did all those things correctly. We finally got it right. And the [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4490.660000000001s)]
*  difference there between the sort of individual nearest neighbor interactions versus the tectonic [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4494.9800000000005s)]
*  model where you have large scale coherent interaction turns out to be completely important. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4500.820000000001s)]
*  The upshot is that the nearest neighbor interaction model doesn't ever become complex. The [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4508.26s)]
*  complexity always stays low as entropy goes from zero to maximum. The tectonic model where there [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4513.62s)]
*  are these coherent motions, large scale agreement between different pixels about what they're doing, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4520.58s)]
*  that's when you get complexity. That is much more analogous to like putting the spoon in there and [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4528.0199999999995s)]
*  stirring it, even though there's no external spoon coming in. It's still internal dynamics to the [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4533.46s)]
*  coffee cup, but it's sort of coherent dynamics. There's large scale effects. To us, that's extremely [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4537.54s)]
*  provocative. That result, right? This is saying that some kinds of dynamics are going to make [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4544.42s)]
*  complexity come into existence. Some kinds are not. The existence of sort of long range forces [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4550.42s)]
*  or long range coherence seems to be playing a role. Again, we don't have the once and for all list of [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4557.7s)]
*  here are the qualities you need in your system, the properties in order to get complexity to develop, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4564.1s)]
*  but this is a clue. This is a hint. This is pushing us in a certain direction. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4569.38s)]
*  I suspect that there's some mathematical result that says that complexity must be low at low [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4574.34s)]
*  entropy because there's just not a lot of different things the system can do. Complexity must be low [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4580.42s)]
*  at high entropy because everything is in equilibrium and pretty smooth. Complexity is allowed to be high [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4585.38s)]
*  at medium entropy, but whether or not it actually achieves that large complexity along the way from [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4592.34s)]
*  low entropy to high entropy depends on the details. That's what we would like to better understand. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4597.78s)]
*  Clearly, the universe does this. The universe has large scale coherent motions. That's what gravity [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4603.86s)]
*  does. Gravity is large scale and coherent like the tectonic model in the coffee cup. We're seeing [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4610.0199999999995s)]
*  a little bit of a hint of maybe some answers to the question, what are the properties you need [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4618.34s)]
*  in the laws of physics in order for complexity to arise? Again, the very most simple system and the [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4625.22s)]
*  very most simple definition of complexity that you may have. That's the result that we have in hand. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4634.02s)]
*  What I've been trying to do for a while and I'm still working on is pushing beyond that result [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4640.34s)]
*  to be more realistic, to think really about statistical mechanics and different forces and [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4645.86s)]
*  entropy and quantifiable formulas. We have a bunch of ideas and none of them is quite ready for prime [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4651.38s)]
*  time yet, so I'm not going to be laying any of those ideas on you, but I'm going to give you some [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4657.7s)]
*  hints in the remaining time about how I see all of this big picture fitting together. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4662.66s)]
*  Basically, here's what I see. I think it's a story of information. I haven't really used the word [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4670.099999999999s)]
*  information that much yet. I've used it in the sense of saying how much information you need to [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4675.14s)]
*  give me to specify some configuration or something like that in the definition of complexity, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4680.26s)]
*  but information is another one of these words like entropy or like complexity that has different [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4687.3s)]
*  definitions and appears in different avatars, different guises, and we have to be very, very [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4693.22s)]
*  clear on what we mean. In particular, let me explain something that sadly never, not never, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4698.5s)]
*  but rarely gets explained and is very confusing. What is the relationship between entropy and [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4705.3s)]
*  information? The reason why I say it as explicitly as this is because a computer scientist and a [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4712.82s)]
*  physicist will give you opposite answers to this question. They both mean true things, but slightly [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4720.02s)]
*  different things. Computer scientists or even, I should say, maybe engineers, communications people, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4726.74s)]
*  they hearken back to Claude Shannon. Claude Shannon is the founder of information theory, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4734.66s)]
*  and he had a very specific question in mind. He was working at Bell Labs. He was interested in [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4739.94s)]
*  knowing what is the best way to send signals across the transatlantic cable in a way that would convey [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4745.139999999999s)]
*  information while being robust against noise. If you try to convey a signal across large distances, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4751.38s)]
*  you might get noise in there. It might degrade because of random fluctuations that you don't [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4759.9400000000005s)]
*  have any control over. Shannon invented formulas for the information content of a message, and [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4763.54s)]
*  he realized in stories about this where he was talking to John von Neumann, etc. The formulas [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4771.38s)]
*  look mathematically just like the formulas for entropy from statistical mechanics in the following [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4777.22s)]
*  sense and for the following reason. What Shannon realized is if I'm sending a signal [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4783.62s)]
*  with a certain number of bits, and I want to maximize the information content in that signal, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4789.46s)]
*  what do I have to do? Well, let's say the signal is just zeros and ones. What I'm interested in [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4794.42s)]
*  is learning something I didn't know before. That's what information really means. If I already knew [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4801.22s)]
*  it, if you tell me a fact that I already knew, I don't really gain a lot of information. The example [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4806.66s)]
*  I like to use is if someone says, the sun rose in the east this morning, and they are very reliable, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4812.0199999999995s)]
*  you believe what they say, so they sent a sentence to you, but you didn't really learn a lot of [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4818.099999999999s)]
*  information. You already knew that the sun rose in the east basically every day. That was already [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4822.74s)]
*  your expectation. But if that same reliable person tells you the sun rose in the west this morning, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4828.58s)]
*  and you think they are reliable, and they're not joking with you, and they didn't make a mistake, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4836.02s)]
*  suddenly you've learned a lot. You've learned a lot because even though the message was just as [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4839.780000000001s)]
*  long, the word east and the word west are exactly as long as each other, it conveys much more [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4845.7s)]
*  information because it is so surprising. Shannon worked out that if you want to convey the most [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4851.780000000001s)]
*  information in a message, what you want to do is make every bit or every word or every part of the [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4858.42s)]
*  message as surprising as it can be. Now they can't be perfectly surprising. You know you're going [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4864.82s)]
*  to get something. So what he said is, imagine you have a frequency of getting different signals, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4870.66s)]
*  or if you want to put it this way, a probability distribution. So if you're getting zeros and ones, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4875.94s)]
*  what's the probability the next digit is going to be a zero or the next digit is going to be a one? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4881.46s)]
*  And what he realized is that to maximize the information content, you want that probability [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4887.62s)]
*  to be uniform. You want it to be maximally spread out. Like in the English language, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4892.82s)]
*  when you if you're just getting letters one by one in a telegram message, when you get the letter Q, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4898.74s)]
*  usually the letter U is going to follow it, right? When you get a word beginning with TH, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4905.78s)]
*  maybe you'll be the. It might need not be the. There's plenty of words beginning with TH, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4911.299999999999s)]
*  but that's the most common word, and therefore you're learning less from getting that signal [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4915.86s)]
*  than you would if every little word or every little symbol in your message was equally probable. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4921.14s)]
*  And he quantified this and he quantified it in a way that led him to a formula, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4928.1s)]
*  which was exactly the formula for entropy that Boltzmann and Gibbs and their friends came up with. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4932.1s)]
*  And the way it works is high entropy is high information. You know, high entropy in the [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4937.38s)]
*  statistical mechanical sense is everything spread out. Everything's equally likely, right? A uniform [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4943.54s)]
*  probability distribution. If you're low entropy, then your probability distribution is localized [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4948.34s)]
*  and peaked on some certain set of configurations. And if you take your messages from a highly [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4954.34s)]
*  localized, highly peaked probability distribution, none of them are surprising. You're not learning [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4961.14s)]
*  a lot. OK, so in information theory, as Claude Shannon thinks about it, high entropy means high [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4965.9400000000005s)]
*  information because high entropy means a uniform probability distribution. That means every little [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4974.18s)]
*  bit of your message is meaningful. It contains some non-trivial information. It's not just redundant [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4979.54s)]
*  or predictable from the start. OK, communication theory, high entropy equals high information. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4985.62s)]
*  Physics has a very different point of view. In fact, the version of entropy that we've been talking [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4991.9400000000005s)]
*  about, the one that Boltzmann had, remember, there's different versions of entropy, just like [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=4998.18s)]
*  different versions of information or complexity. So Boltzmann's definition of entropy is the [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5001.62s)]
*  logarithm of how many microstates are in your macrostate, where your macrostate is the set of [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5007.0599999999995s)]
*  microstates that macroscopically look the same to you. High entropy means there are many, many [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5014.26s)]
*  microstates in your macrostate. Low entropy means that there are very few microstates in your [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5019.62s)]
*  macrostate. So let's ask the question, if I tell you what macrostate I'm in, how much did I just [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5024.18s)]
*  tell you about the microstate? How much information is there about the specific microstate in the [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5032.34s)]
*  macrostate information? Right? Well, the answer is if you're in a high entropy macrostate, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5039.9400000000005s)]
*  and I tell you you're in a high entropy macrostate, you know very little about the microstate, [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5047.62s)]
*  because by definition of entropy, there are many, many, many microstates that could have been in [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5053.78s)]
*  that high entropy macrostate. Whereas, if I tell you that you're in some specific low entropy [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5059.78s)]
*  macrostate, there aren't that many microstates in that low entropy macrostate, so you have learned [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5066.34s)]
*  a lot. You have gained a lot of information by being told that your physical system is in a low [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5073.46s)]
*  entropy macrostate. So to physicists, or at least physicists in this sort of Boltzmannian mode, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5080.5s)]
*  low entropy means high information, and high entropy means low information. So the communication [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5088.02s)]
*  theorists or information theorists think that information and entropy are in the same direction. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5095.62s)]
*  Physicists, statistical mechanics physicists anyway, thinking in Boltzmann's way, think that [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5102.1s)]
*  information and entropy are opposite to each other. Okay? And I'm giving you that because, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5107.22s)]
*  you know, why not? I might as well help clarify something that you might be confused about, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5112.02s)]
*  but we're being physicists now. We're being Boltzmannian statistical mechanics now, so we're [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5115.860000000001s)]
*  using a language where a low entropy state contains a lot of information. To be slightly [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5123.06s)]
*  more specific about that, to tell you that the system, whether it's the universe or the coffee [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5131.46s)]
*  cup or a box of gas or whatever, is in some specific low entropy state, is to convey to you [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5136.82s)]
*  a great amount of information about its possible microstates. It's very, very constraining, very, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5142.9s)]
*  very specific. You've learned a lot, okay? And the reason why we want to talk that way is because we [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5147.7s)]
*  know that the early universe was in a very, very specific low entropy state. So that fact, telling [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5154.66s)]
*  you the state of the early universe conveys an enormous amount of information. And we know that [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5162.58s)]
*  as the universe evolves and time goes on, entropy will go up. So we go to a state where just knowing [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5169.86s)]
*  the macro state of the universe has almost no information in it. In other words, the available [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5176.26s)]
*  information, let's define the available information as the difference between the maximum entropy the [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5183.54s)]
*  state could be in, in this Boltzmannian sense, and the actual entropy that it has right now. So if it's [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5190.74s)]
*  in maximum entropy, the available information is zero. If it's in a low entropy state, very, very low [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5197.94s)]
*  compared to maximum, the available information is basically equal to the maximum entropy. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5204.82s)]
*  And in that conception, what is happening in the evolution of the universe is that there is a [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5211.0599999999995s)]
*  resource that we have to use, that we have in the sense that we're able to use a resource of [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5216.98s)]
*  available information. Okay, I'm saying it this way because usually in physics, we would talk about [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5223.7s)]
*  free energy. Free energy is sort of the ordered amount of energy. This is what Schrodinger would [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5232.419999999999s)]
*  have talked about when he wrote What is Life? He talked about neg entropy. It's kind of a silly word [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5238.66s)]
*  that I don't like to use, but because it's the entropy is never negative. He just meant the [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5244.34s)]
*  difference between the maximum entropy and the actual entropy, the amount downward you go from [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5248.34s)]
*  the maximum to where you are, which I'm calling the available information. He was not thinking [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5253.860000000001s)]
*  about information theory at the time. But if you multiply that entropy by the temperature, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5258.42s)]
*  you get an energy. And basically, the entropy times the temperature is the useless energy. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5265.860000000001s)]
*  And the difference between T times S and the total energy is the useful energy, the free energy, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5272.900000000001s)]
*  the energy that we can use to do work. And what Schrodinger's point was when he wrote What is Life? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5278.660000000001s)]
*  Is that a living creature uses free energy from the sun or from wherever to metabolize and to [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5286.820000000001s)]
*  self repair and to learn and to do things. And that is the characteristic of what life is. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5295.7s)]
*  Life is not the only system that does that. A fire does that. If you have some wood and you light it [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5303.3s)]
*  on fire, it is converting free energy into useless high entropy dissipated energy. So it's easy to do, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5309.38s)]
*  but a living creature will do that kind of thing in an orderly, constructive way. This is all very [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5316.179999999999s)]
*  vague because the definition of life is all very vague. But you get the point. As you burn something [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5322.9s)]
*  or metabolize your food or mix cream into coffee, you're losing, you're using up a resource. That [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5330.5s)]
*  resource is the available information provided by the difference between the thermal equilibrium [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5338.58s)]
*  entropy maximum, maximum entropy and the actual entropy that your system is in. The more you [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5344.74s)]
*  burn and dissipate, the more you increase the entropy, the less available information you have. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5350.18s)]
*  If you're in a thermal system with a temperature, you can convert that to a free energy way of [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5355.54s)]
*  thinking. But I think the information theory way of thinking is actually more general, more robust. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5360.58s)]
*  Sometimes there's no heat bath that you're in. Sometimes you want to think more generally than [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5366.26s)]
*  that. So forget about temperature. Just think about entropy and information and define the [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5370.58s)]
*  available information to be that difference. Maximum entropy versus actual entropy. We use [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5375.38s)]
*  that up over time. Why am I dwelling on this? Because I think that as we go past the simple-minded, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5380.900000000001s)]
*  apparent complexity of the coffee cup or the large scale structure of the universe, to think about [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5390.74s)]
*  more sophisticated versions of complexity, what's really going on is subsystems of the universe [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5397.54s)]
*  coming up with better ways to take advantage of that resource, of the available information [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5405.38s)]
*  resource. We are using it up. We are chewing our cud and we're sweating and we're doing global [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5412.58s)]
*  warming. We're basically increasing entropy of the universe, mixing cream into our coffee. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5420.02s)]
*  Sometimes we're using that power for good. We're using that resource to do something interesting [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5425.14s)]
*  and complex. My hypothesis is that the story of complexogenesis is going to be a story of stages. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5429.94s)]
*  We do things in more and more sophisticated ways that we recognize as more and more complex. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5439.62s)]
*  Let me put a little bit more meat on those bones, but honestly not that much meat. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5448.339999999999s)]
*  We're going to be a little vague here because I think that the understanding actually is vague. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5452.74s)]
*  The story we told about the coffee and the cream, the apparent complexity, is a very low-brow [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5456.98s)]
*  version of complexity. There is information. You are using it up as you are increasing the entropy [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5465.7s)]
*  of your coffee and cream system, but you're using it up in a dumb, simple-minded way. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5472.5s)]
*  The next level where you use that information a little bit more cleverly is maybe what we could [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5477.94s)]
*  call it as metastable complexity. Here I think that the typical physicist wouldn't even be [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5485.3s)]
*  thinking about information, but I think that maybe it's part of a bigger picture. Information is the [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5491.46s)]
*  right way to think about it. I'm thinking about the difference that we already mentioned between [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5496.42s)]
*  a planet and a star. Planets and stars are both more or less stable configurations of matter [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5500.9800000000005s)]
*  over billion-year timescales. Eventually stars die. They don't last forever, but over a very long [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5511.14s)]
*  time, stars are just sitting there looking more or less the same from moment to moment, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5517.62s)]
*  and a planet is just sitting there looking more or less the same from moment to moment, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5521.9400000000005s)]
*  but for very different reasons. The planet is not using up any resource. It's just mechanically [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5526.18s)]
*  stable. It's a simple-minded, brute way of being more or less the same from moment to moment. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5533.54s)]
*  The star is using a resource. It's stable because it has fuel inside in the form of [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5540.74s)]
*  either protons or some other light nuclei that can undergo nuclear fusion into heavier nuclei [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5551.62s)]
*  through various processes that astronomers love to talk about, but there's only a finite amount [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5558.58s)]
*  of fuel. If you turn all your protons into helium, you've used up your protons. Eventually, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5563.14s)]
*  you'll turn them into iron or something like that, but maybe that's much later on, and then you stop [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5567.700000000001s)]
*  being stable, and then the star either collapses or goes supernova or whatever. This is, again, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5573.860000000001s)]
*  not a very sophisticated use of information, but it is an example of maintaining stability [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5580.820000000001s)]
*  by using up some fuel. Stars do that. Planets do not. As an aside, galaxies are sort of interesting [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5589.38s)]
*  special case. They're an intermediate case. Galaxies are not exactly stable. Like a star, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5599.06s)]
*  galaxies do evolve over time, but if you do the detail ... Galaxies will not last forever. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5606.820000000001s)]
*  Galaxies are not maximum entropy configurations, and the reason they're not is because you can [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5613.54s)]
*  always increase the entropy of a galaxy by through the various gravitational interactions of the [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5619.14s)]
*  stars. Let's forget about stars evolving and exploding, whatever. Think of stars as point [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5625.14s)]
*  masses that last forever, and just think about a gravitating system with a bunch of point masses [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5629.62s)]
*  in it. You might think that you find some stable configuration. If you only had two stars, and you [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5633.78s)]
*  were completely Newtonian in your gravity, then you could be completely stable. They would just go [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5641.78s)]
*  in ellipses around each other. There are even certain very special cases of three-body systems [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5646.5s)]
*  in Newtonian gravity that can last forever, but the generic case when you have many objects in [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5652.099999999999s)]
*  Newtonian gravity that are just point masses is what you can do is have interactions between the [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5658.42s)]
*  different masses such that one of them gets flung out of the system. It escapes and runs out of the [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5664.9s)]
*  system. It reaches escape velocity just through its gravitationally bumping into other stars, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5670.74s)]
*  and it flings outward, and the rest of the system contracts a little bit. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5677.38s)]
*  The overall total energy of the system remains constant, but the entropy goes up through the [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5682.74s)]
*  contraction of most of the stars. This is literally what happens when you form a galaxy or whatever. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5689.38s)]
*  Those galaxies are going to continue to contract over time by spitting out stars. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5694.900000000001s)]
*  They're not perfectly stable, and the entropy is increasing, but when you run the numbers, [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5700.900000000001s)]
*  that process is very slow. Galaxies can look stable for a long time without really increasing [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5706.66s)]
*  in entropy, even though it's not really mechanical stability like the Earth. It's not really like the [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5712.900000000001s)]
*  stars are pressing up against each other. It's just that the gravity is a weak force, and the time it [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5717.54s)]
*  takes for the entropy to increase is very slow. This is just a reminder that physics is complicated, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5722.66s)]
*  and the universe is very complicated. Anyway, the point is that the existence of this resource, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5728.82s)]
*  this decrement between the maximum entropy we can have and the actual entropy we do have, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5738.74s)]
*  makes a way for certain systems to be metastable like stars, namely to use up fuel and to [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5744.74s)]
*  use that fuel to maintain some steady state of some sort, a non-equilibrium steady state [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5752.34s)]
*  configuration. We mentioned this idea when talking to Addy Prost in the context of life. He has [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5758.98s)]
*  kinetic stability, kinetic dynamical stability, which is a slightly different thing that a [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5766.0199999999995s)]
*  chemist would care about, but this is like the physics version of that. Still, stars are not [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5771.7s)]
*  very complex. It's not very exciting. If that's as complex as you could get, it would not be [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5776.82s)]
*  worth writing home about. There's other systems like, think about the atmosphere of Jupiter. I'm [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5782.66s)]
*  not sure if this is the best example, but it's an example. If you take these pictures of Jupiter, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5789.139999999999s)]
*  it's gorgeous. There's all this stuff going on, these different colors. The great red spot is [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5794.74s)]
*  there. Other spots sort of come and go. The great red spot survives for a long time. That seems [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5799.7s)]
*  more complex than a star. It's still not clever. It's still not goal-oriented or adaptive or [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5806.66s)]
*  anything like that, but there's clearly substructure that persists for some reason. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5813.62s)]
*  I can guarantee you, even though I haven't gone through the calculations, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5821.22s)]
*  it wouldn't persist if there were not an input of low entropy energy in there. There's some dynamics [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5824.9s)]
*  going on. The atmosphere of Jupiter is not exactly the same from moment to moment. It's not frozen [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5832.74s)]
*  like the topography of the moon or something like that. It's dynamic, but it's clearly also not just [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5837.46s)]
*  maximum entropy all by itself. There are subsystems. There are components that are interacting with [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5843.38s)]
*  each other. We're beginning to see, even though it's again nothing like a living organism, but [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5850.099999999999s)]
*  we're beginning to see something that we would more viscerally recognize as complexity, this sort [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5855.219999999999s)]
*  of modular kind of thing where things break into subsystems, each of which plays a different role, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5861.22s)]
*  and again, dependent on this resource that we're using up. If the sun disappeared and Jupiter has [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5867.22s)]
*  radioactive elements inside that heat it up, and so if all that energy production mechanism, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5876.1s)]
*  low entropy energy production mechanisms, ceased, you would get rid of all the structure in the [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5882.02s)]
*  atmosphere of Jupiter. It's a temporary, somewhat steady state, persistent, but not forever kind of [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5888.1s)]
*  configuration that is dependent on this resource that we're using up. Clearly, the big leap is [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5895.9400000000005s)]
*  from this sort of structured complexity, but the kind of dumb complexity that you would see in the [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5904.660000000001s)]
*  atmosphere of Jupiter, to something more like a living being, the origin of life. I'm not here [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5910.58s)]
*  to tell you how life began, that's an open question, we don't know all the details about that, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5915.94s)]
*  but clearly it's sort of very intuitive that living beings are more complex [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5920.82s)]
*  than non-living beings, and how can we think about that? Again, I think it is a matter of [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5927.78s)]
*  a living being is able to take advantage of its information-rich environment, its low entropy [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5936.58s)]
*  environment, to persist. Schrodinger's definition of a living organism, somewhat tongue in cheek, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5943.78s)]
*  but he had something going on in his mind, was something that kept on moving long after it [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5951.38s)]
*  should have stopped. What he has in mind is if he put a rock into a bowl of water, the rock will [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5957.86s)]
*  just fall to the bottom and then just sit there, it will move. If you put a goldfish in a bowl of [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5964.259999999999s)]
*  water, it will move around for quite a while, as long as it has food, as long as it has that [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5971.46s)]
*  information resource that it can take advantage of, it can maintain its structural integrity [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5975.94s)]
*  and keep moving around, and that's what makes it living. It's using that resource to maintain its [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5981.14s)]
*  stability. If the food supply gets cut off, the goldfish dies and it becomes more like the rock. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5987.14s)]
*  So I'm sure there are many, many people out there in the world who just have a much more sophisticated [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5993.38s)]
*  view of this than I do, because I don't know a lot about biology, but if we talk to Chris Kempis [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=5999.22s)]
*  or Adi Pras or Michael Wong or any of those people who we recently talked to about this stuff, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6004.02s)]
*  they would have a picture of how living beings take in information and use it to survive. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6009.54s)]
*  The one example I know of is kind of amusing because it's sort of an example of making a [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6015.860000000001s)]
*  prediction, even though it's a prediction in the sense that I didn't know what the answer was, the [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6021.3s)]
*  rest of the world knew what the answer was. There's this very well-known phenomenon called [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6024.58s)]
*  chemotaxis. If you put a bacterium in a petri dish with more nutrients on one side than on the other [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6029.3s)]
*  side of the dish, so there's a gradient, lots of nutrients on one side, very few nutrients on the [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6036.9s)]
*  other, the bacteria, even though they sort of from moment to moment look like they're thrashing around, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6042.34s)]
*  will in general move toward the direction of more nutrients, right? Somehow they're smart enough to [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6046.9s)]
*  know that they will be happier, they will live longer if they're in the more nutrient-rich [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6052.5s)]
*  environment. Now that by itself doesn't seem that complex, right? After all, if I put a ball on a [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6056.74s)]
*  hill, the ball will roll down the hill, and that doesn't require a lot of information knowledge [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6064.66s)]
*  or anything like that. It's just the ball is instantaneously responding to the forces that [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6070.02s)]
*  are being exerted on it. How is that any different from what the bacterium is doing? So I thought [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6074.98s)]
*  about it and I thought, you know, if this picture of information as a resource is right, and this [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6080.74s)]
*  picture of life as a more sophisticated complex system than a rock is right, then maybe the [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6087.54s)]
*  bacterium is not simply mindlessly responding to the gradient and nutrients and moving in that [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6095.46s)]
*  direction. Maybe there is something interior to the bacterium that is keeping track. This is the [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6101.94s)]
*  next level of complexity, you know, over and above just modularity, but actually literally keeping a [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6109.38s)]
*  record that is informationally rich. So in information theory terms, you would have [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6116.02s)]
*  mutual information between the state of the bacterium's interior and the state of the nutrient [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6123.54s)]
*  gradient in the outside world. It turns out this is right. I thought about this and I looked it up [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6132.42s)]
*  and indeed there are proteins inside the bacteria that basically keep track of the direction in which [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6138.98s)]
*  the nutrients are bigger. So yeah, the bacterium really is directly and manifestly taking advantage [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6145.94s)]
*  of that informational resource that it has to use. If the interior of the bacterium were in thermal [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6155.3s)]
*  equilibrium or maximum entropy, it would not be able to keep track of what the exterior environment [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6161.38s)]
*  is doing. If you remember the podcast we did with Christopher Adami, Christophe Adami, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6168.66s)]
*  he made a big deal about information theory and life and the way that he puts it is that the whole [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6176.1s)]
*  genome of a living being has a very high mutual information with the whole environment it's in, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6181.22s)]
*  in the sense that the genome of the living being is selected to survive in that environment. So [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6187.3s)]
*  there's a lot of relationship between what the genome is. A genome that makes you able to survive [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6195.06s)]
*  underwater is very different than a genome that makes you able to survive on land. So that can be [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6200.820000000001s)]
*  quantified using information theory and I think it all fits very nicely into this picture. Of course, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6206.1s)]
*  beyond just being a living being, there's the next stage that you would like to talk about which is [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6211.46s)]
*  a thinking living being. And you know, look, you can go on about this in great detail, but now we're [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6218.1s)]
*  into the realm of biology. We're in the realm, not the biology is not interesting, but it's, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6225.22s)]
*  there's a bunch of people studying it already, okay? Like the physicists have very little to [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6229.86s)]
*  offer here compared to the real biologists who know what they're doing. There is a famous book [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6234.34s)]
*  that caused a lot of impact and people still talk about it. You know, impact is, can be both positive [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6241.22s)]
*  and negative, or at least can be controversial as well as praiseworthy. There's a book called The [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6247.06s)]
*  Major Evolutionary Transitions. I have trouble pronouncing these people's, this person's name, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6251.54s)]
*  but it's by Eors Smaathmari, Szaathmary, S-Z-A-T-H-M-A-R-Y, I presume Hungarian name, and John Maynard [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6257.3s)]
*  Smith. So these are both, you know, working evolutionary biologists, the major evolutionary [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6267.3s)]
*  transitions, and what they tried to do was to pinpoint moments in the history of evolution [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6271.46s)]
*  where not just you have a new species or whatever, but you have a new kind of mode of living. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6277.860000000001s)]
*  And what interestingly, what they ended up concluding is that the way to think about these [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6284.5s)]
*  evolutionary transitions, like, you know, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, or from single celled [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6290.58s)]
*  organisms to multiple cellular organisms, then all the way up to like language use and things [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6295.62s)]
*  like that. The common thread that they identified was the use of information, really the transmission [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6299.86s)]
*  of information, which is a little bit different, but it's still along the same general lines. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6307.7s)]
*  I've learned recently actually from talking to David Crackauer here at SFI that there are real [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6313.62s)]
*  biologists who are skeptical, or poo poo, the book, because a lot of the pinpointing of major [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6318.26s)]
*  evolutionary transitions by Safmarian Smith was based on feelings. It was not quite as rigorous [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6325.46s)]
*  and quantitative as you might like. But okay, that to me, that's not a criticism, that just means [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6332.9800000000005s)]
*  they're making a hypothesis. Now we got to think about it. So the common idea is that [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6339.54s)]
*  once you get into life, you have an enormous number of things that you can do, the space of [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6347.06s)]
*  possibilities is much bigger. And a lot of that space consists of how can we use the information [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6352.5s)]
*  resource that we have to survive in this difficult world that we're in? One such thing, I'm mentioning [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6359.3s)]
*  a lot of former Mindscape guests, but Malcolm McIver was a Mindscape guest in the early days, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6367.62s)]
*  and he talked about how there was a transition when fish climbed onto land. When you're a fish, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6373.22s)]
*  when you live under the water, you're swimming around, and the attenuation length of light in [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6379.14s)]
*  water is rather short, it's meters, roughly speaking, and you're swimming in meters per second, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6384.820000000001s)]
*  so you can't see that far in front of you. When you see something, you don't have that much time [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6389.38s)]
*  to react to it. Okay, you better either decide right away whether it's friend or foe or food. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6395.700000000001s)]
*  And whereas, when you climb on the land, now you can see essentially forever, you can see [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6401.860000000001s)]
*  things that are far away, and therefore a new mode of information use, information processing, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6408.74s)]
*  opens up to you. When you are a fish, the only evolutionarily useful mode of information [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6415.3s)]
*  processing is you see something and you react to it. When you're on land, you can see something and [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6420.9s)]
*  you can think about it, you can plan, you can imagine different hypothetical scenarios and [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6426.099999999999s)]
*  sit and contemplate which one of those will be the best. Should I run up on that tree? Should I [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6434.18s)]
*  hide behind the rock? Should I attack this thing? You know, whatever you want to do. And that costs [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6438.820000000001s)]
*  resources to think about things, right? Thinking in the brain is an energetically costly thing, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6444.9800000000005s)]
*  but if it gives you a survival advantage, evolution will eventually find it. That is an even more [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6451.780000000001s)]
*  sophisticated version of using the information resource that we have that gives rise to a level [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6458.34s)]
*  of complexity that the little bacterium can only imagine, or could not even imagine because it [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6464.58s)]
*  doesn't have the capacity for imagining. So all of this is to say, I think you can see the vague [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6469.860000000001s)]
*  outline of a picture of stages of increasing complexity in the physical world characterized [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6479.22s)]
*  by increasingly sophisticated ways of using the information resource that we have around us. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6488.740000000001s)]
*  What you would like to do is turn that vague picture into a more quantitative one by coming [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6495.9400000000005s)]
*  up with what a physicist would call an order parameter. An order parameter is just a number [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6500.900000000001s)]
*  you can compute that sort of characterizes a phase transition. Like for liquid water [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6504.58s)]
*  transforming into steam or to ice, the speed of sound changes, the equation of state changes [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6513.3s)]
*  dramatically at those transitions. So you can have an order parameter that tells you, yes, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6521.22s)]
*  you have had a phase transition. What you would like to do is use information theory as what we're [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6525.7s)]
*  trying to do, me and my friends, use information theory to come up with order parameters that [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6530.18s)]
*  characterize these different stages of complexity. There's no guarantee that it's straightforward. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6534.58s)]
*  Maybe some things happen in some physical systems. Some ways of using information happen earlier. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6540.900000000001s)]
*  Stage one happens before stage two in one system, and stage two happens before stage one in another [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6547.700000000001s)]
*  system. It could be a mess, right? That's the whole joy of complexity is that it's not necessarily [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6552.5s)]
*  simple. It could actually be complex. Okay, so I could stop there. That's my picture of the [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6557.38s)]
*  way that we should think about complexogenesis in the universe and its relationship to entropy, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6565.7s)]
*  but to information as the difference between maximum entropy and actual entropy. But there's [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6570.42s)]
*  just one other kind of thing that I think is really interesting, you know, back to the more [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6577.38s)]
*  basic question of what are the features of the laws of physics that allow this to happen in the [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6582.66s)]
*  first place? Okay, we can kind of sketch out how it does happen. If the laws of physics were different, [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6588.0199999999995s)]
*  then would it still be able to happen? Or, you know, is there some feature of the known laws of [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6596.34s)]
*  physics that we can pinpoint that you say, oh, even if I didn't know what the universe was like, if I [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6600.42s)]
*  knew that these were the laws of physics, then it would happen. This is the kind of question that [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6604.42s)]
*  only physicists and maybe philosophers would care about. Biologists don't care about this. They [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6607.94s)]
*  think they know what laws of physics are, so they can just plug them in. But that's okay. We can be [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6612.5s)]
*  physicists. We can ask what if the laws of physics had been different? What is important here? [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6616.98s)]
*  I mentioned from our investigation in the coffee cup that it seems as if the existence of long [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6622.82s)]
*  range forces is an important feature. But there's another feature that I'm becoming increasingly [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6630.5s)]
*  convinced is super important, which is the existence of photons, or something very, very [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6636.02s)]
*  much like photons. What do I mean by that? Well, think of a box of gas. Okay, I love thinking of [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6642.820000000001s)]
*  boxes of gas. I think of different molecules. Think about a box of gas that has sort of two [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6650.660000000001s)]
*  different kinds of molecules. We're abstracting away from real physics here to just do thought [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6655.540000000001s)]
*  experiments. Think of red molecules and blue molecules. Okay, and they're bouncing around [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6660.1s)]
*  in a box of gas because it's a gas, so they're moving around. The space of all possible [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6666.34s)]
*  configurations for that system is big, right? There's a lot of different configurations that [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6671.9400000000005s)]
*  the molecules could be in, even at a fixed energy or whatever. There's not a lot of interesting, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6678.820000000001s)]
*  if it's in a high entropy state, not a lot of interesting information usage in that context. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6685.22s)]
*  You might need a lot of information to tell me where every molecule is, but it'll be a different [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6692.740000000001s)]
*  configuration in a second. There's nothing stable and interesting. There's no information processing [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6696.66s)]
*  in any interesting way. But imagine that you didn't only have these atoms, you also had the [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6701.7s)]
*  ability to have chemistry, these molecules, I guess I was calling them. In other words, maybe [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6708.740000000001s)]
*  a blue atom and a red atom or two blue atoms or two red atoms could bump into each other and stick [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6714.74s)]
*  to make a molecule. I should have called them atoms in the first place because I'm going to [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6722.5s)]
*  call them molecules now. If I were a chemist by trade, I would call them monomers for the [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6725.54s)]
*  individual pieces and polymers for when I'm making a big thing. I'm imagining that my little monomers, [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6730.5s)]
*  my little individual particles, have the ability to stick together. If they come in two forms, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6737.219999999999s)]
*  red and blue or zero and one, whatever you want to do, then it's interesting what happens, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6743.22s)]
*  not to be too provocative about it, but there is an analog to digital phase transition. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6750.5s)]
*  In the phase where all the monomers, the particles are just bouncing around, that is analog. They [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6756.740000000001s)]
*  could be anywhere they want. There's an infinite number of places they could be. Once they stick [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6761.780000000001s)]
*  together, there's a bit of digital information that comes to life, namely the order. Is it red, [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6766.82s)]
*  blue, blue, blue, red, blue, or is it red, blue, red, red, blue? There's some storage of information [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6775.139999999999s)]
*  and, of course, that ability to store information in a relatively reliable way is crucial to what we [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6783.94s)]
*  imagine we're babbling about as higher level ways of using information. It doesn't help if the [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6790.66s)]
*  information is out there, but you can't store it and use it. This ability to have a digital version [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6797.0599999999995s)]
*  of your configuration of particles is crucial to being able to do that. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6804.98s)]
*  Now, if you are a physicist by training and you are thinking about the space of all possible laws [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6810.26s)]
*  of physics, as we're doing right now, there's a very crucial thing about that idea that two [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6816.18s)]
*  particles or two atoms, two monomers, will stick together. Namely, generically, that does not [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6822.42s)]
*  conserve energy. That is an inelastic collision. If you think back to your early physics courses, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6829.06s)]
*  the total kinetic energy, the total momentum of the system will be the same before and after they [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6835.9400000000005s)]
*  stick, but the total energy will be different. At least the total kinetic energy of the two things [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6840.740000000001s)]
*  that happens. But, of course, chemistry happens all the time. In the real world, atoms do stick [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6845.7s)]
*  together. What is going on? What's going on is the state of the atoms when they are stuck together [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6850.0199999999995s)]
*  is slightly lower energy than the state where they're freely moving. That information didn't [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6857.139999999999s)]
*  just disappear, it is transferred into photons. The atoms give off a photon that carries away [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6862.42s)]
*  the amount of energy that is the difference between the amount they had before and the amount they had [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6869.94s)]
*  after. The thing about photons is they're really flexible. A photon is a massless particle. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6873.94s)]
*  Einstein told us that E equals MC squared. What he means by that is that a massive particle has a [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6882.339999999999s)]
*  minimum amount of energy that it can have. When the particle is just at rest, it has E equals [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6888.82s)]
*  MC squared energy. If it's moving, it has more energy than that, right, kinetic energy. But if [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6893.139999999999s)]
*  it's just sitting there, there's a minimum amount of energy you can have given by MC squared. A mass [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6898.5s)]
*  less particle, the minimum energy you can have is zero, right, MC squared is just zero. It can [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6903.3s)]
*  have any higher amount of energy because it can also have kinetic energy. A photon, which is a [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6909.46s)]
*  truly massless particle, can have any energy at all as measured in some rest frame. That feature, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6914.5s)]
*  which we sort of take for granted, is crucially important to allowing chemistry to happen [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6921.78s)]
*  because different kinds of atoms with maybe different initial energies will stick together [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6929.3s)]
*  and they will need to be able to give off different, arbitrarily different amounts of [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6933.78s)]
*  energy in order to conserve energy and stick together, right. They have a very definite [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6939.7s)]
*  amount of energy they have while stuck together and because they have different potential velocities [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6943.54s)]
*  before they stuck together, they could have any energy beforehand. So photons, which are particles [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6948.58s)]
*  that can carry away any amount of energy you want, play an absolutely crucial role in this analog to [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6955.38s)]
*  digital transition. They allow for it to happen in a very, very real way. And this idea that, you [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6962.9800000000005s)]
*  know, the digitalization of the information is, you know, clearly we know examples where this is [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6970.34s)]
*  crucially important. Schrodinger, again, in his book, What is Life, he famously predicted the existence [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6977.06s)]
*  of something like DNA. His argument was the following, you know, he's a physicist, clearly, [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6983.94s)]
*  so statistical mechanics was one of the things he was very good at. He's thinking about molecules or [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6990.259999999999s)]
*  atoms bumping into each other and he knows that they can't actually convey a lot of information [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=6996.9s)]
*  because they're randomly moving around. If they sort of cooled down and your molecules became a [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7002.66s)]
*  solid, a crystal, let's say, as a specific example of a solid, then you're cooled down but you're [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7009.22s)]
*  still not containing a lot of information. Think about a crystal, a crystal of salt or diamond or [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7015.54s)]
*  whatever, is it's just atom after atom after atom. There's no new information contained. If you know [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7022.5s)]
*  that you're in a diamond, you know that if I'm a carbon atom here, next to me there's going to be [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7028.740000000001s)]
*  another carbon atom. No new information has been conveyed. So Schrodinger said for a living being [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7032.82s)]
*  to have something like genetics, something like the ability to send its genome down to subsequent [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7039.62s)]
*  generations, it must have a configuration of atoms inside that contains information in a relatively [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7046.66s)]
*  stable form. So it can't be a real crystal because real crystals are just predictable and no [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7054.42s)]
*  information but it also can't be a gas or a fluid. It has to be what Schrodinger called an [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7059.62s)]
*  aperiodic crystal, that is to say an arrangement of atoms in the form of a molecule where you don't [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7064.82s)]
*  know what the next grouping is just by knowing what your current grouping is, basically an alphabet [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7073.0599999999995s)]
*  or a way of conveying different bits of information at different sites of what he was thinking of as [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7079.78s)]
*  this aperiodic crystal. And of course now we know it's DNA that does this. RNA also does it to some [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7086.34s)]
*  extent but RNA is less stable. Then there's a whole long story that I'm going to avoid at the [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7092.42s)]
*  temptation to start talking about RNA world and the origin of life and things like that but it's [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7099.78s)]
*  precisely this analog the digital transition. DNA is very very much analogous to the sort of red and [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7105.78s)]
*  blue balls sticking together that we were just talking about. You don't know from knowing that a [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7113.46s)]
*  certain nucleotide is one identity what the next one is going to be and therefore in Claude Shannon's [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7120.02s)]
*  sense the information about the next one carries information in an interesting way. So you can kind [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7127.22s)]
*  of see the importance of photons here and there's almost just for fun I can imagine an anthropic [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7134.98s)]
*  principle argument for gauge symmetry. So this is even this is wackier we're getting late in the [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7144.179999999999s)]
*  podcast but you know the existence of a massless particle that interacts non-trivially with ordinary [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7149.299999999999s)]
*  matter should not be taken for granted. So consider the following argument intelligent observers are [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7157.299999999999s)]
*  complex information processing systems right. That's what we think we are and the anthropic [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7163.22s)]
*  principle is supposed to say one thing about the conditions in their universe or the laws of physics [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7167.860000000001s)]
*  underlying them is that they have to be compatible with the existence of intelligence observers [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7175.54s)]
*  otherwise you wouldn't have any intelligent observers there talking about the laws of physics. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7180.26s)]
*  Okay so at this level of analysis what we mean by intelligent observer is some complex information [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7184.02s)]
*  processing system. Now a complex information processing system is a configuration of matter [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7190.02s)]
*  which as we just discussed it won't be created unless you can dissipate extra energy away right. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7196.18s)]
*  If you think about the space of all possible configurations of atoms to make a complex system [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7203.700000000001s)]
*  at any one energy if you start with the atoms all moving it's very very unlikely that you will find [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7211.22s)]
*  a configuration where the atoms are stuck together with exactly the same energy that's almost a set [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7218.1s)]
*  of measure zero it's very very difficult to find you can only find these sort of interestingly [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7223.700000000001s)]
*  complex structures by going down in energy by decreasing the energy of the atoms by giving [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7229.700000000001s)]
*  away the energy to some other part of the universe okay dissipation that's exactly what it is. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7236.02s)]
*  When can dissipation happen? Well you need low mass particles massless particles would be the best [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7242.26s)]
*  because they can have any energy at all and they can carry it away but neutrinos or something like [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7250.5s)]
*  that are low mass particles they're of no help whatsoever because they don't interact that much [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7256.9800000000005s)]
*  it's very very hard to get a neutrino to carry away energy so you want a low mass particle but [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7261.54s)]
*  one that interacts noticeably right that really has a non-zero chance of carrying away some energy. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7267.62s)]
*  Now there's a separate particle physics argument but basically the only low mass particles that [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7274.5s)]
*  interact noticeably with other particles are gauge bosons something that we've talked about [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7280.18s)]
*  because volume two of the biggest ideas in the universe talks a lot about gauge symmetries and [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7286.58s)]
*  the fact that the existence of a symmetry in the quantum field theory context leads directly to [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7292.5s)]
*  massless particles ordinarily if a particle is massless it's only because it doesn't interact [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7298.02s)]
*  with anything gauge symmetries allow for interactions while keeping particles massless [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7303.54s)]
*  and therefore the existence of intelligent observers relies on the existence of gauge [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7309.9400000000005s)]
*  symmetries and so you can make photons so there you go i've explained why gauge invariance exists [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7315.22s)]
*  it's because of the anthropic principle i wouldn't take this very seriously but i think it's amusing [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7320.34s)]
*  to think that when we know the laws of physics as well as we do sometimes it's it's you know [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7325.38s)]
*  tempting to take for granted the features that they have but if you imagine different laws of [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7331.3s)]
*  physics things might have been very different up to and including life might have been impossible [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7336.34s)]
*  okay let me let me just wind up with yet another amusing observation like we don't have the full [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7341.7s)]
*  picture here i think it's pretty obvious we're groping toward this idea of complexity increasing [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7346.82s)]
*  because we have this information resource and therefore there's a lot of different ways that [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7352.82s)]
*  we can put it to use and the the issue is the the homework assignment is quantify all the ways [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7357.94s)]
*  that physical configuration of matter can use that information resource to survive [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7365.62s)]
*  and argue that it's going to be more and more complex ways of doing that okay so like i said [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7372.900000000001s)]
*  it could stop there but the final observation is the following once you do this and along the [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7379.780000000001s)]
*  digital transition once you have dissipation so that you can take your configuration of matter it [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7386.42s)]
*  can cool down into a complex information rich configuration of stuff the space of possibilities [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7393.3s)]
*  that are relevantly different from each other becomes enormously big okay this is this is the [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7402.58s)]
*  crucial thing that i'm still trying to wrap my head around to sort of figure out how to quantify [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7408.18s)]
*  it and say it exactly even though in the box of gas there's a huge number of different places and [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7411.7s)]
*  velocities the molecules can have they're all kind of the same in some intuitive sense that you would [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7416.820000000001s)]
*  like to make quantitative once the molecules start sticking together then they're not the same [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7422.9s)]
*  anymore then the different orderings of the monomers into the polymer matter so how big [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7427.62s)]
*  is the space of possibilities when you say like okay there's many different ways to put those [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7435.7s)]
*  atoms together to make like a dna or whatever how efficient could we be if you think that a dna [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7440.179999999999s)]
*  molecule carries the information that turns into the blueprint for a big macroscopic organism [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7446.58s)]
*  and you think the natural selection can be thought of as sort of searching through the space of [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7452.42s)]
*  genomes for things that climb up to peaks in a fitness landscape and can survive in a harsh [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7456.42s)]
*  environment how good a job can we do in exploring that space of possibilities let's make it [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7463.38s)]
*  explicitly the space of genomes okay so let's imagine we have nucleotides and we're putting [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7470.0199999999995s)]
*  nucleotides into dna and we're saying we have four different we have an alphabet which has four [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7476.1s)]
*  letters in it gcta those are the nucleotides that that come into making dna and we're going to put [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7483.46s)]
*  them in different orders and you know the human genome has approximately three billion base pairs [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7489.22s)]
*  so three billion nucleotides in some specific kind of order is that because the universe has [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7499.7s)]
*  searched through all possible dna strands up to three billion in length and found the perfect one [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7507.78s)]
*  no so just to quantify that how big the space of possibilities are imagine that we took all of the [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7515.54s)]
*  protons and electrons in the universe in the observable universe 10 to the 80th of them as [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7523.38s)]
*  you now know imagine we god let's say because we don't have the capability to do this imagine that [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7528.9800000000005s)]
*  we put them all into the form of dna okay indeed into the form of base pairs for dna and then we're [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7535.9400000000005s)]
*  going to assemble them into strands with n base pairs in each strand and imagine that we do this [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7541.860000000001s)]
*  one billion strands per second okay so we're going to keep taking as all the matter in the universe [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7550.26s)]
*  and we're going to put it into different combinations of gctna and we're going to [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7557.14s)]
*  keep shuffling through all those combinations a billion times a second and we're going to somehow [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7563.78s)]
*  magically perceive which one of those make good living organisms and which ones would fail okay [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7569.22s)]
*  and how much time do we have within the age of the universe 10 billion years how long of a strand [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7575.86s)]
*  of dna could we search through comprehensively so we really checked every single possibility [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7583.7s)]
*  the answer is about 180 about 180 base pairs in a dna molecule we could if we if we had the entire [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7589.7s)]
*  universe devoted to this program of putting all the different base pairs in different orders and [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7598.74s)]
*  asking whether they were good or bad and we could do that in a billionth of a second all which is [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7604.34s)]
*  entirely unrealistic of course just so you know we're just trying to make a point here [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7609.54s)]
*  the point here is there's not enough matter or time in the universe to search through all the [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7614.18s)]
*  possible configurations of nucleotides and dna even if we did it in this completely unrealistic [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7620.34s)]
*  way we wouldn't get even to length 200 of our hypothetical genomes here the human genome is [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7626.82s)]
*  three billion base pairs long so we search through the space of possibilities in an enormously [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7633.54s)]
*  inefficient way right we can't possibly be comprehensive about it that's why natural [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7641.94s)]
*  selection uses sort of randomness and culling right you know you randomly mutate your dna [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7647.7s)]
*  and then if you're unsuccessful you die out and if you're successful you reproduce that's how [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7654.9s)]
*  natural selection works and you're not going to do anything like a careful examination of all the [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7659.38s)]
*  possible things you can do in a dna strand that is three billion base pairs long you're going to [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7667.62s)]
*  explore an enormously tiny fraction of that available landscape of possibilities so what [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7674.58s)]
*  that implies to me is that in this process of increasing complexity increasingly sophisticated [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7681.54s)]
*  ways to use the information resource that we have in the universe we're nowhere near done [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7689.7s)]
*  we could easily imagine configurations of matter that are in some hopefully definable sense [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7696.98s)]
*  way better at surviving than we are right because who knows what you could do by organizing these [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7704.740000000001s)]
*  dna base pairs in better more efficient strands to make better organisms not that i'm advocating [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7712.18s)]
*  doing this there's this is the thing about natural selection is it's mindless it's not teleological [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7719.38s)]
*  but somehow i guess this is a good place to end on one of the things that happens [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7726.02s)]
*  in this progress progress is of course the wrong word here in this progression this evolution [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7732.34s)]
*  from simplicity to complexity as these subsystems of the universe become increasingly sophisticated [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7739.54s)]
*  at using the informational resource around them is that we can do something called imagining the [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7747.46s)]
*  future as we mentioned with with malcolm mcgyver's talk etc the reason why that's interesting [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7754.26s)]
*  that's interesting is because physics wise the universe is governed by two things number one the [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7760.18s)]
*  laws of physics and number two a past boundary condition the low entropy of the universe in the [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7768.66s)]
*  past the past hypothesis as david albert has dubbed it the fact that the early universe starts with [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7775.06s)]
*  very low entropy in the past there is no future hypothesis right there's no future boundary [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7779.9400000000005s)]
*  condition for for whatever cosmological reason our universe has a boundary condition at one end [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7785.78s)]
*  of time but not the other okay and so all of the sort of coarse-grained evolution of the universe [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7791.46s)]
*  questions can be addressed by the underlying laws of physics plus an initial condition not a final [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7798.5s)]
*  condition there's no nothing you need to know about the future in order to predict how systems [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7804.82s)]
*  will evolve from the past to the future there is something you need to know about the past the low [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7812.58s)]
*  entropy of it there's nothing you need to know about the future okay the only condition is in the [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7816.66s)]
*  past but there are also systems in the universe that have goals a goal is a future state that you [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7821.86s)]
*  would like to reach right these systems are of course living systems living systems have goals [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7834.34s)]
*  as far as we know non-living systems don't have goals they might have places they go to but they're [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7840.9s)]
*  not trying to go to there because they have a purpose in the same way that living systems do [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7846.82s)]
*  living systems can envision where they want to be and work toward getting there right like if you [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7854.0199999999995s)]
*  drop a ball and it falls toward the floor if you were aristotle you might casually say the ball [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7861.62s)]
*  wants to be at the floor it has a nature to be down there but i could just catch the ball i could [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7868.26s)]
*  just put my my hand there and stop the ball from reaching the floor right if there is a cat that [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7872.34s)]
*  wants to get a mouse and okay so the cat moves towards the mouse i could try to step in the way [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7879.22s)]
*  of the cat and the cat would move around me the cat would change its behavior in order to keep [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7884.42s)]
*  pursuing its goal in a way that the falling ball doesn't because the cat is a living organism that [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7890.42s)]
*  can imagine things in the future so somehow somewhere along the progression from very very [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7896.74s)]
*  simple systems that are just increasing their entropy and evolving along with the universe [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7905.46s)]
*  two more complex information utilizing systems the boundary condition that is initially only in the [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7910.66s)]
*  past these individual subsystems of the universe invent a future boundary condition for themselves [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7920.0199999999995s)]
*  some state in the future that they would like to reach that is nowhere to be found in the [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7927.62s)]
*  microscopic laws of physics or anything like that laplace's demon just works moment by moment [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7933.54s)]
*  there's no future boundary conditions but this this appearance of complexity this complexo genesis [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7938.9s)]
*  this increasingly sophisticated use of information allows us to have future goals and i think that's [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7945.7s)]
*  really interesting i would like to know i would like to be able to sort of quantify [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7952.58s)]
*  what is the moment at which that happens is that i don't think that the bacterium doing chemotaxis [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7956.74s)]
*  really has a future goal i think it's just it's just responding to the moment in some way but i [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7961.62s)]
*  have future goals right i want to finish this podcast i want to publish it etc in very down [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7967.3s)]
*  to earth ways no one argues with with that so somewhere along the evolutionary tree between me [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7972.82s)]
*  and the bacterium the idea of a goal appears that has to be one of the stages in complexo genesis [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7977.78s)]
*  right the ability to formulate goals states of future configuration that you will try to get to [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7984.9s)]
*  even if i don't know how i'm going to get there exactly i don't know what time of day i'm going [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7991.38s)]
*  to write the show notes for the episode or whatever but i do know that on monday morning i'm going to [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=7996.259999999999s)]
*  publish the episode right that's a fascinating thing that can happen in this in this information [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8001.38s)]
*  utilizing capacity that we develop as complex creatures in the aftermath of the big bang [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8007.62s)]
*  of course eventually we'll all go away it doesn't last forever the cream and the coffee do mix [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8014.26s)]
*  together the complexity will eventually disappear but even though the stars are mostly formed [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8020.34s)]
*  human life scale human lifespan is of order 100 years 100 years is nothing compared to the [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8026.74s)]
*  time scales at which entropy is increasing the universe and complexity is developing in the [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8033.139999999999s)]
*  universe so i don't know about the universe as a whole but i think that unless we do something dumb [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8037.7s)]
*  and kill ourselves there's a lot of room for increased complexity and increased [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8043.38s)]
*  increased sophistication in our use of information here on earth if that's something that we value [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8049.219999999999s)]
*  that's maybe a goal that we can have to keep that going to keep that surviving and not do dumb [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8056.179999999999s)]
*  things and destroy ourselves here on earth that's a good place to stop so thanks for [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8063.0599999999995s)]
*  listening to mindscape i will talk to you next time [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8067.139999999999s)]
*  so [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWP2ktac34k&t=8085.7s)]
