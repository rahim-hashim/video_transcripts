# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | April 2020
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpJFDLFVFI)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the April 2020 Ask Me Anything edition of the
*  Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll. Strange days of course where
*  we're all worried about the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic across
*  the world under lockdown or some version of quarantine or something like that. As
*  I've said before, Jennifer, my wife and I are much better equipped to deal with
*  something like this than many people. Our jobs involve working from home, we have
*  a nice home, we have relatively stable and predictable income and so forth, so
*  we're doing okay. We like being at home also compared to, you know, any the most
*  people although it would be really nice to be able to go outside, see friends,
*  things like that. But anyway I do hope everyone out there in listening land,
*  podcast land, Patreon supporter land, is doing well under these circumstances. I
*  know it's not easy. I know there's lots of resources out there for people to look
*  at, try to deal with the effects of the lockdown and the pandemic, whether it's
*  the medical effects or also the psychological effects. You know the
*  psychological effects are very real and you should be, you should go to great
*  lengths to take care of yourself in situations like this. I mean someone
*  like me for example has a lot of time to do work. I do in fact spend a lot of time
*  now doing quote-unquote work, but that's not making me very productive to be
*  honest. It's just too easy to get distracted worrying about the state of
*  the world and so forth. And in some sense that's okay. That's just something to be
*  expected, but you have to manage it. You have to figure out ways to get through.
*  One way to get through is to listen to good podcasts and ask questions and
*  answer them. So let's do that. Let's go.
*  First question this month is from Valkea who says, in your February AMA you said
*  the Big Bang wasn't created by anything in the conventional story. I and others
*  have some other stories but that's the mystery. What is your preferred story
*  for how the Big Bang was created? So the answer is I don't have a preferred
*  story. I do think that there are many different models on the market that are
*  plausibly somewhat on the right track. That is to say they will capture
*  something important about what's really happening or what really did happen at
*  the Big Bang. It's also completely plausible to me that none of the current
*  models on the market capture anything important about what happened at the Big
*  Bang. What we know about the Big Bang is there was a period of very very high
*  temperature, high density, high curvature of space-time about 14 billion years ago
*  that led directly to a hot, dense, smooth expanding universe that cooled into the
*  universe we see today. That's what we know. But our theories, whether it's general
*  relativity or quantum field theory or whatever, are just not up to the task of
*  saying what happened at that moment. So it's okay under those circumstances that
*  we have lots of different theories. We don't know which one is true. I would say
*  it's even premature to say to have a favorite, right? You might have a
*  favorite way of approaching the problem, but to say you have a favorite theory I
*  think is wildly premature at this time. John Hamill says, Dan Dennett told you
*  that the little people argument against free will skepticism is obnoxious, but
*  then he went on to rely on precisely that argument himself just a few moments
*  later. His thought experiment assumed that an average person who was told
*  that they have no free will would become slovenly and make bad decisions so that
*  pretty soon they ended up in court. Are you surprised then that a free will
*  skeptic like Jerry Coyne has somehow avoided prison or is it just that the
*  little people without a PhD who would immediately begin a crime spree upon
*  being told they have no free will? So I think that this misunderstands the
*  argument that Dan was making, at least as I understand it. I shouldn't try to
*  speak for him, but I will under these circumstances. Nothing in Dan's argument
*  has anything to do with little people or people with PhDs. The argument is
*  about how you behave given that you do or do not accept the idea that you have
*  free will. If you look closely, Dan never made any distinctions between people who
*  are sophisticated knowers of philosophy and science versus just people on the
*  street. What he said was there's a distinction between people who accept
*  the existence of free will and people who don't. Namely that if you don't
*  accept the existence of free will, you can't accept the existence of things
*  like moral responsibility for your actions because you have no responsibility
*  for your actions. I think that his argument is that people who deny the
*  existence of free will are simply not being consistent unless they act in that
*  really asocial way, that the cartoonish way that you say, well I can't be held
*  responsible, I can just you know become sociopathic etc. No one does that, but I
*  think Dan's point is that that would be the intellectually consistent position
*  if you truly did not believe in free will. The truth is that the people who
*  deny the existence of free will are constantly telling other people how to
*  behave, making decisions about how to behave for themselves etc. And this
*  reality of the situation is exactly what is taken seriously by
*  compatibilists. Compatibilists want to understand how we should conceptualize
*  the fact that real people talk about making decisions and assign moral import
*  to those decisions all the time. And compatibilists say that's okay, that we
*  shouldn't deny that, we need that kind of language, that kind of apparatus to get
*  through life, so let's try to understand it the best way we can. Philip Meiman
*  says you have a very unique and engaging even contagious style of speaking. For
*  example with subtle inflections at the end of sentences that subtextually ask
*  the listener if they're still with you. This makes me very self-conscious when
*  I'm reading this out loud Philip, but I will I will soldier on. I find myself
*  unconsciously slipping into your cadences when teaching. Did you develop
*  this style intentionally or did it just evolve or have you always spoken this
*  way? I certainly didn't develop any style intentionally, this is just how I talk.
*  Of course it has evolved over over time, but certainly not in any conscious way.
*  I'm not against that, you know I did certainly work very hard at public
*  speaking and things like that. I don't think that there's any authenticity
*  argument that says that you shouldn't try to affect how you look, how you stand,
*  how you talk or anything like that. But in the case of my actual cadences and
*  rhythms of speaking, I have exerted no control over them whatsoever. This is
*  just how they came out. I personally really don't like listening to myself,
*  this is one of the reasons why the podcast is only very minimally edited. I'm
*  the one doing the editing and I'm not going to listen to the whole episode.
*  But and I know that empirically other people out there, some of them like
*  the way I speak and some don't and that's perfectly okay. That's just
*  how it's gonna be, this is how I'm gonna talk. There are definitely people out
*  there who have very distinctive ways of talking, whether it's you know people
*  like Lenny Suskind or David Albert we've had on the podcast here and it's
*  always interesting. It's you know just part of the wonderful variety of life
*  that people talk in different ways. Tony B says, does the universe getting
*  clumpier with time affect cosmology in the expansion of the universe? The early
*  universe would have been uniform with the same mass and dark energy
*  everywhere but now there are huge voids with basically just dark energy. Could
*  this exaggerate the acceleration of expansion? So this is actually a or at
*  least it was in the last couple decades a very hot topic in theoretical
*  cosmology. Does the difference between a perfectly homogeneous universe where we
*  can solve all the equations exactly for how the expansion proceeds versus the
*  lumpy inhomogeneous universe in which we live, does that difference really spell
*  a huge difference for how the overall universe expands? There were a group of
*  people who claimed that there was a way of analyzing it which said that the
*  inhomogeneities in the universe did in fact mimic cosmic acceleration. However I
*  personally was always extremely doubtful about that. I think that the sort of
*  mathematical techniques that they used were unconvincing to me and I believe
*  although maybe you should check for yourself but I believe the current
*  consensus is it just does not work that way. I mean one way of thinking about
*  this is to think of an effective field theory of large-scale structure. That is
*  something that I've written a paper about and there you see that the overall
*  expansion rate is more or less unaffected by inhomogeneities. So here's
*  one way of thinking about it. In some large region of space the total
*  amount of mass and energy is the same whether it's homogeneously or
*  inhomogeneously distributed. What's different is that there's a gravitational
*  field right? Inhomogeneities change the gravitational field in an interesting
*  way. But how in the world could the effect of that extra gravitational field
*  be more important to the overall expansion of space than the effect of
*  the mass that is actually sourcing most of the energy or the dark energy or
*  whatever? You would expect intuitively the gravitational field to just be a
*  tiny tiny very weak perturbation on top of that and I believe that is what the
*  mathematics bears out. Igor Velotic says, what is your take on nuclear power
*  plants as a source of energy? Would you enforce or discourage their use? How do
*  you see its safety and efficiency compared to safety efficiency of the
*  alternatives? I'm not an expert on the current state of the art in terms of the
*  safety or efficiency of nuclear power. Intuitively and since I was very young I
*  thought that nuclear power was a perfectly sensible way to move forward.
*  I don't have any big big fundamental philosophical objections to it. I don't
*  think it's the best way long term to do power here on earth. I think that
*  ultimately we want a completely renewable energy source pipeline as much
*  as we can whether it's solar or geothermal or whatever. Now cosmically
*  speaking nothing is completely renewable. The earth will cease to exist in five
*  billion years or whatever but still billions of years as the time scale
*  works for me and nuclear power is not a renewable resource in quite that way.
*  There are absolutely issues with the storage of nuclear waste and so forth. I
*  talked a little bit with Martin Reiss about that on the podcast but I think I
*  agree with his take that in the medium term as a bridge to long-term truly
*  renewable power nuclear power seems to make sense. On the other hand my
*  credences are not that set in stone. If someone really understands the dangers
*  and convinces me otherwise I will change my mind. Charles Hertz says I'm baffled
*  by something I read in Brian Greene's newest book Until the End of Time. On
*  page 306 he says light emitted from a distant location is visible to our
*  telescopes only if there has been ample time for it to have traversed the space
*  between us. We can calculate that it's about 45 billion light-years so assuming
*  space is infinite you can picture of it as a patchwork of widely separated 90
*  billion light-year regions. I just don't get it if there's a guy in a galaxy 10
*  billion light-years north of me can can't he theoretically see 10 billion
*  light-years farther in that direction than I can 10 billion light-years less
*  far in the opposite direction. How can there be separate independent regions
*  since his region and mine are different but overlap substantially. So I think
*  you're both right but you're just emphasizing slightly different things.
*  What Brian says is you can picture it as a patchwork of widely separated regions
*  more or less evolving independently but you are also correct that that division
*  into patchwork is by no means set in stone. You know different ways of
*  dividing it up will give you different answers. It's not as if there literally
*  are boundaries around us 45 billion light-years in every direction and in
*  fact Brian is cheating a little bit because it's not true a hundred percent
*  that these things will evolve completely independently. There
*  will be very very small effects of what's going on on different sides of
*  the different parts of the universe. So I would just say don't take him
*  too literally okay. It's a pretty good approximation to think of these
*  different regions of the universe however you want to divide them up as
*  evolving more or less independently. Linu Mizyara says in many worlds every
*  time the universe splits we become two different people. Why can't we say that
*  each of us becomes one of these descendants? For example I turn out to be
*  the one who observes the spin-up electron while my other self is the one
*  who observes the spin-down. Isn't this necessary in order to preserve our
*  sense of identity? So the answer is just that there's absolutely no distinction
*  between the version of you who observes spin-up and the version who observes
*  spin-down except that one observes spin-up one observes spin-down. There's
*  absolutely nothing in there that says and this one is the real you. That's what
*  would be necessary to make sense of this idea that there is some essence of
*  you-ness that travels down one set of branches and not any other one. So in
*  terms of preserving your sense of identity no I don't think that anything
*  like that would be necessary. The notion of personal identity is different in
*  many worlds than it is in a single-world theory but that doesn't mean it's
*  incoherent. You can go backwards uniquely to know where you were in the past. When
*  you go forwards you don't know who you're going to be. In fact we can say
*  equivalently the other way you know that your present self will evolve into many
*  different future selves. Period. That's it. You cannot also say and I don't know
*  which one I'm gonna be. What you can say is I will evolve into these many
*  different selves and I think as I tried to argue in something deeply hidden that
*  if you really really dig into what you mean by personal identity anyway where
*  you understand that for example you right now is not exactly the same as you
*  one day ago all of this fits in together perfectly well it's just a little bit
*  different than what we're used to. Martin Duszek says how does the many
*  worlds hypothesis affect the simulation hypothesis? Wouldn't a Hilbert space of
*  worlds reduce the probability of living inside a simulation? I don't think so. I
*  mean if you believe the simulation argument at all then you have to believe
*  in the possibility of super technologically advanced civilizations
*  outside our reality and who knows what their reality is. I mean who all we can
*  do is sort of give them almost arbitrary power to do simulations. Other than that
*  we know nothing about them. So whether or not they choose to simulate a
*  classical universe or a quantum universe I don't really see it makes any
*  difference at all. Like they have the power to do any of that. I mean we we
*  don't necessarily imagine that they're building their version of a
*  supercomputer right? I mean maybe we are being simulated on their version of an
*  abacus. They're really really powerful we just have no way of judging. Anders says
*  does the cosmological constant affect the flow of time? If we could build a
*  vacuum energy suction device and extract the vacuum energy from a volume of space
*  and then send one of the two clocks into that volume wait for a long time and
*  then take the clock out again would we see a difference between the two clocks?
*  So I'm not gonna quite answer this question Anders because we cannot build
*  a vacuum energy suction device. This is not a thing that we can build. The whole
*  point of vacuum energy is that as long as it truly is vacuum energy it's exactly
*  the same amount everywhere. You can't move it around. Now you can imagine a
*  phase transition. You can imagine a phase transition where the vacuum energy
*  changes inside a bubble so that it's a different in interior to the bubble than
*  exterior to the bubble and you could send a clock into the bubble and then
*  pull it out. Maybe that's sort of what you're talking about. There would be a
*  gravitational effect of that absolutely and it's no different than the
*  gravitational effect of taking your clock and putting it in a spherical
*  shell of really dense material. If you had a spherical shell that was
*  hollow inside and super duper dense so it had a gravitational field then the
*  clock that just stayed inside the shell would have a different total amount of
*  time elapsed than one that started inside the shell went out hung around
*  outside for a while and then came back in. Likewise there's a certain
*  amount of gravity associated with a bubble of false vacuum energy then the
*  same thing would happen with that clock. It doesn't necessarily have to happen
*  because it depends on details but that's absolutely possible. But I don't think
*  any of that is actually addressing what you're probably really getting at because
*  you said does the cosmological constant affect the flow of time? The point is any
*  form of energy which is completely homogeneous, which is the same
*  everywhere, can be solved in Einstein's equations for general relativity by a
*  metric, by a spacetime curvature, where time is unaffected. Where everyone
*  has the same notion of proper time. Everyone has a notion of what the
*  clocks read to them if they are stationary with respect to the rest
*  frame of this energy. So clocks still take it one second per second whether or
*  not there's a cosmological constant in our universe. Charlie McLaughlin says
*  what kinds of experiments could be constructed and implemented to prove
*  many worlds? So there are none because there are no experiments constructed
*  and implement to prove any scientific theory. This of course requires a footnote
*  because scientists and mathematicians use the word proof in a slightly different
*  way than other people do. You know like people on the street if you said well
*  prove that you purchased this from our store they would show you a receipt and
*  go here's my proof okay. But scientists and mathematicians, logicians,
*  philosophers have a higher standard. They really want the word proof to be like a
*  mathematical or logical demonstration. Something with literally no possible
*  loopholes. A receipt can be faked right? A scientist would say their receipt is
*  evidence for the fact that you bought something at that store but it's not a
*  proof. So if we change your question to say what kind of experiments could be
*  constructed and implemented to provide evidence for many worlds there are
*  millions and they've been done. The whole idea of many worlds is that there is
*  nothing but a wave function and that wave function obeys the Schrodinger
*  equation. So every experiment that says there's a wave function and the wave
*  function obeys the Schrodinger equation is evidence for many worlds. What you
*  really probably want is to know is can there be evidence against many worlds
*  given that quantum mechanics basically is okay and the answer to that is also
*  yes. Just do an experiment where the wave function does not obey the
*  Schrodinger equation. This is an absolutely possible thing. Roger Penrose
*  thinks that the wave function does not obey the Schrodinger equation when it
*  describes pieces of the universe where the gravitational field is different in
*  them. He thinks that that causes an objective sudden collapse of the wave
*  function and experiments are ongoing to look for exactly that which would
*  falsify the many-worlds theory. Justin Bailey says how do black holes have
*  spin and charge when they're really a region of space rather than an object
*  with solid properties? Well because regions of space can have spin and
*  charge. This is a feature of general relativity. You know remember once you go
*  not only to general relativity but to modern physics more generally, fields are
*  the things that the universe is made of. The universe is not made of particles so
*  if you see an electron with an electric charge and spin you have no problem with
*  that. Remember that the electron is really a quantized excitation of the
*  electron field. So fields even though they're spread out through space can be
*  associated with spin and with charge namely with angular momentum and with a
*  coupling to the electromagnetic field. So there's no surprise at all really that
*  black holes are the same way. Black holes are a feature of the gravitational field,
*  the space-time metric that tells us the curvature of space-time and this makes
*  perfect mathematical sense to associate a region of space-time with a total
*  amount of both charge and spin as well as mass for that region, for that
*  matter. Dylan Padilla says I've been reading What is Real by Adam Becker,
*  former Mindscape guest, and I find it crazy how generations of physicists
*  before you viewed and treated some of those who were interested in the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics. Do you see your generation as more accepting of
*  a more bottom-up approach to doing physics? You know I'm always very
*  skeptical of generalizing when it comes to general generations. I think that
*  there were always people who were interested in the foundations of quantum
*  mechanics. I do think that there are still such people today. It's plausible
*  to me that the tide is changing and amongst the majority of physicists
*  they're becoming a little bit more open to investigations in quantum
*  foundations. Now this is very very vague and hedgy for intentional reasons
*  because I don't know how to quantify this. I mean I've never done a survey
*  that is scientific in any way, but given the advances of technology with what
*  quantum mechanics can do, quantum computers but also manipulations of
*  quantum matter and so forth, digging into the quantum into the foundations of
*  quantum mechanics just seems like a more sensible thing to do than it ever
*  did before, so people are becoming a little bit more open to it. I don't want
*  to give my generation special credit or anything like that, but I do like to
*  think that things might be changing. Dan Inch says, do you have any plans to do
*  another podcast on quantum mechanics with David Albert? Your conversation in
*  March 2019 is one of my favorites, but by the end you both sounded as though you
*  needed time to reflect. What we actually needed time to do was just to go because
*  David had an appointment he had to go to, and we ended up talking a long time, but
*  you know as of right now I do not have any plans to repeat any guests on
*  Mindscape. You know David's one of my favorite people and best thinkers that I
*  know, so he'd be a great person to have on again, but I know lots of people who
*  would be great to have on again talking about similar things. You know I've been
*  intentionally staying away from quantum mechanics for the last few months because
*  we overdosed on that a little bit, but quantum mechanics will eventually return,
*  but there's a lot of people to talk to and I don't want to sort of just be
*  retreads of similar conversations over and over again. Having said that, if we do
*  start having repeats, David would be one of the best people to have. Wes Clyburn
*  says, I'm curious about the current state of M theory and the best current
*  explanations for the weakness of gravity. So those are two slightly different
*  questions. Wes is trying to sneak in there. I'll give short answers to both
*  of them. I'm not really sure how to characterize the current state of M
*  theory. You know I mean M theory is not even a well-defined thing. It's
*  sometimes used as a superset of string theory, right? Like string theory evolved
*  into M theory. Sometimes M theory is used as a subset of string theory, that there's
*  a particular limit of string theory where things look like 11-dimensional
*  supergravity and that's the M theory limit. Probably more often it's used in
*  the former sense that M theory is the theory whose limits include 11-
*  dimensional string theory as well as various different super string theory,
*  11-dimensional supergravity plus various different string theories. But the state
*  of it is, you know, I haven't been following it to be honest. I used to
*  follow it better but in the last 10 years that I've been at Caltech I
*  haven't followed along very well. And also I think that the people who are
*  technically string theorists, their interests have changed. You know I've had
*  I guess three legitimate card-carrying string theorists on the podcast. We had
*  Leonard Susskind, we had Clifford Johnson, we had Brian Greene. None of them quite
*  wants to say I am a string theorist, right? They want to say well I'm a
*  theoretical physicist, I'm a quantum field theorist, an M theorist or whatever,
*  which tells you something, okay? And many of these people right now are doing
*  things that are inspired by discoveries in M theory or string theory but they're
*  not actually technically M theory or string theory. They're calculations done
*  in gravity, quantum gravity, tensor networks, ADS-CFT, etc. So I worry that a
*  lot of people working in that field as a whole have lost touch with the goal to
*  eventually contact with data and explain the universe that we see. I never worried
*  that it was hard to make contact with data, like that's okay, that's fine,
*  sometimes things are just hard, that doesn't make them not worth doing. But I
*  do worry if you just don't even try and that's what I worry is happening. Okay,
*  current explanations for the weakness of gravity. There is something called the
*  weak gravity conjecture, which is probably what you're referring to. Again, I
*  don't have anything deep to say about it. It's not a proven thing, it's the kind of
*  thing that if you make certain assumptions then you can prove it and the
*  conjecture states that roughly speaking among two objects that are charged under
*  some non-gravitational force, gravity will always be weaker than that
*  non-gravitational force. So it's more sophisticated than that, but that's the basic idea.
*  So you know that's a good thing to investigate, maybe it tells us something
*  deep, but I'm not really an expert. Dave Stern says on page 172 of something
*  deeply hidden you have the example of a bowling ball that becomes two bowling
*  balls when the wave function branches. The energy contribution of the two
*  child bowling balls equals the energy contribution of the parent bowling ball.
*  Could this lead to observations that would be evidence for the many-worlds
*  hypothesis? So I don't think so, to be honest. You know I've already given my
*  feelings about experiment in many worlds. Namely you can try to falsify it, but you
*  can't try to prove it, okay? We already have overwhelming evidence for the two
*  main claims that many worlds says are true. The thing we should be looking for
*  is evidence for claims that it's not true and people are doing that. Now when
*  it comes to the two bowling balls with different energies, I do think there's an
*  interesting thing to be said about quantum mechanics. I'm currently trying
*  to finish up a paper where I say that here's an experimental situation where
*  you can observe energy not being conserved in quantum mechanics. My
*  student at Caltech, Jackie Laudman and I are writing a paper pointing that out.
*  It's something that has sort of been vaguely gestured toward in other papers
*  before, but more with you know sort of reluctance than enthusiasm. And we're
*  saying look here's an experiment you can actually do to see energy not being
*  conserved on our branch of the wave function. So maybe that's something that
*  will be feasible. Our proposed experiment is not quite feasible, but maybe it'll
*  lead some better experimenters to propose something that is feasible.
*  George Winters says my question is about conservation of energy and other basic
*  principles in relation to many worlds. If such principles apply, am I correct to
*  understand that all these divergent trajectories have to happen in already
*  existing universes, otherwise there would be constantly occurring cases of
*  sudden energy, momentum, mass, etc. So no, I don't think that's quite the way to
*  think about it. The energy in the global wave function of the universe is just
*  conserved in many worlds. Full stop, perfectly obvious mathematical
*  conclusion from the formalism. Many world says there's a wave function, it obeys
*  the Schrodinger equation, there's a formula for the energy, there's a formula
*  for the evolution, and the energy is constant, done. But the dividing of that
*  wave function into many semi-classical branches might have the feature that
*  observers don't see energy being conserved, as I just said. But having
*  said that, the way that we divide up the branches into the wave function into many
*  branches has a certain subjective character. So you don't need to, but you
*  can imagine that all of the branching already happened. In other words, there
*  never was one branch that divided into many, there were always many branches,
*  but just all of those branches looked exactly the same, and they became
*  different looking as time goes on. I don't like that way of talking about it,
*  it doesn't help me, it doesn't really solve any problems, but for some people
*  it seems to be, you know, very reassuring to know that they can think of it that
*  way, and in that case, go ahead, think of it that way. Judith Marsh says, if
*  physicists and educators taught that the earth was in motion in the classroom, but
*  ontologically didn't accept it, nobody would believe that the earth really
*  moves. If we weren't socialized to suspend our common-sense disbelief about a
*  moving earth, we wouldn't believe that it does. It's been over a hundred years
*  since Minkowski's space and time lecture. Why hasn't humanity made the ontological
*  paradigm shift to static time like it did for a dynamic earth? I don't know, you
*  know, I mean, I think a lot of it is just that the arguments that, well, so there's
*  a couple things here. Number one, I have no idea what is meant by the phrase
*  static time. It's used again in another question, it's a couple questions from
*  now. Static time seems to be a contradiction in terms to me. Static means
*  not changing with time, and time is time, so I don't even know what it would mean
*  for time to be static or non-static. It's just a sort of a non sequitur in my
*  mind. But if what you mean is, why haven't we internalized the four-dimensional
*  space-time picture of reality rather than the absolute space, three-dimensional
*  space plus absolute one-dimensional time picture, you know, it's just very far from
*  our experience, number one. And number two, there's no need for most people to
*  understand the arguments that go into that, right? It's much easier to
*  understand the arguments that the earth is moving than they understand the
*  arguments for special relativity and the absolute and the the non-existence of an
*  absolute notion of simultaneity. So, you know, people like me try to get people to
*  understand it, and we have there's lots of people out there who think it's
*  interesting and do understand it, but the fact that most people in the street
*  haven't internalized it, I don't think it's very surprising or really the worst
*  thing that is going on in the world right now. So, you know, I think that
*  I love knowledge, I love understanding the world, I want to share it with
*  everybody, but I don't get mad at people who don't share my love of knowledge that
*  way. I get mad at people who do dumb things, who do bad things, but if people
*  just want to go through their lives with a certain comfortable picture of the
*  world that doesn't cause harm to anybody else, that's a choice that they should be
*  able to make, and that's perfectly okay with me. I just want it to be an educated
*  choice. I want them to know that that's the choice they're making. Not quite sure
*  if that's a contradiction or not, but maybe I should think about that a little
*  bit harder. Tony C. Afrodoni says, I would like to know when the double slit
*  experiment was first performed and how it was carried out. So, Tony, you're much
*  more likely to get that by Googling or by looking at Wikipedia and by asking me. I
*  really don't know what the experimental situation was. I know that people talked
*  about the double slit experiment long before they actually did it, and by the
*  double slit I mean the quantum version of the double slit. Of course, Thomas
*  Young did a classical double slit experiment long before quantum mechanics
*  was invented, but that's not exactly what we're talking about here. David Lang
*  says, Carlo Rovelli in his book The Order of Time talks about the distance
*  light has to travel to an event as the extended present that lays between past
*  and future. Can you explain this idea any further? I'm not sure if I can. You know,
*  I've not read that book. I mean, I know what the truth is, which is that, you
*  know, if you imagine ourselves at an event, at a moment in time and a location
*  in space, okay, then from that one single event you can distinguish three different
*  regions of space-time. The future. The future is all the points that you can get
*  to, all the moments of time and locations in space that you can get to, moving more
*  slowly than the speed of light. The past, which is the set of all points in space
*  and time that can get to you along paths that move more slowly than the speed of
*  light, and elsewhere, else when, right? Someplace that is not either in your past
*  or your future, and probably that's what Carlo talks about as the extended
*  present. The point being that to a Newtonian who believed in absolute space
*  and time, the idea of the present moment extends uniquely from here at this one
*  moment of space-time all across the universe. Whereas in special relativity,
*  or general relativity for that matter, the notion of the present time might look
*  different to different observers depending on what coordinates they use
*  and what motion they have in the universe, etc., and therefore all we can do
*  is take the collection of all the events in space-time that are effectively
*  neither in our present, in our future nor our past, and you can call that
*  the extended present if you like. This is very hard to explain without drawing
*  things, which is a limitation of an audio-based medium. Sigurd Enghoff says,
*  is it possible to determine lower bounds on the computational space complexity,
*  memory, of computational, of computable mathematical models that may underpin a
*  static time universe? Again, I have no idea what static time means in this
*  context, sorry about that. And then the question continues, posed slightly
*  differently, if a computable mathematical model forms the basis of a static time
*  universe, is it feasible that such model may be stateless, in a sense analogous to
*  the property of a Mandelbrot set which has complex structure and apparent
*  emergent entropy, although any point in the parameter space can be evaluated
*  independently? I really don't quite understand what is being asked here. I
*  think you're using a lot of words that are either being used in slightly
*  technical or slightly non-standard ways that I don't quite understand, so sorry
*  about that. I'm just not the person to ask this question to. Kirkbriggs says, my
*  question is about permission. Section 107 of the US Copyrights website contains a
*  list of purposes for which the reproduction of a particular work may be
*  considered fair use. This includes quoted material for use in teaching. Do you
*  obtain permission to quote another author in your books and how would I go
*  about obtaining your permission to quote you? It depends. So this is one of the
*  reasons why I'm a scientist and not a lawyer is because a lot of guidelines
*  legally are very vague and they're sort of intentionally so that judges in the
*  judicial system more broadly can figure out what the best ways to interpret
*  those over time actually are. There is an idea of fair use where you can take a
*  little tiny bit of someone else's work and quote it or reproduce it in your own
*  work and there's an idea of parody where you're allowed to do that but how much
*  you can quote changes from context to context. So poetry for example is very
*  difficult to get permission to. You basically need permission to even quote
*  one line from a poem if you're really being legal about it. Whereas just a text
*  from a book you can quote several sentences. That's no problem. If I have an
*  extended quote from somebody then just out of politeness I will ask them. So I
*  did I had an extended quote from Ann Druyan, Carl Sagan's wife, in the big
*  picture and we got permission from her to do it but I don't think we needed
*  permission. It was perfectly covered under fair use. So if you're just quoting a
*  few sentences or even a short paragraph from anything that I've written then go
*  ahead and do it by all means. If you want more than that then probably talking to
*  my publisher Dutton Books is the way to go.
*  Santiago Torres says can you share any thoughts on ideas you have for your next
*  trade book? So my preference is not to do that. I have lots of ideas for the next
*  trade book but until you know a substantial part of the book is actually
*  written which makes me think this is definitely gonna happen I'm always
*  reluctant to do that far ahead of time. I will make an exception not quite for the
*  next trade book but it is becoming real my hope to actually write a textbook on
*  quantum mechanics. I've signed a contract to do that now so I have to get off my
*  butt and actually start writing that. I've written a little bit of it but much
*  most the vast majority of it has yet to be written. So there will be an
*  undergraduate textbook in quantum mechanics for physics majors so people
*  who know a little bit of calculus and linear algebra and so forth but that is
*  definitely going to be written or at least I put myself under an obligation
*  to write that over the next couple years.
*  Dmitry Shevchenko says how exactly is the wave function is the wave nature of
*  quantum fields related to the word wave in wave function? Are they the same
*  types of waves or perhaps one is emerging from the other? Neither one
*  they're not the same type of waves and one is not immersion from the other. The
*  quantum fields are quantized versions of classical fields. So fields are wavy
*  already to start okay that's what a field is. A field is something that has a
*  definite value at every single location in space and time so if it's oscillating
*  up and down that's what you call a wave. The difference between a wave function
*  and a classical wave like that is that the classical waves there's several
*  differences one is just that every different kind of field has its own
*  field okay there's an electric field a magnetic field the electron field the
*  gravitational field these are all completely separate from each other in
*  principle whereas the wave function is a feature of the whole universe all at
*  once. The wave function quantum mechanics it's just a bad name because
*  when they started inventing quantum mechanics and they were thinking about
*  one particle which just had a position then the wave function of a single
*  particle looks a lot like a classical wave right it's just a number a complex
*  number but still just a number at every point in space but once you go beyond
*  one particle once you go to like two particles you don't have two different
*  waves for the two particles you have a single wave function that assigns a
*  complex number to every possible pair of places they could be every possible
*  values for where one particle could be and where another particle could be and
*  for the universe as a whole you assign a complex number to every configuration of
*  the stuff in the universe so it's a very different kind of thing than a classical
*  wave or even a quantum field wave which just comes from starting with that
*  classical wave and quantizing it it's just the word wave is used because
*  that's nothing more deep than that. Frank Cochrat says
*  So I'm not sure what the phrase non metaphysics is doing there I don't think
*  there are any metaphysics arguments for or against a specific physical theory
*  like eternal inflation so I'm gonna stick to physics arguments if that's
*  okay and again I think that there's absolutely physics arguments that can be
*  used to provide evidence you know you don't prove scientific theories you
*  provide evidence for them so inflation makes predictions whether it's eternal
*  inflation or not the kinds of predictions it makes are kind of
*  probabilistic inflation is not a certain specific absolutely ironclad
*  theory it's a paradigm into which many different theories can fit so it's very
*  often the case that any particular kind of prediction that inflation might want
*  to make such as the existence of gravitational waves generated by the
*  inflationary period in the early universe if you try hard enough you can
*  wriggle out of that prediction while inflation is still actually true to me
*  that's not a problem with inflation that's just a bad luck for human beings
*  you know no one ever promised you a rose garden no one ever said it would be easy
*  to figure out what the universe is actually doing but if we do what we're
*  doing right now which is making all the observations we can looking for
*  gravitational waves and there's also specific higher-order statistical
*  features of large-scale structure in the universe etc. then what would expect in
*  specific inflationary models then I think absolutely all that would count as
*  evidence for inflation and the absence for it would decrease the credence that
*  you have that inflation is right
*  so I'm not really surprised by disagreement because why in the world
*  would you have a conference where you sat around agreed with each other all the
*  time right there's enormous amounts of agreement in the room but of course we
*  didn't talk about that so the whole point was to get people in the room who
*  already agreed on crucially important questions about naturalism right there
*  were no supernaturalists in the room there were no non physicalists in the
*  room as far as I know people basically believe the universe is natural it obeys
*  the laws of nature there's nothing outside these are huge questions about
*  which we have consensus in the room so no one is making arguments on the base
*  for objective morality on the basis of God's command or anything like that but
*  you don't want to say that over and over again you want to go to the parts where
*  you disagree and talk about that so that is a whole point of that workshop in my
*  mind that's why it's not called celebrating naturalism it was called
*  moving naturalism forward because I get tired of the arguments between
*  naturalists and theists and I want to have naturalists appreciate the fact
*  there's a whole bunch of questions to which we don't know the answer to which
*  we as naturalists have not agreed on how to think about these questions like free
*  will and consciousness and morality so that was the whole point so I mean I
*  would have been very very very disappointed if we had had a workshop
*  there and everyone had agreed with each other that would have been very much
*  against the purpose Stefan Benninger says the Schrodinger equation is
*  mathematically close to the diffusion equation is there a way to understand
*  this relationship in the many worlds interpretation so I'm sorry Stefan but I
*  just don't know a lot about this purported relation I have no doubt that
*  it's real you if you if you go into the question in the patreon account you can
*  see a link that Stefan has provided to a paper that makes the mathematical
*  relationship to the Schrodinger equation and the diffusion equation clear but
*  when you're asking the question is there a way to understand this relationship in
*  many worlds interpretation I would be very skeptical that many worlds
*  specifically has anything to say about this because many worlds says that the
*  Schrodinger equation is true but so does every other version of quantum mechanics
*  usually right every version of quantum mechanics as the wave function usually
*  obeys the Schrodinger equation sometimes it gets violated many world says it
*  never gets violated so I don't think that there's any special insight into
*  why the mathematical structure of the Schrodinger equation is close to any
*  other specific equation that you would get from many worlds versus anywhere
*  else I could be wrong because I don't understand a lot about this particular
*  claim Hector Mata says I've noticed you mentioned David Deutsch is the fabric of
*  reality in your further reading for the big picture however I also noticed you
*  don't mention the beginning of infinity which overlaps a lot on its subject
*  matter with the big picture do it charges against induction and rejects
*  Bayesian reasoning as an extension of induction I really like Bayesian
*  thinking but it's really hard to argue against Deutsch so the question is can
*  you help me you know I don't understand David Deutsch's rejection of Bayesian
*  reasoning to be honest I'm not super duper familiar with it I've read a
*  little bit about what he says and I just don't get it I mean you know I
*  apologize for that I don't think that Bayesian reasoning is an extension of
*  induction in any way right it's a way of getting more information and
*  updating your credences I mean of course you have to be careful here
*  there's basis theorem which everyone agrees is a theorem of the probability
*  calculus okay Deutsch and everyone else the idea of Bayesian Bayesian reasoning
*  as a way to learn more about the world is just saying that these particular
*  rules of probability reasoning are the best way to understand our empirical
*  world to me this is just obviously true so I disagree with Deutsch about this
*  apparently so much so that I have trouble understanding even what his
*  objection is sorry about that Paul Hess says if we blue if we view
*  complexity in the universe as something which starts low then increases then
*  decreases where on that curve do we seem to be based on the observable universe
*  that's very hard to say of course because our ability to quantify
*  complexity is pretty meager right now I would say that here's two arguments to
*  give opposite conclusions one argument is complexity is still increasing why
*  well just here in our environment on earth complexity is increasing because
*  we're able to build more and more complex technological things we're still
*  sort not really surpassing organic things by very much if at all but we can
*  imagine doing that in the next thousands year of years of technological
*  development there's no reason to suspect at all that we can't build machines and
*  technology that are way more complex than human beings or other life forms
*  now having said that we're small compared to the universe so I'm not
*  quite sure how to quantify how important that is so the other argument that goes
*  the other way is we're near the top of the complexity curve and the argument
*  there is you know think about what's happening in the universe stars form
*  planets form planets are where the most complexity happens as far as we know in
*  the universe and the peak of star forming the universe's history is already
*  passed so you can imagine that you know it takes some time for complexity to
*  build up as the first generation of stars forms they explode the second
*  generation has planets and planets can have complex life on them and things
*  like that but then those stars start giving out right start burning other
*  nuclear fuel fading away and that is a fade back to equilibrium and simplicity
*  again so I think that on the broadest strokes maybe we're still on the uptick
*  a little bit but we're pretty close to the top of that curve would be my guess
*  cosmologically speaking like if you coarse-grained into bins of a hundred
*  million years I bet we're near the top even ten million years Sol Zemet says I
*  feel like I've come up with a solution to Hume's is-ought problem and before I
*  start acting on it I'd love you to tell me where I've made a mistake so here it
*  The truth of fallibilism leaves open a possibility even if it is infinitesimal
*  that there is some objective source of moral truth to be discovered or
*  understood if an objective if any objective morality exists there's an
*  objective moral cost taking longer to discover it therefore maximizing
*  knowledge is objectively good because it increases the chances that objective
*  objective moral truth is discovered I know this is similar to Pascal's wager
*  but I don't think it has the same problems so let me rephrase in case that
*  wasn't completely clear what I take Sol's proposal to be people like me
*  think that there's no objective morality that there's no way to go from the
*  reality that is objective of what the universe is doing which is just a bunch
*  of stuff going on according to laws of physics not really caring about right
*  and wrong to prescriptive normative statements about good and bad that's
*  just a logical impossibility as far as I can tell but Saul is saying well maybe
*  we've made a mistake in that analysis and there really is objective good and
*  then if we found it it would be objectively good to find it therefore
*  shouldn't we look even if it's unlikely right so this this is analogous to
*  Pascal's wager which says maybe God doesn't exist I don't know but if God
*  doesn't exist I can just live my life whatever way I want if God does exist I
*  better believe in him because I want to go to heaven therefore I want to believe
*  in God because it doesn't cost me anything and it might benefit me in a
*  enormous amount there's a lot of reasons why this kind of reasoning isn't very
*  good so let me mention one in the context of Pascal's wager and I think it
*  will be clear where its analogy does work in the is ought problem of course
*  maybe God doesn't exist and maybe he does and if he did you would want he
*  wants you to sort of pray to him and that gets you into heaven it's also
*  possible that maybe God exists and God would be insulted by this kind of dopey
*  argument and send you for help to hell for believing it it's also possible that
*  the devil exists and is tricking you into believing this there's a lot of
*  things that are possible they're very unlikely according to our best evidence
*  and reasoning and they might have very dramatic effects but those effects
*  might be the opposite of each other in one very very unlikely but possible
*  thing if you don't believe in God you go to heaven or sorry if you don't believe
*  in God you go to hell but in another one if you don't believe in God you go to
*  heaven okay there's a million different possibilities or if you do believe in
*  God you're tortured etc etc I think the conclusion from this it's very similar
*  to something that Martin Reese mentioned in the podcast I did with him maybe
*  turning on the large hadron collider will make a black hole that destroys the
*  world but maybe turn on large hadron collider will lead to a discovery that
*  gives us free energy forever both of these things are incredibly incredibly
*  unlikely so how do you deal with them when there's a whole bunch of unlikely
*  things with huge consequences I think the sensible thing to do is to not take
*  them very seriously like you can't really honestly put a very good
*  probability a very good credence on these being true all you can say is
*  they're really really unlikely so I think that the right way to act is to
*  use your best logic and reason it's not innocent right I mean the part of
*  Pascal's wager where it says it doesn't hurt you to believe in God and therefore
*  go ahead and do it is entirely false it certainly can hurt you to believe in God
*  because belief has consequences likewise the belief in objective truth
*  objective good objective morality would also have consequences what if your
*  objective morality said gay marriage is bad right I mean there are people who
*  believe that there is objective morality that says that that can lead to real
*  harm to real human beings so I'm entirely unconvinced by all these
*  arguments that try to boost up some really really really really unlikely
*  thing by saying well it's harmless to believe it and its consequences are
*  enormous if its consequences are enormous it's never harmless or harmful
*  to believe it you should think about what it means to believe it you should
*  properly give it the tiny tiny tiny fraction of likelihood and go on with
*  your life just not believing that it's true Pauline Barron says in your
*  interview with Carl Friston it was not quite clear to me whether he makes a
*  distinction between unconscious instinctive predictions which our brain
*  makes all the time and conscious rational predictions or does he treat
*  them all the same that's actually a really good question I'm not exactly
*  sure so my guess please do not attribute this to Carl because it's my guess is
*  that he's thinking of our unconscious instinctive predictions when he says
*  that you know the brain works in a certain way so as to minimize free
*  energy etc that is what the brain does when it's just getting through the day
*  unconsciously when it's doing its system one kind of work when it's
*  actually cognitive when you're actually consciously rationally thinking about
*  things I don't think that there is any analogous free energy argument you can
*  override almost any simple kind of minimization procedure not to say
*  there's not a minimization procedure but it would be a complicated one not
*  something simple like free energy Johnny says in Dragon Ball Z they have gravity
*  chambers where the gravity is set higher allowing them to train there and become
*  much stronger when going back to normal gravity is there any merit to that idea
*  in the real world or is it just silly so I mean there is merit to the idea that
*  if you could train in a region with higher gravity it might make you
*  stronger in exactly the same way as training carrying weights makes you
*  stronger right if what you're asking is could you build a gravity chamber like
*  that there's two different answers one is no you cannot really build a gravity
*  chamber like that you cannot manipulate the strength of gravity according to
*  Einstein's general relativity the strength of gravity is directly tied to
*  the mass of the earth and you cannot you know move around masses comparable to
*  the earth so that they only affect what's going on inside a little chamber
*  and not outside gravity is not manipulable in the way in that way as
*  for instance electricity and magnetism are manipulatable in that way the
*  difference is that in E&M you have both positive charges and negative charges
*  and by carefully arranging the distribution of positive and negative
*  you can make whatever electromagnetic field you want in gravity you only have
*  positive charges every particle in the universe creates more gravity so all you
*  can do is increase the amount of gravity by bringing more stuff together now
*  having said that you could mimic it in a centrifuge right you could mimic it by
*  taking a room putting it on a sort of pendulum and swinging it around really
*  fast because Einstein also says that acceleration and gravity are very
*  related to each other so just accelerate something and that would be
*  just like having more gravity an anonymous commenter says I recall you
*  saying that you learned about the many worlds interpretation before Bell's
*  inequality that was surprising to me in popular science land Bell's inequality
*  is one of the first things you learn about quantum mechanics where did you
*  learn about many worlds when did you decide it was probably right I don't
*  remember exactly when I first learned about many worlds I know that I was
*  thinking about it at a scientific level at least in graduate school by the time
*  I got to graduate school and was thinking about cosmology you know this is
*  circa 1990 and one of the hot topics was Euclidean quantum gravity and Sydney
*  Coleman's idea that you could use wormholes in Euclidean quantum gravity
*  to understand the vanishing of the vacuum energy and quantum cosmology more
*  generally was a hot topic back in those days and essentially almost everyone who
*  does quantum cosmology believes in the many worlds interpretation of quantum
*  mechanics so I went completely along with that I had no idea that there were
*  any sensible alternatives I had strong feelings that the usual Copenhagen story
*  made no sense and that many worlds seemed to make sense but I did not really
*  appreciate that there were still viable theories of hidden variables or
*  dynamical collapse or anything like that Ramon Roja says I've been reading a bit
*  about brain cosmology that's B-R-A-N-E brain a common theme is that no
*  experimental or observational evidence exists for extra dimensions if we were
*  flatlanders living on a plane intersecting a 3d object or living on its
*  surface what sort of experiments can we perform to reveal that the true 3d shape
*  of what we perceive of as a 2d universe well the simplest answer is gravity okay
*  I mean this is one of the great things about gravity is it can't be confined to
*  a two-dimensional brain so if we really did live in so let's let's say just to
*  get my own talking about this sensible we live in three-dimensional space okay
*  so let's imagine we live in a three-dimensional space embedded in a
*  four-dimensional world how would you know well and I don't mean
*  four-dimensional space time you mean embedded in four-dimensional space well
*  gravity would leak out into that extra fourth dimension of space that would
*  the Newtonian law of gravity would not be an inverse square law it would be an
*  inverse cubed law so the reason why gravity is inverse square is because the
*  gravitational lines of force spread out and dilute as the distance squared
*  because we live in three-dimensional space if gravity really escaped into
*  four-dimensional space it would spread out faster that's the empirical way that
*  we can do it and in fact if you believe that there was an extra dimension or two
*  extra dimensions and they were very small you could do experiments testing
*  Newton's inverse square law and people have done that most famously Eric
*  Adelberger and his collaborators in the et Bosch experiment at the University of
*  Washington to the best of our empirical knowledge space seems to be
*  three-dimensional all the way down Simon Carter says I think he once joked that
*  if GRW this is a spontaneous collapse theory of quantum mechanics was proved
*  true that you would leave physics but if that does turn out to be right or some
*  other theory other than many worlds would you be able to just take it on the
*  chin and move on sure it was just a joke I would be able to take on a chain no
*  matter what reality does and I think that every physicist is like that of
*  course we have preferences we have beliefs we have credences we have our
*  favorite theories but whatever nature does nature is doing something cool
*  because nature is just cool by definition so if nature is doing GRW or
*  dynamical collapse then that would be really really interesting in all sorts
*  of ways my joke was to make clear to everyone who was listening that in my
*  view you know many worlds is definitely the leader by a long shot things like
*  hidden variable theories make sense to me I don't think they really fit the
*  world in which we live but if some better version of them came along that
*  would be okay I would get it but something where the wave function just
*  randomly collapses just seems horrible to me I would learn to adapt yes but I
*  put a much smaller credence on that theory than I do on hidden variable
*  theories for example as an alternative to many worlds Kristen Cosentino says
*  your answer to my previous question regarding many worlds was that when the
*  universe divides it doesn't create a new universe but divides the existing one
*  into two since this potentially happens billions and billions of times will we
*  ever run out of universe so no we're never gonna run out of universe sorry
*  let me let me let me be a little bit more precise about that there's two and
*  I talk about this a lot in the book in something deeply hidden if you want a
*  longer discussion of it I talk about exactly this using exactly these words
*  so the difference is is Hilbert space is the space of all possible wave
*  functions finite dimensional or infinite dimensional if it's infinite dimensional
*  then no we will never run out of different ways the universe can branch
*  we have an infinite amount of room in which to move and that's very possible
*  it's also very possible that Hilbert space is finite dimensional and in that
*  case you will have a maximum number of splittings you can possibly do but you
*  don't run out of universe that's why I quickly said you don't run out of
*  universe rather the splitting stops happening right in order for branching to
*  happen in the way that we know about it certain conditions have to be met the
*  environment the space of things that we don't keep track of in our quantum wave
*  function has to be much much larger than the space of the classical things
*  is classical approximately classical things that we do keep track of and that
*  will eventually stop to be true far in the future of the universe once we
*  approach thermal equilibrium so this approach to effectively running out in
*  the quantum sense classically it looks like we're approaching thermal
*  equilibrium which will eventually happen right the stars will burn out the black
*  holes will evaporate ten to the 100 years from now things are gonna look
*  like thermal equilibrium branching of the wave function in the usual way we
*  understand it will no longer happen James O'Sullivan says in the last AMA I
*  asked for clarification on the double slit experiment why a particles
*  interaction with the slits doesn't cause decoherence you said that the double
*  slit experiment is an idealization and that we need to imagine the states of
*  the particles can you elaborate on what is actually done in the lab then so I
*  think I said what you need to do is imagine the states of the slits not just
*  the particles which we never do in when we talk about the double slit experiment
*  I cannot elaborate on what is actually done in the lab this is a complicated
*  question okay that you know experimentalists are highly trained
*  professionals and I'm not one of them I can if you really really are interested
*  I can recommend reading a book by Yakir Aronov and collaborators called quantum
*  paradoxes or quantum puzzles something like that basically he goes through a
*  long list chapter by chapter of these kinds of questions right like so he
*  talks about the double slit experiment in great detail and he does it in a very
*  sensible way he says what if you have these slits but you put the slits on
*  wheels so that when the electron goes through one slit or the other it can
*  actually nudge the slits back and forth this is a way that you can actually
*  model the interaction with the slits then you can talk about the wave
*  function for that blah blah blah and of course it depends on details is the
*  answer but it's all work-outable I can assure you that. Mark Chirion says I find
*  it an equally difficult conceptual leap to think of space emerging out of
*  quantum entanglement as time flowing relative to fixed cardinal points
*  instead of left to right. Does understanding the math make the former
*  easier for you to imagine? Can math be a language that makes ideas like this
*  conceivable? I think the different physicists and different mathematicians
*  have different approaches to conceptualizing these difficult ideas I'm
*  actually more visual than most people I do try to visualize things but if you're
*  really doing this math at a deep level you can't rely on the ability to
*  visualize things you know when you say that oh there's a Hilbert space that has
*  a dimensionality of 10 to the 10 to the 123 and someone says well how do you
*  visualize that you don't visualize it you visualize it by imagining it has a
*  dimensionality of 3 and then there's a lot more that you're not seeing that's
*  really all you can do it's a it's hideously inadequate to the task so but
*  what you can do which is implied in your question is you can trust the math right
*  if I understand the math for two or three dimensional Hilbert spaces then
*  the extension to Google upon Google dimensional Hilbert spaces should just
*  be a matter of trusting the math it would be very helpful to be able to
*  visualize these other things but I can't do it no one else can do it either we
*  got to do the best we can do Zachary Roland says have you ever had a serious
*  talk with Lee Smolin I've been following both of your research and was a believer
*  in Max Tegmark's mathematical universe however upon pondering Gertel's theorem
*  I find it very hard to believe that there can be a mathematical framework in
*  the real universe when we know there are holes in the math we're working with so
*  I'm not sure what is the relationship of the different parts of your question
*  here sure I've had plenty of serious talks with Lee Smolin we've been at
*  conferences together we've talked together a lot about various different
*  things I really don't I'm not quite seeing what this how this relates to the
*  mathematical universe question but I don't think offhand that Gertel's
*  theorem is an obstacle to Max's mathematical universe idea Max's ideas
*  that every mathematical structure is real there's a really existing universe
*  corresponding to every such mathematical structure Gertel's
*  incompleteness theorem is about provably true statements namely that any
*  sufficiently powerful formal system will have statements that cannot be proven
*  true but are true if the formal system is consistent but I don't think that the
*  provability of statements plays an important role in Max's theory maybe it
*  does and I'm just missing something there Sandro Stuckey says you've said
*  earlier the quantum field theories are typically developed by quantizing a
*  classical field theory so I guess there may be a classical electron field
*  corresponding to that in QED does this field show up somewhere in classical
*  electrodynamics so the answer is it could you know there is a classical
*  electron field that you can write down you can write down the equation for it
*  the equation is called the Dirac equation that's what it is the Dirac
*  equation is precisely the equation obeyed by a non-interacting classical
*  electron field the problem is it's not a huge problem but it's the reason why you
*  never hear about it is because the classical field doesn't do a very good
*  job of approximating the real-world behavior right the classical
*  electromagnetic field is a really good approximation to quantum electrodynamics
*  whereas the classical electron field is not and the reason why is because of the
*  Pauli exclusion principle the exclusion principle says you can't have two
*  particles of the electron form of fermion fields doing exactly the same
*  thing so that makes classical matter fields classical fermion fields just not
*  be a very good approximation to anything you don't pile up many many many
*  electrons doing the same thing to get classical behavior so instead when you
*  do classical electrodynamics you model the electron as a point charge but even
*  though you know that what it really is is a quantum mechanical vibration in the
*  electron field there's just no overlap between the regime where the classical
*  electron field description would work and the real world
*  Dimitri Pukhashov says you were talking about how space-time could actually be
*  emergent from the Everett theory does this reasoning also apply to quantum
*  field theory could it be derived from the evolution of the universal wave
*  function that's the hope absolutely you know we absolutely would like it to be
*  the case that someday we will derive not just gravity and space-time but quantum
*  field theory and the standard model etc from entanglement properties and the
*  behavior of the universal wave function having done that yet plenty of work to
*  be done for young prospective graduate students out there
*  John Reynolds says we understand the cosmic microwave background has a
*  temperature we also understand this temperature was hotter in the past and
*  will be colder in the future if it was possible to measure this temperature and
*  its rate of change accurately enough would this not be the ultimate perfect
*  clock tied directly to the entropy of the universe so two things it three
*  things number one it's an okay clock it is a clock right a clock is just
*  something that distinguishes between different moments of time the
*  temperature of the cosmic microwave background does that because the
*  universe expands number two it's not a perfect clock because if you want a
*  perfect clock you need to have infinite resolution between different moments of
*  time but when you measure the temperature of something you're waiting
*  for photons to hit your thermometer or whatever it takes time to do a reading
*  there's no sense in which you have infinitely fine gradations in the
*  moments of time that you'll be measuring by measuring the temperature of the CMB
*  and the final thing is it is not tied directly to the entropy of the universe
*  because if you were in a universe that was nothing but cosmic microwave
*  background the entropy of that universe wouldn't be changing as it was expanding
*  and the universe was cooling the temperature of the microwave background
*  would be decreasing but the volume would be increasing and the effects would
*  cancel out and you can sort of intuitively get that by remembering that
*  it's reversible right if you expand the universe the microwave background
*  photons cool off if you contract it they heat up in exactly the same way it's a
*  reversible process so no entropy is being either created or destroyed along
*  the way Eric Wernlich says or Wernlich a much word is there a reason time must be
*  conceived as a single dimension when a quantum event causes the universe to
*  split in the many-worlds theory could you think of them as each being a
*  separate temporal dimension I mean empirically time is a single dimension
*  right like I can move different directions in space I can't move
*  different directions of time that's it mathematically we could write down
*  models of the universe in which there was more than one time dimension those
*  models don't look anything like the world in which we live when you say the
*  universe is splitting can you think of them as each being a separate temporal
*  dimension I don't think so there's one equation the Schrodinger equation and
*  that equation has the letter T in it for time and that time keeps track of the
*  time and all the branches of the wave function at the same in the same way so
*  time this time that is moving on different branches of the wave function
*  is the same time not separate time dimensions Sherman flips says the delayed
*  choice quantum eraser experiment showed an interesting way in which
*  decoherence can be manipulated experimentally with decoherence now as
*  more of a known factor can we use whether it happens or not to determine
*  interesting things about systems by substituting them for the eraser in the
*  experimental apparatus is this what quantum computing is so I don't think so
*  I mean I'm be misunderstanding the question here a little bit the thing
*  about decoherence in the quantum eraser etc. is there's no experimental
*  surprises right like the delayed choice quantum eraser has been worked out
*  theoretically what should happen and when they try to do it in the lab that's
*  what happens there's nothing that we're learning about quantum mechanics other
*  than that it continues to be right it's the same quantum theory that was written
*  down in the 1920s right we didn't need to modify quantum mechanics or
*  understanding of it to take into account decoherence or the delayed choice
*  quantum eraser or whatever and I don't think that anything would be different
*  if we replace the eraser with something else you know we there might not be
*  things we understand about a certain material system but it's not quantum
*  mechanics we're learning about as far as quantum computing quantum computing
*  tries to avoid decoherence as long as possible so that you can keep things in
*  superposition in the process of the quantum computation but again you know
*  you need to learn about matter about the stuff that is making up your qubits but
*  you're not learning anything especially novel about the fundamental rules of
*  quantum theory along the way Adrian Perez says hey Sean you've probably been the
*  biggest influence on my philosophy oh thank you Adrian seems like yesterday I
*  was sitting at home after high school watching your naturalism lecture on
*  YouTube just wanted to know who is that person for you if you have one I don't
*  think I have one I built up my philosophical beliefs from all sorts of
*  sources I didn't discover philosophy as a formal subject until I was in college
*  until I went to Villanova and they had requirements these are back in the days
*  he had lots of core course requirements so we had to take three semesters of
*  philosophy as well as three semesters of religious studies which was quasi
*  philosophical and I liked it and liked it and liked it more and learned more
*  about it but there was never a moment of you know one big person or one big
*  philosophy grabbing my attention I mean different people's personalities are
*  different my personality is kind of anti individual idolizing of anybody for
*  anything other than Julia serving for playing basketball other than that I
*  think that we should be pluralistic and willing to give up on people as we
*  learn more about them and we alert that they're not who we thought they were and
*  we should be willing to increase people in our esteem if we learn more things
*  about them that are admirable Jamie Laurie says I like the Roger Ebert quote
*  the cinema is a machine for creating empathy but it made me think listening
*  to podcasts with incredibly smart people is a Dunning Kruger machine I love
*  listening to your podcast but I think I understand quantum mechanics in the way
*  my dog understands English as a science communicator is there any technology you
*  can conceive that would really make a difference in bridging the comprehensive
*  gap for the non-technical audience so yes that technology is called the book
*  if you really want to understand this stuff it's just no way of understanding
*  physics theories without understanding the mathematical basis of them but
*  that's understandable it just takes work it just takes time there is no royal
*  road to geometry as Euclid is I think it was Euclid was supposed to have said to
*  his royal tutti you have to learn the math you have to learn the physics you
*  can learn them through books you can learn them through online courses the
*  books are there the courses are there it's there for everybody there's just
*  no shortcut however at the same time I want to say that I'm sure you understand
*  quantum mechanics better than your dog understands English your dog
*  understands a little bit of English right some commands but we can
*  conceptually understand parts of physics even if we don't understand the math
*  what we can't do is manipulate them we can't solve the equations and find out
*  what's going to happen in the way that a professional can Ezra Parzabok says is
*  there a grand is a grand unified theory inevitable or is it possible that it is
*  a brute fact that the math for QED and the math for gravity will never add up
*  to a grand unified theory so just so everyone knows the phrase grand unified
*  theory is a technical term within physics which does not include gravity
*  the idea of a grand unified theory is a theory that includes electromagnetism
*  the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force this was the big goal in
*  the 1970s and some of the 80s to find such a theory the idea of putting
*  gravity into it just didn't wasn't there that seemed too hard it wasn't until
*  string theory came along and really string theory became popular in the mid
*  80s the first super string revolution 1984 that's when people began to think
*  that they might honestly be able to include gravity along with all the other
*  forces of nature and the technical term as it were for that is a theory of
*  everything so I think what you're asking is it will will is a theory of everything
*  inevitable and I think the answer is yes it clearly is inevitable because the
*  theory of everything is just whatever the correct description of nature is I
*  mean nature exists nature is doing something whatever the correct
*  description of that is is the theory of everything it might not be elegant or
*  simple it might look ontologically nothing like what we're familiar with
*  or it might we just don't know but the existence of the universe is evidence
*  for the existence of a description of the universe and therefore the theory
*  must be there Brent Meeker says how would sterile neutrinos fit into the
*  standard model would they have enough rest mass to be dark matter so sterile
*  neutrinos are a hypothetical form of neutrino that doesn't interact with the
*  weak nuclear force like regular neutrinos do it's not hard to modify the
*  standard model to put sterile neutrinos in there could they have enough rest
*  mass to be dark matter it's not one of the more popular candidates but I
*  believe please don't quote me on this but I believe that you can come up with
*  theories in which sterile neutrinos are the dark matter Alex Kosenko at UCLA is
*  one of the world's experts in neutrino physics and he can use neutrinos to
*  explain anything as long as you believe in certain neutrino properties so I
*  think that there's a wide window open for neutrinos to explain things like dark
*  matter as well as other things Robert Ruxin-Drescu says I would like to know
*  exactly how exactly does a photon interact with an electron considering
*  the two of them are waves are we guaranteed to have a collision between
*  the two in the particle way of thinking well I think the point is that the
*  particle way of thinking is not very good if you want to really zoom in on
*  what's happening during an interaction of the photon with the electron if you
*  believed that both electrons and photons were truly particle like then
*  the chances the two particles which by definition have zero size would literally
*  hit each other would be zero right it's a set of measure zero the trajectories
*  that in which those two things would intersect so at the very least you
*  should not treat the photon as exactly particle like or the photon has a
*  wavelength and things like that so maybe you can say you could treat the
*  electron as a particle but really you should just do it right I mean neither
*  the electron or the photon are actually particles they're vibrations in waves
*  and they interact when they overlap and that can be overlapping to a greater or
*  lesser extent and then there's a greater or lesser probability that you will
*  observe them to scatter off of each other Thomas Prunty says a question was
*  asked last week maybe that means last month about arriving at home arriving at
*  the same answer by different means in physics I wonder what part of my
*  subconscious made me say arriving at home sorry about that about arriving at
*  the same answer by different means in physics this reminded me of a different
*  case the Einstein AB coefficients and the rate of spontaneous emission it was
*  calculated originally by Einstein using thermodynamic arguments and basic quantum
*  mechanics even though as I understand it spontaneous emission relies
*  fundamentally on quantum field theory and was only later calculated from
*  first principles in QED are they really two fundamentally different ways of
*  arriving at the same answer or they actually the same somehow I'm gonna
*  prevaricate a little bit here because it's been literally decades since I've
*  looked at the calculation of Einstein AB coefficients in any details that was when
*  I was taking a quantum course in graduate school but I think basically
*  there it's not quite the same as two fundamentally different ways of getting
*  the same answer because the answers you're getting are slightly different
*  things Einstein was trying to understand a way in which various stochastic
*  processes interacted and happened in the same environment in order to give an
*  answer that we saw in experiments right whereas the quantum field theory thing
*  is saying you know exactly what this microscopic situation is of this
*  particular atom and this particular electron and let's ask what happens
*  next I would say they're complementary but the questions that they're asking
*  and answering are not exactly the same so it's not really an example of two
*  fundamentally different ways of arriving at the same answer Paul Hardy says can
*  you explain what the transactional view of quantum physics is I watched a video
*  with Ruth Kastner explaining it but did not understand it so no I cannot explain
*  that one either sorry about that I'm just not familiar I've heard people
*  mention it before it's not very clear to me what it actually says sorry about
*  that Razi Ahmed says let's assume you were creating an entropic score of
*  intelligence you might put ESI you might put Laplace's demon towards one end of
*  the scale with an ESI of one you might argue the demon has no intrinsic
*  understanding of anything what would you put on the other end of the scale what a
*  species with ESI of zero be one that is able to encapsulate all laws of physics
*  in a few characters so I'm going to apologize here also because I don't
*  exactly know what you mean by this entropic score of intelligence it seems
*  vaguely related to a level of coarse graining right Laplace's demon
*  visualizes the world in a maximally fine-grained way it knows every little
*  detail about everything you and I observe the world in a coarse grained way
*  even when we look at the table right in front of us we don't see the microscopic
*  state of it we see some macroscopic observable properties so Laplace's
*  demon I've often said in some sense doesn't need to know about ideas like
*  entropy and temperature these are higher level emergent phenomena Laplace's
*  demon only needs to know the microscopic level it could like you know Laplace's
*  demon is made up it's imaginary we could imagine a version of Laplace's demon
*  that knew about emergent properties like entropy and temperature we can also
*  imagine people like us that only know about entropy and temperature and do not
*  know through our everyday senses through our eyes and ears the locations of any
*  fundamental particles but if that's the scale you're using then the maximally
*  coarse-grained observable is just the universe expressed as a single number
*  okay I don't know what that number is maybe it's average density or something
*  like that so someone tells you that number it's five that gives you nothing
*  right that gives you no information about anything at all that's in the
*  nature of coarse-graining as your coarse-graining becomes more and more
*  coarse you have less and less microscopic information so in the
*  transition from completely fine-grained to increasingly coarse-grained there are
*  some useful places to be and some not useful places to be maximally coarse
*  grained is not a useful place to be minimally coarse-grained that is to say
*  maximally fine-grained where you know every detail that is a useful place to
*  be in principle but in practice is completely useless you don't have the
*  storage capacity to actually work that way so there are different layers in
*  between where you actually get some useful ability to predict what will
*  happen empirically on the basis of incomplete information but the actual
*  places where that is is very very detailed and hard to predict what that
*  would be I mean we we find it out empirically we don't predict it from
*  first principles and I really don't know what it would even mean to relate this
*  to some kind of score of intelligence Sean K Davis says I find myself
*  wondering if you think there is a rock bottom to reality if so what do you
*  think that rock bottom might be so yes I mean related to the previous question I
*  think that nature itself by construction is the rock bottom to
*  reality maybe what you mean is is there a complete comprehensive theory of
*  reality and again yes for exactly the same reasons maybe what you mean is does
*  that complete theory of reality have the form of a theory of really really tiny
*  things interacting with each other and that we don't know that we have no idea
*  that's not what my favorite idea would be right my favorite idea would be
*  something like the rock bottom theory is the wave function of the universe a
*  vector in Hilbert space and all the talk that we have of space and particles and
*  fields and interactions is emergent at some higher level but that I have no
*  confidence that that's right we have no way of knowing how close we are to the
*  final theory of all the stuff that makes up the reality Jake Johansson says if a
*  quantum computer has to measure the state of a qubit before it can use it
*  computationally how is that any different than a classical bit well it
*  doesn't so this is important a quantum computer has to measure the state of the
*  qubits that it outputs but when a quantum computer is manipulating the
*  qubits when it's actually doing the calculation it's never measuring
*  anything measuring things collapse their wave function and that's stochastic and
*  random and unpredictable the whole point of the quantum computer is to maintain
*  quantum coherence not measure anything not collapse anything do everything
*  deterministically output a set of qubits and then measure those and the
*  property will be that you try to output a set of output a set of qubits with
*  the property that when you measure them they tell you the right answer to the
*  calculation you're doing with very very very high probability hopefully you can
*  get that probability high enough to be useful Peter Bamber says if you had to
*  move from fundamental physics to applied physics what area would you think would
*  attract you and why so I'm actually working more these days in non
*  equilibrium statistical mechanics this is an interest that came out my interest
*  in entropy and Bayes's theorem and things like that and also complexity
*  theory this is a kind of applied physics I don't know whether or not how you
*  should exactly characterize it because what we're doing is looking for very
*  robust rules obeyed by complex systems complex statistical mechanical systems
*  so it's a kind of fundamental physics but I think that there's a more
*  traditional definition of fundamental physics where you're looking at
*  elementary particles and fields not at composite objects like complex systems
*  okay so that's what I would do in fact that is what I'm doing to a greater
*  extent than I was before Kellan Rivers says what is your opinion of Trump's
*  response to the coronavirus pandemic including the two trillion dollar
*  stimulus package I don't have any detailed feelings about the stimulus
*  package I have no idea whether Donald Trump gets any credit if at all for that
*  it went through Congress there's a lot that goes into how a sausage is made
*  when a stimulus package like that gets passed through Congress I'm sure that
*  all sorts of representatives and senators on both parties put their
*  special things into the package as much as they could once two trillion dollars
*  is going through the pipeline skimming off a billion here a billion there
*  doesn't seem that hard right I do think we need some kind of stimulus package as
*  I've said elsewhere my own preference would be to give it to poor people to
*  give it to people who would spend the money just give people cash let them
*  keep the economy going by circulating that cash if you give money to people
*  who will spend it then people who are not poor will quickly get the money
*  because they're owning the companies on which it's spent right so I really want
*  you know my real fear in the coronavirus epidemic aside from the obvious health
*  fears the fear of getting sick and dying and other people dying or small
*  businesses and for my own personal reasons small restaurants and pubs and
*  things like that entertainment venues the kind of things that make our lives
*  colorful and enjoyable when things are going well small restaurants especially
*  it's just gonna be so hard for them to survive this and I think that's a
*  terrible tragedy and I wish that more were being done to stop it in terms of
*  stopping the epidemic the pandemic I think that Trump has done a terrible
*  terrible job mostly by neglect by not taking it seriously early on and by
*  early on I mean you know years before we had any idea that the pandemic was going
*  to hit he's a short-term thinker he dismantled the pandemic response team in
*  the CDC etc he slashed funding for dealing with these kinds of unlikely but
*  terrible emergencies and we are feeling it the United States is now the epicenter
*  of the pandemic we have more cases than anybody else you don't know that for
*  sure because maybe other countries are not reporting accurately but certainly
*  it is very very bad getting worse very very rapidly and to some extent it's our
*  fault both a lack of preparation and a lack of dealing with it quickly when it
*  happened Ricardo Rosera says do you think the hard problem of consciousness
*  is an actual problem whenever I hear someone talk about it I always conclude
*  that it is just a bad question caused by thinking that a philosophical zombie is
*  plausible so I do think that it's a it's a real problem in the sense that it is
*  okay to ask the question the hard problem of consciousness being how do
*  you account for first-person subjective experiences the redness of red you know
*  the things that you can feel but not really communicate to somebody else but
*  I don't think it's hard in the sense of the kinds of explanations for those
*  things are going to be fundamentally conceptually distinct from the kinds of
*  explanations that we have in the case of the easy problem like why do you see the
*  why are you able to recognize the red of a stop sign as being distinct from the
*  green of a green light I don't think there's anything spooky about our
*  first-person experiences I don't think you need to step outside the usual way
*  of explaining things I think eventually what will happen is you will understand
*  what happens in the brain when you have those experiences we will call that
*  understanding the answer to the hard problem Marianne Marcaulay says can we
*  have the tiniest controllable singularity in orbit to be used as a
*  mega battery so no I don't think so for one thing you don't have singularities
*  right there's something called the cosmic censorship conjecture put forward
*  by Roger Penrose previous mindscape guest which says that whenever there's a
*  singularity in nature it's surrounded by an event horizon so really what you have
*  is a black hole right an event horizon surrounding a singularity and black
*  holes by themselves are not batteries there's if you have a black hole that is
*  not spinning there's no way to get energy out of it it's in its lowest
*  energy state given its its macroscopic parameters it is it is in its highest
*  entropy state let's put it that way given its mass so it's not a battery in
*  any realistic sense if you have a spinning black hole that is an energy
*  source that you can extract energy from in principle that is also something it
*  was invented by Roger Penrose called the Penrose process if you want to look
*  it up in practice we have no idea how to do that and also in practice a smaller
*  black hole will be much harder to extract energy from from than a large
*  black hole large black holes even though they're larger are actually milder
*  outside there's a milder gravitational field outside so it would be easier to
*  extract energy from a large black hole than a big one but even a black hole the
*  mass of the Sun is small by these conditions so you would have to
*  introduce into the solar system an entirely new solar sized object to even
*  start talking about this I don't recommend that as a way to go
*  Robert Gustafson says is the ability to learn a new behavior something genetic
*  or something environmental given the answer to that question how do we induce
*  people to think critically before they act or speak more often I'm not exactly
*  sure what you mean I'm not exactly sure how to distinguish the genetic and
*  environmental features of the ability to learn a new behavior I mean many things
*  have abilities to learn new behaviors right people cats computers you know
*  simple machines have the in some sense ability to learn new behaviors computers
*  don't even have genetics right but they can still learn new behaviors so if the
*  second part of your question is the more important one how can we induce people
*  to think critically you know people are complicated mixtures of reason and
*  irrationality and I think that you know it's it's it's sort of a little bit
*  starting off on the wrong foot to say like all those people are not thinking
*  critically but I am right none of us thinks critically all the time none of
*  us is irrational all the time what we should do is try to overall increase the
*  amount of rationality in the world and we can do that by understanding what it
*  means to be rational ourselves by being examples of good reason by helping
*  people out to want to learn more critically to think better and more
*  rationally Spencer Hargis says let's say you commit the perfect crime a crime
*  pulled off so unbelievably smoothly that the world where you committed the crime
*  looks exactly like the one where you didn't in every way down to subatomic
*  precision with any sort of interference happen between the world where you were
*  guilty and the one where you were innocent so I'm Spencer I'm going to
*  unask this question because I just don't think it is a sensible scenario that
*  you've outlined here if you really are imagining that I measure some quantum
*  system like an electron see there's been up or spin down and if it's spin up I
*  commit a crime if it's been down I don't and I commit the crime in such a way
*  that I'm affecting the world around me minimally so that I try not to branch
*  the wave function of the universe I think that's literally inconceivable
*  because just by existing I'm radiating right just by breathing and living I'm
*  giving off infrared radiation and if I give it off in a different location in
*  two different branches of the universe that's instantly more than enough to
*  disturb the universe enormously and to branch the wave function very very
*  obviously so the thought experiment in which I as a macroscopic person do two
*  separate things in two different parts of the wave function and yet those
*  wave those parts of the wave function do not branch and stop interfering is not
*  one that makes a lot of sense to me Sam Hartzog says I recently came across an
*  article in physics world that equated climate change policy to making a
*  Pascal's wager second Pascal's wager question this AMA awesome I've been a
*  naturalist for years now and I wasn't persuaded by Pascal's wager
*  unfortunately I didn't find the popular refutations wholly convincing either if
*  we further remove the association with Christianity the wager seems to reduce
*  to an incredibly tiny possibility of upside versus no risk whatsoever in that
*  case the rational choice seems to be the tiny potential for upside no matter how
*  remote so as I said to the earlier question number one there's never no
*  risk whatsoever by the lights of the thought experiment you're saying yes yes
*  yes I know that something is very unlikely but imagine that it has a tiny
*  possibility of being true so if you say that for one thing like the existence of
*  God or the existence of objective morality you should also say it for
*  other things like the existence of the devil or the fact that if we discovered
*  objective morality maybe everybody would die you know maybe there's some terrible
*  terrible thing that would happen by doing that so that's the problem with
*  all of these wagers is you can't just say there's no risk to believing this
*  because there always is either there either the thing you're believing has
*  literally no impact on how you behave in any way or there is a risk to believing
*  it so I'm in favor of ignoring these Pascal wagers kinds of arguments Anthony
*  Tonkin says coronavirus is having a massive impact on the world but what are
*  some things you identify as being positive things we learn from it when we
*  get to look back on it years from now I think besides pandemic preparatory
*  preparedness vaccine technology there will be at least some sense of data for
*  what a universal income would start to look like and also by the way maybe
*  coincidentally Jan Lussek right afterwards says do you think there is
*  any upside to the current COVID-19 crisis will society change for the
*  better in any way as a result of the situation in your opinion you know I
*  want to say two things which seems to be a pattern in my answers here today sure
*  there will be some upsides to this you know we'll learn something by studying
*  it we will be jolted out of our complacency about this particular kind of
*  unlikely but but frighteningly plausible disaster scenario so yeah
*  pandemic preparedness for instance will probably be greater ten years from now
*  than it was ten years ago but you know on the other hand the other part of the
*  answer is I'm not that interested in looking at the upsides right now you
*  know we have to get through it I think that you can look at the upsides but
*  there's a danger that you it's very hard to balance them correctly right I mean
*  obviously the downsides are hugely enormous so the temptation to say yes
*  but there's also an upside it's just really really hard to say that in a
*  reasonable way that doesn't downplay the fact that this is mostly downside that
*  we're facing now so you know I don't want to say that you shouldn't think
*  about it or whatever you should always think about anything you want to think
*  about I'm in favor of that but I personally am not going to spend much
*  time wondering about the upsides I'm sure they will be there we will learn
*  things but the downsides are so big that that's where my attention is going to be
*  focused Abdul Afzal says one criticism that is often and now I'm coughing trust
*  me I'm coughing because I've been doing an AMA for hours not because I'm in any
*  way ill Abdul Afzal says one criticism that is often cited against many worlds
*  is a commitment to assigning ontological status to the quantum state and hence
*  Hilbert space assuming you take this to be a bug do you think introduction of
*  primitive ontology to many worlds solves this problem or the critics missing
*  something so I don't take it to be a bug sorry about that I think that even
*  within the world of people who take many worlds seriously I am much more
*  fundamentalist about the ontology of many worlds so for those of you don't
*  know what we're talking about ontology is the study of being what is the
*  fundamental stuff that you have in your theory many worlds is the simplest
*  answer to that question it's just a wave function and nothing else the quantum
*  state that's the ontology other theories like hidden variables have other
*  variables other parts of reality in addition to the wave function and what
*  is a wave function so there's different versions of the answer of ways you can
*  answer that question some people think of a wave function as a function of a
*  set of other variables so even though the only physics is in the wave
*  function it's a wave function of something like the positions of a bunch
*  of particles or the value of a bunch of fields or something like that I don't
*  even think that I think the wave functions as a vector in Hilbert space
*  full stop this is what Ashmeet Singh and I wrote a paper on which we called mad
*  dog Everettianism this is named after mad dog naturalism which is the theory
*  of Alex Rosenberg who was another previous mindscape guest so mad dog
*  Everettianism takes the absolutely minimal version of ontology just a
*  vector in a really big big big Hilbert space and tries to show how the
*  evolution of that vector through time can give rise to the emergent world
*  around us so I don't think it's a bug I think it's a wonderful feature plenty
*  work to be done though in connecting it to reality Jeremy Labreck says if
*  measuring a quantum vent with a binary outcome leads to a splitting of the wave
*  function does measuring something with the distribution such as the location of
*  electron lead to a spreading of the wave function as in it spreads into a
*  distribution of worlds where the electron was observed in different
*  places yeah basically that is correct if you have variables with continuous
*  possible observational outcomes like the position of an electron in
*  non-relativistic quantum mechanics then it's impossible to say there are a
*  certain fixed number of worlds at any one moment of time what there is are
*  there are different worlds but they're smoothly distributed so it's absolutely
*  sensible to say that the electron is measured here in one world and there in
*  another world but it does not make sense in this context to say well how many
*  worlds are there in between it's just a fuzzy kind of delineation once again the
*  math is perfectly sensible but the language the verb the verbiage that we
*  have in English to talk about this is not quite up to the task but yes there
*  be a smooth distribution of worlds in this picture Greg Wright says do you
*  think of emergence as something that happens in the world when matter and
*  energy reaches certain complexity to bring about additional levels of
*  organization or is emergence something that happens in human brains as they
*  reorganize more and more complex phenomena into describable concepts that
*  can be manipulated independently so I don't think quite either one emergence
*  doesn't necessarily have anything to do with complexity right thermodynamics the
*  study of temperature and heat and pressure and fluid mechanics right this
*  is a standard example of emergence and there's no complexity involved whatsoever
*  things could be completely in thermal equilibrium and still have this emergent
*  description of themselves but it's also just not in the human brain emergence
*  the very very specific thing that happens when you're able to predict the
*  behavior of a physical system on the basis of way less information than
*  actually in here's in that system that happens sometimes in physical reality
*  but usually not okay usually if you want to predict what a system with a lot of
*  particles is going to do you need to know what all the particles are going to
*  do to find situations where you only need to know certain very specific
*  pieces of information in order to make reliable predictions is it's incredibly
*  precious and rare and that's when emergence happens but it's also
*  objectively real when it happens it usually doesn't happen but when it does
*  we can tell we can do experiments to see it at work
*  Masimiliano Sravagara says my question is which is currently your favorite
*  theory to explain consciousness and why you know I'd say I don't really have a
*  favorite theory to explain consciousness as I explain in the big picture I think
*  that you know the goal of that book even though I talk about consciousness a lot
*  the goal is not to explain consciousness my goal in that book it's a very good
*  goal to try to explain consciousness but that's not what I was trying to do
*  what I was trying to do was simply to say there is essentially no reason to
*  doubt that whatever the explanation is it will be on the basis of naturalism
*  you do not need to bring anything in that is supernatural or even non-physical
*  to explain consciousness the actual way that it works I don't know right I mean
*  there's there's that's like saying what is my favorite theory of dark matter
*  there's lots of different theories of dark matter whichever one is true or
*  even if one that we haven't thought of yet is true that's fine with me but I'm
*  sure the dark matter is some kind of matter that has the basic features we
*  think it has likewise with consciousness Christoph Piranski says if dark energy
*  is a property of space itself and causes it to expand then it seems that energy
*  is increasing with expanding space i.e. is not conserved I am sure there is a
*  mistake in this argument do not be so sure Christoph there is no mistake in
*  that argument there's if you go on to Google and type in energy is not
*  conserved the first or one of the first things that will come up is a blog post
*  that I wrote several years ago about this very fact that when you have general
*  relativity when you have a dynamical changing space-time our usual notion of
*  energy is just not conserved now you can mess with our usual notion of energy
*  you can try to change the definition of it to get something that is conserved
*  but I think it's just easier to say that the feature that we used to have with
*  space and time being absolute and unchanging was what gave rise to
*  conservation of energy once space-time is changing there's no reason to think
*  that energy is conserved it still obeys a law there's still a rule that says
*  exactly what happens to the energy as space expands so it's not like all
*  craziness is broken loose it's just that the law is a little bit of a
*  generalization of the flat space example Paul Torek says if you're
*  familiar with Mark Stuckey Michael Silberstein and Timothy McDevitt's
*  relational block world interpretation of quantum mechanics can you give us a
*  quick opinion on it no I'm not and no I can't sorry about that I've never heard
*  of that one there's a lot of theories out there that I'm not familiar with
*  Ronald Gorin says with all you do how do you find time to read and retain at
*  least a working knowledge of all the authors books you read oh I don't I'm
*  very bad at that like it's almost a joke within this household here with Jennifer
*  and myself where when it comes to fiction like reading novels or watching
*  movies and stuff like that if I only read a book once or what see a movie
*  once a couple years later I will have no idea what happened the plot of movies
*  and novels just disappears in my brain very very quickly and there's a similar
*  thing that happens with nonfiction books also I mean I retain some knowledge of
*  things by sort of going over them multiple times you know I look I've read
*  looked back at the transcripts of podcasts I did a year ago and go huh
*  that's really interesting that we're talking about there when I mean it's the
*  podcasts are worse actually to be honest because when I am recording them I'm
*  thinking you know ferociously about like where to go next in the conversation
*  did we cover this particular thing am I running out of time is that I hit the
*  record button all these things what is the sound quality like and so it's sort
*  of remarkable how little I am able to retain afterwards so looking over the
*  transcripts is useful given as I said before that I don't like actually
*  listening to my own voice Dan O'Neill says I know that much of modern physics
*  is inaccessible to those of us without the requisite mathematical knowledge but
*  do you ever find that you get too caught up in the math not just in calculating
*  problem-solving but even in your more creative theoretical mathematical work
*  to the point where you lose touch with the wonder and strangeness of the
*  reality the math represents I'm not exactly sure that I understand what
*  you're asking but I think if I get it my answer is yes and no I mean I think I
*  think I appreciate where you're coming from it's it's definitely true that when
*  you're tackling physics problems and then you're motivated by some physics
*  question and you bring some mathematics to bear on that physics question there
*  is an intrinsic beauty and seductiveness in good math right and so sometimes
*  doing that math and trying to understand the physics problem leads you to ask
*  another mathematical question that is a little bit removed from the physical
*  motivation that you started with and you can keep going in that direction to the
*  point where you're basically just doing math and that's not necessarily bad
*  doing math is a good thing but it's different from doing science from doing
*  physics my preference is absolutely physics so if anything I'm the opposite
*  like if anything I've written maybe a couple of papers on topology and things
*  like that which were more math than physics but I tend to err on the other
*  side that I get impatient with really complicated math because my preference
*  is to absolutely find the nugget of simple beautiful physics underneath all
*  of it and the math tends to get in the way for me more often than I get lost in
*  the beauty of it. Gregorz Anielak says as far as I can tell the entropy
*  definition has to do with the distinction of microscopic and
*  macroscopic states isn't it subjective to the observer what counts as
*  macroscopic why doesn't it cause similar controversy as using the
*  observer in other laws of physics like quantum mechanics well it's a little bit
*  different entropy I mean you're right there is an there's a subjective element
*  that comes in when you define entropy but it turns out if you sort of go
*  beyond that and look into what actually goes on it's not that bad okay it's like
*  there's a subjective element to taste some people like some food and some
*  people like other food yet again it's not like all hell is broken loose you
*  can go to a restaurant and everyone recognizes that some restaurants are
*  good and some restaurants are less good okay there is still an enormous amount
*  of overlap and consensus when it comes to what tastes good even though it is
*  fundamentally subjective that is not exactly a perfect analogy but a pretty
*  good analogy for entropy yes it's subjective but when you look at
*  something when you look at a cup of coffee with cream mixing into it you
*  see where the cream is and you see where the coffee is you don't see the
*  positions and the velocities of all the different molecules and that's true for
*  everybody we all see more or less the same picture of cream mixing into coffee
*  so we use what we can see when we define entropy we say the entropy is the
*  logarithm of the number of microscopic states that look the same to us
*  macroscopically but that's okay that's good enough to get a quantity which we
*  can use in physics equations and agree on from person to person John Farr says
*  if you ran the planet and all its resources what would your top three or
*  more priorities be so when I first read this question I instantly said oh I don't
*  have any such list of priorities but I thought about it for five seconds and I
*  realized I kind of do have a list of priorities you know priority one would
*  be climate change that's pretty obvious by the way my list of priorities is not
*  very clever it's not very innovative I'm not trying to be contrarian I think
*  that they're the pretty obvious priorities climate change would be one I
*  would want to fix the second one would be democracy I want to make I would want
*  to make sure if I ran the planet that we had a functioning democracy which maybe
*  is incompatible with me running the planet but maybe I have a some sort of
*  benevolent dictatorship where I where I use my powers to run the planet just to
*  make sure everyone is really being a well-functioned democracy and then I
*  think I originally thought that my third one would be really clamping down on
*  nuclear proliferation to lower the risks of a nuclear explosion because that would
*  be tremendously terrible but after a little bit of contemplation I think that
*  poverty and disease elimination would be what I would want to do so there and I
*  say poverty and disease they're two different things obviously but they're
*  closely related if we could get people in lesser well-off portions of the world
*  to have some money to have a basic income whether it's the traditional
*  policy of universal basic income or just my magical powers of as runner of the
*  planet but get people to have the ability to buy things to lift themselves out of
*  poverty the world would be a much better place and disease would go down you could
*  use some of that money to help build infrastructure right to help build
*  hospitals and schools and stuff like that that's what I would want to do
*  cletus black says if general intelligence does not require an organic connection is
*  it fair to say that a system of a dog plus a human working together and viewed
*  as one collective system is more generally intelligent in many survival
*  situations than either the dog or human alone is I mean there's probably a sense
*  in which that's true but my suspicion without having thought about it very
*  deeply is that it's not a very profound sense I think that you know when you
*  talk about the word intelligence okay which is what you're doing you have to
*  talk about the intelligence of what right it wouldn't make much sense to
*  talk about the intelligence of you know just our cerebellum or you know just our
*  pineal gland or other parts of the brain the thing that has an intelligence in
*  some way is the whole person and I don't think that it makes sense to say a human
*  plus a dog is a system that has intelligence you can try to do it but
*  you're obviously doing violence to the concept that you started with I think
*  it just makes more sense to talk about the composite system the team of the
*  human and the dog the human has some intelligence for some things the dog has
*  some intelligence for some things there are certain tasks that they can do
*  better than either one of them individually but I wouldn't ascribe to
*  them intelligence in the same way I would to a person Robert Murley says
*  what happens exactly when the universe splits is there then two universes each
*  with all the space and mass of the original since mass is equivalent to
*  energy where does all the new energy come from I'm gonna have to like write
*  some blog post or something about this because this is I'm not I'm not trying
*  to give you a hard time Robert but this is an extraordinarily frequently asked
*  question the answer is there's two different ideas of energy okay there's
*  the idea of energy that you have as seen from the point of view of an observer
*  inside the universe and there's a energy that you have as seen from God's eye
*  view looking at the wave function describing all the universes at once
*  from within the universe the fact that the universe branches and there's now
*  another universe is completely irrelevant to you essentially the energy
*  you have before after branching is the same it's not exactly the same because
*  as I already mentioned earlier there can be a slight deviation when you measure a
*  quantum system the energy can change but still it's basically the same but
*  there's another definition of energy which is the total energy of all the
*  universes at once that energy is modified is modulated by the amplitude
*  by the thickness by the size of the universe that is contributing to the
*  wave function overall and so even though there are now two universes each with an
*  equal amount of energy where they're used to be just one each of those
*  universes only contributes a fraction to the unit to the energy of the whole
*  shebang and the fraction adds up to one so the energy of the whole shebang did
*  not change and again this is an example where the math is crystal super duper
*  clear there's zero no controversy within the physics community about energy
*  conservation in many worlds we all know what it is it's just really really hard
*  to explain in English because the words just don't match Martin Ziegler
*  Ziegler says you've mentioned that you enjoy playing poker do you actually try
*  to calculate in real time while playing updates to the conditional probabilities
*  of winning so yes absolutely now maybe what you mean is do I actually use Bayes
*  theorem to do that which would be hard okay Bayes theorem is the correct
*  formalization of how you update your credences based on new information
*  coming in but actually multiplying things out correctly and normalizing
*  correctly would be a mess but what you absolutely do is to say well someone
*  hasn't done anything in the hand yet I give an equal probability to them having
*  any two cards other than the two that I have and they do something right they
*  make a bet or they call or they check or they fold or whatever that information
*  changes quite dramatically the credence that I have on them having a certain
*  kind of hand if someone in early position who has been very very tight
*  that is to say not getting involved in a lot of pots someone early position
*  suddenly raises an otherwise unraised pot my credence is very high that they
*  have a very very good hand a high pair or ace-king or something like that that's
*  what every poker player does and if you want more details I did a whole podcast
*  interview with Lev Bury who is a professional poker player and we
*  talked about exactly this we go into detail about that Leonard Levy says you
*  presume the decision-making is not a quantum event therefore does not split
*  the universe what about a decision which leads to an action I feel an impulse to
*  scratch the tip of my nose I can decide to act on that impulse or to inhibit it
*  whichever decision I make will lead to decoherence as my index finger interacts
*  with different photons as it scratches my nose then when it rests on the arm rest
*  of a chair doesn't that split the universe in the many worlds interpretation
*  of quantum mechanics so no it does not because the decision that you made was
*  entirely classical you made the same decision in every branch of the wave
*  function of the universe the only way for you to branch the wave function of
*  the universe is to measure a quantum system that is in some kind of super
*  position and had that quantum system become entangled with the world around
*  it so if you made your decision by consulting a quantum random number
*  generator then there would be different branches in which you did different
*  things but the thing that brought those different branches into existence was
*  the quantum random number generator not the decision that you made Gregory
*  Kuznick proposes a general relativity paradox a meter stick is flying past me
*  and very close to the speed of light in its own reference frame is still a meter
*  long but I see a Lorentz contracted to within its own short shield radius what
*  in my frame keeps it from collapsing into a black hole well it's probably the
*  answer is what you're gonna guess it is namely that there's no rule in general
*  relativity that says that when something is inside its own short shield radius in
*  somebody's frame it collapses into a black hole because after all you're
*  within your short shield radius in the frame of high energy particle moving
*  past you close to the speed of light and you don't collapse into a black hole and
*  the reason is who cares what someone else in some other frame observes what
*  matters to you is whether you are in your short shield radius in your own
*  rest frame that is the criterion that you use for whether or not you collapse
*  into a black hole otherwise relativity just wouldn't be sensible who would
*  have different predictions for different people that's exactly the opposite for
*  physical phenomena that's exactly the opposite of what relativity is supposed
*  to be about Gareth Butler asks what is an operator as used in equations
*  basically an operator is just something that takes a function and turns into
*  another function so you have the operator multiply by two okay that's a
*  very simple operator you have some function of X you multiply it by two you
*  get a new function of X many operators are more complicated than that like the
*  derivative of a function is an operator or you can take two derivatives or you
*  can take a derivative and multiply by two and add the results together all
*  sorts of different possible things this is a very useful concept in quantum
*  mechanics because the function we're dealing with is the wave function and
*  we're continually operating on it to turn into some other function it's also
*  true that you don't need necessarily to go all the way to a function if you just
*  have a vector you can operate on the vector by rotating it by extending it in
*  some direction and so forth that's really all it means of course it becomes
*  complicated when you think about different kinds of operators unitary
*  operators Hermitian operators that's when you get into the math of linear algebra
*  and so on Clive Thompson says given Earth's particular location in the Milky
*  Way we see particular patterns in the stars from our specific vantage point
*  Orion's belt Southern Cross etc how good is our current mapping of the Milky Way
*  in all three-dimensional glory so that's a great question because it has recently
*  become much much better with work from the Gaia satellite so it's very
*  difficult in astronomy to realize to figure out the distances to stars and to
*  galaxies and so forth seeing where they are in angle on the sky their position
*  on the sky is easy even measuring their redshift is easy but measuring their
*  actual physical distance is very very hard so for stars in the Milky Way what
*  you ideally want is a satellite around the earth that can look at the stars
*  from slightly different positions as the earth goes around the Sun or as the
*  satellite goes around the Sun and then see the tiny tiny motions in the
*  apparent positions of those stars due to parallax due to just looking at them
*  from different angles so there was a satellite called Hipparchus that did
*  this a couple decades ago but not to very high precision there's been a more
*  recent satellite called the Gaia satellite that has done this to amazing
*  precision I don't know exactly the details but we're talking about
*  literally billions of stars that we have now figured out more or less their 3d
*  positions so the nearby galaxies certainly we know quite well what what
*  the positions of all the stars look like Brian Miller says if gravity is due
*  to the warping of space-time why do we talk about gravitons as the force
*  carrying particles for gravity so this is just an example of two very different
*  languages that mean the same thing okay gravitons come into the picture when you
*  talk about quantum gravity but their ultimate effect is exactly the same as
*  the classical description of a warped space-time causing the gravitational
*  It's exactly the same as electromagnetism where we have electric fields and magnetic fields but then if you dig down into the quantum level it's
*  convenient to talk about photons but we're still talking about exactly the same thing a classical
*  electromagnetic field is just a bunch of photons piled on top of each other and
*  exactly the same thing is true for gravity warped space-time is just a bunch
*  of gravitons piled on top of each other now when you're talking about a black
*  hole or the expanding universe some very large-scale very dramatic gravitational
*  effect this language of piling gravitons on top of each other isn't very useful
*  so nobody uses it but it could be there if you really wanted to bend over
*  backwards for some reason Zachary Stopa says some theorists such as Brian Green
*  and others have postulated that every possible reality will be realized
*  somewhere some when I believe I heard you say that infinity does not necessarily
*  guarantee a manifestation of every possible reality to get more
*  plain-spoken even an infinite construct there's no guarantee somewhere some when
*  that I was the MVP of the National Hockey League last year or is there so
*  let me clarify a few things here it's absolutely true that there's no reason
*  to think that just because there are an infinite number of universes in whatever
*  sense of universe you mean either the many worlds of quantum mechanics or
*  different pocket universes in cosmology even if there's an infinite number of
*  them doesn't mean everyone exists the one example I always like to use is
*  electrical charge is conserved so there's no universe in which neutrons
*  turn into protons without any other particles being emitted okay but many
*  weird things can happen in the quantum mechanical universe you can put a coffee
*  cup on a table and it can tunnel right through and fall to the bottom that's
*  very very very unlikely but it's a tiny little part of the wave function the
*  universe so there is a world in which it happens so I don't know exactly
*  whether or not you being the MVP of the National Hockey League would violate any
*  important laws of physics so I don't know whether it's a possible thing that
*  actually comes true in the wave function of the universe but let me
*  emphasize the other things I wanted to say which is that it's not you who would
*  be the MVP of the National Hockey League because you're not in that universe
*  okay different copies of your previous self that are now in different universes
*  are different people so there's you can't even say things like oh yes in a
*  different universe I am doing this in a different universe there's no you you
*  live in this universe Brian Larson says as I understand it the term superposition
*  essentially means a linear combination of states is this correct or is there
*  more to it what I what am I missing that makes it inappropriate to talk about a
*  northwest velocity as a superposition of a west and north velocity nope you're
*  not missing anything that is basically what it means the important fact here
*  is that quantum states are vectors the wave function is a vector in Hilbert
*  space you can add them together you can take linear combinations and that's
*  exactly what a superposition is the reason why we use different language to
*  talk about superpositions in quantum theory than in other contexts like the
*  direction you're walking in is because when you observe quantum things you only
*  see certain outcomes you only see the electron either spin up or spin down you
*  don't see it in a superposition of both so if you just saw the wave function
*  every time you observed it everyone would know that the universe was
*  described by a vector and that's how we should talk about it and you wouldn't
*  emphasize this idea that it's a superposition of certain definite
*  measurement outcomes but because we only do see certain measurement outcomes the
*  way that we think about the vector is its relationship to the measurement
*  outcomes namely that it is a superposition of different possible
*  measurement outcomes that's why we use that language so often in quantum theory
*  Anders Hedlund says I'm interested in the decay of radioactive materials and
*  why we say it's impossible to know when in time a particular atom decays exactly
*  what part of quantum mechanics makes it impossible to predict when it happens
*  this is one of those questions that depends on your favorite approach to the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics because different people are going to give you
*  different answers if you believe in an objective collapse model like the GRW
*  models or Penrose's model which we've already mentioned in this podcast then
*  the laws of physics have an intrinsically unpredictable feature to
*  them it just says you know something's going to happen with a certain
*  probability and you can't say exactly when that's it full stop if you believe
*  in a hidden variables theory then there is a definite position to all the hidden
*  variables but you don't know what they are and so you have some ignorance and
*  that's why the best you can do is to talk probabilistically about what the
*  measurement outcomes are going to be if you believe in many worlds all the
*  outcomes are going to be possible but once the universe branches into the
*  possible outcomes it can branch into there will be many copies of you and
*  none of those copies of you will know which branch they're on so there is once
*  again probability there I actually wrote a little essay that I think appeared in
*  quanta magazine online that you can search for about how different
*  approaches to the theory of probability intersect with different approaches to
*  quantum mechanics if you want to look that up
*  Alexandre Zani says we often have to make decisions based on information in
*  fields about which we know little for example when we look at someone's health
*  or economic policy before voting for them what is your approach to evaluating
*  information in fields where you have no expertise and where there isn't a very
*  obvious expert consensus so this is a great question actually I've been
*  thinking about it you know very offhandedly and casually I don't have a
*  full-blown theory of it but the general question is you know the role of
*  expertise and external opinions in regimes where there's not a consensus
*  among the experts and and where you yourself are not an expert I don't have
*  any you know brilliant once and for all plan here but I have sort of the usual
*  advice that any sensible person would say which is you know look at the
*  experts so there will be experts that disagree about things so not just health
*  policy but the foundations of quantum mechanics is another example where
*  experts absolutely disagree as a non-expert I think in in those cases it
*  is wise not to have too definite a belief about anything right if the
*  people who are experts don't have a definite set of beliefs considered as a
*  collective then why in the world should the rest of us have definite beliefs but
*  also you can sometimes even if you're not an expert yourself get a feeling for
*  what experts seem more trustworthy if you know what I mean you can just listen
*  to how they explain themselves right are they dogmatic do they seem to be
*  talking in certain ways because there's other forces or incentives that are
*  nudging them in the direction of doing that or are they truly seeking the
*  answers in open-minded good-faith way do they give answers that are convincing
*  and compelling even to those of us who are not experts etc so I think that even
*  if you're not an expert yourself it's possible to develop an ability to judge
*  the trustworthiness of different kinds of experts outside your own knowledge
*  base and that's a very important helpful thing but again still even then I would
*  not become dogmatic about anything where I was not an expert myself if the
*  complete set of experts themselves disagreed Gerard Droyven says I'm curious
*  what is changing physically in the system when it arrives in a situation
*  with less gravity if this can only be explained by explaining how time works
*  well you've already given me an answer so I mean I think that it's safe to say
*  that nothing changes physically in a system when it arrives in a situation
*  with less gravity it's very hard in general relativity to even define what
*  you mean by a situation with less gravity remember general relativity is a very
*  local theory it explains what happens at different points in space and space time
*  and then it explains the relationship between them if you literally travel
*  from one point in space time to another but what it doesn't want you to do not
*  doesn't absolutely prohibit it but general relativity gently suggests that
*  you not simultaneously compare what is happening at two distantly separated
*  locations in space time because there's no unique way to do that when you go
*  through the math you find that there's no way to actually sort of figure out
*  both how fast a clock is ticking at one location in space and also how fast a
*  clock is ticking at another location in space simultaneously there is no
*  notion of simultaneity like that in general relativity so if you just look
*  locally at what clocks do all clocks move at one second per second no matter
*  what they do okay so locally there's no difference between what happens to
*  systems in different amounts of gravity globally there's a difference that is to
*  say if you have two clocks that start at the same location in space time and they
*  travel on different trajectories and then they come back because they have
*  different speeds or they travel through different gravitational fields they will
*  experience a totally different an amount of time interval that is different
*  overall but it's not a local difference it's that global difference just like
*  walking along a different path takes you a different amount of distance if you go
*  a straight line versus a curved line Neil glue says general relativity is
*  based on a manifold and other stuff but there are many kinds of manifolds
*  topological once differentiable twice differentiable smooth analytic etc
*  and there are manifolds with and without boundaries do physicists have a strong
*  feeling about what kind of manifold describes the world we live in so this
*  might not make any any sense that this question to people who don't know a
*  little bit of math but indeed there are you know the idea of a manifold is
*  basic to general relativity and there's different different levels of manifold
*  if you want in the math literature so what you need for general relativity is
*  a manifold that is twice differentiable you can take derivatives of the
*  functions on the manifold at least twice so you need to be able to differentiate
*  the metric at least twice to be able to define the curvature tensor for example
*  you might want more than that you it's very often that people just for
*  convenience assume that their manifolds are as smooth as they need to be this is
*  a very typical physicist move okay mathematicians are like tell me how
*  smooth your manifold is physicists are like don't worry it's smooth enough I'm
*  not gonna worry about that and there's a good reason they don't worry about that
*  because probably the universe is not a manifold okay general relativity is a
*  classical theory arguing too much in depth and in detail about the niceties
*  of the mathematical formalism of general relativity takes you away from physics
*  because we know that ultimately the world is going to be quantum gravity not
*  classical general relativity and in quantum gravity the world isn't a smooth
*  manifold at all it's a wave function so I think that the physicist's attitude of
*  saying that their manifolds are as smooth as they need to be is probably
*  the right one given that we don't understand ultimately how gravity works
*  in the real world okay the final question is from Lothian 53 in relativity
*  we talk about not being able to test whether or not we are moving as long as
*  the motion is constant meaning that the speed of light is the same measurements
*  of magnetic or electric fields are the same etc now that we have dark energies
*  the acceleration of the expansion of the universe also the same strength and
*  symmetry regardless of the direction or the speed we move so I think that the
*  answer is no here but we have to be a little bit careful because when we do
*  cosmology we generally do talk about a certain preferred reference frame
*  namely the rest frame of the matter and the cosmic microwave background photons
*  in the universe so the theory of relativity says it doesn't matter what
*  the laws of physics are all the same etc but that is a statement about the
*  fundamental laws of physics it's not a statement about the particular situation
*  in which you find yourself if you walk into a wall there's a big difference to
*  you whether you walk into it quickly or slowly right that's because the wall is
*  effectively defining a preferred rest frame with respect to which you can
*  compare how fast you're moving likewise in cosmology we have a universe that is
*  scattered with galaxies and dark matter and photons and together they provide a
*  rest frame with respect to which we can talk about things like the expansion
*  rate of the universe so it doesn't really quite make mathematical sense to
*  say well is the universe expanding at a different rate in a different rest frame
*  you know regardless of the direction which we move the expansion of the
*  universe is a global phenomenon that we use to describe the universe as a whole
*  and that universe has a rest frame that suggests how we should make that
*  description so there's really no danger of people getting different answers to
*  the question how fast is the universe expanding and so forth okay that's the
*  end of the questions as they are currently asked I know that you know
*  sometimes there's a time-lapse I'm not gonna get a chance to quite edit this
*  and and post it tonight so it'll probably appear tomorrow and maybe people
*  ask more questions and I will not have answered them sorry about that but
*  there's always next month tune in next month for more ask me anything questions
*  I will once again be releasing to this this to the public a week after we
*  release it here to patreon supporters and remember that I've also started a new
*  video series the biggest ideas in the universe you can find on YouTube on my
*  YouTube channel or on my web page and thanks everyone for their patreon support
*  thanks for sticking with the mindscape podcast I hope that it provides a little
*  bit of distraction from the mess all around us because the universe keeps
*  going it's important for us to keep thinking about it take care see you next
*  month
*  you
