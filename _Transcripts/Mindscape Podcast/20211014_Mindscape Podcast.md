Welcome to the October 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape AMA, Sean Carroll | October 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [October 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEfdjROvasI)
*  Hello everybody, welcome to the October 2021 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape Podcast.
*  I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  And greetings from sunny Boston, Massachusetts, where I remain for my visit here to the Harvard
*  Philosophy Department.
*  It is sunny actually at this exact moment, but as cliche as it is, what I have to comment
*  on is the weather here in the Northeastern United States.
*  Because you know, I live in Los Angeles and have for the past 15 years or so where it's
*  sunny and dry almost all the time and the right temperature.
*  And actually I've been blessed with the right temperature pretty much here in the Northeast,
*  but boy is it humid.
*  And I say this as someone who lived in Boston for eight years and before that in Pennsylvania
*  for many years, but I kind of forget that 75 degrees in the Northeast is just not the
*  same weather as 75 degrees in Los Angeles.
*  That's about it for my deep insights here because I've mostly for the past month been
*  just concentrate concentrating on getting books written and other things that I've had
*  to do, you know, revising papers and writing letters of recommendation.
*  It's that part of the year doing a tiny little bit of traveling and not too much.
*  So yeah, no real big news other than that.
*  So with that spirit in mind, let's go.
*  James Facoreto says, great podcast on paleogenetics.
*  Toward the end of the discussion, the idea of kickstarting life processes on other planets
*  came up.
*  Do you think we are or ever will be wise enough to evaluate and take that step?
*  We do not have a good track record on such past intrusions despite whatever good intentions
*  may have been in play.
*  Well, you're absolutely right.
*  We do not have a good track record.
*  We I mean the human race generally.
*  And the question of the question that came up for those of you who didn't listen to the
*  podcast, this is with Betul Getsar.
*  We talked about the idea not of starting life on other planets, but basically of if there
*  were other planets we're imagining very far in the future where we're visiting planets
*  from other star systems, for example, you could imagine the same question for the solar
*  system.
*  What if there's no life wherever we are visiting and looking?
*  We decide that, you know, not Mars, let's say, but some moon of Neptune has no life
*  on it, but it could have life for whatever reasons.
*  You know, we can imagine forms of life that might live there.
*  Would we be tempted to put the raw materials to start life into that environment to let
*  it go its own way?
*  You know, in some sense, that's a minor intervention.
*  You know, we're not, you know, changing a society or anything like that, or even seeding
*  a planet with life or terraforming it, but we're just giving it some raw materials it
*  didn't otherwise have.
*  So let me first say before answering the question, you know, I agree that our intentions are
*  not always as good as they could be.
*  Even when we have good intentions, we don't always do well at following through.
*  But also, you know, my attitude toward many of these questions, by these questions, I
*  mean, should we human beings indulge in this amazing thing that technology will someday
*  allow us to do?
*  My attitude toward these questions is, look, we're going to do it, right?
*  I mean, there's no question about whether we're going to do it or not.
*  Human beings, whatever their track record is for having good or bad intentions, their
*  track record for doing what they're capable of doing is almost 100%.
*  We do it, right?
*  I mean, we drop atomic bombs on cities full of people.
*  That's how human beings roll.
*  We derive some new technological capability.
*  No matter how horrific the consequences, we do it.
*  So whether it comes to designer babies or uploading consciousnesses or seeding other
*  planets with the raw ingredients for life, I think that our expectation should be that
*  we're going to do it.
*  Now, but actually, in this particular case, I don't think it's that bad.
*  I haven't thought through all the details very, very carefully.
*  You might be able to change my mind about this without too much effort.
*  But if there's literally no life on a planet and we're sure of that, whatever it means
*  to be sure of that, I don't see the harm in putting the raw materials of life onto a planet.
*  Indeed, I wouldn't really see the harm in putting life onto the planet.
*  I mean, certainly we're not going to have that many qualms about visiting and setting
*  up human habitation on other planets.
*  I don't think that doesn't mean we should sort of despoil the entire galaxy of the entire
*  universe, whatever there can be limitations on what we do.
*  But if it's literally another planet that doesn't already have life on it, I don't see
*  the harm.
*  I don't see literally who is being harmed by us doing some dramatic intervention to it.
*  I do think we need to be careful about it.
*  It's so far from our experience that it's hard to think through all the consequences
*  very clearly.
*  But nevertheless, I suspect it's going to happen.
*  And I'm kind of OK with that.
*  Peter Bamber says about half of marriages in the USA and in the UK end in divorce.
*  The promise to stay together until death do us part appears to be nonsense in many cases.
*  Should marriage be a time limited contract, perhaps renewable rolling contract?
*  What use is marriage?
*  All right.
*  Someone wants to get their money's worth with the AMA is here.
*  This is a big question, right?
*  And I don't have any simple answers to this one either.
*  That's probably going to be a theme through this AMA.
*  I'm in favor of marriage myself.
*  I am in one, which is extremely successful.
*  That doesn't mean it's for everybody.
*  I'm perfectly cognizant of the fact that for some people, marriage is wrong, even for some
*  people who get married.
*  It's certainly true that people do also get divorced.
*  Now you could imagine just confessing to that, right?
*  Admitting it.
*  In other words, stopping pretending that marriage is forever.
*  This is probably what you're getting at.
*  I would be 100% on board if you said that we could introduce into the institution of
*  marriage different levels, right?
*  Different kinds of commitment.
*  Some people might say, well, we're going to get married for five years.
*  Other people might say we're going to get married until death do us part.
*  Either one is sort of allowed and written into the contract.
*  I can imagine that.
*  I suspect that most people would just want to do it until the death do us part.
*  To me, the more important thing is for the mechanism to end it be a lot easier and simpler
*  and more straightforward than it actually is.
*  The rules are complicated.
*  Divorce tends to create bitterness and financial strife and a whole bunch of things like that.
*  I think that in fact, we have some feeling that divorce is somehow bad and therefore
*  if you're going through it, you should suffer.
*  It should be difficult to go through it.
*  And I'm against that.
*  I think it should be a lot easier than that.
*  And obviously, I think that if only one person wants to get divorced, that should more or
*  less be enough.
*  I don't think that you should be able to force someone to stay married to you.
*  Now, you ask what use is marriage?
*  And I think that's a very good question because there's more than one use that people have
*  in mind, right?
*  I mean, there's the sort of romantic role that marriage plays as a commitment to another
*  person.
*  I think that's a good thing.
*  Again, not for everybody, but for some people, it's the right thing.
*  I'd be very open to also not just imagining more flexibility in the institution of marriage
*  in terms of the time horizon that we attach to it, but also the structure.
*  I'm very happy to imagine group marriages, obviously gay marriage or whatever.
*  I think I'm 100% fine with that.
*  Maybe there could be, you know, if you read The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein,
*  there's all sorts of elaborate marriage structures like line marriages where there's a whole
*  group marriage.
*  And when someone dies, someone else is brought in, right?
*  And a line marriage can last for centuries.
*  You know, who knows?
*  Do you call that a marriage or not?
*  You see, I think those things are much more difficult to make work in practice than in
*  theory.
*  But that's OK.
*  If it works for at least one group, that should be enough as far as I'm concerned.
*  Anyway, I was trying to say that there is a romantic reason for marriage.
*  I'm all in favor of that.
*  There's also a legal reason.
*  And I suspect that a lot of the weirdness about marriage in the modern world is because
*  these are two very different uses, the romantic use and the legal use.
*  And the legal use is not to be taken lightly.
*  Like, in fact, it's a really, really good reason for a lot of people to get married.
*  I have friends who are not married, even though they are absolutely completely bonded and
*  have been for many, many years and will be for many, many years into the future.
*  And I worry about that a little bit because in our modern world, if you're married to
*  somebody, then your spouse has all sorts of rights automatically.
*  Most importantly, when one member of the marriage is ill or dying or died, the legal control
*  over what to do goes to the other person in the marriage.
*  And so that is an incentive to get married.
*  Absolutely, you know, 100 percent.
*  And maybe that should be separated from the romantic role.
*  I'd be open to that possibility.
*  There has to be some equivalent of that.
*  And I think that would be very important.
*  So I'd be open to imagining sort of the institution of marriage being one thing and being
*  entirely romantic and then other sorts of legal obligations and connections on the
*  market that one could pursue.
*  That might be a more enlightened way to do things.
*  But you know, you have to deal with the fact that in the real world, people are not that
*  enlightened and people have strict ideas handed down through generations about what
*  marriage should be. So I don't see any of this actually or much of it anyway happening
*  very soon.
*  Sumas, I don't know how to pronounce your name, sorry.
*  S-E-U-M-A-S, McLennan.
*  Is it supposed to be Seamus?
*  Mistyped? I don't know.
*  Says, as a non-physicist, I think I can get a bit of a handle on the number on a number
*  of concepts and models in physics via analogy, diagrams, simpler equations and such.
*  But the idea of a singularity leaves me stumped.
*  Is singularity just a formulation of our ignorance or can it be imagined as a
*  thing with a knowable nature?
*  You know, I think that the word singularity appears in different contexts, in different
*  physics situations, most famously in general relativity, Einstein's theory of curved
*  spacetime, where a singularity is a place where the curvature of spacetime becomes
*  infinitely big. Roughly speaking, there's different kinds of singularities.
*  There's whole books written classifying different kinds of singularities.
*  But singularities also appear in other contexts such as fluid mechanics or, you know,
*  field theory sometimes.
*  And usually the way that a professional physicist thinks about a singularity is as a
*  place where your theory is breaking down.
*  So I know that we like to talk a lot about what happens at a singularity, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  But you have to understand that when physicists say those words, what they really mean is
*  what is happening in nature at the location or at the time when our theory is predicting a
*  singularity.
*  So the more precise formulation is not what happens at a singularity, but what happens instead
*  of a singularity.
*  So I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about singularities, actually.
*  I've had this discussion with, you know, people who do classical general relativity or
*  philosophy of spacetime or things like that, who sometimes just spend a lot of work
*  thinking about classifying singularities, dealing with them, predicting them, etc.
*  And, you know, my attitude is, but they almost certainly don't happen in nature.
*  So why are you doing that?
*  You're figuring out implications of a theory in the regime where the theory is not accurate.
*  So that's not really what I personally want to spend my time doing.
*  Spoonly Orange says, You say in the Biggest Ideas Q&A number 21 episode where you discuss
*  the emergence of spacetime from Hilbert space that gravity enforces a kind of limit on the
*  dimensionality of Hilbert space.
*  Does this mean gravity has a direct effect on Hilbert space?
*  And would that be considered, would gravity therefore be considered more fundamental?
*  I'm not quite sure where the question is asking.
*  And would be considered more fundamental than spacetime.
*  So I think that the logic is a little bit not exactly how I would put it there.
*  You know, I don't think that it would be right to say gravity has a direct effect on Hilbert
*  space.
*  The right way to say it is gravity as a phenomenon in the form that we know it in the sort of
*  general relativistic form where it shows up as the curvature of spacetime should be thought
*  of as something that arises in Hilbert space theories where Hilbert space itself is finite
*  dimensional.
*  So the Hilbert space is always more fundamental than spacetime or anything like that, at least
*  in my way of thinking about it, which is, you know, it's my AMA.
*  So I'm going to go with that right now.
*  Hilbert space is where you start.
*  So you don't say gravity has an effect on Hilbert space.
*  You say the following kinds of Hilbert spaces can support theories of gravity.
*  Other kinds of Hilbert spaces do not.
*  And I think that infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces typically will not have gravity or
*  at least it will have gravity in a form where local regions of spacetime still look like
*  they're only part of the whole Hilbert space.
*  They're described by a finite dimensional piece of Hilbert space.
*  So for example, the anti-de Sitter space conformal field theory correspondence, the
*  holographic duality that strength theories like to talk about has the following feature,
*  the boundary theory, which is a conformal field theory, no gravity.
*  It has an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.
*  No question about that.
*  And it also is supposed to correspond to a quantum gravity theory in anti-de Sitter space.
*  An anti-de Sitter space is infinite in spatial extent.
*  So if you think that a read, so that's compatible, in other words, in the following way in the
*  anti-de Sitter space where there is gravity, you can say that every region of space is
*  described by a finite dimensional piece of Hilbert space, but there are an infinite number
*  of pieces.
*  That's how you're allowed to correspond to the infinite dimensional Hilbert space that
*  is on the boundary.
*  So the gravity theory as a whole has an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, but the individual
*  spatial regions are only a finite dimensional piece of them.
*  Riverside says, you interview scientists coming from around the world to do amazing work at
*  American universities.
*  Yet at the same time, the United States seems to have become a rather anti-scientific country
*  over the last years.
*  Some may say that the American brand of radical free market capitalism is driving both trends,
*  the fast paced scientific innovation and the deep economic divides in society that
*  make people prone to populism and mistrust towards science, rationality and democratic
*  procedures.
*  Would you see it this way and is improvement possible?
*  I think there are ingredients that you have identified that play parts, that play a role
*  in this syndrome, but I do think it's very, very complicated and I wouldn't want to buy
*  into any overly simplistic way of thinking about it.
*  For one thing, I don't even know that it's true or accurate to say the United States
*  has become a rather anti-scientific country over the last years.
*  This complaint that the United States is anti-scientific or anti-intellectual or whatever is a perennial
*  complaint.
*  It's been going on for a very, very long time.
*  When I was just starting out, the big controversy was over creationism in high schools and nuclear
*  power.
*  That was another big controversy.
*  Even before that, there was the 60s and folk spirituality and things like that.
*  All these got complaints that they were being anti-scientific.
*  I don't know of any objective way to measure how anti-scientific we're being and whether
*  or not it has in fact increased over the past several years.
*  Having said that, I also, sorry, I should also say I don't know how to measure whether
*  the United States is more anti-scientific than other countries or than other scientifically
*  industrialized countries or anything like that.
*  These are impressions, but these impressions, I don't trust them necessarily.
*  Maybe they're true.
*  I'm not saying they're not true.
*  I just don't know how to test them in a value-free objective way.
*  There's still a question.
*  There is anti-scientific sentiment.
*  Where does that come from?
*  Whether it's more or less here or now than in other places or times, I don't know, but
*  it's there.
*  Where does it come from?
*  I think it comes from a lot of different places.
*  Even though I just said don't be too simplistic about it, let me give you my very, very simplistic
*  take on one aspect that I think is overlooked.
*  You suggest capitalism as a possible cause.
*  Again, maybe that's true, but I want to emphasize the role of culture in this one, the ideas
*  role rather than the money role.
*  When you go back to, as I said, the debates over creationism in public schools, for example,
*  I think that scientists were continually frustrated when they were trying to argue against teaching
*  creationism in schools because they were arguing on the scientific merits.
*  They were saying, you know, here are the pieces of evidence we have for Darwinian evolution
*  and for change of species over time, et cetera, et cetera.
*  Therefore we should teach this correct theory in the schools rather than some incorrect
*  theory.
*  But I don't think that for most people who are on the other side, I don't think that
*  was the point.
*  I'm sure that for some people who are on the creationist side, they really just looked
*  at the evidence and came down on that side.
*  But I think that for a large number of people, there were cultural issues at work, in particular
*  resentment issues.
*  You know, we're more familiar with that these days in the populist era than we did have
*  in the discourse in, let's say, the 1980s, where I'm thinking of.
*  But it was still there, you know, when you have a big heterogeneous country like the
*  United States.
*  And that's why there might be some American exceptionalism here.
*  The United States is bigger than most countries.
*  Its population is largely non-native, right?
*  I mean, the people who are in the United States today are the overall majority of them not
*  descended from families who were here in the United States 500 years ago, right?
*  They came from a whole bunch of different countries, bringing different traditions and
*  cultures along with them.
*  And the history within the United States is complicated, especially by things like the
*  Civil War.
*  So we have regional differences.
*  Some regions had slavery, some did not.
*  And so all of these things mean that there is a wide spectrum of kinds of people living
*  in the United States, perhaps a wider spectrum than in most other countries, you know, even
*  other big countries like India or China, big population wise, they have more of a common
*  history than the United States does.
*  If we're thinking about history stretching over 500 years, a thousand years, etc.
*  So what that means is that, you know, even though the United States is a country and
*  has its history, not everyone necessarily identifies with the rest of the country or
*  with other parts of the country.
*  And so, again, to be very simplistic about it, and I would like to see data here too,
*  and so you're welcome to check me.
*  But my feeling is that sub-populations of people in the United States tend to be a little
*  bit ornery about being lectured to by other sub-populations, okay?
*  Whether it's, you know, economic class or geographic location or cultural history or
*  whatever, people don't want to be told what to think and how to believe and what to do.
*  And so I think that for a lot of people to go back to creationism, this is the point
*  I'm trying to make, for a lot of people, the desire to get creationism taught in schools
*  was not really about creationism.
*  It wasn't even really about religion.
*  It was about asserting the right to determine for themselves what they wanted taught in
*  their local schools rather than being told by some government bureaucracy or some academic
*  elites or even some group of scientists what to be taught in their schools.
*  So when the scientists came in and said, let me explain to you the truth, this was counterproductive.
*  This is exactly what they were reacting against.
*  And I think similar dynamics are at work with anti-scientific movements in the United States
*  today.
*  You know, Kyrie Irving, the basketball player, is on the record saying that he believes that
*  the earth is flat.
*  And he got laughed at for doing this, but he got a little bit of a platform because
*  he's a famous and very talented basketball player.
*  And why in the world would anyone believe that the earth is flat?
*  This makes no sense scientifically.
*  And I take it as a sort of a signaling effort to say, you know, whatever you authorities
*  are going to tell me to believe, I'm not going to believe them.
*  I'm going to be skeptical.
*  I'm going to do my own research.
*  Right?
*  Do these phrases sound familiar to you in this day and age?
*  So the question to ask when someone says, I believe the earth is flat, or the attitude
*  to take, strategy to take, is not let me assemble for you the pieces of evidence to tell you
*  the earth is not flat.
*  That's just the entirely wrong thing to do.
*  The thing to do is to say, what makes you believe that?
*  What is it about the traditional scientific story for which there is overwhelming evidence
*  that makes you distrust it?
*  And so I think that if we want to decrease anti-scientific sentiment in the United States,
*  and this is something I'll talk about in future podcast discussions, we really need to think
*  about empowering people and making them feel like they're not being told what to do and
*  what to think and what to believe by people who are out of touch with them.
*  That's a bigger project.
*  I'm not sure how to do it, but that's my that's my simplistic theory to address that question.
*  Robert Ruxandrescu says, the question is, how can you reconcile the instantaneous integrated
*  conscious experience of your brain with a space like separated structure?
*  So the point is, and Robert goes into a great detail if you want to look at the question
*  in the AMA, but you have a bunch of neurons in your brain and we attribute to that collection
*  of neurons firing signals at each other, something we call consciousness, right?
*  But even though neurons are fairly close together, they are still space like separated at any
*  one moment of time.
*  That is to say, a neuron on one side of your brain will require some time to send a signal
*  to the other side of your brain, even if that signal moves at the speed of light, which
*  it doesn't quite.
*  They always move slower than the speed of light.
*  So in what sense can we attribute an instantaneous notion of integrated conscious experience?
*  I think the answer is it's a mistake to take too literally the idea of instantaneous integrated
*  conscious experience.
*  There is no such thing.
*  The human brain works at a certain set of time scales and actually different parts of
*  that work at different time scales, but none of those time scales is instantaneous.
*  We think about the world, we perceive the world in a coarse grained way and time is
*  included in that.
*  It's not that there's any discretization of time, but we sort of smear out what we
*  think of as one moment of time into some finite interval, which might be very small, so small
*  that we don't even notice it.
*  But it's just not true that we need to think about instantaneous interactions in the way
*  that a physicist would seriously take that to make sense of what the brain is trying
*  to do.
*  The brain is only approximately instantaneous and that's only on human scales, not on physics
*  scales at all.
*  I'm going to now group two questions together.
*  One is from James Nancarrow, who says, I am puzzled by your conclusion about the fundamental
*  origin of the universe and wonder if you could discuss this further.
*  You had a whole podcast on why there is something to nothing.
*  You don't have an answer in that podcast except to say the universe just is.
*  You seem to give Tegmark's idea and any other idea a zero Bayesian prior probability given
*  your conclusion of no answer.
*  But if the universe has a cause, then the cause must end the chain of causal descent
*  by itself existing without a cause.
*  Doesn't pure mathematics satisfy this?
*  And the other question is by Preston Justice.
*  I've recently read a paper on William Lane Craig's Kalam cosmological argument blended
*  with the fine tuning argument and know that you had a formal debate with him in 2014.
*  Has your position reasoning changed at all in the past seven years and can you please
*  briefly reiterate your counter argument?
*  So the reason why these two things are grouped together because at the end of James's question
*  where he says if the universe has a cause that cause must end the chain of causal descent
*  by self existing without a cause is very much in line with William Lane Craig's Kalam cosmological
*  argument.
*  Part of the cosmological argument, the conclusion being that this cause that exists without
*  a cause is God.
*  So first to answer James's question, you know, I don't say when we ask the question, why
*  is there something rather than nothing to say there is no answer except to say to the
*  universe just is what I try to say is that's not an answerable question.
*  That is not a question that has an answer.
*  Okay.
*  So just because I can grammatically form a sentence with a question mark at the end doesn't
*  mean it's a sensible question to ask about the universe, right?
*  To ask about reality.
*  When you say what is the largest prime number, the answer is not a number.
*  The answer is no, no, no, there's no such thing as the largest prime number.
*  You shouldn't ask that question, right?
*  Likewise, when you ask why is there something rather than nothing, the question being begged
*  there is, is it sensible to attach a reason why to the question of something versus nothing?
*  And my answer is no, there's no such thing as the reason why there is something rather
*  than nothing.
*  That's not the same as saying the universe just is, although it is compatible with saying
*  the universe just is.
*  The other thing is, you know, you say that I give Max Tecmark's cosmological views a
*  zero Bayesian prior probability.
*  And so this is pushing a hot button of mine and let me digress a little bit over this
*  because a good Bayesian doesn't really give zero prior probability to almost anything,
*  any logically coherent ideas because you never know when evidence might come along and increase
*  or decrease your credence in those ideas.
*  But very frequently, I will, when asked a question, give an answer to it, right?
*  Like what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?
*  Well, it's the many worlds interpretation, right?
*  Is there dark matter?
*  Yes, there is dark matter.
*  Is the theory of natural selection basically true?
*  Yes, it basically is.
*  Now in all of these, of course, what I mean is my credence in those answers is high, high
*  enough that I'm not going to continually footnote every single claim I make by saying my credence
*  is high, but not precisely one.
*  So for some weird reason, when I talk about ordinary scientific subjects, people seem
*  to get that.
*  When I say dark matter exists, for example, most people understand that what I'm saying
*  is I put a very high credence on the existence of dark matter given the data and information
*  we have and so on and so on.
*  But when it comes to these sort of grand metaphysical slash theological questions, anytime I state
*  an opinion, people attribute to me certainty in that opinion.
*  Even though I'm not saying I'm certain in that opinion, I never say I gave zero Bayesian
*  prior probability to anything else.
*  I've never said any words like that.
*  I said, here's what I think is right.
*  That is what I said.
*  So, you know, when I say that, like I just said, for my attitude toward the why is there
*  something rather than nothing problem, probably there is no reason why there is something
*  rather than nothing.
*  I'm not meaning to attribute any certainty to it.
*  And I think it's extremely, you know, one should never assume that just because a person
*  says something that they're certain about it, because it would be very tedious indeed
*  to go through life mentioning your numerical Bayesian credence to every claim that you
*  make, even if that credence is 99 percent.
*  Right.
*  So no one does that and no one should expect anyone to do that.
*  So it is important to distinguish between making claims, which is always a fine thing
*  to do, and erroneously attaching certainty to those claims.
*  Don't accuse people of attaching certainty to their claims unless they actually literally
*  say that that is what they are doing.
*  OK, now then we have the bit about causes and chains of events and also Preston's question
*  about the Kalam Cosmological Argument.
*  And, you know, my answer has not changed that much since 2014, which is that the whole talk,
*  the whole discourse of causes and effects is just completely inappropriate in the context
*  of the existence of the universe.
*  The idea of causes and effects, you know, goes back a long time.
*  It probably goes back very, very far, but certainly attempts at formalizing it were
*  made by Aristotle and so forth.
*  But like many ideas in philosophy and science, they start out as informal folk ideas and
*  then we try to make them rigorous.
*  OK.
*  We try to attach meaning to these everyday human inventions.
*  So we have causes and effects in the everyday world.
*  No question about that, right?
*  The cause of me getting sick was I got a bug, right?
*  And I got sick because of that, because I wasn't wearing my mask.
*  Perfectly sensible set of things to say.
*  But there's no guarantees that that informal notion extends to these huge metaphysical
*  questions that are well outside the realm of our everyday experience.
*  So that was my point when I talked with William Lane Craig, and that will be my answer to
*  your question, James.
*  This whole first premise of the Kalam cosmological argument, everything that begins to exist
*  has a cause.
*  Nope.
*  No, it doesn't.
*  I would respond to that by saying the notion of having a cause just doesn't apply to things
*  like the universe.
*  OK, what does apply?
*  You might well ask what applies?
*  Well, I would say that the sensible thing that seemingly applies is does everything
*  that happens obey the laws of physics?
*  Now of course, you always define the laws of physics to include everything that happens.
*  So a better thing to say is, is there some simple universal set of laws of physics that
*  is working now that allows for the universe or for all of existence and all of reality
*  to be self-contained and compatible with that simple set of laws?
*  Now we don't know what the ultimate laws of physics are, so we can't say the answer to
*  that for sure.
*  But with things like quantum cosmology, the wave function of the universe, et cetera,
*  we have very good reasons to believe that the universe can exist self-consistently,
*  without any external cause or support or creator or anything like that.
*  So that's the scientific attitude given what we know about modern physics.
*  Claudio Slomovitz says, I'm wondering if all the fields that make up the universe are present
*  everywhere or if some fields exist only in limited portions of the universe.
*  A raw definition for field is a physical quantity represented by a number or another tensor
*  that has a value for each point in space and time.
*  Does a particular field still exist in regions of space where the value at each point is
*  zero?
*  What if there are fields whose value is zero at all points?
*  Would we be aware of their existence?
*  So there's two things going on here.
*  One is the first question, would a field exist even if its value is zero?
*  Sure.
*  Because the existence of a field means that it could take on other values.
*  If you invented a field that for some reason could only be zero, that's the only value
*  you could have, then it might as well not exist.
*  You know, the whole point of fields is that they can in principle change and interact
*  with other fields.
*  So to answer the second part of your question, would we be aware of it if a field has zero
*  value everywhere?
*  Well, again, it depends on is it a necessary fact about the field that it always has zero
*  value?
*  In which case, no, we would not be aware of his existence and it would make no sense to
*  talk about such a field as existing.
*  But if it just happens to have a zero value in some region, but we could bring it into
*  a non-zero value, then we say it exists, even if we don't do that.
*  So it's not just that it exists when it has a non-zero value, but the possibility that
*  we could give it a non-zero value by interacting with other fields, for example, is enough
*  to say that that field exists, just like the number zero exists.
*  It doesn't need to be non-zero number.
*  Peter Solfast says, sorry, I shouldn't have said that last word, that last sentence is
*  going to make me sound like a Platonist.
*  Things that have a value zero quantities, like the number of pennies in my pocket.
*  The number of pennies in my pocket could be zero.
*  It is zero, in fact, right now.
*  But the concept still makes sense.
*  And we could say that concept exists.
*  The more I'm saying this, the more is a bad analogy.
*  Fields are special.
*  Fields having zero value have no trouble at all.
*  Here's a better analogy.
*  The temperature is zero in degrees Celsius.
*  That doesn't mean that there's no such thing as temperature.
*  It just means the value is zero.
*  Peter Solfast says, when working through a new idea or cranking through math, what's
*  your preferred working medium?
*  Whiteboard, chalkboard, tablet paper, et cetera, and why?
*  So I generally go back and forth between three media.
*  Like in many ways, when people ask about my work habits, I just don't have a very systematic
*  procedure.
*  Sorry about that.
*  But there's something nice about working standing up at a blackboard or whiteboard.
*  Unlike many of my colleagues, I am not all that invested in whether the board is black
*  or white.
*  I like whiteboards just as much as blackboards.
*  A lot of people have a sort of aesthetic preference for blackboards.
*  I get it, but that's not me.
*  I just don't care.
*  But there is something nice about standing up.
*  And also you can sort of see things in front of you and you can sort of erase and shape
*  things.
*  And that's very nice.
*  But the problem is you can't be very detailed about it, right?
*  Like you can't fit that much onto a blackboard.
*  So at some point you got to sit down and write.
*  And traditionally I've done that with pen and paper.
*  But mostly these days I've switched over to iPad and Apple pencil.
*  OK, the same sort of technology that I use to do the biggest ideas in the universe series
*  is what I do to take my notes.
*  There's pluses and minuses there.
*  The huge minus is you can't set out 20 pages in front of you and look at them all at the
*  same time.
*  And the access time to different pages is actually slower on a tablet than it is in
*  person.
*  On the other hand, there's a huge benefit, which is that you can cut and paste.
*  That is a huge benefit.
*  The other huge benefit is that I'm walking around with my iPad.
*  I have every note I've ever taken since I got the iPad.
*  Whereas other notes that I do on paper, I tend to put in a file and then never take
*  out of the file ever again.
*  So I think that overall the tablet is winning a little bit.
*  But you know, I'm open to that changing down the road.
*  And then finally, since usually these ideas that I'm working on are in the context of
*  some hopefully deliverable product, like a paper or a book or whatever, I'm also typing
*  at the computer.
*  So I'm very often, you know, I have a fodder file on my computer where there's a list of
*  ideas that I someday want to write into papers or books.
*  And when one of them grows up to be more than just a paragraph, it will get its own file
*  in a folder on the computer.
*  And I'll type in ideas that will eventually become an outline and hopefully eventually
*  a paper.
*  That's how it works.
*  So back and forth between some text files on the computer, the tablet where I can write
*  and do other things, and then the blackboard where you can sort of conceptualize everything
*  and also talk to other people.
*  The social aspect is very important.
*  Joseph Williams says, Did you expect LIGO to detect the gravitational waves propagate
*  at the speed of light?
*  Do we fully understand why that is?
*  So yes, I expected that.
*  And yes, we fully understand it.
*  It's because gravitational waves are massless.
*  We understand it mathematically.
*  You can in fact, if you buy my general relativity book, you will prove it for yourself.
*  The wave equation in classical general relativity looks basically the same as the wave equation
*  for Maxwell's electromagnetism.
*  So remember that there's nothing special about the speed of light.
*  There, sorry, there's something special about that speed.
*  The thing that is special about it is not that light moves at that speed.
*  There is a special speed built into the fabric of space time.
*  The speed at which you can't ever travel, the limiting speed if you are a massive particle
*  or object.
*  It's the relative velocity between two particles that are both massive can never be as large
*  as a certain speed.
*  It just so happens that light travels at that speed.
*  And you can see that from the particle point of view by saying the particles are massless
*  or from the wave point of view, by just looking at the equation that the waves obey.
*  And the equation that gravitational waves obey is basically the same as the equation
*  that light waves obey, electromagnetic waves obey.
*  When I say basically, it can't be exactly the same because light is a spin one wave
*  and gravity is a spin two wave, so different tensor structures.
*  But the differential equation that tells you how the wave changes from moment to moment
*  in time and in space, those are exactly the same structure for light and for gravity.
*  So that is exactly what you would expect before you ever turned on LIGO and it's exactly
*  what we saw.
*  To change that to give either light or gravity some other speed is actually very challenging
*  given what we already know about those two phenomena.
*  So people sometimes try to do it, but it's very tricky.
*  Phil Moyer says, I'm still not clear on the relationship between space time curvature,
*  e.g. decider versus anti-decider space and the cosmological constant.
*  First, how does the cosmological constant show what kind of space we live in?
*  Second, what does current research tell us about the curvature of our space?
*  Good, so there's a couple things going on here.
*  One is, I mentioned before, but I'll say again, there's a difference between the curvature
*  of space and the curvature of space time.
*  So the curvature of space time makes perfect sense.
*  It's something that we can define.
*  The curvature of space implicitly means, if you're even going to talk about that, that
*  you've divided space time up into space and time, right?
*  So you can assign space a curvature.
*  Now in both cases, space and space time, if you're completely careful about it, you need
*  tensors to characterize the mathematical structure of that curvature.
*  In other words, it's not just a single number.
*  It's a set of numbers that answer a bunch of questions about how the curvature of space
*  is affecting particles moving in different directions or something like some equivalent
*  physical notion.
*  But we very, very often simplify, okay?
*  So we consider spaces or space times that we call spaces of constant curvature, curvature
*  that is the same in every direction and the same at every point.
*  And there you go from by making that simplification from an infinite number of possible curvatures,
*  different ways that the space or space time can be curved, to a very small number, namely
*  three.
*  Either space or space time, if it's uniform, if it's constant curvature, can either be
*  zero curvature, positively curved or negatively curved, okay?
*  So when you're talking about this particular distinction, decider versus anti-decider,
*  usually we're talking about, I mean, that means talking about the curvature of space
*  time, not about the curvature of space.
*  And I mention this because if in the real world, we don't live in either decider or
*  anti-decider because decider and anti-decider are solutions to general relativity with zero
*  matter in them.
*  By matter, I mean any propagating form of energy, including radiation or fluids or whatever.
*  They're empty universes.
*  They are vacuum solutions to Einstein's equation of general relativity.
*  The only non-zero source that you include to get those solutions is the vacuum energy,
*  the cosmological constant.
*  So basically, if you have no matter, no energy other than the vacuum energy, then if the
*  cosmological constant is positive, you get a decider solution with positive curvature.
*  If the vacuum energy is negative, you get an anti-decider solution with negative curvature.
*  And if it's zero, you get Minkowski solution with zero curvature.
*  And roughly, those correspond to test particles moving together over time as positive curvature,
*  as like you're on a sphere, or they could move apart over time with negative curvature,
*  or you can have zero curvature like Euclid thought about, but the space time version
*  of that.
*  And as you know, Euclid thinks that initially parallel lines remain parallel forever.
*  Same thing is true in space time, in Minkowski space.
*  So in that case, it's a very simple straightforward relationship.
*  If there's nothing in the world other than the vacuum energy, the vacuum energy tells
*  you which space you're in.
*  But as I started to say a minute ago, we don't live in the vacuum.
*  You and I are not made of the vacuum.
*  We're made of particles.
*  So we will asymptotically approach the vacuum.
*  The universe is emptying out, coming closer and closer to the vacuum.
*  And the fact that we think the cosmological constant is positive means that we're approaching
*  decider space.
*  But right now we're not in decider space.
*  We're in something that is approximately homogeneous and isotropic cosmological space time.
*  So if you look at the distribution of galaxies or radiation or anything like that on very
*  large scales, it is approximately uniform.
*  That lets us pick out a preferred way of dividing space time into space and time.
*  And then we can talk about the curvature of space all by itself.
*  And we could say is space positively curved, negatively curved or zero?
*  And the important thing is there's a very long-winded way of getting at a single important
*  point.
*  The curvature of space is completely independent from the curvature of space time.
*  You can have, let's say, a positive cosmological constant so that you will eventually approach
*  decider space in a positively curved universe.
*  And yet in the time, in the time period, in the era where you still have matter and
*  energy other than the cosmological constant, your spatial slices of space time may very
*  well be either positively curved or negatively curved or have zero curvature at all.
*  And in fact, in some cases, there's more than one way of slicing space time.
*  If you were actually in decider space, if there was no matter, if you were in a vacuum
*  solution where you had decider space time, you could equally well slice it so that spatial
*  slices were completely flat or that spatial slices were positively curved.
*  So it's a complicated relationship overall.
*  So just keep your wits about you and make sure you know whether people are talking about
*  the curvature of space or the curvature of space time.
*  Nicholas Walker says priority question.
*  Remember, priority questions are you're allowed once in your life to ask a question that I
*  will try to answer and I can't answer every question because there's too many questions,
*  but I will always try to answer your priority questions.
*  But you only get one.
*  So make it a good one.
*  And Nicholas says, I recently watched a program that said that our current best view on gravity
*  is that it emerges from some description of the universe that has no space and time in
*  it at all.
*  In information returned to the universe from black holes imprinted in radiation.
*  Could you help explain this?
*  Well, you know, how much of an explanation do you need?
*  I did a whole episode with Neda Engelhardt on this kind of problem, on the black hole
*  information problem.
*  So I recommend you check that out if you haven't already.
*  But there's a couple of ideas that maybe got smushed together here a little bit.
*  There's the idea that the fundamental description of space time as you and I know it is fundamentally
*  quantum mechanical and doesn't start with space or time at all.
*  Or maybe it starts with time, but not space, maybe even space, but not time.
*  Like all these options are on the table.
*  Something that is crucially important to emphasize here is that we don't know, right?
*  I mean, the state of our current knowledge here, it's all very, very speculative when
*  it comes to these things.
*  So keep an open mind about what the possibilities are.
*  But the point is that if you take quantum mechanics seriously, the universe is a wave
*  function and the wave function has its own status, its own existence as a vector in some
*  giant Hilbert space, as we were talking about earlier.
*  And so you want to be able to describe space and time, or at the very least space, as well
*  as all the fields and particles, et cetera, that were made out of as emerging from that
*  underlying Hilbert space, vector in Hilbert space way of thinking about things.
*  Now that's a very sensible program to follow.
*  And I'm very, very interested in that.
*  I've written about it.
*  My most recent paper is literally called Reality as a Vector in Hilbert Space.
*  So you can check that out.
*  Or my most recent paper on this topic anyway.
*  Now, the implementation of that, how does space time really emerge from this abstract
*  notion? That's a tricky thing and that we know even less about.
*  And so when you say in information, return to the universe from black holes and printed
*  in radiation.
*  Well, you know, maybe, but certainly not necessarily right.
*  Like most information of the universe was never in a black hole, was never returned
*  to a universe, anything like that, that those sets of words appear in a context where you
*  have put some information in a black hole.
*  You've made a black hole.
*  Some quantum information has fallen into it.
*  And you're asking how it comes back out.
*  And crucial, if it does come out at all, which many of us think it does, there seems to be
*  a crucial step in which you're not attributing anything like a location in space to that
*  information.
*  The information is somehow spread out in a non-local way.
*  And the details there are remaining to be worked out.
*  I wouldn't want to make you think that it was almost all set.
*  So that's the that's the motivation, the philosophy behind it.
*  But, you know, we don't completely understand it quite yet.
*  So that's all I'd be willing to explain right now.
*  Ben Stein says, based on your interview with Edward Slingerland and your discussion of
*  Taoism and Confucianism in the context of modern neuroscience, do you think these two
*  ancient philosophies might actually be more similar and interrelated than they seem?
*  In other words, might Confucianism's call for self-cultivation neurologically develop into
*  the action without intention of Taoism?
*  Put another way, as was hinted on your show, is intense practice of the piano and study
*  of physics usually necessary for musical improvisation and physical intuition?
*  Honestly, I'm not the one to ask about this, so probably I shouldn't even try to answer
*  it. But I don't want to speak for Taoism and Confucianism.
*  I'm not an expert on those things. I have to disappoint you on that.
*  But the reason why I wanted to answer it was because, you know, there is a sort of hopeful
*  tendency or a tendency to be hopeful, maybe when you think about competing philosophies,
*  whether they're religions or more secular ways of thinking about the world, to say,
*  like, aren't they all one at heart?
*  And I think that the general answer, even though I don't know enough about Taoism and
*  Confucianism to say, but I think that the general answer is no.
*  Right. Like if we were talking about consequentialism versus deontology versus virtue
*  ethics in the realm of ethical and moral philosophy, I think they're really different.
*  And I think that, you know, not all religions are really the same.
*  I think that Confucianism puts has an emphasis more on the social aspects, on working within
*  a society in a successful way, playing your role, you know, taking up your place in the
*  hierarchy and fulfilling the requirements and the intentions of being in that place.
*  Whereas Taoism is more individual. Right.
*  It's about more about cultivating yourself for intrinsically virtuous reasons.
*  And so, again, even though I'm not an expert enough to say with any definitiveness, I don't
*  necessarily think that they were sort of going along the same path.
*  They can be compatible in many ways.
*  I can certainly imagine that being your best individual self is completely compatible with
*  playing your best role in a society.
*  But that's what I don't really have enough knowledge about to say whether or not they
*  really are compatible.
*  A real expert would actually know.
*  Bachi A says, Would you mind describing your writing process?
*  Once you've settled on an idea for a book, do you follow any particular system that guides
*  you through completing it?
*  So like I just hinted at, my process, such as it is, is, you know, kind of chaotic, kind
*  of non-systematic, I guess would be a better way of saying it.
*  I know that there's a very popular genre out there, right, of what your writing process
*  should be, kind of a self-help genre, or, you know, what the great people did.
*  And maybe you can be inspired by that.
*  But I think that everyone's different.
*  And I think that people should be different and their processes should be different.
*  I mean, my wife, Jennifer, is a writer.
*  She writes more than I do.
*  And our processes are utterly different, even though they both come to a successful
*  conclusion, I think, in very different ways.
*  So anyway, all that is preliminary to saying I might have my process, but it shouldn't
*  be your process.
*  As to what my process actually is, you know, it's unlike other people, I do as much
*  thinking and outlining as I can and reading and research and sort of conceptualizing in
*  my brain before I write anything.
*  So a lot of people will write a lot of rough drafts and, you know, just core dumps, free
*  writing, get something on the page, then eliminate a lot of it, cut and paste it,
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
*  That is not my process.
*  I really try to think in the most organized way possible about what I want to say,
*  where I'm going.
*  And then once it comes to actually writing it.
*  So the downside of that is a lot of my working habits look like I'm not doing anything at
*  all. I'm just sitting there.
*  But then the good part of it is that once I actually get to writing, I don't need to
*  revise very much because I really have a pretty clear idea of what's going on.
*  And when it does actually come to writing, like I will typically signpost.
*  So like I'll write a very brief outline, right.
*  And then I'll just go back and fill in the outline with the words I want to say.
*  And like going along with this with this philosophy is, you know, the idea that I
*  write from the start to the beginning.
*  Like, I can't imagine writing Chapter 7 before I've written Chapter 6 of whatever it
*  is I'm writing because I have the whole outline in mind.
*  I generally have a title in mind, even if it doesn't end up being the title.
*  But like a person who can write a book and not know what the title is going to be,
*  that's very alien to my way of thinking.
*  Let's put it that way.
*  So very encouraging to people to do it other ways.
*  But, you know, I have this this method where the whole thing is basically in my
*  head before I start.
*  DLP says, what is your favorite standalone science fiction movie of the past 10
*  years? Standalone, meaning not part of a series or set in a larger fictional
*  universe. So I don't really have one.
*  I almost didn't answer this question for that reason.
*  I don't have any. I thought I didn't have anything insightful to say.
*  But then I was thinking about, you know, maybe, you know, I just don't really keep
*  in my head a list of top 10 movies or whatever.
*  Right. So maybe there was some movie the past 10 years that I just have forgotten
*  was really great. And so actually, you know, went back inspired by this question.
*  I looked up, you know, what were the great science fiction movies of the past 10
*  years? And part of me thinks that I'm not that impressed with any of them in the
*  past 10 years.
*  Some of them are very, very good.
*  There's a lot of great movies out there.
*  I really liked, you know, Looper, The Martian, Ex Machina, Gravity in a slightly
*  different way.
*  I will confess that I didn't watch Arrival, which everyone says is really good.
*  So I should have to do that at some point in time.
*  But, you know, all of these are in my mind pretty good, but not like super great.
*  They weren't indelibly stamped into my consciousness like a really great movie
*  would be or even super duper memorable so that when someone mentions them and go,
*  oh, yes, let's watch that one again.
*  Right. I think they're pretty good.
*  And maybe it depends on exactly how the question was asked.
*  So 10 years is a certain criterion.
*  If we included Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, that's outside the 10 year
*  window. But that, I would say, was a truly great movie that impacted me quite a bit.
*  If we included Get Out as a science fiction movie, which arguably you could do,
*  it's closer to horror, I suppose, that I think was a truly great movie.
*  But, yeah, the you know, so for example, but I guess what I'm getting at is
*  the point of me answering this question is I don't know if it's my part, my fault
*  or the movie's fault that I don't have a real favorite here.
*  You know, it's certainly plausible to me that it's my fault, right, that there is
*  an era of your life when you're in your teens or your 20s, maybe where you're more
*  impressionable. So you see a movie and it just has a big impact on your life.
*  And then when you reach a certain age, as I now have, it's just harder to see a
*  movie and say, oh, that was really life changing experience, right?
*  But, you know, a movie doesn't need to be a life changing experience to be good.
*  So I'm not sure that it is my fault, to be honest.
*  So think, for example, about Looper directed by Rian Johnson, which I really
*  liked, but he also directed Knives Out, which I loved.
*  I think that Knives Out was a way more impressive movie than Looper.
*  And Looper was good, but Knives Out was better.
*  Like Knives Out was one of my favorite movies.
*  And why?
*  Like, is it just, well, you know, sometimes one movie is better than another.
*  I kind of wonder, this question is making me wonder whether science fiction on
*  screen or at least on the movie part of things is in a lull these days.
*  Obviously, science fiction commercially is hugely successful.
*  And, you know, DLP very specifically said don't include larger fictional
*  universes, but we know there's some very successful large fictional universes
*  out there, but, you know, I'm thinking about these movies and there is a
*  certain, you know, well troddenness to them in some sense.
*  Like we know the moves, we know the scenarios, there's some individual
*  surprises, but, you know, okay, we've seen The Matrix.
*  You know, we've seen time travel movies and it's a little bit less
*  truly new and deep in some way.
*  So, you know, Looper was a time travel movie that was very well done, very
*  competent, you know, it was fun and it was good as a movie, but the science
*  fiction didn't really, you know, blow my brains away and Knives Out wasn't
*  trying to be a movie that blew my brains away, right?
*  It was just a mystery story with some gooky characters in it, but it was just
*  so good at being that that I thought it was much more successful as a movie.
*  So, you know, yeah, maybe the science fiction on screen these days is sort
*  of less grandiose, less important, less significant in some way, or maybe
*  it's just that the really great people are mostly doing TV these days.
*  That's completely possible, right?
*  I mean, maybe the brilliant screenwriters are doing things like
*  Black Mirror and The Expanse and who knows, Foundation might be there at
*  some point, we don't know.
*  Game of Thrones, if you want to include fantasy as well.
*  So, yeah, so I don't know.
*  So this question made me think more than I expected it to, and I don't think I'm
*  like missing any great movies and of course, everyone's feeling about movies.
*  It's going to be different.
*  So I'm sure that everyone has very different opinions about this than I do.
*  Emmett Francis says, what defines something as a branch of physics?
*  Your conversation with Nigel Goldenfield helped me think through this a bit.
*  Part of it seems to be just that the same sorts of models like the Ising model
*  that apply to basic physical systems also work quite well when describing
*  higher level systems.
*  So is it just that mathematical models and tools happen to carry over to other
*  fields or is there something deeper that defines something as physics versus
*  quantitative modeling?
*  So I thought, see, I guess I got confused by this question because I thought when
*  you asked what defines something as a branch of physics, that we were
*  contrasting physics with, you know, chemistry or geology or biology or
*  whatever.
*  But then at the end, which is an intrinsically interesting question,
*  right?
*  I mean, with Nigel's conversation, we used, he, sorry, showed us how to use
*  techniques that you develop by being a theoretical physicist and put them together
*  to work in studying biology, either molecular biology or evolutionary biology,
*  et cetera.
*  So the boundaries are fuzzy in that sense, and maybe that's perfectly fine.
*  I don't really care whether we call it physics or not.
*  But then at the end, Emmett puts in this thing where he says, is there something
*  deeper that defines something as physics versus just quantitative modeling?
*  I don't know what that means.
*  So it's not physics versus other subfields of science, but physics versus
*  quantitative modeling.
*  You know, modeling is a part of physics, I guess.
*  You know, quantitative modeling is a part of physics.
*  You know, part of the scientific method broadly is inventing hypotheses, which
*  you could call models, and then figuring out what the predictions are of those
*  models, comparing them to the data, and so on and so on.
*  So I got confused at the last bit of that question, physics versus
*  quantitative modeling.
*  The physics versus biology and chemistry question, you know, part of it, part of
*  my answer would be, who cares?
*  Don't try to reify these artificial boundaries.
*  Just do good science and learn about the world.
*  But there is sort of a human scale question.
*  Why do we tend to think of some things as physics and other things as not?
*  Your first impression or your first guess is, well, we think of simple systems
*  as being physics.
*  And once they can become complicated, they become something else, right?
*  Chemistry or biology or whatever.
*  But complex systems can or complex behavior can arise from very simple
*  physical systems.
*  That's the whole point of what Nigel was talking about.
*  So it's not a very cut and dried criterion.
*  And honestly, you know, if I think about it, I'm not quite sure that there is a
*  cut and dried criterion for saying that something is physics versus some other
*  way of doing science or other subfield of science.
*  Rebecca Lashawa says, Bostonian here, what are some of the things you like to do
*  when you're in town?
*  How do you like it here in general?
*  And how would you compare it to L.A.?
*  So other than the weather, we'll not talk about the weather.
*  Like I said, I lived here.
*  I lived here eight years, five in grad school and then three in postdoctoral
*  years.
*  So I know the weather very well, but still, it's a shock to actually go through
*  it.
*  But I love Boston.
*  Boston is a great city.
*  And I'm a city person in general.
*  I think most cities are great.
*  Like once you have a critical mass of things going on, I'm pretty successful at
*  finding things that entertain me.
*  Right now, I'm sort of in the downtown crossing Chinatown area.
*  So there are more dumpling houses and hot pot restaurants around me that I can
*  possibly sample in a finite period of time.
*  So that's fun.
*  I'm going to try.
*  You know, overall, the food scene in Boston is not that great, to be honest,
*  compared to cities like L.A. or New York or San Francisco or Chicago.
*  Boston obviously has a lot going for it.
*  The single best thing, look, I know I'm biased.
*  Okay, I'm very, very biased.
*  I'm not everybody.
*  But if I were a Bostonian, the thing I'd be most proud of is that it's the best
*  university town around.
*  Right.
*  And we're including Cambridge.
*  And for that matter, let's include Medford so Tufts can get in there.
*  But Harvard and MIT, obviously, but also BU and BC and Tufts and Northeastern and a
*  whole bunch of places.
*  Brandeisie.
*  Let's include that.
*  The amount of smart people devoting their lives to intellectual pursuits is just
*  amazing here in the Boston area.
*  That's my favorite thing.
*  And, you know, it's not very original or anything like that.
*  But if I'm being honest, that's what I like about it.
*  What do I like to do?
*  Yeah, I don't think that the things I like to do in Boston otherwise are that
*  different than other places.
*  Eating, drinking, and eating.
*  I'm not doing a lot of those things because, number one, I'm by myself.
*  Jennifer is still back in Los Angeles.
*  And number two, there's a pandemic.
*  So I'm not like hanging out in clubs, going to hear music or anything like that.
*  Hopefully, I'll be able to come back under better circumstances pretty soon.
*  How would you compare it to L.A.?
*  I mean, it's very, very different.
*  That's the interesting thing.
*  Even though they're both cities with an amazing number of things to do, they're
*  very different.
*  And in many of the ways, I would give Boston the edge in some ways because it's
*  more walkable, right, or more public transportationable.
*  And that sounds trivial.
*  It's just a way to get around rather than what you do when you get there.
*  But it has an impact on how you interact with the city because in L.A., because
*  you have to drive everywhere, it's hard to find them.
*  And so I think that's the way to get around.
*  Because you have to drive everywhere, it's hard to find things in L.A.
*  You can't just like here in downtown Boston, I can walk in some direction and
*  interesting things will appear.
*  Or if I'm walking to some place for some particular reason, I will notice
*  interesting things that I hadn't anticipated before, right?
*  Places or stores or whatever.
*  Whereas in L.A., you better know where you're going to find anything interesting.
*  You better go there.
*  And then wandering around the neighborhood is usually less rewarding in a place like
*  L.A. There's some specific neighborhoods that work quite well in Hollywood or
*  whatever, Santa Monica.
*  But it's harder in L.A.
*  I think L.A. is wonderful.
*  The fact that the entertainment industry is centered there is a wonderful fact
*  about L.A.
*  The weather is pretty nice.
*  I said I wouldn't mention that.
*  But I really, really like L.A.
*  But I like Boston too, which is why it's fun to spend a couple months here.
*  Ken Wolf says, are you familiar with Eric Drexler's publications on his ideas for
*  what sort of capabilities molecular nanotechnology could eventually bring about?
*  So I had Eric Drexler's book years ago.
*  He wrote a book, Engines of Creation, where he won one of the very early
*  nanotechnology books.
*  I don't remember reading it.
*  So I cannot specifically answer that I know what was in those books.
*  But I wanted to answer the question because two things.
*  One is that, and I think I've said this before, apologies for people who have heard me say it
*  before, tiny, tiny, tiny technologies are going to be hugely important in the near
*  middle term future.
*  I think we underestimate how important they're going to be.
*  Nanoscale technologies in general are going to have an enormous impact on human lives.
*  But I have this vague feeling that the biggest impacts are not going to come from what we
*  traditionally think of as nanotechnology, but from what we traditionally think of as
*  synthetic biology.
*  As Francis Arnold put it, the Nobel Prize winner, a lot of good engineering at the
*  nanoscale has already been done by nature.
*  And we can use the ideas that nature has come up with and modify them for our own
*  purposes.
*  But that's going to be a much quicker route to world-changing technologies than just to
*  build little machines directly ourselves.
*  And in fact, we've seen this, right?
*  We've seen this with CRISPR, which we had podcast episodes on with Fyodor Urnov,
*  where CRISPR is something that exists in nature.
*  Bacteria invented it, and we are just repurposing it to edit genomes for ourselves.
*  So I think that the picture that you might have in mind of like little tiny machines,
*  where machines are literally made of metal, they look like little tiny miniaturized
*  versions of robots, is probably not the right one.
*  The world at that scale of being really tiny is a different world than our macroscale.
*  And the appropriate way to be and way to survive and way to thrive is probably to look more like
*  a cell than look like a little robot.
*  So nanotechnology will be important if that includes cellular biology, synthetic biology,
*  things like that.
*  Madeline Carr asks a priority question.
*  Do you think the concept of Bergsonian duration, the experience of lived time through the
*  immediate data of consciousness, will ever be reconciled with scientific clock time and
*  by what approach?
*  Yes, I do.
*  I think there's something missing here that I'm not getting in the question.
*  So I'm going to, sorry that it's a priority question, I'm going to give you a disappointing
*  answer, but the approach is by doing neuroscience and psychology, I guess, right?
*  I see no tension between the experience of lived time through consciousness and scientific
*  clock time.
*  There's like almost no barrier to answering that question.
*  I mean, we, our brains, are made of little things that obeyed laws of physics, laws of
*  chemistry, laws of biology, and they tick along like little clocks and they have rates
*  of doing things and it takes a certain amount of time to do different things and the collective
*  behavior of all those little pieces gives us consciousness and gives us the experience
*  of living through consciousness and that is responsible for our experience of time.
*  So I don't, I mean, of course, all the details are not yet worked out and will take effort
*  to work out.
*  I'm not going to predict when they're going to be worked out, but it's not something where
*  there's a huge paradox or puzzle that we see no way of resolving.
*  I think it seems like it's clear how it will eventually be figured out.
*  Luke DiGiacomo says, priority question, I am 25 years old and a software developer,
*  a great job I like well enough, yet I want so badly to be able to learn and work on the
*  foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  If I were to decide to make that jump, where would I need to begin?
*  So thanks for asking the question, but I'll answer it not just specifically for you,
*  but in more general.
*  We live in a world where this is easier than ever has been before to go from no knowledge
*  of professional physics to expert level knowledge of it because we've always had books,
*  but now we have online courses, lecture notes, online talks and things like that.
*  So if you wanted to do something like this, I'm not saying it's easy or even doable,
*  but it's more doable than it used to be.
*  Really what you need, you need two things.
*  You need a curriculum.
*  So you need like a list of subjects to learn and then you need the actual motivation to do it.
*  I mean, it's very, very easy to say, I'm going to learn all these things.
*  It's much, much harder to do it.
*  It's like saying, I'm going to lose 10 pounds.
*  That's very easy to say, harder to do for many people in actual fact because it takes a long
*  time to actually hold yourself to that standard.
*  So you can find curricula online.
*  I always point people to Gerard Etoufft's website.
*  Etoufft is a brilliant living physicist, Nobel Prize winner, and he has a website
*  which is called something like How to be a Good Theorist.
*  And he gives a very detailed curriculum that you can go through and learn.
*  And he links to online lecture notes as well as textbooks and things like that.
*  So you could just do that.
*  It would take you a long time, but there's no royal road to geometry.
*  It takes time.
*  The only problem with Etoufft's list is that there's too much in it.
*  Like he's a genius and a brilliant guy and he's giving you an overwhelming amount of stuff
*  you need to learn.
*  And so I've often contemplated making a companion webpage saying,
*  instead of how to be a good theorist, like how to be an adequate theorist,
*  where it was sort of the minimal set of things you need to know.
*  I mean, you need to know calculus, but how far back do you go is the question.
*  You clearly need to know algebra, okay?
*  Algebra, geometry, the basics, trigonometry, calculus.
*  And then beyond that, you need to know differential equations,
*  vector calculus, complex analysis, various techniques within mathematical physics
*  to solve differential equations like series expansions and transforms,
*  Fourier transforms especially.
*  A little bit of matrix mechanics, linear algebra, right?
*  And that's the basic mathematical toolkit.
*  And then with those, you learn the traditional curriculum is classical mechanics,
*  electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics,
*  and then options after that.
*  But it doesn't sound like too much, right?
*  Classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,
*  statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.
*  And the options include general relativity or nuclear physics or particle physics
*  or cosmology or astrophysics or biophysics or many, many different things.
*  But all those topics are available online if you really wanted to do them.
*  So if I don't know where your starting point is, start with classical mechanics.
*  Buy a big textbook or find a textbook online, Physics 101.
*  Start reading it.
*  See how far you get.
*  Siraj Rajan says, priority question, is there a physical distance that two worlds
*  in the many worlds interpretation have to maintain to stay distinct?
*  More generally, can the many worlds occupy the same classical physical space?
*  So, nope.
*  I have to undo the question, in fact.
*  There's no such thing as physical distance between many worlds.
*  So it's not that there's a certain physical distance
*  they are separated by to become different worlds.
*  There is literally no such concept as the distance between the worlds.
*  It's the other way around.
*  Space lives within each world separately.
*  It's not that the worlds live within space.
*  And this is a difficult little mental jujitsu to wrap your brain around
*  because we're not used to thinking that way.
*  We used to think about things living in space.
*  But in quantum mechanics and the many worlds interpretation,
*  the thing that matters is the wave function of the universe.
*  And that's not in space at all.
*  Space is in it.
*  And for each different world, there's a different copy of space.
*  There's no distance between them because there's no distance,
*  there's no space in between the different worlds.
*  Crather Lucas says, is there more than a semantic difference
*  between saying our universe splits in branches, thereby creating more universes,
*  and saying that all the universes in many worlds already exist
*  but differentiate over time?
*  So I think there is a difference.
*  But many people have asked this question.
*  I never actually myself have thought about it very, very carefully.
*  So I'll give you my tentative belief answer.
*  But again, subject to updating if someone explains it to me better.
*  What do you mean to say different worlds?
*  There needs to be some meaning to that statement.
*  When are two different subsets of some big physical structure different worlds?
*  So I think that the answer is that if you change the physical situation in one of those worlds,
*  the other world doesn't notice.
*  It will never notice as long as it goes on.
*  There's no difference in the evolution of one world
*  if you start from a different starting point in the first world.
*  That's the nature of things in the many worlds interpretation.
*  If you have a branching event, so now you have two different branches of the wave function.
*  And I imagine again, hypothetically, it doesn't happen,
*  but hypothetically, counterfactually, putting my finger in there
*  and messing with the physical situation in one of those worlds,
*  what happens in the other one?
*  And the answer is nothing.
*  There's no observable effect.
*  Very, very similar, but different conceptually, but similar conclusion to
*  the cosmological multiverse where the different universes, as we call them,
*  are literally just so far away that nothing that happens in one universe can affect the other.
*  As we just discussed, here in many worlds, there's no distance between them,
*  but they are causally separated.
*  So if you want to say, well, maybe all the worlds were always there,
*  but we just didn't differentiate between them, I don't think that's right.
*  Because if you went in and poked one of those purported worlds
*  before the branching event happened, before decoherence happened,
*  that would be noticeable in the other parts of the wave function.
*  So again, I'm not 100% sure that's the best way of thinking about it,
*  but that's how I think about it right now.
*  So open to modification if someone gives it to me.
*  Max Plan says, a while back, I think you organized a series on naturalism
*  called Moving Naturalism Forward.
*  I love those discussions and learned a lot from them.
*  Have you ever thought of organizing something like that again?
*  So yeah, for those of you who don't know, back in I think 2012,
*  I helped organize, well, I did organize, it was mostly me,
*  a one workshop called Moving Naturalism Forward.
*  You can find it online.
*  All of the videos are there.
*  It's a wonderful thing.
*  We just got a bunch of people in a room and for three days we talked.
*  It was cut short a little bit, more like two days,
*  because there was a giant hurricane that hit Massachusetts where we were.
*  So people had to run away quickly.
*  But it was philosophers and physicists and biologists and neuroscientists
*  all talking to each other.
*  Richard Dawkins was there.
*  Steven Weinberg was there.
*  Dan Dennett was there.
*  As well as a bunch of former Mindscape guests.
*  Jan Eleven was there.
*  Alex Rosenberg was there.
*  A bunch of other people.
*  And we had a great time.
*  The whole point of it, the motivation of this was
*  so much effort had been spent in the atheist-naturalist community
*  in saying that God didn't exist or saying that religion was bad or something like that.
*  Right?
*  A huge amount of effort.
*  And fine, it's true.
*  I agree that God doesn't exist.
*  But okay, what are you going to do about it?
*  How are you going to live your life now that God does not exist?
*  Nietzsche has asked us this question.
*  And have we given a completely adequate answer to it?
*  And I think the answer is no.
*  We've not given a completely adequate answer to it.
*  And part of the evidence is from that workshop.
*  If you look at the discussions,
*  we didn't agree with each other on a bunch of things.
*  Okay?
*  So there's plenty of work.
*  Once you say God doesn't exist, you're not finished.
*  So that's why we called it moving naturalism forward.
*  So let's agree.
*  Zero time was spent arguing about the existence of God.
*  We all agree that God didn't exist.
*  But okay, what's the meaning of life?
*  Do we have free will?
*  How should we be moral?
*  Right?
*  These are the questions that we addressed.
*  Simon Dedeo, David Purple, other Mindscape guests who were on there.
*  I'm sorry that I'm forgetting people.
*  But anyway, yeah, I think it was very, very productive.
*  It was very interesting to hear people.
*  And it was also productive because there was almost no agenda, right?
*  I sketched out an agenda like if it's this morning,
*  then we're talking about the meaning of life.
*  And I designated one person to lead the discussion.
*  And we just discussed.
*  And it was a small enough group that we could do that.
*  And it worked, I thought, beautifully.
*  And we never, we didn't say we're going to write a book
*  or anything like that.
*  There was no obligations.
*  So it made people willing to go.
*  And so it was very useful.
*  Am I going to do it again?
*  Maybe.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't have any current plans.
*  It is work setting these things up.
*  So I only have a finite amount of time in the day.
*  So I have to choose what I'm doing.
*  David Wallace and I have actually thought about doing moving Everett forward.
*  Doing a workshop with just a few people who are all Everettians.
*  There's lots of workshops on the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  But we're constantly arguing over what is the right theory of quantum mechanics.
*  And there's sort of intra Everettian questions to be asked,
*  which are very, very interesting.
*  And so maybe we could do that.
*  And this is not to say someone else couldn't have a theory on moving Cubism forward
*  or moving pilot wave theories forward.
*  Good for them.
*  They shouldn't be bothered by talking to Everettians all the time.
*  They should be able to talk to themselves too.
*  And I'm sure there's a million other things.
*  So I will certainly be organizing workshops going forward,
*  but I'm just not sure which ones.
*  Tim Kennedy says, near the very end of a recent AMA,
*  you spoke about how you were leaning away from consequentialism
*  and more towards deontologism.
*  Could you share more thoughts about that?
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm not sure if it's toward deontologism or not.
*  But it's certainly true that over the past 10 years or so,
*  maybe that's a little bit too many years,
*  but I guess since writing the big picture,
*  which is more like five years ago,
*  when I really needed to sit down and actually put onto paper
*  some of my ideas about ethics and meta ethics,
*  I had already become a little bit skeptical of utilitarianism and consequentialism,
*  which was sort of my natural, comfortable home in my early days,
*  thinking about morality and so forth.
*  It's very, very compatible with being a scientist, right?
*  As we will talk about on a very soon upcoming podcast,
*  there is a seductiveness to quantitative measures of things and clarity,
*  being able to say this is bigger than that.
*  And that's a wonderful feature of consequentialism and utilitarianism.
*  There's a number, utility, and you add it up and you maximize it.
*  What is better than that?
*  Whereas deontology is the idea that rather than just maximizing
*  some consequences of your actions, you follow rules.
*  And I need to keep including, which I didn't do very well in the big picture,
*  but there's another approach called virtue ethics,
*  where rather than following rules, there are some virtues you aspire to,
*  being brave and loyal and helpful and kind or whatever they are.
*  And it's more the aspiring to these qualities
*  than the following of these rules that is important.
*  And so I think that consequentialism is a natural guess,
*  a natural intuitive starting point for trying to be a moral person,
*  but I just don't think it works.
*  I don't think there is a number called utility that you can add up and maximize.
*  I am certainly a constructivist about morality.
*  I don't think objective morality is out there in the universe to be found.
*  I think that we construct our moral theories.
*  So the question is, what do you construct?
*  And on what basis do we pick some moral principles over others?
*  And I think that's sort of a kind of agglomeration of some combination of our intuitions
*  that we're just either born with or we develop over biological time.
*  And our teaching or learning, I should say, our experience in the world,
*  gives us some impressions.
*  And then, of course, our intellect, our cognition,
*  is able to try to systematize all of these inchoate initial starting points.
*  And I think that if you admit that morality is not objective,
*  sorry, let me back up because this is an important point.
*  I should try to get it right.
*  Think of someone like Peter Singer, the world's most famous utilitarian,
*  okay, recent winner.
*  I combined two words there, winner of the Bergruen Prize for philosophy,
*  million-dollar prize, and very, very influential in thinking about animal rights
*  and other issues in the philosophical world.
*  So he comes to some conclusions that most people think are counterintuitive,
*  especially about the rights of disabled people and mentally handicapped people
*  and things like that.
*  He thinks that the world would be better off if we were,
*  I don't want to put words into his mouth and I'm sure I'm not going to get it right.
*  Let's just say he is much more willing to contemplate
*  ending the lives of people who suffer than many other people are
*  because many other people have deontological intuitions where ending lives is bad
*  and Peter Singer is a thoroughbred consequentialist.
*  So he says, well, if they're suffering, then we better offer them not to be here.
*  And to me, this is an example of you start with some moral intuitions
*  like increasing utility and happiness is good.
*  And you develop a theory on the basis of that like I'll be a utilitarian.
*  But then you reach a conclusion that is incompatible with your initial intuitions.
*  And there's a point of view that says, well, so what?
*  I've reached a conclusion and I believe my theory.
*  So even though my theory contradicts my original intentions,
*  I should believe the theory if I'm going to be logically consistent
*  and intellectually coherent, right?
*  And that's an attitude.
*  That's Peter Singer's attitude.
*  My attitude is if the theory leads us to conclusions
*  that are incompatible with the premises on which we built the theory,
*  that just means the theory is bad and we need a better theory.
*  And I think that utilitarianism or consequentialism always does that.
*  It leads you to these conclusions that are incompatible with the initial intuitions
*  that you were using to construct your moral theory.
*  So I'm not sure what exact replacement I would advocate for consequentialism,
*  but some version of deontology and or virtue ethics is more like it.
*  Roughly, roughly, roughly speaking,
*  I mean, becoming more fuzzy about morality.
*  I'm becoming less and less convinced that there is a clear, crisp set
*  of rules or principles we can write down.
*  And I think that's compatible with the idea that we are constructivists.
*  The basis, the starting points for our construction of morality
*  are themselves unclear, ill-defined, imprecise.
*  So to attribute perfect clarity and precision to the outcome
*  is probably a mistake in some way.
*  I'm not sure I want to defend that 100%,
*  but that is roughly tentatively the direction which I'm moving.
*  Josh Hedgepeth says,
*  In a cosmos with infinite worlds where all points in time are equally real,
*  how does one reach a sense of self?
*  Are our past and future selves or future selves
*  any more us than our parallel counterparts?
*  So yeah, this is part of the important and weird issue
*  of personal identity in the many worlds interpretation
*  where there are parallel worlds with copies of us in them.
*  And I think you need to update your sense of self to make sense of many worlds.
*  In a single world cosmology where things only happen once
*  and we all agree what those things are
*  and they're all sort of continuous in space and time,
*  then it makes sense to talk about the life of an individual person
*  as constituting a coherent self, right?
*  You're born, you age, you experience the things, eventually you die.
*  That makes sense because we all have that same set of shared experiences.
*  We know what it means, etc.
*  It would be complicated if someone builds a transporter machine.
*  We'll talk about that later.
*  You know, if you could copy yourself and appear somewhere else
*  and the old copy of you was still there, now there's two of you,
*  well then the sense of self would be different
*  because you're faced with a different set of circumstances
*  than we ordinarily are in our experience of the world.
*  Likewise, if you believe in many worlds,
*  then the reality is different than our experience.
*  We have to update our notion of what we mean by a single set of selves.
*  I think the sensible way to do it is to think of
*  each person on each world as having a self.
*  The wrinkle, the complication, is that if you have multiple people
*  on different worlds who came from a single past self,
*  then they share a universal past, a common past,
*  but they don't share a common future.
*  The things that will happen to them in the future are distinct.
*  So that change, the fact that they do not share a common future,
*  to me means they're separate people.
*  That would certainly be the case if you made a duplicate of yourself
*  and the duplicate was very far away,
*  and the duplicate was living their own life,
*  and they were experiencing their own stuff
*  completely different than what you were experiencing.
*  There's no sense whatsoever in which that's also you
*  or the same as you or part of one collective you, right?
*  Even though you share the same past, your futures are completely different.
*  That's the situation in many worlds.
*  Happily, in many worlds, unlike the duplicator machine,
*  we're never going to see those other people,
*  so it just doesn't at all matter, right?
*  I would advocate that each one of them is a separate self,
*  but it also doesn't matter as long as you don't sort of try to group yourself
*  into some collective being.
*  The fact that more copies of you will split off
*  and live in different universes is irrelevant.
*  You personally, any one of those individual copies,
*  can think of themselves as having a unique past and a unique future.
*  It's true about the unique past, the future, it's not true,
*  but for all intents and purposes, it is.
*  So I think that even though you need to change the words around a little bit,
*  the actual operation of the sense of self isn't any different in many worlds
*  than it usually would be in a single world cosmology.
*  Marion Markali says,
*  I was listening to the latest Complexity podcast with Brian Arthur on economics.
*  By the way, I should say, you mean the latest podcast episode of Mindscape,
*  but there is a whole podcast called the Complexity podcast
*  put out by the Santa Fe Institute, which you might be interested in checking out.
*  Okay, question continues.
*  Basically, the theory is so abstract and divorced from the world,
*  and this makes it very successful in some aspects,
*  but too disconnected and unable to actually model reality correctly.
*  It should be a more complete dynamical process, more algorithmic, computational in nature.
*  It seems maybe mathematics and physics are in the same situation
*  with many disconnected fields or tools or theories, but not a central core.
*  Is this way of thinking applicable to physics?
*  Maybe hypergraphs are the underlying topology for the QFT equations or something like that.
*  So I'll put aside whether I quite agree with your
*  way of talking about what Brian said vis-a-vis economics.
*  I mean, economics is very the theory, the standard theory of economics as it currently exists,
*  is successful at some things, less successful at others,
*  and it's complicated to draw the line between them.
*  But for physics, I would say the answer is no, this is not a good analogy
*  or it's not the same situation anyway.
*  Physics has shared underlying theories and methodologies, right?
*  The standard model of particle physics underlies all the different areas.
*  All the different areas of physics.
*  If you have a physics theory of, I don't know, atomic physics,
*  you have a specific thing going on in atomic physics
*  and it violates the rules of the standard model of particle physics,
*  then either you're wrong or you're going to win the Nobel Prize.
*  There's no sense in which you just go on and say,
*  yeah, well, it's a different field, right?
*  They are all sharing that same common core.
*  And furthermore, the methodologies and the standards and the questions that are interesting
*  are more or less common.
*  Physics is remarkably unified, you know, considering how much ground it covers.
*  And that comes down to the fact that physics is pretty simple compared to other things.
*  Physics is all about simplifying things as much as we possibly can.
*  And other sciences, other areas of science don't have that privilege.
*  Okay, I'm going to group two questions together.
*  One is from Austin Hughes who asks a priority question.
*  Well, quantum mechanical behavior is very different from our everyday experience,
*  but the theory is incredibly good at making predictions.
*  How confident are physicists that this is a real description of reality
*  or an emergent phenomenon maybe from some lower level description of reality?
*  Is it ever possible to say that a theory is the lowest level description of reality
*  versus a description of an emergent phenomenon?
*  And then the other question is from Sid Huff who says,
*  do physicists know for certain that quarks are not made of something even smaller and why?
*  So you see, Sid's question is a more specific version of Austin's question.
*  And the answer is we don't know.
*  You know, we arguably will never know for sure whether or not our current best theory of the world
*  is the fundamental theory, is the absolutely correct theory.
*  You have to be open-minded about the fact that you might discover some new phenomenon
*  that you didn't predict in your underlying theory.
*  But what we do know is that right now we don't have it.
*  We do not have that underlying theory of everything because
*  we have general relativity and we have quantum mechanics and they're incompatible with each other.
*  You would think that different parts of physics need to be ultimately compatible with each other
*  because they all are describing the world in some way.
*  It might turn out that the best description of the world is a patchwork quilt
*  where the patches overlap with each other,
*  but they can't be incompatible in regions where they should both be true.
*  And that's the current situation with general relativity and quantum mechanics.
*  So, you know, we can look for ever deeper levels,
*  but the point is not there is a level that is the deepest and we need to find that, right?
*  If we keep finding deeper levels, that's fine.
*  If we find a level that seems to be a theory that covers everything, that's also fine.
*  And we can also keep looking for even deeper levels after that.
*  The specific question for quarks,
*  um, people have absolutely thought of the idea that quarks are made out of smaller constituents.
*  In fact, there's even a name for it.
*  It's the idea of a prion, P-R-E-O-N, not a prion, which is a neuroscience concept.
*  Prions are hypothetical little particles that are inside quarks in some sense.
*  So you can try, right?
*  You can try to build a model of prions inside quarks compared to the data, etc.
*  Doesn't seem to work.
*  As far as anyone knows, it doesn't really work yet.
*  Maybe we just haven't been clever enough yet.
*  But I think that the smart money is betting the quarks really are
*  fundamental, at least as far as field theory is concerned.
*  Abby Levine says, it seems that space expands everywhere except EG and galaxies.
*  Is it that interstellar expansion is negligible
*  compared to intergalactic and larger scales, or is it literally zero?
*  So of those two options, it's closer to saying it's literally zero,
*  but there's a more subtle answer here.
*  When we talk about the expansion of space, we are talking about cosmology.
*  And in fact, we are specifically talking about the approximation we use in cosmology
*  that you can divide all of space-time, as we said before, into space and time,
*  assign a geometry to space, and talk about how that geometry of space changes over time.
*  And since the assumption is that the universe is homogeneous,
*  it's the same everywhere in this approximation, we're making that assumption.
*  It's the same curvature of space everywhere, and it either just increases or decreases.
*  And we call that the expansion of the universe or the contraction of the universe,
*  if that were to happen.
*  But of course, we know that in the real world, that's just an approximation.
*  And that approximation breaks down when you get to the level of inside a galaxy.
*  Inside a galaxy, it is a terrible approximation to think of the density of the galaxy,
*  to think that the density of the galaxy is the same as the density of the universe,
*  or intergalactic space.
*  So the real point is that the metric of space-time inside a galaxy is not in any sense
*  well approximated by attributing a constant curvature to space.
*  The curvature is different in different places.
*  It's different inside the sun, outside the sun, inside a black hole,
*  far away from the galaxy, near the rim of the galaxy,
*  whether gravitational wave is passing by, whether two neutron stars are orbiting each other,
*  all these weird crazy things are happening in a very, very location-dependent way.
*  So the idea that there's one thing called the curvature of space that has a number that either
*  increases or decreases is just wildly inaccurate.
*  So inside a galaxy, and this is a more full answer than I've ever given to this question,
*  I've been asked this question lots of times, this is the fullest answer I've given to it.
*  It's just conceptually wrong to talk about the expansion of space.
*  What you should talk about is the curvature of space-time in the galaxy, okay?
*  And that you can do, and it's complicated because there's lots of stars and lots of gravitational
*  fields, but remember the curvature of space-time is what gives rise to what we think of as the
*  gravitational field.
*  So when you're talking about the space-time curvature within a galaxy,
*  you need to separately treat every star and planet, right?
*  Because they're all sources for space-time curvature.
*  Now, having said that, so this is all a way of saying you really shouldn't even talk about
*  the expansion of space inside a galaxy.
*  But there is also an additional bit of intuition that you can get, which is the following.
*  If you take an expanding universe, which is completely smooth and homogeneous,
*  and take a region of that universe, imagine that it's like made of dust.
*  Dust is what cosmologists call particles that are not moving, okay?
*  Individual particles scattered uniformly through space, but they're not moving with
*  respect to each other.
*  So space is expanding, the particles are moving apart.
*  Take all those particles in a spherical region of space and squeeze them into the center of
*  that spherical region, leaving a gap, leaving empty space in between the center of that
*  region where now you've made a collection, a clump, and the rest of the universe going
*  on its own way.
*  You can exactly solve Einstein's equation for this kind of situation, where you have
*  a clump of stuff orbiting itself, much like a galaxy, and then you have a region of empty
*  space, a spherical annulus around that clump, and then past some boundary, you have a uniform
*  collection of matter.
*  The uniform collection of matter continues to expand.
*  It is unaffected by a spherical concentration of matter replacing a spherical region of
*  uniform dust, okay?
*  And the galaxy that you made, the clump of particles, is completely unaffected by the
*  fact that the rest of the universe is expanding.
*  100% zero unaffected.
*  There's literally no, it's not an approximation, it's not pretty close, it's not negligible,
*  it's zero effect of a spherically symmetric expanding universe around it.
*  So to the extent that that thought experiment is a more or less useful guide to what happens
*  in real galaxies, as if we consider the rest of the universe outside the galaxy as still
*  being completely smooth and homogeneous, but inside where a clump of matter is surrounded
*  by empty space, there is zero effect of the expansion of the universe on what happens
*  inside a galaxy.
*  And that's more or less true in the real world, in our actual galaxy.
*  Alexander Cordova says, if you were close enough to two colliding black holes or neutron
*  stars, would you be able to see the gravitational waves rippling off?
*  I'm guessing the time scales here may not be human friendly, but assuming we could take
*  a video and play it backward, could you, and play it back and fast forward or slow motion,
*  could you actually see the ripples moving outward?
*  No, certainly not.
*  It's gravitational waves.
*  The only thing you could ever see are electromagnetic waves.
*  That's what it means to see.
*  You're looking with your eyes that see light.
*  And a gravitational wave puts off zero light.
*  If you surrounded the in spiraling objects with other objects, you know, planets or stars
*  or whatever, then you could see that they would move with respect to each other.
*  But you're looking at those planets and stars.
*  You're not looking at the gravitational distortions directly.
*  Jeff B says, I would love to be able to dive deeper into physics and many other
*  challenging subjects, but I find that I lack the energy after coming home from work.
*  Do I just need to suck it up and get reading or is there a way to make learning challenging
*  concepts feel like less of a chore?
*  Mostly you got to suck it up, I think is the answer here.
*  I don't think that there aren't any tricks to making learning challenging concepts any easier.
*  When you say that it feels like a chore, you know, what does that mean exactly?
*  Because you just said you'd love to be able to dive deeper into it.
*  But then you say it's a chore.
*  So, you know, maybe it is just a chore.
*  Maybe it's not something that you're really interested in diving deeper into.
*  Maybe you just wanted to have happened.
*  And there's just no way to make that happen because when you're learning something like this,
*  you're retraining your brain.
*  Your brain doesn't naturally go down those routes that you need to go to learn about
*  modern physics or any other academic subject, really.
*  So it's hard and it requires, you know, practice and thought and also repetition,
*  doing problems, you know, working out things for yourself, et cetera, et cetera.
*  You know, you can do it in bite-sized chunks rather than trying to do it all at once.
*  You know, you need to if you're learning, as we already talked about the curriculum,
*  right, classical mechanics, electromagnetism, et cetera.
*  And every one of those subjects, of course, has many sub subjects.
*  Okay.
*  If you think of learning a little bit of a sub subject as a goal in itself,
*  rather than saying, I just want to learn all the physics, that's too much.
*  You know, break it down into smaller pieces and then maybe you'll feel a sense of accomplishment.
*  When you just get a little bit into it, it's the best I can offer.
*  Casey Mahone says, David Eagleman had an idea I thought was fascinating.
*  To be clear, he did not claim to believe it.
*  The idea is that the brain is analogous to a radio.
*  If you only study the radio itself, you would never be able to understand
*  where the sounds it made were coming from.
*  So maybe consciousness works in a similar way,
*  where we can never understand it simply by studying the brain.
*  To preempt your possible response, we should be able to
*  detect the presence of any consciousness field that pervades space.
*  But perhaps the brain is reading some type of signal that appears scrambled or encrypted,
*  unless interpreted by a brain-like structure.
*  So, you know, as usual, the answer is anything's possible.
*  Maybe.
*  David is describing not a new idea, but an ancient one.
*  I mean, this is the idea that not ancient.
*  Maybe it is ancient, but it's certainly very old.
*  This is Descartes' idea.
*  You know, Descartes was a card carrying dualist.
*  He thought that the mind was completely separate from the body
*  and was indeed not even physical or located in space at all.
*  And he had this idea that there was a radio receiver.
*  He didn't call it that, but basically radio receiver in the pineal gland in the brain
*  that communicated thoughts and feelings to and from the mind and the actual body.
*  It doesn't work for lots of reasons, for many, many, many reasons.
*  But the simplest one today is that, as I've often said,
*  we know too much about the physics of the particles that make up the brain.
*  In order for something like this scheme to work,
*  even if it's encrypted, etc., etc., you have to change the laws of physics.
*  And we have very, very good experimental data that says that the laws of physics,
*  when it comes to atoms and electrons and molecules, etc.,
*  are very, very well understood.
*  Again, it's possible, but there's zero evidence for it, lots of evidence against it.
*  Joshua Hillerup says,
*  How common is it for physicists working in your area these days
*  to discover facts about the universe that get basically confirmed as being true?
*  Where on the spectrum is it from every working physicist should be doing this fairly often
*  to if you manage to do this, you win a Nobel Prize?
*  Well, I think the key phrase here is in your areas.
*  In most areas of science, working physicists do discover new facts about the universe.
*  The facts might not be that profound, right?
*  Like if you have a new material that you made out of atoms in a certain new crystalline
*  configuration and you measure its tensile strength or its electrical conductivity,
*  boom, you've discovered a new fact about the universe, okay?
*  Real physicists and real biologists and chemists, etc., do things like this all the time.
*  That's their job.
*  They discover these new facts about the universe.
*  Now, these facts are not facts about fundamental physics, as we like to call it,
*  or elementary physics if you want to be a little bit more humble about the whole thing.
*  The basic laws of nature, right?
*  The core theory, the standard model of particle physics plus general relativity,
*  that is something that's been in place since the 70s.
*  The only things we've done since then are discover parts of it.
*  We've measured the mass of the Higgs boson,
*  but the Higgs boson idea was invented in the 60s.
*  We measured the cosmological constant, right?
*  The vacuum energy.
*  We thought it was zero, but we discovered it, so we knew that it could be there.
*  It was proposed by Einstein in 1917, but we measured its value.
*  A lot of people thought it would be zero.
*  Likewise, masses of neutrinos are something that sneaked up on us gradually through the 70s,
*  80s, 90s, and now we have some more data about them.
*  But the basic structures that allowed all this to happen
*  have been there since the 70s or earlier.
*  So no, people in my areas do not discover new facts about the universe.
*  To discover a new fact about the fundamental laws of physics is something that, you know,
*  if it goes on like this, soon all the people who have done it will no longer be with us.
*  Steven Weinberg did it, right, as a theoretical physicist.
*  He discovered how to unify electromagnetism with the weak nuclear force,
*  but he passed away recently.
*  So yes, these days in fundamental physics,
*  if you discover a new fact about the universe, you would absolutely win a Nobel Prize.
*  Siddhartha says, it's been a while since I last saw you in a theism versus atheism debate on YouTube.
*  Do you think the ideas and arguments supporting atheistic worldview are so
*  sufficiently widespread today you don't need to anymore?
*  Or did the debate format stop being that interesting and effective?
*  A combination, but I think also I just haven't been invited to any.
*  I don't think there are that many.
*  I don't set up these debates.
*  I have a mixed feeling about public debates.
*  It's not really a way to reach any conclusions, right?
*  When I participate in one of these debates, I'm not trying to win the debate.
*  I'm not trying to score points and come out on top on some judge's ballot,
*  nor am I trying to persuade the person I'm debating,
*  because usually they're very, very, very set in their ways.
*  As to be fair, I'm very set in my ways if I'm actually having a debate about these things.
*  What you want to do is reach the audience.
*  There are people in the audience who have not made up their minds about these questions.
*  So I think that there is a useful purpose to these debates,
*  but it's not finding the truth.
*  It is educating the audience about ideas you already have.
*  Look, I'm busy.
*  I give a lot of talks, things like that.
*  Recently, the talks that I've been invited to give have not been debates.
*  They've just been talks.
*  I have no objection to the idea, but I've said a lot of what I want to say in that format.
*  It would have to be interesting for some reason for me to do it again.
*  Charlie Grover asks a question about the swampland.
*  It's a long question.
*  I'm going to try to make it a little bit shorter, but he says,
*  Kumran Vafa, another prominent string theorist,
*  have recently been working a lot on these swampland conjectures.
*  And so to put it in my own words, the idea of the swampland is
*  we have this idea of low-energy effective field theory.
*  So we have field theories, including the standard model,
*  but also extensions of the standard model.
*  You can include supersymmetry or dark matter, whatever.
*  All of these are low-energy effective field theories.
*  They're not supposed to be theories of everything.
*  They're theories of particle physics and quantum fields of low energies.
*  And there's millions of them, an infinite number you can easily invent.
*  The swampland conjecture says that not all theories of low-energy particle physics
*  that you can invent can be derived or can be made compatible with quantum gravity,
*  and in particular string theories,
*  because they think that quantum gravity is string theory,
*  generally the people who do this.
*  So the swampland language was invented to contrast with the landscape.
*  The string theory landscape is this set of very large numbers,
*  numbers like 10 to the 500 are bandied about, but we don't really know,
*  very large number of possible low-energy theories that you can derive from string theory.
*  And the idea behind the swampland conjecture is, well, if there's a finite number that you can,
*  or even if there's a sort of parameterized,
*  finite dimensional set of theories you can derive from string theory,
*  even there's a whole bunch of other theories you can't.
*  And maybe we can learn something about either string theory or about nature
*  by understanding the difference between these.
*  And I'm putting words in Charlie's mouth, sorry about this,
*  but the question he focuses in on is that of the cosmological constant.
*  It has turned out to be extremely hard within string theory
*  to come up with low-energy effective field theories
*  where the cosmological constant is positive.
*  So remember, string theory starts as a theory of strings,
*  or maybe a theory of membranes or things like that,
*  but in a higher number of space-time dimensions,
*  either 10 or 11, depending on the version,
*  or the limit that you're taking in string theory,
*  but more than four that we live in.
*  So you have to compactify these extra dimensions.
*  And when you compactify the extra dimensions,
*  it affects all the parameters of your low-energy theory,
*  the mass of the electron, the charge, the fine structure constant,
*  and also the vacuum energy.
*  And so far, not only have we not rigorously established
*  the existence of some compactification of the extra dimensions,
*  which leaves the cosmological constant positive,
*  there are general arguments that you can't.
*  Now, these general arguments are not airtight.
*  So there are other people, there are people, I should say,
*  who have claimed to suggest ways you can make compactifications
*  of string theory with a positive cosmological constant.
*  There's a famous paper called KKLT, after the initials of its authors.
*  If I can remember correctly,
*  Kantrou, Kalos, Lindey, and Trevetti.
*  And then many follow-up papers from that,
*  where they proposed that they could do it.
*  They could get a compactification of string theory
*  with a positive cosmological constant.
*  Others don't think it works.
*  They disagree with this paper.
*  Okay, so despite it being theoretical physics,
*  there's room for disagreement there.
*  Okay, so all this is a long warm-up to saying
*  that there are still string theorists who think
*  that string theory is incompatible with the positive vacuum energy.
*  Full stop in the low-energy effective field theory.
*  And you might say, well, then string theory is ruled out
*  because we've measured the acceleration of the universe.
*  And the cosmological constant is positive, but not so fast.
*  There is, of course, the possibility that the acceleration of the universe
*  is not due to the cosmological constant,
*  but due to a dynamical form of dark energy, right?
*  Sometimes the leading candidate would be quintessence,
*  would be a scalar field slowly rolling down a potential.
*  Now, I've written about quintessence.
*  I thought a lot about it back in the day.
*  I was the first one to really emphasize the fact
*  that if you have these quintessence fields,
*  they should couple to other fields.
*  They should couple to the standard model fields
*  and be detectable for that reason.
*  But I also pointed out the loopholes in that argument,
*  how you could construct quintessence fields that were not detectable.
*  But generally, if quintessence were the dark energy,
*  it would have been easy to already have detected it,
*  to already have either measured it directly
*  through couplings to other fields
*  or indirectly through the expansion of the universe.
*  And we haven't yet.
*  So whatever your credence is in quintessence versus cosmological constant,
*  it's lower now than it was 20 years ago
*  when we started playing these games.
*  So the question, Charlie's question is,
*  what about this theoretical argument from string theory,
*  which leaves open the possibility of quintessence
*  but seems to be against the cosmological constant?
*  So I don't take it very seriously, that particular argument, honestly.
*  And I don't know enough about it
*  to really be qualified to take it seriously or not.
*  But my impression is that the game being played
*  of looking at compactifications of string theory
*  is a sufficiently hard game to play
*  that making these very, very general statements
*  about what is not possible is a bit premature.
*  So I'm not at all convinced
*  that string theory really is incompatible
*  with compactifications that give you a positive vacuum energy.
*  So it hasn't changed my credences that much.
*  But look, I'd be delighted if the dark energy were quintessence.
*  In fact, as I previously mentioned very briefly,
*  if it's quintessence that is a pseudoscalar field
*  that could cause cosmological birefringence
*  and I'd be famous because I predicted that.
*  So my vested interests are in favor of it.
*  But I love the idea of the Swamp Land program
*  because it is a real good faith honest attempt
*  to connect string theory to observational
*  and experimental physics.
*  And however you can do that is a good thing.
*  Vladislav Liutka.
*  I hope I got that right.
*  Asks a priority question.
*  What would be your credences that there are horrible
*  inner experiences associated with a person
*  who is having surgery under successfully applied
*  general anesthesia?
*  Assume there are inner experiences
*  associated with conscious people
*  and maybe you mean unconscious people.
*  Oh no, maybe you mean conscious people.
*  You just mean, I assume that inner experiences are real things.
*  And there are no inner experiences
*  associated with dead people without brain activity.
*  I think my credences would be pretty low
*  because we have some data, namely dreaming, right?
*  Dreaming is not exactly the same
*  as being under general anesthesia.
*  But it seems perfectly plausible to say
*  that in the absence of other data,
*  whatever experiences we have when we're not conscious
*  might be very much like, or at least bare family resemblances
*  to the experiences we have when we're dreaming.
*  What I really expect is the general anesthesia,
*  and again, not enough of an expert
*  to have a firm opinion about this,
*  but my feeling would be the general anesthesia
*  puts you under so deeply that you don't have experiences,
*  right?
*  You don't have anything that you would recognize
*  as an experience, just as you don't
*  when you're asleep and not dreaming.
*  You can be asleep and not dreaming, right?
*  So together with the fact that I think
*  there probably are no experiences
*  when you're under general anesthetic,
*  and whatever experiences you do have,
*  I think that's a pretty good thing.
*  And whatever experiences you do have,
*  I'm guessing are more analogous to dreams
*  than to horrible tortures.
*  My credence that there are such horrible inner tortures
*  is pretty small.
*  And I should say, obviously, the potential benefits
*  of surgery to your waking self could be very, very large.
*  So I wouldn't use this as an excuse
*  to not put yourself under general anesthetic
*  for important surgery.
*  Maybe considerations like this
*  make you think twice about elective surgery,
*  but look, as with always with these arguments
*  that seem to be low credence,
*  focusing on low credence possibilities,
*  there's also the possibility you have
*  blissful nirvana experiences under general anesthetic,
*  right?
*  And you'd be depriving yourself of those
*  by not going under.
*  So I'm not quite sure where to balance that out.
*  Alexander Zani says,
*  you've said we have reason to be confident
*  the laws of physics underlying the phenomena
*  of everyday life are completely known,
*  but you and others have written books
*  about a variety of physical phenomena
*  we do not fully understand yet.
*  And so the specific arrangements of the particles
*  in those books is caused by said
*  poorly understood phenomena.
*  So don't we need more physics to fully explain
*  the arrangement of particles
*  in the everyday phenomena of many physics books?
*  Sure, obviously.
*  I've never said that physics is done.
*  I've never said we don't need more physics.
*  What I said is the kind of physics that we need
*  is not of the form laws of physics
*  underlying everyday life
*  at the level of the core theory of quantum field theory.
*  That part of physics is done.
*  The way that those core fields come together
*  to make complicated things like books and people,
*  obviously completely unknown
*  or not completely unknown,
*  but very far from being completely established.
*  And we have a lot of work to do on that.
*  Those two statements are utterly compatible.
*  Aurea Biddle says,
*  in your podcast with Neil Ferguson,
*  he mentioned the fact that it is easy
*  to place all the blame on individual actors
*  for failures to meet demands during a catastrophe.
*  And instead he opted to emphasize the role of networks
*  and how our lack of native vigilance
*  can cause dysfunction.
*  In regards to COVID, however,
*  he seemed to be downplaying the role
*  that one man, Donald Trump, material had
*  in politicizing and therefore swaying
*  the Republican response and messaging around the crisis.
*  Is it not valid to blame the spearhead
*  as a useful shorthand when trying to troubleshoot
*  how best not to repeat these same errors?
*  Well, so I think a couple of things are going on here.
*  I mean, one, Neil is not being inconsistent, right?
*  He's saying we're too tempted to blame individuals.
*  And in this case, he's not blaming an individual.
*  So that's completely consistent.
*  Now, what you're suggesting is maybe there is a sense
*  in which we should be blaming an individual in this case.
*  And regardless of the specific details
*  of this moment in history, I think as a general question,
*  can individuals be blamed for bad responses to catastrophes?
*  I think it's a complicated question
*  because I think that this is in the nature of complex systems.
*  I think that probably I'd be sympathetic
*  to the direction of Neil's critique,
*  namely that we are more likely to blame individuals
*  and less likely to blame systems than we should be.
*  I don't think that that means
*  we should not blame individuals at all, right?
*  The system of which Donald Trump was a part
*  is very complicated and there's a lot of inertia in it
*  and a lot of moving parts.
*  And there's only so much impact that one person can have,
*  even the president of the United States.
*  Having said that, some people have a lot more impact
*  than other people do and powerful politicians
*  and business people, et cetera, have more impact,
*  have more power in this system.
*  And it is 100% okay in my mind to blame them
*  for the responsibility that they deserve to have.
*  So those are all fuzzy words.
*  And there's a quantitative question of how much blame to place.
*  But I am sympathetic with the general idea
*  that too often we personalize the blame
*  because it's much easier emotionally
*  to place blame on a person than it is on institutions and systems.
*  Stuart Haynes says,
*  when I sort your YouTube videos by views,
*  I see that many of the biggest ideas in the universe videos
*  have the most views.
*  Did you think that series would be that successful
*  and which of your videos have been the most surprisingly popular
*  or in the other hand, surprisingly not so popular and why?
*  I mean, basically, my videos on YouTube fall into four categories.
*  One category is the biggest ideas series,
*  which has like, I don't know, 48 videos.
*  One is the Mindscape podcast,
*  which I put on YouTube as a favor to the people of YouTube.
*  And I get like 5,000 views.
*  It's not a lot, but it's exactly the podcast.
*  And there's no video.
*  It's just an image, a static image.
*  And I have no reason, no understanding of why people would rather listen
*  to the audio on YouTube rather than on some podcast app.
*  Even if you're sitting at your desktop,
*  you can listen to the podcast either on preposterousuniverse.com
*  or on Apple Podcasts or whatever.
*  But some people really like YouTube.
*  Okay, that's fine.
*  Then the only other long series of videos I did
*  were the Moving Naturalism Forward Conference videos.
*  I mentioned this workshop we did.
*  And we videoed all that and that's all been edited very nicely by Gia Mora
*  and have been put on the web in bite-size chunks.
*  And finally, like just a couple of miscellaneous videos
*  that are not really worth even mentioning.
*  So I'm not at all surprised that the biggest ideas
*  did much better than the Mindscape videos
*  because look, the Mindscape videos,
*  I don't get any benefit from them.
*  It's just extra work for me.
*  I don't even get paid.
*  Like when someone listens to the video, sorry,
*  listens to the podcast on a podcast app,
*  my podcast host or not host,
*  my podcast network, Wondery, counts that as a download
*  and it charges the advertisers.
*  And so I get a penny or whatever it is
*  for every one of those times that someone listens on a podcast app.
*  I do not get money from the advertisers on YouTube
*  when someone watches on YouTube.
*  I do get money from YouTube ads,
*  but that's like an order of magnitude less.
*  YouTube is not the...
*  You're not doing YouTube for the money at my level.
*  Like once you get millions of hits,
*  then maybe doing YouTube videos is worth your while.
*  But for 5,000 hits, it's really not...
*  You're not buying an ice cream cone for that,
*  much less quitting your job.
*  So I just do it because I know that people like doing it on YouTube
*  and I want the podcast to reach as many people as possible.
*  That's why I do it.
*  But I wouldn't watch Mindscape.
*  I wouldn't do Mindscape on YouTube.
*  I would do it on a podcast app.
*  So I'm not at all surprised that the Biggest Ideas videos,
*  which were meant to be seen on YouTube and have visuals,
*  do much better than the Mindscape videos.
*  I do wish that the Moving Naturalism Forward videos had done better.
*  They did very badly in terms of numbers.
*  And I'm not sure why.
*  We had famous people there saying interesting things
*  and the videos themselves were, I think, very nicely done.
*  Hired a professional videographer and so forth.
*  So I think there's a lot of treasures in there
*  that hadn't been appreciated by the wider folks.
*  Well, I think it's ultimately completely compatible.
*  Chip Stevens and I wrote a couple of papers
*  on probability in many worlds using self-locating uncertainty.
*  And we emphasized from the start that we weren't doing it
*  because we thought that other people's explanations were wrong.
*  If there's one true fact, it's very often the case
*  you could explain that true fact in different ways,
*  using different words, but still be a true explanation in some sense.
*  Having said that, they feel very different.
*  And the reason why I like ours is because it's sort of
*  not just gives you the right answer, but in my mind,
*  it gives you a better feeling for why there is probability at all.
*  In some sense, you couldn't possibly get the wrong answer.
*  If you put in a good faith effort to understand probability in many worlds,
*  the only thing you're ever going to get out is the Born Rule.
*  It's just the only thing that makes sense over, you know,
*  consistently over time and things like that.
*  And all the probabilities add to one, etc.
*  You're going to get the Born Rule.
*  The real question is why you have probability at all.
*  And the approach that David Wallace has that was based on ideas by David Deutsch
*  is very, very instrumentalist in some sense.
*  The idea is, look, here we are in quantum mechanics.
*  In fact, Deutsch's original paper doesn't even really necessarily need many worlds.
*  He just needs quantum mechanics.
*  And he says if there were, basically, sorry, I don't want to go into it.
*  It's getting late.
*  I don't want to go into too many details here.
*  But his idea is that if there are outcomes for quantum mechanical measurements
*  that you value differently, you'd be happy if the spin was up,
*  less happy if the spin was down, then what you could show is that using decision theory,
*  which says that, you know, among other among other assumptions of decision theory,
*  if you play games with probabilities, you should be just as happy
*  with playing a game that gives you 100% probability of giving you value one
*  as you should be with playing a game that gives you 50% probability of value zero
*  and 50% probability of value two.
*  Now, you might say, well, no, I'm risk averse.
*  I like getting the one with 100% probability rather than the 50% probability of getting two.
*  But that's because you're not really appreciating the word value here.
*  Value doesn't mean money.
*  Value literally means that you value two,
*  the meaning of the phrase value two in decision theory is you give 50% chance of value two
*  equal value as 100% chance of value one.
*  That's what it means.
*  Okay.
*  And what Deutsch argues and what David Wallace follows up to fill in some of the details
*  and make it a little bit more rigorous is that given that there are probabilistic outcomes
*  in quantum mechanics, decision theory tells us that we should act as if
*  the probability of getting different outcomes obeys the Born rule.
*  Okay.
*  So that's great.
*  I mean, that's absolutely 100% compatible with how I think about decision theory
*  and quantum mechanics and many worlds.
*  We should act as if there is really a truly stochastic process
*  with a probability given by the Born rule.
*  Okay.
*  But it doesn't really scratch the itch of saying,
*  I want to know why there's probabilities at all.
*  And Chip and I following on ideas from Lev Weidman,
*  pinpoint where the necessity of probability is,
*  namely in the self-locating uncertainty that you don't know which branch you're on.
*  And all the words we use and all the metaphysical moves we use
*  sound very different than the Deutsch and Wallace construction,
*  but they get the same answers.
*  So they're compatible, but I think that ours is a little bit more satisfying
*  at explaining why you should think about the world and probabilities at all.
*  Theirs is extremely, extremely good at saying,
*  if you do think about many worlds in terms of probabilities,
*  it had better be the Born rule.
*  Brad Malt says, in something deeply hidden,
*  you present a Socratic dialogue between Alice and her father
*  in which they debate whether the number of worlds is finite or infinite
*  and conclude the answer is not known.
*  Can you explain how the answer could be anything other than infinite?
*  For example, the probability distribution associated with many wave functions
*  is a continuous curve like the position of two electrons.
*  Since an infinite number of points can fit on a continuous curve
*  when the wave function collapses, an infinite number of worlds must be created.
*  So yeah, but you've assumed a model of electrons.
*  Namely, you've assumed that the electron can be classically described
*  as a point particle moving in a continuum.
*  And that might not be true.
*  Indeed, in quantum gravity, it wouldn't be true.
*  In quantum gravity, if what we said before about the dimensionality of Hilbert space is correct,
*  the treating fields and particles as living in a continuum
*  is just a good approximation valid at low energies.
*  It's not exactly true.
*  Consider that when you actually measure the position of an electron,
*  you don't do so with infinite precision.
*  A real measuring apparatus has some error bars,
*  has some precision associated with it.
*  And of course, we can imagine that precision getting better and better.
*  But when it gets down to quantum gravity scales,
*  maybe the whole idea of doing that measurement just breaks down and isn't good anymore.
*  So you're right.
*  What you're putting your finger on is the idea that if the model of an electron
*  classically starting as a point particle on a continuum and then quantizing that,
*  that would give you an infinite dimensional Hilbert space,
*  and the number of worlds could be infinite.
*  But nature might not be like that because nature has gravity in it.
*  So we just don't know is the correct answer right now.
*  DMI says, if regions across which a function can be analytically continued,
*  all contain the same information about the function.
*  And if quantum fields have analytic properties,
*  and if unitary information is contained in quantum fields,
*  then how can a black hole in one region cause the information in different regions
*  outside the event horizon to be paradoxically destroyed?
*  I don't think the quantum fields have analytic properties.
*  There's no reason for them to.
*  I mean, it may be that in some particular state,
*  quantum fields have analytic properties, but in an arbitrary state, they don't.
*  So for those of you who don't know, in functional analysis,
*  in differential equations and subset differential equations
*  that thinks about the properties of functions,
*  there is a very, very, very special kind of function called an analytic function.
*  And analytic functions have the properties that in some small region,
*  you know, between X equals 10 and 11,
*  I give you exactly what the function does between X equals 10 and X equals 11.
*  And the analyticity is a property of functions that they may or may not have,
*  such that if they have it, then the data of what the function is doing
*  between X equals 10 and X equals 11 is sufficient to tell you what X is doing,
*  what the function is doing at X equals 12 or 13 or 14 or minus 12
*  or a billion or anything else, everywhere else.
*  So analytic functions are very, very, very, very special functions.
*  Most functions, if I just tell you what the function does between 10 and 11,
*  it doesn't tell you anything about what the function does anywhere else.
*  So often in physics, in special circumstances like the vacuum of a quantum field theory,
*  it's nice to imagine that our functions are analytic.
*  It tells us something about what they're doing all over the place.
*  But the whole point of the black hole information problem is that we're not in the vacuum.
*  We have a black hole. We've dumped some information into it.
*  And once that happens, there's no reason to think that the behavior of a function
*  in one region of space tells you what the function is doing elsewhere.
*  So I don't think that there's any relevance to the black hole information puzzle.
*  Maxwell's Demon asks a priority question.
*  Is there a path into physics higher education for someone who self-studies
*  despite getting an undergrad degree in a different subject?
*  To clarify, this question is more about the actual path to higher ed,
*  assuming I'm able to attain proficiency.
*  But if you have tips on learning, that would be great also.
*  Right. So I should have grouped this with the previous question,
*  but that was mostly about learning.
*  This is about the path to higher ed.
*  So let's remember the typical path for an academic physicist.
*  You get an undergraduate degree.
*  You get a graduate degree.
*  You get a postdoctoral research position.
*  And then you get a faculty job.
*  And ultimately, you get tenure.
*  And then you get elected to the National Academy and win the Nobel Prize.
*  Who knows what will happen after those.
*  But those are the typical career steps.
*  So in principle, you can get in at any level.
*  Right. In principle, it becomes harder and harder to get in the higher the levels are
*  because there's just very few resources.
*  There are few faculty jobs.
*  Fewer faculty jobs than there are undergraduate student positions.
*  Right. So if you get an undergraduate degree in a different study,
*  in a different field than physics, but then study physics,
*  it's possible to get into grad school.
*  You just need to convince some department that they should admit you.
*  And that actually often happens, believe it or not.
*  Departments are kind of morbidly curious about people with different backgrounds.
*  And they might be skeptical at first, but if you can convince them
*  that you would do well in grad school, then they would often be happy to take a chance.
*  Remember, you can apply to 50 grad schools and you only need one to take you.
*  How do you demonstrate that proficiency?
*  The simplest way is to really get a killer score on the physics GREs.
*  Right. That's one simple way.
*  But maybe there are other ways, letters of recommendation or something like that,
*  that you could do it.
*  If you didn't, if you thought that you were already advanced enough to be at the equivalent
*  of already having a PhD and instead you were not applying to grad schools,
*  but wanted to apply for jobs, for postdoc jobs or for faculty jobs,
*  very often into postdoc job ads, there is a requirement that you have a PhD.
*  And they're not trying to be gatekeepers, keeping out, you know,
*  rogue physicists who've taught themselves.
*  They just don't want people who are, you know, undergrads to skip the PhD step.
*  Right. They want people to get that training.
*  But I can imagine you could convince someone to hire you as a postdoc if you didn't have a PhD.
*  And the way to do it is write really good physics papers, get them published.
*  If you write a really good physics paper, submit them to the physical review,
*  they will, if it's a sensible paper, they will get a refereed and publish it.
*  And if you have a track record of publishing good papers,
*  then people will be interested in hiring you.
*  I mean, in math, this actually happens.
*  Right. In math, there are stories of people who are completely untrained,
*  but are just geniuses and do great things.
*  And then everyone wants to hire them.
*  It's easier said than done.
*  It's very, very hard to do because, you know,
*  because the training that you get in school is not just in the subject matter,
*  but all that informal folk wisdom that you soak up from being in the environment
*  and having an advisor and talking to students
*  and doing collaborative research and things like that.
*  So it's hard, but it's not impossible.
*  Vincent Ohm says, is there a non-physical aspect to information?
*  Suppose we have two book pages.
*  One contains the theory of everything in a language we do not understand.
*  And the other contains the recipe for an apple pie in English.
*  Does the latter have a higher information content
*  just because we can read and understand it?
*  Well, you know, guess what?
*  It's going to depend on your definition of the word information.
*  And that definition, I know you should say yes,
*  but I can look it up in a dictionary or so forth.
*  But we use words like information differently in different contexts.
*  So one definition of information is a correlation
*  between one physical configuration and another one.
*  So if I have a photograph, that photograph contains information
*  because there is a strong correlation between the image in that photograph
*  and the image of the thing I took a picture of.
*  And there's no interpretive step involved in something like that.
*  It's just a true fact.
*  And I can absolutely say that's information.
*  Even if there was no one looking at the picture,
*  whoever would look at the picture, the information is still there.
*  So therefore, in that sense, if I had an untranslatable manuscript,
*  if it really does say something correct about the real world,
*  it contains information.
*  Absolutely.
*  Now, that information might be inaccessible to us.
*  There might be another notion of information,
*  which is something like the accessible information, right?
*  The usable information.
*  And that might be much, much less.
*  So if you take a book and burn it, as we previously talked about in the podcast,
*  at the level of fundamental physics, information is conserved.
*  The positions of all the atoms, the molecules in the book,
*  which contained information, is in principle still there after you burned it.
*  But in practice, you're not getting it back.
*  So in practice, you burned that information.
*  You destroyed it.
*  So in that sense, that's the sense in which having a text
*  in a language that you can't translate,
*  you might as well not have any information that's accessible at all.
*  Okay, I'm going to group two questions together.
*  Anonymous says, Alice is a character in a fantasy world,
*  and she can do magic.
*  She's helping Bob, a farmer, by using her magic
*  to teleport his cows across a river.
*  Alice knows two kinds of teleport spell.
*  The first kind of spell works like a Star Trek transporter.
*  She destroys the cow and creates an exact copy of the other side of the river.
*  The second type of spell targets the fabric of space time
*  and temporarily connects the cow's location via a wormhole, I suppose,
*  with the new location on the other side of the river.
*  Though Alice can perform impossible feats,
*  her magic still follows rules and comes with limitations,
*  and she wants to be as efficient as possible.
*  If the complexity and difficulty of her spell is proportional
*  to the complexity and difficulty of the change she's trying to make in reality,
*  which spell is easier and uses less energy?
*  You can assume spherical cows.
*  Thank you for letting me assume spherical cows.
*  That's very helpful.
*  And then Matt Hickman says,
*  if I take a Star Trek transporter from location A to B,
*  did I die at location A and a new being get created by B,
*  at B with my memories?
*  And does your answer vary depending on transporter implementation?
*  That's why I grouped these two together.
*  So first to Matt's, actually, I should probably group Matt's together
*  with the previous question about the self in many worlds,
*  now that I think about it, but I don't think you died.
*  I mean, the question is, so let's back up.
*  If you take a teleporter machine, transporter machine,
*  so you disappear at one location and you're reassembled at another one, okay?
*  One attitude would be,
*  there is some essence to yourself that is physically attached to your body.
*  And that essence ceases to be attached to your body
*  when you transport and therefore you die.
*  And the thing that is assembled at the other location
*  is something that looks like you, talks like you, has all your memories,
*  but it doesn't have that essence so it's not you.
*  As you might guess, this is not my view.
*  I don't think there are any such essences.
*  I think that the world is the stuff in it and what the stuff is doing.
*  So to me, the fact that I disappeared here and appeared somewhere else
*  because of the transporter machine,
*  it doesn't affect any of the reasons why I would conventionally think of
*  my future self as part of the same person as my past self, right?
*  Technically, they're different cells,
*  but I don't think that I'm dying at literally every moment
*  until then a new person is coming into existence.
*  I attach some continuity to them.
*  And all the reasons why I might attach that continuity to them
*  work just as well in the transporter case.
*  If you have a duplicator machine, it's trickier.
*  But I think in the transporter machine, I don't think of yourself as dying.
*  So to Anonymous's question, it's an interesting question.
*  Of course, there's no right answer to this because it's a fantasy question.
*  You've already violated the rules of physics to have this transporter machine and wormhole,
*  at least the rules of physics as we understand them and magic, etc., etc.
*  But, you know, okay, let's play the game by the postulates that were being given here
*  and think about it in its own terms.
*  So I would say my guess, my inclination, my first thought is that the wormhole answer
*  versus the transporter answer, the wormhole answer is easier.
*  The wormhole procedure is more efficient than the transporter machine.
*  So and here's why, because in some sense, it is using
*  the existing laws of physics to help it along.
*  I mean, forget about the transporter, forget about the other side of the river, right?
*  In some sense, here I am now and here I am a second later, right?
*  My body, all of its atoms, etc.
*  exist and are related to each other.
*  The configuration of all those atoms and all the organs in my body at one moment of time
*  is related, but not the same as the configuration of all that stuff one second later,
*  especially if I'm moving and talking and things like that, okay?
*  But it didn't take any effort for me to be in almost the same configuration one second later.
*  It just happened because the laws of physics did it.
*  And I think that if you go to the effort of building a wormhole or a bridge through space time,
*  then the sort of nuanced effort of moving each individual atom and molecule in the body of the
*  cow is done by the laws of physics.
*  It goes along for the ride.
*  Whereas if you need a transporter machine, well, you know, you haven't told me the technology
*  behind your transporter machine, but somehow I have the feeling that you're sending the cow
*  molecule by molecule.
*  You're not letting the laws of physics move the positions and velocities of all the parts of the
*  cow.
*  You have to do it by hand in some sense.
*  So that seems a lot less efficient to me, but to be honest, I am much less clear on what the
*  technology of the transporter machine would be than I am on the technology of the wormhole.
*  Okay, Bill Hughes asks a priority question.
*  In something deeply hidden, you've said that many worlds doesn't violate conservation of energy
*  because each of the child branches is thinner because their amplitude is less.
*  I've also heard you say that the low probability branches count for less.
*  What real world effect does being in a branch with less amplitude have?
*  What real thing is amplitude measuring?
*  It's not probability because all the branches do exist, nor the likelihood of being on a branch
*  because you are on all of them.
*  So the answer is it's the likelihood of being on a branch.
*  That's the real world effect of the amplitude.
*  And I know you just said it can't be that because you are on all of them, but you're not on all of
*  them.
*  Different people are on all of them.
*  That's the point.
*  I mean, if you don't accept that, that's fine, but then you're just not going to accept many
*  worlds at all.
*  And you should develop some metaphysical objections to it.
*  But what the many worlds person says is that once the branching happens and you have different
*  worlds, the different people on those different worlds are different people.
*  They're not you on all of them.
*  So there is a question after the branching happens.
*  If I exist after the branching and I know that I'm on one branch, but not the others,
*  which one am I on?
*  And I assign a probability and that probability is given by the amplitude squared.
*  That's the relevance of the amplitude.
*  Russell Wolf says, what is your opinion on the use of the word energy in a psychological
*  context?
*  Like when we talk about extroverts gaining energy from social interactions while introverts are
*  drained of energy and need to recharge.
*  Is there a meaningful physical definition of energy that matches this colloquial colloquial
*  use of the word?
*  I'm completely fine with that use of energy.
*  Look, you know, I take yoga classes or I haven't in a long time, but I am all in favor of taking
*  yoga classes where the instructors often use all sorts of crazy words to describe what
*  is going on.
*  I don't care.
*  Who cares?
*  It's a metaphor, right?
*  It's a poetic way of talking about things.
*  So the question is, is this use of the word?
*  The question in my mind would be, is the metaphorical purpose being served by using the word energy in
*  this context?
*  And I think the answer is absolutely yes.
*  I mean, we get it when someone says they're high energy, they're low energy, they gain
*  energy, they lose energy.
*  Everyone knows what that means.
*  And it doesn't correspond to anything, any physical stuff going into their bodies or
*  anything like that.
*  It has to do instead with intricate questions about their physiological state that are generally
*  going to be very, very complex.
*  OK, but I have no objections to that whatsoever.
*  As long as it's clear, I'm all in favor of it.
*  Julie Mars says, can you recommend a popular science book that explores the phenomena
*  associated with phase transitions across many different disciplines?
*  I've already read Complexity by Michael Waldrop that wasn't thrilled with it.
*  No, I can't really recommend that.
*  I mean, there is there's the book by Malcolm Gladwell, The Tipping Point, right, where he
*  tries to use notions that are kind of phase transition-y to describe some social dynamics.
*  And, you know, there's some things that are true that are said in that book, but it's
*  not going to give you insight into the physics phenomena nor how the physics phenomena can be
*  used in broader context.
*  I say this with regret wistfully because Jennifer Willett, my wife, for a while was planning to
*  write such a book.
*  But alas, in the real world, if you want to put a year or so of your life into the effort
*  of writing a book, someone better buy it.
*  And the booksellers of the world were not convinced that anyone would buy a book on
*  phase transitions.
*  So I don't know.
*  I mean, there could be one out there that I don't know about.
*  Happy to take suggestions in the comments.
*  Igor Kopilov says, you've mentioned that you're writing a quantum mechanics textbook.
*  How do you balance doing something new with covering all the standard things that every
*  QM textbook has to cover?
*  Do you reach out to colleagues who teach QM courses to get their input or are you just
*  following your own vision?
*  Mostly following my own vision, but I'm certainly looking at other people's books.
*  I'm not talking to a lot of people.
*  I guess I talked to a few people who have taught quantum mechanics, but there's a standard
*  curriculum.
*  You know, I'm not going to be surprised by talking to people who have taught it.
*  You know, they they use the same textbooks, et cetera, et cetera.
*  And mostly I do want to cover the standard stuff.
*  You know, I'm not trying to revolutionize the teaching of quantum mechanics, but I do
*  want to nudge it in a productive direction.
*  So I think that there are ways in which I think they're pretty clear ways in which the
*  current way that we teach quantum mechanics falls short.
*  And I don't mean they're not teaching many worlds.
*  I don't even mean they're not teaching the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  I do think they should say true things about the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  They should be correct when talking about the measurement problem or Bell's inequality
*  or things like that.
*  And they are often not.
*  Okay, so I think I can try to get that better.
*  But more importantly, very often quantum textbooks are just excuses to solve the Schrodinger
*  equation over and over and over again, most often for single particle systems.
*  And the notion that particles can be entangled is mentioned and then slid by.
*  Right.
*  So that's terrible.
*  That that to me is just doing a disservice to what makes quantum mechanics quantum mechanics.
*  So I think that without getting philosophical or anything like that about it, I definitely
*  want to do a lot more than the typical quantum mechanics books does to explain both the
*  phenomenon of entanglement and the technical apparatus that goes along with thinking about
*  it, decoherence and density matrices and things like that.
*  And this is not just because I think it's interesting and true, although there's that,
*  it's also relevant to how we use quantum mechanics in the modern world, whether we are grown up
*  professors that are now doing research in quantum mechanics or whether you go into industry to
*  build a quantum computer.
*  Quantum computers rely on entanglement, and it turns out that it's not that hard and enormous
*  fun to teach people the basics of quantum information and quantum computing.
*  That's 100% appropriate for an intro quantum course.
*  So ideally, if it all works out, there will be stuff like that in my quantum textbook,
*  but it will be optional.
*  Entanglement will be there, non-optional, but then you can choose to still, you know,
*  spend a lot of time doing Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and additions of spins and
*  time-dependent perturbation theory, if that's what gets your juices flowing,
*  or you can do quantum information and quantum computing if that's what gets your juices flowing.
*  That's the goal.
*  We'll see if it all pans out.
*  Gregory Kusnyk says, in last month's AMA, you argued that since events at the scale of human
*  affairs are effectively classical and deterministic, we should expect histories that diverge radically
*  from our own, like the Nazis won World War II, to have very low probability.
*  I don't see how this follows.
*  It seems to me there's ample scope for quantum uncertainties and things like genetic recombination
*  and the random activation of oncogenes to have profound effects on who gets born and who dies
*  early.
*  This would lead me to expect a diverse array of very different histories, all with roughly
*  equal measure.
*  So I think that's a fair point here, but there is a footnote that is crucial, which is
*  when you're thinking about the wave function branching.
*  So as you think about branchings of the wave function that go earlier and earlier in time,
*  then you can have a tiny fluctuation, a tiny difference at very early times, lead to an
*  enormous difference in the present era.
*  Just for the most dramatic example, if you believe in inflationary cosmology, then literally
*  the fluctuations that led to galaxies forming are quantum measurement outcomes that would
*  be very different in different branches of the wave function.
*  So the Earth and our galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, wouldn't exist in a large number of
*  other branches of the wave function.
*  That's certainly very different.
*  Okay.
*  What I was thinking, what I was implicitly assuming, which I shouldn't have implicitly
*  done, I could have done it and said it out loud, was that there were, we were talking
*  about branchings that were relatively recent.
*  So I'm not even talking about who is born and who dies.
*  I was talking about the actions taken by the leadership of the countries during the 1930s
*  and 1940s.
*  I think there the room for large variations is much smaller.
*  It can happen, but I think the probability is much lower.
*  But sure, if you are including branches that branched off a long, long time ago, even if
*  you go back thousands or millions of years, so the genetic histories could be very different,
*  then yes, you could get histories now that look quite different.
*  Johan Lüfgren says, I enjoyed your recent paper, the quantum field theory on which the
*  everyday world supervenes, and I find myself largely in agreement.
*  But I'm worried that the issue of naturalness is being swept under the rug.
*  From effective field theory principles, we expect the standard model Higgs mass and cosmological
*  constant to be much larger than what we have measured.
*  When we are considering the completeness of the core theory, should it not give us pause
*  that the standard Wilsonian effective field theory principles do not seem to lead us right
*  here?
*  Sure.
*  So what's going on here is I made an argument in this paper that on the basis of what we
*  think we understand about effective field theories, we have very good reason to believe
*  that any variations of the core theory, the standard model particle physics plus general
*  relativity, would be irrelevant to everyday life things.
*  In particular, things that go on in a brain or a biological organism.
*  And crossing symmetry and other features of quantum field theory is a very important
*  argument, but so are the idea that the dynamics of the fields we already know about is pretty
*  well understood.
*  So there is a weaker argument that I made that still works.
*  You know, even if you don't believe the rules of not the rules, but the expectations of
*  effective field theory, those expectations tell us that there could be new interactions.
*  Well, we call irrelevant or higher dimensional operators in the quantum field theory.
*  But the sizes of those interactions are very, very small.
*  That is a prediction of effective field theory.
*  I keep saying prediction and expectation.
*  It's not a strong prediction.
*  It's just we expect in a reasonable non-finely tuned theory that these extra interactions
*  are very small.
*  So two things to say about that.
*  One is we could be wrong.
*  And what Johan is bringing up is there's two famous examples where we are wrong, the Higgs
*  mass and the cosmological constant.
*  Now, they're both special.
*  Those two quantities are both special in effective field theory as relevant operators that
*  they're only two relevant operators that we can write down.
*  And so it turns out that in the core theory, there are two relevant operators and our field
*  theory, our effective field theory expectations for them are wrong in both cases.
*  But that doesn't mean that we're wrong about marginal operators or irrelevant operators.
*  So there's no immediate worry, but it does remind you that these are just expectations
*  and you can be wrong about them.
*  OK, so to that extent, this is a perfectly good issue that Johan raises.
*  However, it doesn't really help you because even if you were very skeptical about that
*  particular expectation of effective field theory, what could you get by violating the
*  expectation of effective field theory?
*  Well, we've already measured the coefficients of the parts of the standard model we know,
*  right?
*  The masses and the kinetic energies of the ordinary particles and fields.
*  The only room for changing the dynamics of the known fields is in their higher order
*  interactions.
*  Right?
*  How an electron interacts with two photons at once or something like that.
*  And the point is that even if that interaction was much larger than we expected, who cares?
*  It's not going to affect everyday life in any interesting way, right?
*  In order to have this kind of effect, we either need truly new fields that are pushing around
*  the fields of the standard model in some non-obvious way, or we need something dramatically
*  in violation of effective field theory principles, like a violation of locality.
*  That's really what people want.
*  The people who want to change the laws of physics in order to have an impact on consciousness,
*  they don't care about higher order operators.
*  What they care about is that electrons interact with the energy of the system.
*  What they care about is that electrons in the context of a human brain behave differently
*  than the same electron would behave in the context of a rock.
*  And that's not just a matter of the expectations of higher order normalizable operators being
*  off.
*  That's just a total violation of everything we know and love about field theory.
*  So I'm not worried about that loophole actually being exploited in nature.
*  Or is it just one of those things that is what it is?
*  So yeah, there's absolutely a philosophy to mathematics.
*  You might remember that I did a podcast where we talk about it with Justin Clark Doane.
*  We talked about the philosophy of mathematics and morality and their relationship to each other,
*  but a lot of it was just the philosophy of mathematics.
*  You very quickly get into questions about mathematics, like can things be true even
*  if you haven't proven them?
*  What does it mean to be consistent?
*  What kinds of trans-finite numbers are there?
*  Are mathematical objects real in some platonic sense or are they just conventional?
*  Are they just names?
*  There's a whole bunch of good questions in the philosophy of math.
*  So yeah, Google it.
*  It's out there.
*  Brendan says, you've mentioned before that you've done casual research on information
*  theory and I was curious as to what about that field interests you.
*  I tried doing some research on the topic and noticed that entropy plays a big role
*  in information theory, but I don't quite understand why that is.
*  Any insight into this would be great.
*  Yeah, I've written a couple papers that I wouldn't call them papers on information theory,
*  but they're papers where information theory played a crucial role.
*  Most obviously in my papers on emergent space time with Charles Tsao and Spiros Mikolakis,
*  we used mutual information between quantum mutual information between degrees of freedom
*  to define an immersion metric on space time.
*  So that's a pretty kind of trivial, once you know what mutual information is,
*  it's not really using the heavy machinery of information theory.
*  More interesting in that context was a paper I wrote with Stefan Leichenauer and Jason Pollock
*  and Tony Bartolotta on the Bayesian second law of thermodynamics.
*  I still think that this paper is more important than people give it credit for because
*  it's the kind of thing I like to do.
*  It answers this question of principle that many people weren't worried about,
*  but I think they should have been worried about.
*  Namely, how do you deal with the fact that on the one hand you say entropy increases,
*  on the second hand you say that entropy is a measure of our ignorance,
*  and on the third hand you learn things as you look at the world.
*  Actually, Cosma Shalizi pointed this out and wrote a whole paper about it how
*  in some weird sense a good Bayesian sees a reversed arrow of time,
*  because you just learn more and more about the world and therefore the entropy of the world
*  goes down.
*  Now of course that's using a very specific epistemic notion of entropy,
*  which is different than the thermodynamic notion that we usually mean in cosmology,
*  so it's not actually a conflict with anything that we know,
*  but it's an interesting question.
*  How do you reconcile those?
*  So the Bayesian second law, which is something that we derived,
*  answered the question if you take the ordinary second law of thermodynamics
*  and include in it the fact that you can measure systems and therefore learn about them,
*  is there some notion of something going up, some measure, some quantity like entropy
*  that increases even though you're doing measurements.
*  And we found yes, and we derived a rule,
*  and it has to do with the relative entropy of different distributions,
*  and all that is very, very information theoretic.
*  So that was a lot of fun.
*  We didn't really give a killer app for that,
*  so the reason why it hasn't gotten a lot of attention is what are you going to do with it?
*  Right?
*  I mean to get other people interested in it, you need to be able to say,
*  okay, you can use this new equation, this new theorem that you derived
*  to do some experiment or build something or something like that.
*  And that we didn't quite do.
*  We have had and have ambitions to do it,
*  but until we do that, I can't really blame the rest of the world for not getting too excited.
*  Frank Layman says, is there a long-standing problem in science, mathematics, or philosophy
*  that your colleagues treat as a huge, very difficult deal,
*  but that you don't think is particularly serious or important?
*  And conversely, is there a problem you think of is the utmost importance
*  where the consensus is that it's solved or unimportant or maybe even not recognized as a problem?
*  So yeah, you know, I mean, the latter is much more true.
*  Like generally speaking, I'm trying to think, but I think that most
*  problems that the scientific establishment thinks are really, really interesting,
*  maybe I don't think that they're really, really interesting, but I generally get it.
*  I generally think that, you know, there is interest in doing that.
*  Okay. I, you know, after reading your question, I tried to think of a really killer example
*  of something everyone else cared about and I don't, but I couldn't think of one.
*  But there are certainly things that no one else cares about or very few people care about that I do.
*  You know, the big question, obvious answer is just the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  Generally, and for that matter, the foundations of statistical mechanics and probability and
*  cosmology and all these other things, you know, I know it's been a long time, you know, these days,
*  since my most recent book is on quantum mechanics, I'm known as the many worlds guy.
*  But 10 years ago, I was known as the arrow of time guy, because my first book from eternity to
*  here was all about cosmology and the arrow of time.
*  My interest in that has not gone away.
*  And I still think that the fact that the early universe had a low entropy is really, really,
*  really important to understand.
*  And my cosmology buddies don't always go along with that.
*  So what can I tell you?
*  I have lots of questions, lots of lots of issues along those lines.
*  Keith says, I was recently re-listening to the James Ladyman episode on structural realism,
*  and I found myself wondering about your current thoughts on the topic that you might share with
*  about your current thoughts on the topic that you might share more about.
*  IE is either epistemic or ontic structural realism, something you find
*  con- congruous with your positions on the ontological status of things like the wave
*  function and Hilbert space.
*  So for those of you who don't remember the episode with James Ladyman, James is one of
*  the leading proponents of this view called structural realism.
*  And it goes in these epistemic and ontic varieties.
*  So what does that mean?
*  It means that the way I think about it, and I've talked with James and I've read things
*  that he's written and things that other people have written, and we had the podcast episode,
*  but it's still a little subtle.
*  And so I don't want to claim that my version of it is the consensus version of it.
*  Not that I'm trying to be contrarian, but that my understanding might not quite be there yet.
*  So let me say the way I understand it.
*  Thomas Kuhn famously emphasized the fact that when we have a scientific revolution,
*  it's not just that we improve the old theory.
*  We very often throw away the old theory, that we throw away the ontology of the old theory
*  and replace it with something completely different.
*  Quantum mechanics is an obvious example to that, but also something like relativity,
*  right?
*  In relativity, pre-relativity, we had space and time as two separate things, and now we
*  have space-time.
*  It's like a completely different thing, especially in general relativity, where gravity is not
*  a force propagating on top of space-time, but a feature of space-time, a feature of the curvature
*  of space-time.
*  So in Kuhn's view, that revolutionary science is really throwing away the old paradigm and
*  replacing it with something new.
*  What the structural realists are trying to emphasize is that you're not throwing away
*  everything.
*  Maybe you are throwing away the ontology.
*  Maybe you are throwing away your idea of what you're doing, and you're not throwing away
*  your idea of what is the fundamental stuff of the universe, right?
*  In classical mechanics, your fundamental stuff is some particles or some fields, and they
*  move through space-time and obey equations.
*  In quantum mechanics, your fundamental stuff is a wave function, which is an entirely different
*  kind of thing.
*  But there is some similarity.
*  If quantum mechanics is going to be successful, at the end of the day, it better predict that
*  the Earth goes around the sun.
*  If general relativity is going to be successful, it had better predict the same thing.
*  The phenomenon of the Earth going around the sun is independent of your idea of the underlying
*  ontology, whether it's four-dimensional space-time or Newtonian space-time, classical
*  mechanics, quantum mechanics, or whatever.
*  The structural realists say that the thing that is real are the things that are preserved
*  through these transitions from one theory to another.
*  And they talk about it in terms of the structure of what relates to what.
*  And you could say it's a way of mapping your fundamental theoretical formalism to your
*  experience, to your observations, to your informal view of the world.
*  When we say the Earth goes around the sun, what we mean is there's some observations
*  of where the sun is in the sky and where the other planets are, and they are most easily
*  explained by thinking of the Earth going around the sun and rotating around its axis.
*  So it's those relationships between different pieces of the world and the relationships
*  between our observations and the formalism that are preserved and improved over time,
*  not thrown away entirely and replaced with something else.
*  So there are reasons why there's an epistemic version of this and an ontic version of this.
*  The epistemic version is the one I think I understand and agree with, which is that this
*  whole picture where we throw away ontologies and replace them with better ones but keep
*  some structures along the way is a statement about our knowledge.
*  It's a statement about what we human beings are doing.
*  There's something true about the world and we're learning more and more about it.
*  And what we're learning more and more about is not just putting more ingredients into our ontology,
*  but it may be a completely new ontology that explains the structure a little bit better.
*  That would be epistemic structural realism.
*  Ontic structural realism is, I think if I understand it, again, not promising you anything there,
*  is a bit more dramatic, trying to be the claim that these structures are what really exist.
*  That's what ontic means, really existing.
*  It's not just that we know these structures, we learn about them.
*  But regardless of our knowledge, it's the structures that exist.
*  I don't know what to make of that.
*  I don't know what that would mean.
*  How does a relationship between things exist if the things don't exist?
*  That's my worry about ontic structural realism.
*  But epistemic structural realism, I think that James and other people have convinced me,
*  is a good way to go.
*  But I haven't reached conclusions about these things.
*  Once again, I keep saying this over and over again during this podcast.
*  That's okay.
*  Living at the boundaries of our knowledge is a fun place to hang out.
*  Kathy Seeger says, a book that is thrown into the fire.
*  A physicist would say that information is conserved because in principle,
*  it can be reconstructed.
*  To reconstruct it would be needed to hypothetically keep track of the microscopic degrees of freedom
*  of the system and then reverse everything back in time to deduce the initial state of the book
*  from the final state of the smoke and ashes.
*  And also the radiation.
*  Don't forget the radiation.
*  But how could that work out when macroscopic systems, or in fact the universe as a whole,
*  is asymmetric under time reversal?
*  And during that hypothetical reconstruction process,
*  going from higher back to lower entropy, aren't there more possibilities for the
*  microstates on the higher entropy side of things to evolve back to?
*  So I think there's two separate things going on here.
*  One is the macro-micro distinction.
*  So, you know, whenever people talk about these thought experiments,
*  they don't mean you're ever going to do it, or even you should ever think about trying
*  to imagine doing it.
*  In fact, here's why you couldn't do it.
*  Because you say, let's capture all the information contained in the smoke and ashes
*  and the radiation.
*  Well, you can't, because in quantum mechanics, when you measure the position of a photon,
*  for example, you change it, right?
*  You collapse its wave function.
*  So you can not actually know by doing measurements what the state of the photon was before you
*  measured it, which is what you would need to have in order to reconstruct the book.
*  So we're not ever talking about actually anything, something that could be done by people,
*  even super duper people.
*  It's just impossible to do it.
*  What we mean when we say the information is still there is that in the universe as a whole,
*  the universe knows that complete state of the universe, even though it's inaccessible
*  to us because of the uncertainty principle, etc., the complete state of the universe contains
*  the right information to reconstruct the book.
*  Macroscopically, it's just inaccessible to us.
*  And the fact that macroscopic physics is irreversible is a reflection of the fact
*  that that information is inaccessible to us.
*  But that's completely compatible with the microscopic physics preserving the information
*  over time.
*  Now, the other thing that you mentioned is, I think, a little bit more interesting and
*  provocative.
*  You say that, are there more possibilities for the microstates on the higher entropy
*  side of things to evolve back to?
*  So, yeah, you know, when you're in a high entropy state, like after you burn the book,
*  in the macro state that you are in, there's the ash, there's a certain amount of radiation,
*  blah, blah, blah.
*  In that macro state, there are more microstates than there were in the initial book before
*  you burned it.
*  Okay.
*  Entropy went up.
*  That's what you mean.
*  So what that means is that for a typical microstate in that macro state, so if all you knew was
*  there was some ash, some dust, some radiation, you knew its macroscopic properties, but you
*  didn't know its microstate, and someone gave you a specific example of that microstate
*  and said evolved it backward, it would not evolve back into the book.
*  The overwhelming majority of such microstates would not even evolve into lower entropy states.
*  In the past, they would evolve into higher entropy states, also in the past, right?
*  Because the information that the book used to exist and used to be in a lower entropy
*  state is still implicit in the microstate of the ashes and smoke and radiation.
*  It's just inaccessible to us macroscopically.
*  So we know that it used to be there because we knew there used to be a book, but just
*  the macroscopically accessible information is not enough for us to know that it even
*  could be reversed into a lower entropy state, much less how to do it.
*  P. Walder says, I often hear scientists say that life on earth only ever originated once.
*  Does this literally mean that there was only ever one instance of some chance chemical event,
*  which subsequently resulted in the evolution of all known bacteria, plants, et cetera?
*  If so, doesn't this point to an incredibly rare event and makes the likelihood of finding life
*  elsewhere in the universe very, very unlikely?
*  I don't think you often hear scientists say that, at least not when they're speaking carefully.
*  What scientists like to say or should be saying is that all life on earth came from a common ancestor.
*  There is Luca, the last universal common ancestor.
*  We don't think that different species of life on earth now have family trees that are completely
*  disjoint. We think that every living organism on earth can be traced back to Luca in some sense.
*  That's not the same as saying that life on earth only ever originated once.
*  It means that if there were multiple origins, either most of them didn't survive at all,
*  or some of them combined to make our last common ancestor.
*  So having one universal common ancestor doesn't mean it was the first ancestor.
*  It's possible that life originated 20 times and 12 of those died out and 8 of them got together
*  somehow to make Luca. I don't know, but this is a hypothetically conceivable set of events.
*  Maybe sometimes scientists say that life on earth only ever originated once,
*  but we don't know that and they shouldn't say that.
*  Having said all that, it's also possible that life we think originated 3.5 billion years ago.
*  Maybe life is rare in its origin, but not super rare.
*  Maybe there's a chance of it coming into existence one every 500 million years.
*  So over the course of the existence of life, it's come into existence several times,
*  but after the first time, it was already crowded. There was already life here,
*  and the life that came into existence either was absorbed or eliminated by the existing life.
*  That's also possible. So I do think that we have enough evidence to say that life doesn't appear
*  immediately and easily. We haven't made it in our test tubes. There's a little bit of effort involved.
*  But I don't think we have enough information to say that it's very, very unlikely either.
*  The universe is a big place. There's a number, the chance that life comes into existence,
*  that we multiply by another number, the number of possible places life could come into existence.
*  One of those numbers is small, the other is big, and we just don't really know what you get when
*  you multiply them by each other. Dominic Adam Jones says, as a scientifically expert, morally
*  serious person, how do you square the climate crisis with your willingness to fly fairly
*  regularly? So I think the short answer is Dick Cheney was right. I'm giving Dick Cheney too much
*  credit. Usually I give no credit at all, though, so this should count for something. Dick Cheney,
*  back when he was running on the presidential ticket as vice presidential candidate with George W.
*  Bush, was asked about energy conservation, in particular, individual efforts to conserve energy,
*  use better light bulbs, etc. And he said, look, that's a matter of personal virtue. He didn't
*  consider it to be a matter of public policy. And I agree with that. I disagree with him about the
*  public policy itself should be, but this whole idea that individuals are going to make choices
*  about light bulbs and traveling and what car to drive seems to me to be not only irrelevant
*  to climate change, but actively unhelpful, because it's not going to help. You know,
*  we talked about with Herb Gintis, the fact that there's no point in voting,
*  if all you wanted to do was be a consequentialist. The reason why we vote is to sort of demonstrate
*  some loyalty or because we think it's a rule that everyone should obey and it's some Kantian sense,
*  etc. But me not flying would have, I mean, strictly zero effect on the climate, right,
*  because the same planes would fly like my choice not to fly would not affect the flight of the
*  planes. Even if 100 people choose not to fly, it's just not going to have a big effect. The way to
*  solve the climate crisis is through collective action. Of course it is. And collective action
*  comes through governments and international cooperation and things like that. I think that
*  if you're serious about the climate crisis, what you worry about is public policy, not whether an
*  individual person is driving a gas car or electric car or something like that. You need to think much,
*  much, much bigger. What I want, in other words, is a system that makes it easy to treat the planet
*  well, rather than relying on individual good deeds, which will never ever, ever do the job.
*  We need to incentivize systems that don't cause harm to the planet, make fossil fuels really,
*  really expensive, incentivize alternatives, give people ways to live their lives so that the choices
*  that make them happiest are the ones that are good for the planet. That's the kind of system we should
*  set up, not just hectoring people into behaving well. It doesn't help. And last question for this AMA,
*  Fabian Rosdalen says, I saw you get referenced by rationality rules in his video on why is there
*  something rather than nothing? And whilst I think you agree with him there, it got me thinking,
*  has there been any case where you felt misrepresented by someone in a documentary,
*  video, article or something like that? And how do you cope with that? Oh, my goodness, yes,
*  is the answer here. I mean, maybe this is just obvious, but certainly I've learned empirically
*  through experience that once you do some communication in the public sphere, once other
*  people read what you write or listen to what you say and then talk about it, you will constantly
*  be misrepresented. It happens all the time. People are constantly saying, attributing to me, not only
*  misrepresentations of what I said, but literally the opposite of things that I would say all the
*  time. People say that I think that there's no more reason to take evidence and observation into
*  consideration when we do science. People have said that I think it's possible to mathematically
*  disprove the existence of God. People say lots of crazy things. What are you going to do?
*  Most of the time, the people's audiences are relatively small and life is short and I don't
*  bother to be honest. Sometimes I get emails from someone saying, oh, someone wrote an article or
*  someone published a video that misrepresents something you've said. Yeah, life is short.
*  I try to be clear in what I say. I knew when I started talking about the fact that the laws
*  of physics underlying everyday life are completely known, everyone was going to misrepresent that,
*  and indeed they do all the time. I don't mean the person I just responded to in the AMA,
*  but some people get it really, really wrong. They just willfully misunderstand in ways that I knew
*  they would misunderstand. I said in the article, please don't misunderstand it in the following way
*  and they do it anyway. I'm making fun of people, of course, but look, we're all finite. We all have
*  limited capacity both to read things and to understand them and to talk about them and so
*  on and so on. I'm included in that. When I talk about what other people say and have said,
*  I'm sure that I cut corners and I misrepresent them not intentionally, but I have ways of thinking and
*  if I'm trying to understand someone else's way of thinking, it's generally going to fit into
*  pre-existing categories in my brain. Sometimes that fit does violence to the original idea.
*  It's very natural that people misunderstand. That's not an excuse. You shouldn't get away with it just
*  for that reason, but I get why it happens. The solution is just that all of us should make good
*  faith efforts to be honest and accurate when we are saying things, when we are attributing
*  views to other people. I try to be clear myself. I try to anticipate ways in which I can be
*  misunderstood and what else can I do? I'm not going to chase around everyone who misrepresents
*  me. If it becomes someone famous, then maybe I will explain on social media or whatever that
*  that was a misunderstanding, but if it's just everyday things, certain punches you have to
*  roll with. Someone said on Twitter recently, you have to pick your battles. Then the joke was,
*  wait, that's a lot of battles. You're picking too many battles. Pick fewer battles. Put some
*  battles down. I'm very much a believer in that particular philosophy. You have to pick your
*  battles. There's an infinite number of battles. Life and energy are finite. Let's pick the best
*  ones that we can pick. With that, as usual, thank you very much for listening this far. Thanks very
*  much for supporting Mindscape. I hope you're having as much fun listening to it and thinking
*  about it as I am making it. Have a good month.
