The Earth's climate keeps changing, largely due to the effects of human activity, and we haven't been doing enough to slow things down. Indeed, over the past year, global temperatures have been higher than ever, and higher than most climate models have predicted. Today's guest, Gavin Schmidt, has been a leader in measuring the variations in Earth's climate, modeling its likely future trajectory, and working to get the word out. We talk about the current state of the art, and what to expect for the future.

Gavin Schmidt received his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from University College London. He is currently Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and an affiliate of the Center for Climate Systems Research at Columbia University. His research involves both measuring and modeling climate variability. Among his awards are the inaugural Climate Communications Prize of the American Geophysical Union. He is a cofounder of the RealClimate blog.

# Mindscape 276 | Gavin Schmidt on Measuring, Predicting, and Protecting Our Climate
**Mindscape Podcast:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMj_51jgRAA)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and here at Mindscape, which I've been doing now for quite a while
*  you know, I constantly get suggestions or requests for
*  Guests to invite for topics to cover and I love getting these by the way
*  Many of the episodes that we've done have been arisen as suggestions from audience members
*  I get way more that I can possibly say yes to so if you make a suggestion and it doesn't get followed up on
*  Sorry, don't feel bad about that. There's just a numbers game going on
*  But one topic that has gotten a lot of requests in recent years is the climate and climate change
*  And we haven't done a lot of climate change
*  We have done some but the most pointedly climate centric episodes that we've done were quite a while ago
*  Michael Mann, Ramesh Naam, people like that and it's not random that that hasn't happened. It's sort of my fault
*  I have a feeling that you know, obviously the science of climate change is incredibly interesting. It's very intricate
*  There's a lot going on a lot to think about
*  But there's also a political social aspect to it, which to me is incredibly frustrating
*  Not because there shouldn't be a political social aspect to it
*  There's a political problem to be addressed both within countries and internationally. We need to do something about this
*  But my attitude is that we should all know by now that we should be doing something about that and
*  It feels a little repetitive and a little frustrating just say the same true things over and over again
*  I didn't want to fall into that trap
*  So I'm here to confess that I was completely wrong in that attitude. That was a bad attitude to have
*  Part of the reason why I changed my mind was because there is something new that was a little bit surprising
*  Namely that over the last year
*  The temperature of the earth has been even warmer than it should have been according to the climate models
*  So something is not quite fitting and that raises a new scientific question
*  So I finally said all right, let's it's time to figure this out learn something and Gavin Schmidt who is today's podcast
*  Guest is the perfect person to talk about these kinds of things. Many of you will have heard of Gavin before he's not only a very
*  respected climatologist
*  Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for space studies
*  Co-author of the various IPCC reports, etc
*  But he's also active in public engagement, which is very very important more important for climate scientists to do than physicists or philosophers
*  Let's put it that way
*  The real climate blog is one that he and a group of friends founded. I learned by talking to Gavin before today's episode that
*  Cosmic variants which was the group blog that I was a part of for a while
*  Was one of the inspirations for real climate starting up. So I thought that was very nice, but they're still going strong
*  You can still follow them and check them out. So anyway
*  Gavin is not only very knowledgeable about these things but incredibly articulated explaining what is going on and keeping interest high
*  and I think hitting the right notes of
*  giving us insight into the science while nudging us in a productive direction in terms of
*  Policy and politics and things like that
*  So I think you know again I was wrong my fault long overdue this episode
*  I think this is gonna turn out to be one of the best episodes of mindscape that you will listen to
*  Occasional reminders if you like mindscape you can support the podcast at patreon.com
*  Slash Sean M Carol drop a buck or two for every episode of the podcast you get a warm and fuzzy feeling
*  Also ad-free versions of the podcast and the ability to ask questions at monthly AMA's and it's just a good thing to do
*  You should support good things that you like in a relatively low level of
*  Cost I think overall I think it's worth it in an hour a podcast every week
*  Anyway with that again, I think that this is a great discussion of some super important topics in a very clear way
*  And we get in a bit sciencey in here. There's some isotopic abundances that we're gonna dig into so let's go
*  Oh
*  Gavin Schmidt welcome to the winescape podcast. Thank you very much. Good to be here. So the climate how's that going?
*  How's the climate doing these days?
*  well
*  Let me tell you
*  so
*  It's um, it's it's totally abundant to to anybody who ever sticks their head outside that the climate is changing
*  um, we are seeing in all the
*  Datasets in the temperatures on the land in the ocean. We're seeing it in the ice. We're seeing it in the sea level rise
*  we're seeing it in the change of
*  weather extremes the the intensity of rainfall the heat waves the the change in the plant hardiness zones
*  That that are moving upward and pole wood on a
*  You know, maybe decadal basis not quite every year
*  But but on a decadal basis, I you know, New York City where I live is now subtropical
*  It turns out and and it didn't use to be
*  But so that makes a difference to what you're planting it makes a difference to what you're seeing it makes it to the pests
*  That you get and we're seeing
*  Changes and you know, I I can go through the litany of
*  Stuff that the people have seen
*  But but it's it's it's everywhere and the evidence for that change
*  is is everywhere and
*  If that's all there was it would be all that's interesting on what's going on
*  But it isn't
*  That's going on because we actually understand why it's changing and we have been predicting
*  Why it was going to change why it is changing and why it will continue to change
*  For many decades now and we have been doing so successfully
*  And the answer is that uh, it's us and it's our emissions of
*  greenhouse gases
*  notably carbon dioxide methane carbon
*  the CFCs
*  Changes in ozone changes in nitrous nitrous oxide
*  It's it's a whole list of list of things that we're doing deforestation
*  The evolution of various sorts we are now
*  very clearly a
*  geophysical force
*  and our
*  imprint on the system is
*  It's comparable to you know, almost the biggest things that have happened in the last 65 million years
*  and down what one of the
*  Complaints there are doubters out there. We're not going to give them too much air time
*  But there's a lot of people who want to throw up
*  Reasons to be skeptical of the whole climate change story and you know one for a long time has been
*  The climate is really complicated. It's a very
*  Complex system, it's very hard to model. We know what's gonna happen any how to be honest
*  I'm interested in your perspective on this
*  I never quite bought that argument, but I wouldn't have been shocked, you know, like the climate is very complicated
*  There are absolutely yeah, it's kind of amazing how well you folks have done in modeling it
*  It seems like a very hard thing to do
*  Yes, yes, and this is something that is the fall. I think well appreciated
*  You know, we've been doing you know climate modeling
*  You know at a serious level for since the night since the beginning of the 1980s, right?
*  so that's that's over that's over 40 years and
*  The amazing thing was at the beginning nobody thought it would be useful, right?
*  You know the climate is too complicated. Look at all the weather. Look at all the details
*  Everything is like there's so much heterogeneity like you're never gonna be able to to get something on the on the
*  Global scale we're using the scale that is that is gonna be anything other than that academic
*  But the fact of the matter is is that a lot of that noise
*  Cancels out a lot of it is just in fact noise and you can extract the signal from that noise
*  In models relatively easily and then in the data
*  There's a little bit more noise and so it takes a little bit longer to come out in the data
*  But but but you could you can see it and and it turns out that that signal
*  Is in fact far more robust to the details than we really?
*  Anticipated you know 40 40 years ago. And so the climate is complex, right? I
*  mean
*  If you ever saw my my TED talk, but you know, but that's how we start like the climate is
*  Enormously complicated you can see so many different
*  Feedbacks and interactions between the clouds and the particles and the ocean and the land
*  and it is very hard to keep track of but
*  But
*  The models that we have created
*  Even the first set of models that we created 40 years ago have managed to skillfully predict
*  What happened in the global mean temperatures in the pattern of temperature change in the
*  You know the rate at which we were warming and the impacts on rainfall and things like that. They didn't get everything right? I they
*  You know, we still struggle with
*  Getting you know, the sea level predictions, right?
*  because you know you need to include the ice sheets the dynamic ice sheets and underneath the ice sheets and
*  All the other things that happen to water that's that's still kind of very much at the cutting edge
*  You know, we don't get you know, we haven't been able to to
*  Successfully predict when the tipping points of rainforest systems are when you have deforestation and drying and when when do they when do they not?
*  work anymore
*  We don't know you know, so so there's there are still there's still kind of detailed
*  Complicated questions that we're still working on
*  And and we can get to to perhaps some of the the ones that are relevant for for exactly what's going on right now
*  2023 2024 a little bit later in the in the in the talk and so so there are very much open questions
*  But the big question right the big the big issue like why is it different now to what it was a hundred years ago?
*  It turns out that the answer that we came up with 40 years ago has stood the test of time and it's not going away and
*  I definitely do want to get into the modeling especially because that's a just a fascinating scientific subject
*  But let's let's be good empirical scientists and measuring a little bit
*  So absolutely my most basic question is what does it even mean to talk about the temperature of the earth or the atmosphere?
*  I mean the temperature here in Baltimore is not the same as the temperature in
*  Oslo or in
*  Cairo, so is how well defined is that is that something that is a good guess we all agree
*  Is there a dispute about what it means?
*  Well, no, I mean, I you know temperature is a three-dimensional field and I can average it over any two-dimensional surface
*  I once and and I can get a number now. The question is is that meaningful, right?
*  So so so, you know, the issue is not, you know, can I define a double mean temperature?
*  the issue is is that meaningful and
*  you might think that it it might not be very meaningful because well
*  You know all of these things are nonlinear and so it matters that
*  Somewhere is a little bit warmer and somewhere is a little bit colder that doesn't give you quite exactly the same thing as if everybody
*  Was the same was at the same temperature, right?
*  You know, so and and that's that's that's a valid that's a valid point, but it turns out there's a pretty small
*  The
*  Kind of heuristic model that we have of the of the climate where you know, the Sun brings the energy in the
*  The infrared goes out and that's kind of mediated by effectively the surface temperature
*  It actually works pretty well. I mean it helps explain
*  You know not everything that you're seeing
*  But it does help explain like the bulk
*  Issues and that's why those early models were so successful right because they didn't do very much else other than
*  Like kind of chop chop the world up into quite large boxes and average those together
*  And so as we've gone to more and more detail as we've allowed for more and more of that
*  Of those nonlinear interactions and more and more details and and more and more complexity
*  It turns out that those average heuristics that we started off with they're still pretty valid. Yeah
*  again, there must be a
*  Explanation for why we should have thought 40 years ago. We'd be doing this well, right?
*  Is there some ex post facto way of thinking that?
*  We were too worried about nonlinearities or chaos theory or something or is that no?
*  I mean, it's not that we don't think the chaos theory is is valid
*  I mean it totally is
*  And so but it's a question of how much of the shift that we see in
*  Interannual temperatures or whatever measure that you want to look at is is rated to you know
*  Wherever you are on the
*  On the the attractor and
*  Where that attractor is in space, right? So so there's there's effectively two things
*  I think I think some people get caught up by thinking that we're just on that attractor and we're just going around and around
*  And around and people can you know visualize the the Lorentz butterfly and you say, okay
*  Well, how can we ever know anything but the but the climate problem is not working out where you are on the attractor
*  It's where that attractor is in face. Yeah. Okay, right and
*  And it turns out I'm sorry some overall kind of well defined point, right? Yeah
*  Yeah, and so I
*  How much of the climate changes that we've seen are that attractor moving?
*  And how much of it is like kind of within?
*  The the wheels it turns out that almost all of the change that we've seen is because that attractor has shifted not because
*  We don't know quite where we are on that
*  Okay, when we when we compare when we say that it is warmed the average temperature has gone up
*  Obviously in the past we're using different methods to measure the temperature for sure. So that's the thing
*  I mean for you personally like what is most relevant thing us compared to a hundred years ago or a thousand years ago or a
*  Hundred thousand years ago and and how what is the I presume it gets less and less certain as you go into the past
*  Sure, so let's let's let's let's take that that that view and go back in in time. So
*  We have great data
*  Back to
*  1979 which is really the beginning of the satellite here. I work for NASA
*  We're very proud of the satellites the contribution the satellites have made but they really make a step change in how much stuff
*  Right and that you know that kind of started in the 1960s with the Tirol satellites
*  but anyway, but but like 1979 is really the the starting point for a
*  Comprehensive satellite mission to what's going on? Okay before 1979
*  We have instrumental records on the ground and that takes us back to you know, the middle of the 19th century, right? So we had
*  Temperatures on boats we had temperatures in weather stations
*  And you know and there's less and less as you go back in time, but you can get back to
*  the mid
*  the mid 19th century
*  Without too much without too much uncertainty
*  After that it starts to get a little bit
*  Hokier and you need to use
*  Alternative methods and so people people have been working on this for for many many decades
*  If you want high resolution data, right so you have you know data that tells you what's happening every year every season
*  you have to look at things like
*  corals in the tropical
*  Areas they they have they have layers just like trees trees have layers and so you can you can extract temperature signals
*  from both of those caves
*  Like you know stalactites so I think we use tight mics not so tight so me
*  You know, they have they have layers we can we can date those layers very precisely we can go back even further
*  But yeah, I mean it's it's it's probably have ice cores
*  The ice cores have annual layers until about 50,000 years ago something like that. You can count individual layers
*  So so there is a lot of data there that comes from a lot of different parts of the world
*  But but you're right. I mean the further back you go
*  The the more uncertain it gets
*  Balance that though the further back you go the bigger the signal gets and so the signal to noise ratio
*  For a lot of stuff that happened in the past is actually pretty comparable to to what we can what we can detect
*  Even the last hundred years, right? So you go back to do back go back 20,000 years, right? So
*  You're in Baltimore 20,000 years ago that was that was a tundra coastal plain
*  Where you are now you would have been maybe a hundred miles from that from the coast
*  And it would have been you know mammoths and
*  And various tundra like things where I am we would have still been under the ice sheets
*  Maybe a kilometer of ice on on Manhattan and that ice sheets obviously stretched from
*  All the way to the Arctic Circle
*  And that was that was that was a huge climate difference from from the the late Holocene that we
*  kind of grew up in as a society and
*  And that was that was about some
*  What audience we talked to do I do I have to convert everything to Fahrenheit I
*  Know you and we're gonna trust the money
*  No, you can
*  Trust the mindscape listeners out there to plug in if they need to okay. Okay, so it was about five to six degrees Celsius
*  colder and
*  We've warmed
*  You know in the last hundred and so years we've ruled about one and a half degrees
*  Celsius so, you know the uncertainty on that one and a half degrees is about
*  point one point two degrees, right so
*  Let's say let's say let's say a 10%
*  Noise compared to that signal
*  the uncertainty in the last spatial maximum temperatures is
*  Using maybe a degree right? So so maybe it was maybe it was six degrees
*  Maybe it was four and a half degrees six and a half degrees, right?
*  So it's about a degree out of that five. So it's about a 20%
*  Error, so so we can we can go back and we can still see those large signals
*  I
*  Because they are large right?
*  So if we go back even further we can go back to the Pliocene before before the the quaternary for the glaciation
*  Really kind of kicked in
*  And we have reasonable estimates of the temperatures there is about three degrees warmer than pre-industrial
*  We can go back to the Cretaceous even larger signals, you know, the dinosaurs flying around everywhere
*  Theropods probably flying with dinosaurs everywhere
*  And
*  And and a warming of maybe eight degrees Celsius above where we where we were in the pre-industrial
*  So so we can we can see those things and we can understand them
*  And and then you know, and then people will read our work is this all see climate change before
*  And and that that's always a little bit amusing because you then you then ask them well, well said the sea level
*  What was the sea level like in the Cretaceous do you think?
*  And for our listeners it was about a hundred meters higher than it is today
*  So we would not like that again. Yes now
*  But but I know this is kind of obvious
*  But just so it's on the record here the rate at which things are changing now and for like you said
*  Reasons we a hundred percent or ninety eight percent understand. Let's say
*  It has no analog in the historical fossil record
*  No, Anna
*  Mm-hmm. I I I
*  So it so we don't know quite how fast everything changed in the geological past, right?
*  So that's one of the things that you lose is the ability to say this took 20 years. This took 10 years
*  But but compared to those last signals that I was talking about so so the warming out of the last
*  Iceage took 10,000 years to warm five degrees
*  And we we've changed
*  1.5 degrees in the last hundred so that's
*  That's that's quite a bit faster
*  You know, I mean I mean obviously there's there's there's one there's one thing that happened in the in the past that we're absolutely certain
*  Took no time at all effectively, which was the the KT impact
*  And you know, we have we have records there all the day
*  of the day in the spring
*  when that
*  When that's the asteroids hit which is insane
*  That was very fast but but obviously most things in geological class didn't happen that quickly
*  Like like with the sea level rise that was pretty bad when that happened
*  You don't want to like that was that was bad. Yes, sir
*  That was probably the worst day in the last hundred million years. I was
*  And one of the things that I've learned from my very superficial reading about climate and so forth
*  Is that it's not just the atmosphere right? The right sure is hugely important
*  So can we get reliable estimates of what the water temperature was in the past?
*  yeah, so so that's that's actually one of the
*  the real success stories of
*  Paleo climate has has been able has been the ability to pull that out and
*  And there's a couple of things there that kind of tie back into some of things we've said we've said already
*  Which is how big is the signal how big is it?
*  One of the first things that people started looking at once they understood
*  You know kind of post-war
*  Understanding of isotope system, right?
*  People invented mass spectrometers and they were able to for the first time
*  I measure the the ratios of isotopes of different elements in different substances and one of the things that
*  Harold Urey who won the NOAA prize
*  For chemistry for his work on this he was looking at some deuterium and oxygen 18
*  Right, so deuterium is heavy heavy hydrogen a stable isotope, right?
*  Oxygen 18 is a stable isotope of
*  Oxygen most oxygen is oxygen 16 most hydrogen is standard hydrogen
*  And it turns out that the ratio of those two things in water
*  Changes pretty dramatically
*  Yeah, depending on whether the water evaporates whether it condenses in which pool it's seen and so it's a really good tracer of
*  You know how water moves around in the system and then it turns out that it's it's
*  Those the fractionation is temperature
*  Dependent as well and so if you look at things that form from water particularly shells
*  Carbonates, you know, so that's that's ca co
*  Three right the oh there comes from the water and the ratio of oxygen
*  18 to oxygen 16 in that in that oxygen there
*  actually reflects the water that the carbonate was formed in plus a temperature signal and
*  And and and people took that in and they said okay
*  Well, let's let's let's see if we can find carbonate around the world and and in the 90s and 50s
*  1950s and 60s as they were kind of really just kind of exploring the ocean
*  They didn't know about the mid-ocean ridges at that point. That was a new discovery
*  They would drop cores and then pick up mud. There was a there was a boat here at Lamont Doherty and
*  The goal was anytime you stop for anything
*  Take a core sample just in case and they ended up building this this this this repository of
*  data from the from the oceans
*  Bottom the mud in the ocean bottom you think well, what's that good for?
*  It turns out that there's there a little there a little
*  single celled foraminifera that have carbonate shells that are that exist through time and you can
*  Just like in the ice cores you can go back in time and you can you can analyze that ratio
*  And it turns out that it doesn't matter where you are in the ocean
*  You see something that looks very similar. You see this kind of like flat bit at the beginning. That's the Holocene
*  It goes there why goes it goes up
*  But in temperature wise it goes down
*  Into the last glacial maximum bounces around a bit pops up again a hundred thousand years earlier goes back down pops
*  You know and then goes back and in time and as they put those things together
*  They you know, they started off with like about a million years worth of records and they found out Oh
*  everywhere you go is the same thing and
*  Putting that together with the theory for why the glaciations happened which was developed by a
*  Physicist called Malankovitch who had some spare time while while sitting in a Serbian jail
*  In the 1920s to calculate all these things. He calculated all of the changes
*  In in how much of the Sun's energy was coming in as a function of the wobbles in the earth's
*  and
*  That was you know, this is the before the days in mechanical calculation. It was very laborious
*  And it took him, you know a
*  Number of years, but apparently he had he had the time spare
*  And and that was that you know
*  That was a hypothesis for why the climate would change and and for a long time it didn't seem to fit
*  For a long time like the dating seemed wrong
*  But it turns out that it was the dating that was wrong and when people got good at the dating one
*  And then once they put together this this stack of records from everywhere around the oceans
*  It was abundantly clear that he was spot-on and that and that there's a hundred thousand year cycle
*  There's a 40,000 year cycle
*  There's a 19,000 year cycle and put together those of have pace that have been the pacemaker of
*  the the glacial periods and the glacial interglacial variations of at least the last three million years and
*  So so that was that that was a huge triumph of that kind of empirical science
*  Yeah, so you you have to size that measuring these water temperatures at different points
*  Different places around the globe gives you a consistent story
*  I'm presuming the story that you get is also somehow consistent with the atmospheric temperatures
*  Yes, so so this is before anybody had the ice course
*  So the ice cores kind of came in in the early 90s
*  So I so people were very excited that there'd been some early ice core work in the in the 1980s
*  Which kind of said something we can we can see something interesting there, but that wasn't really done
*  To the to the level that was required until the 1990s and there there were a number of
*  Efforts in Greenland and there were a few efforts in Antarctica
*  that gave extremely complementary
*  and
*  Coherent results in in in Greenland. They go back one
*  Glacial cycle so they go back about 120 thousand years, but in
*  But in in Antarctica and now
*  Inantarica and now they've gone back almost a million years you can see, you know
*  These these ups and downs of the of the glacial cycles and the greenhouse gases, right?
*  That was that was the new thing that the green that the Antarctic ice courts gave was the bubbles in the ice itself
*  We were able to measure how much greenhouse gas there was in each of those boats, which is incredible, right?
*  And so and so we get this this this this beautiful record of
*  The the temperatures and the carbon dioxide the temperatures in the carbon dioxide which have gone hand-in-hand
*  together
*  Until until very recently over the last three million years because when you say the phrase greenhouse gases just so
*  We're clear again with the audience that doesn't mean created by human beings necessarily. There are gas. No, no, no, no, no
*  I mean, that's so so so greenhouse gases in the rain a natural right?
*  so our our planet is is much warmer than it would be if it was a
*  ball the floating around in space without an atmosphere are because of the the heat trapping properties of
*  Small constituents in our atmosphere, but big deals in terms of the climate right? So most of our atmosphere is made up of nitrogen
*  78 percent and I'll tell you a good story about why it's important to know that maybe later on
*  I
*  21 percent oxygen small spattering of argon things it turns out that the nitrogen oxygen argon
*  Almost totally inert with respect to infrared radiation. So they don't absorb or emit any infrared radiation
*  So they they absorb and emit at the higher frequencies
*  But there are some gases
*  And other substances in the atmosphere that that absorb in the infrared and the infrared is important because that's the temperature
*  That the planet is emitting and so if you absorb in the temperature that the planet is emitting then you can then you can make a
*  Difference and so water vapor which is triatomic H2o
*  carbon carbon dioxide triatomic co2 right methane
*  Five atoms all of these slightly more complex
*  atoms have vibrational modes that absorb in the infrared and
*  And that's what makes them greenhouse gases and that's why they are so useful
*  Keeping that the the earth's planet the earth's surface much warmer than it otherwise
*  Okay, you got to tell us an amusing story about why the abundance of nitrogen in the atmosphere is so important
*  So so let me tell you four decades of my life, right I spent
*  learning
*  totally obscure facts about science and the earth and and they never came in handy until
*  one day I'm sitting in a bar and
*  And
*  And and there's a there's a as a cute girl. I just just next to me
*  At the bar and I had I had position myself so that I was being next to said said you go
*  But I was I was trying to the bartender, but anyway, she turns around and asks me. Do you know the primary composition of air?
*  I said yes
*  And
*  And and I saw I said oh it is nitrogen 78% and
*  At which point she she kind of kind of went white and then and turned back to her conversation and it turns out that
*  That she had been trying to demonstrate to her conversational partner that nobody knows anything about science
*  And that this I'm gonna prove it by going to this random person see next to me
*  and they're not even gonna know the first thing about the primary composition and
*  that was the beginning of a of a big conversation and
*  Blah blah blah blah and you know, she's now she's now my wife. So that's very good. I was hoping
*  Yes, no, of course. Yes
*  Okay, but one thing that one loose thread here is I would kind of like to understand just a little bit better
*  why
*  The ratio of oxygen 18 isotopes to oxygen 16 isotopes depends on the temperature, you know
*  I'm literally just the dumb physicist here. They're just isotopes. Why do they care where the temperature is?
*  Well, so so they don't
*  But you have to think about the water cycle on on on the planet
*  So so where does water come to and go from in the atmosphere, right?
*  it makes it mostly evaporates in the subtropics, right so so kind of just north of the
*  Equator just out of the equator and when you evaporate water, it's much easier to evaporate lighter
*  Atoms right. So so when you when you evaporate water you leave behind the oxygen 18s
*  And you and you have more oxygen 16s, right? So the ratio of 18 to 16 changes
*  When you evaporate the water, okay, and now that water
*  Where does it go? Well effectively it kind of moves north and you've got this export of water vapor towards the high latitudes towards the poles and
*  as it gets
*  Further towards the poles gets colder and as it gets colder it rain, you know more of that water rains out
*  There's a lot more humidity in the tropics than there is in the mid latitudes and certainly as there is in the poles
*  And so as you rain that water out what rains out first the heavy atoms, right?
*  So the oxygen 18 gets more and more depleted and so by the time you get to
*  The snow that's falling in Greenland
*  You have much less oxygen 18 than you started
*  And it turns out that if it's a little bit warmer you have a little bit more and if it's a little bit colder
*  you have a little bit less and
*  So if you measure the oxygen 18 to oxygen 16 ratio in that snow
*  That it becomes the ice that goes down through that ice core
*  When when there's more oxygen 18 it was warmer and when there was less oxygen 18
*  It was cooler and you can calibrate that
*  Against a number of different other ways of doing it and so you can actually end up with this payo thermometer
*  That is not perfect, but really quite good now
*  Yeah, so but that's not the only place where you're recording these isotopes, right? So I mentioned carbonates
*  in foraminifera, which are small
*  plankton, but also in in cave records caves are carbonate as well and it turns out that the
*  When you form carbonates right you take the oxygen so so carbonate is formed when you have
*  You know carbon dioxide dissolves in in water and it forms
*  dissolved aqueous carbon dioxide
*  carbonate bicarbonate and then when you want if you're a creature or if you're a cave record or a stag might
*  You condense out the the carbonate but the oxygen came from the water
*  And as you do that again, it's slightly easier to
*  To take the the heavy
*  Oxygen and make it into a solid
*  Then then it is otherwise and that that's temperature dependent
*  So so there if the temperature is high you get a little bit a little bit more carbon 18
*  Than you would do otherwise, so so it's actually the opposite sense than the than in the ice cores
*  But in practice it allows you
*  Again to go back in time and and to derive a paleo thermometer that has you know other things going on
*  Particularly, you know the total amount of ice on land also changes the oxygen 18 content of the of the ocean
*  But effectively it gives you a temperature signal
*  my
*  my kind of entry into
*  Climate modeling was really to try and simulate the interaction between those
*  So how could you?
*  Look at the paleo record and instead of trying to invert those records and try to work out what went on
*  You know, could you forward model the kinds of things that you would be measuring?
*  So can so could you include the isotopes in the climate models?
*  So that when the climate changed it would tell you what the isotope signal should be both on the land and in the ice cores
*  and in the ocean and that was that that was really my
*  Kind of my gateway drug
*  Into into global climate modeling and the complexities of it because it turns out that that's actually a very big job
*  And I think it took us it took us about eight years to to be able to do the first
*  coupled simulation of the full
*  Oxygen 18 I threw the oxygen a isotope
*  climate record
*  in a model and I did not think it was gonna quite take quite that long, but
*  But it did and it worked out
*  you know stories like that just
*  Remind me in a very nice romantic way of how awesome science is
*  I mean, there's so many moving pieces in what you just talked about
*  you know come down to the laws of nature being obeyed and they work and you can test them and they're robust and and
*  We human beings can kind of mostly figure it out. It never ceases to amaze me
*  Well, I don't know if we can mostly figure it out. We've been able to figure out some things
*  And the fact that we've been able to figure out anything is remarkable
*  But you know, but a lot of times, you know, we spend our time looking underneath the streetlamp and not in the dark
*  And so it's not quite clear what we're not what we're not seeing
*  But but where we can see things we have been successful at doing so and we and we continue to push
*  You know that zone of illumination if you like about the the natural system
*  Well, I I had the luxury of being able to take the cosmic view over which all of human history is very short
*  More urgent things going on see you want the
*  Rate of progress to be a little bit faster. So so let's on that note think about these models that we were talking about before
*  You know, everyone has probably seen some two-dimensional diagram of photons hitting the atmosphere and
*  Being captured by the greenhouse gases you already talked about
*  Take it that the models you get professionally paid to think about are a little bit more complicated than that. I mean
*  You give the audience like just a feeling of what are the elements that go into these what do you what do what do the
*  Modelers have to keep juggling in their codes and their heads. Oh
*  Yeah, so so let's start at the source, right? So
*  The Sun is the source of 99% of the energy that comes through the system
*  So you start off with that? Well, what does that look like? Well, it's spectrally
*  Interesting, you know, so it's mostly in the visible but there's a there's a component in the near-infrared. There's a component in the UV
*  That comes in. How does it interact with the atmosphere? Well, the atmosphere is made up of lots of different things. It has
*  we mentioned water vapor and greenhouse gases and ozone and clouds and
*  Small particles which can be absorbing or reflective or scattering or a little bit of all of them
*  And so you have to track what happens to to that to that that that ray of Sun
*  It has to be broken up into the spectral bands. It has to interact with all those different things
*  You know one by one, there's a lot of what's called photolytic chemistry
*  So there are reactions that happen just because there are photons that come in and make that reaction happen particularly in the stratosphere
*  And so you have to include that and now you have to obviously you know, you need to keep track of well
*  Where is the Sun, you know, and you know, well the earth is rotating half of it is in the dark half
*  It is in the light
*  You have to keep track of where everything is what happens at twilight something's a kind of chemistry wise
*  Twilight is a very interesting time. You have to include all of those things. Okay, then now this
*  This sunlight kind of reaches the ground well some of that reflects because there's snow some of it gets absorbed because the ocean is dark
*  Or the land is not quite as dark darker
*  And then that temperature changes and now you have to go back up again. Okay, so this is everything down here
*  Is is radiating in the infrared?
*  Depending on its temperature
*  Have to calculate that then you have to do those all those calculations going back again
*  With what gets absorbed in the infrared and so that could still include the clouds and could still include the atmospheric particles
*  It can still include the greenhouse gases and finally, you know some stuff gets out
*  Okay, okay, but like now that's set up a whole bunch of different things inside
*  so, you know those temperatures have set up gradients they they
*  Influence influence the winds and so now we have to solve the the equations of motion effectively the Euler equations
*  There's a little bit of Navier-Stokes near the near the surface, but basically the Euler equations in the in the bulk of the atmosphere
*  But then that leads to upward motion and downward motion and that leads to changes in the surface fluxes
*  Which brings water into the atmosphere and then that water condenses and okay
*  Well, now that's a cloud as the cloud interact with all those little particles and what's the chemistry on the cloud particles?
*  What's going on inside the clouds? How does that change the?
*  The reflection or the absorption and so so you just keep on going and I have it and I haven't you know
*  That's only complicated but I haven't even started
*  And so so, you know you you try and do your best you kind of chunk up the atmosphere
*  So you're not doing that, you know with every tiny little point you're doing it on a on a kind of column that is maybe
*  You know 25 kilometers by 25 kilometers
*  You can go you can do higher resolution but it it starts to take much more time
*  And that makes it a little bit easier a lot of the physics is just vertical
*  So, you know the radiation you can think of as just being a vertical process
*  To very good order convection is also just a vertical process
*  So so there's a lot of things that you can do in the column that allows you to
*  Be quite efficient about how you solve the equations
*  So you can have each each column like sits on a different processor and so you can do lots of things at the same time
*  and then they interact by the via the winds and
*  And the waves and those kinds of things
*  do you ever talk to astrophysicists who study stars or supernovae is a
*  relatively similar sort of
*  spherically symmetric but not quite
*  I
*  Yeah, they have us so they in some ways it's more complicated some ways it's it's simpler
*  So they have to deal with magneto hydrodynamics, which we don't really have to worry about
*  Hi, and and it's a lot harder to get direct information from from the middle of the Sun
*  Than it is to get information from the middle of the atmosphere
*  So so I think we have we have some advantages on earth
*  I think probably that's why we're we're a little bit ahead of the game in terms of making useful prediction
*  You said that the Sun is almost all of the energy input there. What are the other things that matter?
*  I mean when I drive my car
*  Obviously if it's a gas guzzler then then that's something but does the heat generated by the car matter does the heat generated by?
*  Cities or for that matter volcanoes matter to the budget. Yeah, not very much
*  So so the heat generated by volcanoes is part of the whole geothermal flux, right?
*  So that's that's generated effectively by there's a little bit residual
*  Heat from you know, the the formation of the of the planet, but mostly it's generated by radio item decay, right?
*  So so that's a but that's a pretty small number. It's about
*  Well, it's a it's it's about
*  0.05 watts to meter squared
*  and you're comparing that to the the the average
*  Absorbed solar radiation of about 240 watts for me to squared
*  So it's it's it's three or four more three or four orders of magnitude are too small to worry about
*  But I'm biggie, but you do you know, it's not it's not
*  You do need to include it, right?
*  Because that's that's what part of what sets the the temperature profile underneath an ice sheet or in the soils, right?
*  So you so you need to include that it's a small term
*  That you know changes temperatures, you know right along the mid ocean ridges and things like that as well
*  And
*  Go ahead. Yeah, and then there are you mentioned the waste heat component
*  So we use about 15 terawatts of energy as a society
*  so that's that's that's everything, you know, the
*  Renewables that we capture the the coal that we burn the trees that we chop down
*  Everything that we do there including bioenergy and the energy that we give out. I mean it
*  But that's actually not a very large number
*  either so if you take the 15 terawatts you divide it by the
*  surface area of the planet
*  It's it's still not a very large number and the and the changes that we have put into the system because of the change in greenhouse gases
*  Totally dominates that so so you can think of you can you can you can assess that by
*  Thinking about okay, you know, here's the situation when we had the greenhouse gas levels in the past
*  Here's the situation now with the current day greenhouse gas levels. There's a lot more of them
*  It's a lot harder for the infrared energy to get out to space
*  And that means that if you just took like an instant
*  Instantaneous thing you didn't change anything else
*  What would be the change in energy at the top of the atmosphere by changing the greenhouse gases?
*  It would be well the same amount of energy is coming in but there's less going out and so there's there's an energy imbalance and so
*  You would you would you would calculate that and it turns out to be
*  Roughly two and a half watts per meter squared
*  So that's that's the forcing that we have put on the system in the last hundred years or so
*  Okay, and that's that's what's driving the warming
*  That's what's that's what's driving the climate changes and that's that's quite a large number compared to the waste heat fluxes or any of those
*  Okay, and you did say one note that I have here
*  I wanted to follow up on you mentioned that most of the physics that was relevant here is
*  vertical in the atmosphere
*  But in one of your article as I read about the idea of teleconnections
*  Sort of nonlinearities that are induced by currents in the air or the sea
*  As soon as you just say that word and say that concept
*  I think that probably in the minds of the audience
*  The complexity of the problem sort of expands quite a bit when you start needed to take those things into consideration
*  Right. I mean and this is what you see on a on a on a weather map, right?
*  you're seeing those far-field you you see if you look at a
*  if you look at a
*  Satellite picture of water vapor right and and you see that a lot of times if you Google atmospheric river
*  for instance, you'll see
*  you'll see
*  water vapor pictures and what you'll see is these
*  There's a lot of water vapor in the tropics and then you'll see these kind of rivers of water vapor kind of escaping out of
*  The tropics and then intersecting with the continents maybe in California, maybe in Europe, you know
*  And then dumping a huge amount of rain
*  But but what you're seeing there is this kind of idea of a teleconnection that something happening in
*  The tropical Pacific is going to affect the weather a long long way many thousands of miles away from the tropical Pacific and we
*  we have a
*  Pretty good empirical track record of like how that works, you know
*  so so the El Nino La Nina events a bit of a sloshing of
*  Of warm water along the long the equator in the tropical Pacific if you have an El Nino last warm phase
*  So it's warm right next to South America that tends to lead to wet
*  periods in the American Southwest
*  changes in
*  Northeast Brazil war
*  Fires and drought in Australia and Indonesia and then when you have a land in here, it's the opposite pattern
*  Not quite the opposite but but close enough
*  And so so these are these are patterns that you know big
*  You know things moving in the tropics and then impacting, you know, what seems to be the more chaotic and
*  further afield weather and and climate elsewhere and
*  And that's one of the reasons why one of the things that people struggle with is we talk about the global temperature
*  Which we started talking about but then the global temperature going up doesn't mean that the temperature in every place simply goes up
*  Right. There's a patchiness. There's all sorts of these nonlinear effects
*  Yes, is it?
*  It is is my impression correct that increased
*  variance in weather events is part of global climate change or is that just because
*  expectations are not quite being met in the same ways that they used to be
*  That's a that so that's that there's more to that question than perhaps people realize I
*  so
*  I
*  Are we are we seeing greater variability or are we seeing you know variability and then that that variability is shifting
*  right and I
*  You know, so that it's a statistical statement, right?
*  So is it's it's quite easy to see if there's a change in the mean, right?
*  because lower of large numbers and it's take enough data and I can see where there's a change and
*  There has been a change in the mean almost everywhere
*  On threats over the last since even since the 1970s
*  It has warmed
*  Over something like 98 percent of the planet right in in a detectable way
*  There's a few places where it hasn't there's a patch right and to the south of Greenland and there's a little band
*  around the Southern Ocean
*  Near Antarctica
*  Unfortunately, nobody lives in either of those places. So so anywhere that people live has warped right now
*  Then you say okay. Well, so has the variance changed?
*  Well as you might think like to calculate the variance where you need to have an accurate picture of what that whole distribution is
*  and that needs a lot more data right to be able to say that with
*  with with some confidence and
*  We don't why have enough data to be able to say that the variance has increased
*  We have enough data to say that the distributions have shifted. Yeah, right. So
*  Are we getting as many cold?
*  Super cold days in st. Louis or
*  Or in Baltimore. No, we're not getting as many cold fact fact the the the climates
*  In in New York and Baltimore and St. Louis have have shifted by about a month in the seasonal cycle
*  So so what used to be?
*  You know March temperature they now get in February used to be furry now get in and that and the coldest month has now just disappeared
*  And so
*  So we're seeing much less of the cold outbreaks and we're seeing much more
*  Warm embrace so if you look at the number of days above 90 degrees number of days about a hundred degrees in general
*  these have all been increasing over the last four to five decades and
*  But this last year has been the worst
*  I mean not just the worst because it's the most recent and therefore we're up there
*  But even compared to the models my impression is you're hotter than we expect it to be
*  that's true and
*  We have been
*  We you know
*  We were talking earlier on about like how surprising it is that we've learned anything. Yeah
*  And then you know, we perhaps we get a little bit complex and perhaps we then say, okay
*  Well, you know, you know, we know everything and and and for the last 10 years or so
*  On the back of both those long-term trends which we understand and then that's rushing in the in the in the tropical
*  Pacific the El Nino La Nina I
*  Think I've been doing this
*  There's a little college industry of people that kind of predict next year's temperature at the beginning of the year, right?
*  So before you've had any data
*  Just on the basis of what the trends are and then whether you're in a La Nina or in an El Nino and for 10 years
*  That made us look extremely clever
*  Right and
*  Okay. Well, it's gonna be a little bit cool. It's gonna be a little bit, you know, but but the trends are gonna be up
*  You know, here's the chance of a new record temperature and for 10 years that that worked out
*  until last year
*  Last year it was a total bust total bust like way outside any of the uncertainties that you would
*  Add into such a prediction and those those uncertainties are based on on the past data
*  Like how how good a prediction that would be given all the different things that have happened in the past, right? So you would think
*  that
*  the the noise in the system would be
*  Would be well sampled by just going back a hundred years and seeing all the things that have happened
*  But it turns out no, no, no it uh, and we were way off
*  and um
*  We still don't know why?
*  Uh, and that's that's a little uh, disquieting. Um
*  You know, is it because those empirical relationships, uh that we derived they're no longer any good because now we're in a new climate regime
*  and you know the past is no longer a
*  Predictive of the future that would be a little bit concerning
*  Um, or is there something else that's happened that that I didn't include in in that simple
*  Empirical thing so there are things that could be happening, right?
*  So, you know
*  The sun is going is is going through its cycle, uh, and we're kind of on the upswing now towards a solar maximum
*  Is it that?
*  Doesn't seem to be um, is it changes in pollution in china or in uh shipping lanes because they've switched to cleaner fuels
*  Maybe uh, but like but the the but the quantification of that has not has not matched that. Um, is it related to
*  Uh, there was a there was a quite interesting volcano that happened a couple of years ago the hunger tonga hunger hepe
*  Volcano that put a very surprising amount of uh water vapor into the stratosphere
*  It increased the stress rate water better by by 10 on its own
*  Uh, just just in in a day. It was an incredible, uh eruption. It did it hit 56 kilometers, right?
*  So that's that's over 40 miles, uh into the atmosphere and it was an underwater volcano like
*  Nuts, I mean
*  Uh, so, uh, so that's very dramatic did that did that do it?
*  And so so there's people calculating those things doesn't quite seem to add up
*  So if you take all those different things and then you add up, okay
*  Well, maybe it's a little bit of the weather here a little bit of the weather there
*  It still doesn't quite add up. Uh, and so we ended up with
*  records, uh at the end of last year, uh, august september october november, uh, were
*  Uh, like they were they were off the charts, but then they were off the charts in how much they were off the charts
*  Right, so they were breaking the records where they were breaking the records by a record breaking amount as well
*  So that's the kind of double that's record breaking squared if you like the second order record breaking
*  um
*  And uh, we don't really have a good answer for that yet
*  Uh, and I know that there's a lot of work that's being done. Uh, you know people are people are saying stuff
*  We're gonna have a uh, we're gonna have a session on this. Uh, hopefully it's uh at the uh, at the big meeting in december
*  Um, we're we're we're looking into it ourselves. Uh, but
*  We don't really have a good idea and uh, uh, and so that that
*  As I said is disquieting because well, what does that what does that mean for the future? Um, so we're still uh march
*  Just happened, uh was also a record breaking month. So we've had 10 months in a row of global record breaking months
*  uh, I think
*  march might be the last one maybe april maybe a tad but but but I think uh,
*  That that this particular run is almost done
*  Um, and we would anticipate based on those teleconnections that we have derived from the empirical, uh data
*  That as the el nino has faded in the tropical pacific
*  So we're that's kind of going away and then by the summer
*  It'll be in a kind of neutral condition and it may even go to the cool condition
*  Uh by the end of the year
*  Uh that those that those record breaking temperatures will kind of will come off that peak and will kind of will still be warm
*  We'll still have that, you know 1.5 degree warming since the pre-industrial, uh, but it won't be like bonkers
*  Um, and and we'll be back to uh being able to say oh well
*  We told you so because of the increases in u.s gases. Um, uh, but we uh
*  But right now, uh, it's it's a little bit. It's a little bit tricky
*  but if
*  I just want to understand if march
*  Only barely broke the record
*  Compared to last march which broke the record by a lot, right? So it's not like
*  No, so so the record that it was breaking, uh, was uh was march of 2016, uh, which was
*  Uh the march following the last big el nino event, right?
*  So so normally what we expect is that the el nino peaks in december january
*  And then like a couple of months later, we get the peak, uh, normally in the in the global mean temperature, right?
*  So that there's these tele connections take a while to to get out there. It doesn't happen at the speed of light. Um
*  Uh, and so, uh, we expect and
*  All the times that this has happened in the past
*  We expect the highest anomalies to happen in in seborrheum march following an el nino event
*  And up until this year until 2023 up until last year, uh, that's always what happened
*  So the fact that the highest anomalies last year were in august september and october is like
*  That's never happened before what's going on?
*  Um, but the but the fact that the anomalies are happening this year in february and march is actually very predictable
*  And so so we may be back to predictability land, uh, but but but
*  But we are shaken, uh in our confidence. Um, uh, and so, you know when uh
*  When a model kind of fails at a multiple
*  sigma level
*  Uh, then you have to go back to the model, right? Yeah
*  Well and just as a point of science because I think it's very interesting you mentioned empirical relations
*  By which I take it you mean, you know
*  in
*  In science sometimes we can start with the basics with the periodic table or with atomic physics and and electromagnetism and derive
*  Everything other times we just kind of look at what actually happened and notice the z2 variables are correlated and you're suggesting that
*  Previously reliable empirical correlations might have been off this last year and that is like you say
*  It's a little bit scary because that means
*  They can get off more and more because they were never like if it were founded in the fundamental laws of physics, right?
*  Okay, they're gonna come back. They're gonna be fine, but
*  If it's empirical and we're not exactly sure what the derivation is right changes in the underlying conditions can
*  Lead us places. We don't want to go
*  That's that's absolutely right and and you know and that ties back in with some of the things we were talking about before
*  I you know the the temperature
*  um
*  isotope relationships that people had first derived for the
*  uh for the uh for the ice cores and for things it turns out they were wrong, right because they were based on
*  uh empirical data, uh that was derived from spatial variations that we can see today
*  But really what you want is
*  Changes in time and it turns out that the things that cause things to change in time
*  Are not the same things that cause them to change in space and so empirical relationships that are derived from
*  uh not
*  From from data that's available
*  Rather than the data that you need can indeed lead you to lead you astray and it took us
*  I would say 30 years to get to the point where we could calibrate those paleo thermometers
*  accurately
*  Using multiple methods right replication
*  um and uh and then like kind of doing this forward modeling of how things uh how things are actually happening based on
*  more fundamental physics perhaps not not quite at the at the totally first principle level, but but at a much
*  Uh at a more complicated level than the than the than the empirical correlations that people would use up until now
*  Okay, so let's just get a handle on where we are now then like we had a scary year
*  Which we don't quite understand yet
*  But there is an overall trend that we're still seeing you've mentioned
*  1.5 degrees celsius as I mean that's the number that I hear for the
*  Average amount of warming over less hundred years or so. Yeah, I mean plus or minus 0.1 0.2
*  Uh, we're not actually gonna know when we cross that 1.5 threshold. There's not nobody nobody
*  There's no cosmic sign that says you've done it now
*  Bing bing bing bing. No, so so we're just gonna it may have happened. It may not happen for another 10 years. Uh, it's a little
*  What is your feeling about? Okay the next 10 20 50 years
*  I know this is late in the podcast. We can be a little speculative now
*  So, oh
*  We're going to continue to warm on the aggregates because we are continuing to put carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere
*  until we
*  I get effectively to net zero, right? So so no more addition of of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
*  Temperatures will continue to climb
*  The less we put in
*  The slower that will be but but it will effectively
*  Our best estimate of when global warming will stop is when we get to net zero. Yeah
*  We're a ways from that right, you know, there there are promising signs right so in the uk
*  They burnt less coal last year than any year since before 1800. So that's pretty impressive
*  You know per capita emissions in the u.s
*  Um, uh, you know per capita emissions in the u.s are down at like 1920s levels, uh, that's pretty impressive too, right?
*  um, I
*  You know the rollout of renewable energy is going very very well, uh, you know exponential much higher faster than expectations, etc
*  Etc, but it isn't really displacing very much of the uh of the fossil fuel
*  Um
*  uh
*  sourced
*  energy
*  and in fact a lot of the the people were even wanting to they're wanting to retire the fossil fuel plants, but then they're being bought by
*  by bitcoin miners who need an easy source of energy to
*  Make up stuff that is of no use to man or beast
*  New things to spend energy on so that's that's well that that is that is a problem. That is a problem. Um
*  Uh, but anyway, uh, so
*  There are uh
*  There are promising signs, right? Uh, you know, there are promising technological
*  Things that are happening energy efficiency is improving
*  electric vehicles
*  Not just tesla's but electric cargo bikes. So we are a big fan of electric cargo bikes like makes
*  Uh life in the city so much easier. Um, and more people should have those right and that
*  reduces the pressure on the roads reduces uh pollution levels
*  Bit of a win-win all around there are solutions that are coming out, you know cities are more livable
*  Now than they were 20 years ago pollution levels are down. They're more walkable. There's a lot more. Uh, you know
*  space for pedestrians, uh, etc, etc
*  um
*  so
*  Uh my my feelings on the matter, you know really kind of depend on on what i'm reading
*  In any particular day, right? Uh, you know, I
*  I see an interview with
*  The more uh paleo
*  Wings of various parties and they're all into oh no climate change isn't real
*  We should just burn everything and uh, and then I see the worst case scenarios
*  Uh, and then and then I see no here we we we did this solution in this small rural part of
*  of of north dakota we
*  We you know texas is uh building, you know, absolutely massive amounts of wind and solar and I think at some point last week
*  It was 70 of their grid was uh, was
*  Which this is texas. That's that's impressive, right? They're not they're not doing it for ideological reasons
*  They're doing it for practical reasons and that's that's great, right? So, um, you know the cost uh estimates of these things keep going down
*  Uh and the money available to invest in these things keep going up and you think okay
*  We're we're uh, we're we're on a good path. We're not we're not on the optimum path. We're not on the path that will
*  prevent further damage
*  Uh and uh and prevent the need for further adaptation. So
*  So we're gonna have to be doing we're gonna have to be building climate resilience
*  We're gonna have to be adapting. Uh, we're gonna have to be mitigating and you have to do all three
*  You can't you can't adapt to an ever getting worse situation, right? It has to at some point stabilize. Um, and uh,
*  And you can't just mitigate because we're already seeing the impacts and there's a lot of places that are not well adapted to even the climate
*  We have now which is not the climate we had 30 years ago
*  But they're certainly not going to be adapted to the climate. We're going to have
*  So, uh, so there's a lot of work to be done
*  Uh, I see a lot of people trying to push things in the right direction trying to improve those decisions
*  That are being made. Uh, and so that gives me uh, that gives me some uh, you know
*  I wouldn't I wouldn't say hope so much. Uh, but it doesn't depress me quite as much as seeing uh,
*  Seeing people, uh, uh, you know who know nothing
*  Like spouting on about the climate change and how we need to drill drill baby drill
*  Do you have any optimism for?
*  very at this moment hypothetical technological fixes for the atmosphere like actively going in there and poking around in the atmosphere to
*  lower
*  the greenhouse effect
*  so some of these are
*  Totally speculative some of them are based on real science that will work
*  um, uh, but
*  the but the problems that
*  The arise with these things are often not scientific, right? So so let's take let's take the most plausible
*  Uh thing that we could do which we could we could put uh sulfates into the stratosphere
*  Uh, just just as uh as has happened with big volcanoes like map in a tubo in 1991
*  And that will cool the atmosphere. Uh, it will cool the surface
*  There's no question, right? The stuff stays up there two three years. Uh, then it comes out and you have to put it back
*  um
*  But the uh, the problem the problem with that as a solution
*  Uh is that you need to keep doing it, right?
*  Until you get your emissions under control and it doesn't want to keep getting
*  Anymore you have to keep doing it and if you keep increasing your emissions then you have to increase the amount of stuff that you're doing
*  And then you say well, how long do you need to keep doing that?
*  And the answer is hundreds of years
*  And so you say okay well so are there mechanisms in place
*  that uh could ensure that this that this thing continued, uh,
*  regardless of uh wars economic downturns
*  regional configurations
*  Uh, yeah
*  People like complaining sabotage and the answer is no there's there's no there's there's no
*  There's there's there's
*  There's very it's very hard for me to see how such a system would be resilient to the stuff that we're seeing every day
*  Right, you know, uh the arrangement
*  The Indians upset that it's not raining in peran but the but it's raining in uh, the uh, the yellow river valley
*  Um, the indians upset at the failure of the monsoon and blaming it on china who's running the uh, the you know, uh
*  These are you know, these are not all rational
*  people making rational decisions and when things happen
*  people are not gonna go back and say well, let's just have a uh, let's have a uh, a solid
*  Scientific commission and work out exactly why this is going on unless you do for us
*  Oh that people are just gonna start shooting at each other
*  And so uh, the chances that the a system of solar radiation management is what they call it. Um is um,
*  Uh will be robust to like the standard level geopolitical crises that we see every day
*  Seems entirely fanciful
*  Uh, and that means that if you start you will stop and when you stop it's much much worse, right?
*  It's like all of that climate change in like a year
*  Right, and and you know, we're having trouble dealing with it when it's been over 100 years and now you're saying okay
*  Well, we're gonna make let's make it stop for a little bit and then everything that we didn't have
*  Uh, we're just gonna have all at once
*  And it's like
*  Uh, that's that's that's recipe for an absolute disaster. And so so people that put their faith in that
*  I think are um
*  Uh, they're they're taking a much bigger risk, uh than than than perhaps they realize
*  No, that's a very good point. I actually had not thought of it. I mean as we said before
*  the changes to
*  Weather patterns over the earth are sort of you know
*  multifaceted, etc. So
*  Maybe you could probably make an argument that anything that would make the overall climate better would make someone's climate worse
*  Uh, well, yes, yes, and and and who and who decides?
*  Right that we don't we don't have we don't have a global governing council
*  Uh to decide exactly who the winners and losers are going to be. It's effectively it's fought out literally. It's fought out and um
*  you know and losers are not usually very happy about that, uh, and so I I
*  I I don't see it as a uh as a solution that is um
*  Gonna lead us down the uh, the the primrose path to uh to peace and world prosperity
*  I did recently interview henna richie. I don't know if you know her work. I do know. Yes
*  He has a new book out arguing that like look things are very bad, but we can't just say things are bad
*  We also have to give people some hope. Otherwise they they stop fighting for it
*  I mean, do you have uh, you've been in the public sphere having these arguments for a long time. Uh, do you have any?
*  Since we're near the end of the podcast
*  Do you have any like words for the audience in terms of both the attitude they should take towards these challenges and how to?
*  Maybe even do something at the small individual level to make things just a little bit better
*  All right. So let me let me make let me make two points. Um, yeah, you know, I yeah
*  You know, I don't think that as scientists we are obligated to give people hope like that's not really our job
*  We're not we're not motivational speakers
*  We're you know trying to tell people what is going on in the real world and if you don't like it, well
*  The real world doesn't care
*  Uh, nonetheless, right, you know, there are things that that derive from the science
*  that are
*  The people like to hear
*  right
*  Um, one of the things that people like to hear is the fact that if we get to net zero global warming will stop
*  If we got to net zero tomorrow
*  The warming would would stabilize. I mean the sea level would continue to rise a little bit but slower and etc
*  et cetera, but the temperatures which a lot of the weather extremes are associated with would effectively stabilize
*  uh, and that means that any
*  future change in temperatures is actually related to future emissions
*  Which means that we are in control
*  Yeah, which means that we as a society and and the the rich emitting parts of that society are in control
*  um
*  Uh, and we have agency
*  Uh, which means that you know, it's like it's not hopeless in in that sense, right? We have agency
*  Now what do we do with our agents? How do we how do we translate our feelings our personal feelings and our personal actions into?
*  Our agency that makes a difference at the global scale, right? The key thing to remember
*  Is that we wear many hats
*  right
*  Um, we're consumers sure, you know, we can make better decisions as consumers. Uh, we're commuters
*  We can make better decisions as commuters or we could not commute at all
*  um
*  But we are often members of our faith community. We are often members of the parent teacher association. We
*  Uh can go to our town halls. We can go
*  We can go to our city halls. We can vote in our local and state and federal
*  Elections we can write letters to the editor. We can put comments on blogs. We can run a podcast
*  Uh, we can get our voice out there if you have something interesting to say keep saying it and eventually people will hear you
*  um
*  our uh, our our influence
*  Uh is not limited by our consumer choices, right?
*  That would be bizarre that when you think about gretta thunberg, uh, whatever you think about her personally, it's clear that
*  Uh a swedish school girl with no disposable income has had a massive global effect
*  right now not everybody is going to be uh a a gretta, but
*  I
*  We can find ways to multiply
*  Uh our voice our opinion, uh our body of thought beyond
*  You know just choosing to uh to recycle some plastic bottles or something
*  But
*  Let me finish on one thing which is kind of related to that to that same thing
*  Um, I said we we wear multiple hats, right?
*  uh, and we've been talking about making predictions and uh, you know doing science and
*  Uh, you you you might you might understand this like so where where where is the joy of being a scientist come from, right?
*  It comes from
*  observing things in the universe
*  Encapsulating that in a theory encapsulating ends in some code and then making predictions about things that you haven't already seen
*  And when you make those predictions and those predictions are skillful and you say, okay. Well, I have a useful theory
*  I've done something great. I've taken i've taken the the the vast
*  Incohate mass of information that's sitting out there and i've turned it into something useful. We're supposed to feel
*  Happy we're supposed to to to find um satisfaction in our job because we've made successful predictions
*  But when the predictions that you make suck
*  Even if they're accurate
*  It's no it's not joyful. It's not satisfying. It brings me absolutely no joy
*  To be able to tell people
*  That the next decade is going to be warmer than the last decade and it was warmer than the decade before that
*  Uh, it gives me no joy to tell people that oh, yeah, we're going to have another record-breaking year
*  Uh this year next year whenever
*  Um, because i'm not a sociopath
*  I'm a scientist, but i'm also a person and and we live this dichotomy
*  You know the the people who are working in this in this area and this and we're not the only scientists to work in
*  In a troublesome era there. I mean like you sit you look at uh, at ophenheimer and you say okay. Oh look
*  Look what we've done
*  Oh shit. What have we done? Um
*  Uh, it's it's it's it's a very uh, it it actually runs through a lot of science, right?
*  What what do you do?
*  When you have predictions that work, but you don't want to see them come true
*  And uh, you know that was that was encapsulated by shirley roland who won the noel prize for um,
*  for
*  the chemistry of ozone depletion
*  And and he said he said exactly that in a in a new york article. What is the point of sitting around?
*  Waiting for your predictions to come
*  right
*  and and so
*  We don't right so so in fact right now
*  The joy
*  The satisfaction that one gets from being a scientist now is being able to tell people what is happening and having people act
*  uh accordingly
*  um, and having them understand
*  What it is that that is happening?
*  in order to avoid
*  Our predictions being correct
*  Well, I hope that being on this episode can
*  Move you epsilon closer to feeling that uh feeling of accomplishment because I think that you you know, you really
*  Look up. Yeah, i'll be i'll be very honest
*  Like I have mixed feelings about talking about climate change because I know what's happening. The science is fascinating
*  But I very much feel that frustration. Uh,
*  The sort of sense of banging your head against a wall that that you alluded to but I think this is going to energize people
*  I think this might just do it. I think this episode might eventually solve climate change. That's my guess. Yeah
*  Well, thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast. You're awesome. Thank you very much
*  You
