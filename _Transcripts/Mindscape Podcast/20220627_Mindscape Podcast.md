The United States is suffering from an epidemic of tragic gun violence. While a political debate rages around the topic of gun control, it remains important to understand the causes and possible remedies for gun violence within the current system. Andrew Papachristos is a sociologist who uses applied network science to study patterns of street violence in urban areas. His research shows that such violence is highly non-random; knowing something about the social networks of perpetrators and victims can help identify who might be at heightened risk of gun violence. Itâ€™s an interesting example of applying ideas from mathematics and computer science to real-world social situations.

Andrew Papachristos received his Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago. He is currently a professor of sociology at Northwestern University, and a faculty fellow at the Institute for Policy Research. He is also founding director of the Northwestern Neighborhoods and Networks Initiative.

# Mindscape 202 | Andrew Papachristos on the Network Theory of Gun Violence
**Mindscape Podcast:** [June 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qil35nuukjg)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. It's undoubtedly very
*  well known at this point that there is a problem with gun violence in the United States, especially
*  compared to other countries. People debate how best to measure this, but compared to the countries
*  that the US would generally consider its peers, that is to say other developed wealthy, purportedly
*  well-functioning societies, the United States has a lot more gun violence per capita than any of our
*  comparison nations. Now I feel a little bit weird because we're gonna be talking today about gun
*  violence, but not about the kind of mass shootings that have been in the news recently. As I'm
*  recording this intro, recently there was a mass shooting in Uvald, Texas. There have been others,
*  really terrible events where someone is able to get a weapon that fires a lot of ammunition very,
*  very quickly, break into a school or other kind of place where there's a lot of people, and do
*  an enormous amount of damage. This is clearly a problem. We're not talking about that one today.
*  There are other problems out there. So today we're talking to Andrew Papachristos. Andrew is a
*  sociologist at Northwestern University just outside Chicago, and what he's doing is using ideas from
*  network theory, something that we talked about before with people like Steven Strogatz. Andrew
*  uses network theory to predict what kinds of people and specifically which people might be
*  vulnerable to imminent gun violence, but not in the mass shooting sense, more like the gangs on
*  the street, crews that get into flare-ups where they start firing at each other kind of violence.
*  It's an interesting problem that sort of combines criminology, sociology, and math, because you use
*  the math of the network theory to say, well, this person is in the following network in the following
*  ways with these other people that puts them at greater risk than they might otherwise be. For
*  better or for worse, we have a lot of data out there on people, on who they talk to, who they know,
*  who they've been in prison with, who they've been in a gang with, things like that. And the good news
*  is that we can use that data to say, okay, this specific set of people might be at greater risk.
*  Right now, because there's recently been another shooting, now you can go in and try to protect the
*  people who are more at risk than others. It's not an any sense of panacea, be all and all way to end
*  gun violence, but we have so much here in the United States that it is a strategy that might be
*  helpful when we're trying to deploy the resources we have in the most effective ways. I'm not
*  personally enough of an expert to say whether or not this is the right way to go or the best way to
*  use our resources, but it certainly is an interesting combination of mathematical analysis,
*  big data kind of analysis of sociological phenomena and real world applications that
*  might help us to maybe save a few lives here or there. If we could do that, that'd be well worth
*  the effort. So let's go.
*  Andrew Papachristos, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.
*  Gun violence is what you work on as a professional pastime. Whenever I get people on the podcast
*  who work on these slightly touchy subjects, I'm kind of curious because I work on physics and
*  cosmology and philosophy in the beginning of the universe. And even those are touchy subjects.
*  People get very emotional about them. But you work on gun violence, which I imagine must engender
*  some reactions from people who hear about your work in the media.
*  It definitely does. I mean, gun violence is not unique to America, but there is a uniquely
*  American take on gun violence and what Americans think about guns and how we use guns and our
*  history with guns and the number of guns we have. And so, you know, I think a lot of what I try to
*  do is understand the science behind gun violence. And there are, of course, interventions and
*  preventions and policy measures that can reduce or make things worse. But by and large, what I try
*  to do is I try to approach it as a social scientist to figure out how we can understand these patterns
*  that we see, especially in cities and especially when people are harming each other as opposed to
*  suicide, which is the most common form of lethal gun violence in this country, which is quite
*  different. So I try to look at assaultive gun violence when people use firearms to kill other
*  people. And I try to really kind of unpack those patterns that we see, not just aggregate
*  statistics, so that we can hopefully do something about that problem and the situations that create
*  them and the currents that are both big and small that keep these levels of gun violence
*  unacceptably and stubbornly high in some places rather than other places.
*  Well, you mentioned already the fact that there is something uniquely American about this.
*  Can we let's try to quantify that, because I think a lot of us recognize that America is an outlier
*  when it comes to gun violence in various ways. So is that are we right about that? And how much is
*  it? And why is that true? Simple questions. Simple questions. So clearly, you know,
*  the United States is not unique relative to say other European countries when it comes to things
*  like robbery or non gun assaults. We are unique when it comes to our gun homicide and gun assault
*  levels of violence, which are, you know, tens of times higher than some of our other peers or who
*  we consider to be our peers. Part of this, of course, is the presence of firearms. We have more
*  guns in this country than people, which is not to say those guns are evenly distributed across
*  households. They are not. Most people that own a gun own multiple guns, which is, again, not
*  uncommon of people that are into something, right? Some people are into shoes and sneakers
*  and cars, and some people are into guns for whatever reason. So there's a unique part of
*  this country that is about, you know, owning a gun. It is a constitutional right and is being
*  upheld by the Supreme Court. There's also something uniquely American about the idea of arming
*  ourselves to protect ourselves. So the number one reason people carry or own a firearm in this
*  country is for protection. And then sort of the tricky science part is actually owning and carrying
*  guns actually makes you less safe. So despite that, this idea that guns will keep us safe is
*  pervasive. And it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether you live in the suburbs. Doesn't
*  matter whether you live in a neighborhood that is experiencing a disproportionate amount of gun
*  violence. The reason people carry guns is for protection. There's also an element in this
*  country, which, you know, this last surge in gun purchasing during the epidemic, people also arm
*  themselves when they feel like they have to take care of themselves outside of the confines of the
*  state. The state has let them down. The state's not protecting their interests or the state is
*  actively harming them, which also goes back to the founding of this country. And it doesn't just apply
*  to one particular group or the other. You know, the Black Panthers armed themselves for that very
*  reason. And we're seeing, you know, militias arming themselves for that very reason. And
*  private citizens purchase guns because they feel like they might have to protect their own selves
*  because they can't rely on somebody to come when they call. So I think this is implicit in what you
*  just said, but it's not just a matter of having more guns. If I recall correctly, Canadians have
*  more guns per capita than Americans do. But the culture is very different. You're really putting
*  your finger on the way that we think about guns and why we own them. I think that's right. I also
*  think it's fair to say that there are guns that are the ones we associate with violence,
*  interpersonal violence, which are handguns, which are handguns that are often diverted
*  from legal sources to illegal sources. So, you know, they are bought, they're stolen,
*  they're traded, they're stock, straw purchasers. This idea of a gun show loophole is not actually
*  about gun shows as much as the lack of regulation for private transactions, which is in most states
*  in this country. I could sell you a gun without telling anybody. Right. Yeah. There are certain
*  rules that I am supposed to uphold. You have to be of age. I have to reasonably believe you
*  wouldn't fail a background check, but I don't have to do a background check if I'm a private citizen.
*  Just selling a gun like I'm selling a private car to somebody. So there are guns that are the
*  ones that are a problem, and they are those guns. They're not all guns, largely handguns that are
*  acquired illegally or that have somehow been diverted from these sorts of sources, which is
*  also unique because they're durable. Right. Guns are by and large durable goods. They're not like,
*  say, drugs or some other food, whether you eat them, you ingest them, they're gone, you get more.
*  Guns stay around for a long time. So they move around. You mentioned that suicides are actually
*  the largest form, largest way that guns kill people in the US. Give us a sense of the numbers,
*  not just of suicides versus homicides, but also of what kinds of homicides we're talking about.
*  I know that when you study gun homicides in cities, that's a very different kind of thing
*  than might happen in rural areas or suburbs or whatever. Right. I don't have the suicide figures
*  in front of me when we're there, but by and large, I'm pretty sure where there's like
*  almost five to one suicides for every gun homicide in this country.
*  But sorry to put you on the spot. I didn't mean to do that.
*  No, no. I don't study suicide. So oftentimes, I neglect it as well. We talk about it in class,
*  but it's not something I spend a lot of time on. But the point is, it's not 10% more than homicides.
*  It's many times several times. Yeah, absolutely. When we're talking about
*  assaultive violence where you fire a gun at somebody and they get hit or they get hit and die.
*  I should say we know very little about non-fatal shootings because data is very poor. Even in
*  cities like Chicago, there are five or six to one non-fatal shootings for every fatal shooting. So
*  you have literally tens of thousands of people who are injured with firearms that we know very
*  little about. When it comes to homicides, which we have better data on, not perfect data, there are
*  different types. It's important to distinguish at least three of these types. One is, of course,
*  our course mass shootings, spree shootings, the kinds we see that are going around the country
*  again right now. As we're seeing in shopping malls and schools. And those are quite distinct from
*  other two real types. One is intimate partner violence, which is again, extremely serious,
*  but a very different sort than the third, which is the lion's share of gun homicides, which is
*  essentially assaults, people that know each other, arguments, disputes. And that's commonly,
*  that's kind of what shows up on the front page more often than not. And part of the reason it
*  gets more attention besides the large volume, the largest volume of gun homicides is oftentimes
*  it's public, right? Intimate partner violence happens behind closed doors. So we often don't
*  hear about it. We don't know a lot about it. It's an expressing problem, which needs attention
*  as our mass shootings. But the everyday sort of assaultive violence is the stuff that
*  we often talk about. It's the stuff I focus on. It's also the stuff that creates
*  additional trauma in communities. You're exposed to it. Somebody shot on your block. It impacts you.
*  It impacts your kids. It impacts a school. It impacts the police. Those are the sorts of
*  work that violence that we look at. So you said you seem to say when mentioning
*  assaultive violence against people who you know, or a rival gang or something like that,
*  does that category also include if someone robs a bank and it goes terribly wrong and they kill
*  somebody? Yeah, I would actually include them. That happens much more rarely than the former,
*  of course. There could be even a fourth category of state violence, especially those
*  shot by police. And then again, of course, you branch off into, was it the commission of a crime?
*  Was it a traffic stop? Was it a mistaken identity? Was it intentional? But in that case,
*  again, those are smaller portions of the total. The majority of gun homicides are these
*  assaultive interactions, essentially. So that already tells us something that when there is
*  going to be an assaultive homicide, or rather, let's just broaden it. When someone is killed
*  with a gun by another person, it sounds like usually if it's not a mass shooting, it's by
*  someone who they know or have some connection with in some more abstract way. That's right.
*  This idea of stranger homicide is actually quite rare. Two-thirds that we know of are by people
*  that are known to the person who was injured or killed. And the other third, we actually just
*  don't know. It's not that that other third is strangers. It's just that we just don't know who
*  did it. And by the way, your enemy is often not a stranger. The person who you got into a fight
*  with is often not a stranger. They usually say, you know, from your neighborhood, from your class,
*  from work, from the pub. They're not unknown. You know them. You just might not like them,
*  which is different than stranger because when we read about this in the media, of course,
*  the fear that is stoked is that it can happen to anybody. It can happen anywhere.
*  There are stray bullet killings that accidentally kill somebody, but that is, again, not the norm.
*  Most of this violence is happening in social networks, in small communities,
*  that people are known to each other. And I think it's important that we understand that. They're
*  all tragic, but they're not random. Of course. And I think that helps us understand solutions as well.
*  I mean, just to get on the table, the idea, I think that exactly because this is such a
*  hot button issue and such an emotional issue, some people will be upset when you talk about certain
*  types of gun violence and not others, right? Or you're choosing to focus on something.
*  And I'll just go on the record as saying that I would like to understand it all so that we can
*  diminish the rate of all of it, no matter what kind of gun violence it is.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think that's fair. I think the only reason it's important to unpack it is the
*  treatment, if you will, or the response is not necessarily the same.
*  Exactly. Right.
*  You know, and I do think it's important because we often talk about gun violence as an epidemic
*  or public health problem, which it is. If we take that literally, though, we do need to understand
*  whether it was intimate partner violence versus a mass shooting is going to elicit a different
*  response. Right. It's very hard to predict in any real sense, mass shootings. You can look
*  for warning signs. There are things like red flag laws, which are when you prohibit somebody
*  from owning a firearm that can reduce intimate partner violence and mass shootings. But then
*  there are other things that would necessarily apply to say, you know, a young man on Chicago's
*  West Side who's involved with a dispute and a crew, right? They're not using legal firearms.
*  No flag would go off. They're probably outside of, say, a school system or a health system
*  where a red flag would pop up. So the response needs to fit the sort of conditions, at least
*  in some sense. So just to ground us with some specifics, one of the papers that I saw of yours,
*  I think that you sent me, was about the very short period of time between June 18 and July 5, 2020.
*  So not long after lockdowns had begun with COVID and so forth, but there was a real spur to violence
*  in Chicago. So you're in Chicago, right? You're at where you are. Sorry. Northwestern. You're
*  not really in Chicago. You're in the suburbs, but you're right there. I used to live in Chicago in,
*  you know, Lakeview. So again, not that much risk of gun violence in my neighborhood, although there
*  was a lot of risk of like drunken people coming out of Wrigley Field and swinging baseball bats,
*  but that's a different worry. So you're looking at shootings in very localized neighborhoods,
*  relatively, in Chicago. And so if I have the numbers right from that paper you wrote,
*  in that two or three week period, there were 416 shootings, 74 of which were fatal. So
*  what do we know about why that happened? Was it just stir craziness from COVID? Was it pre-existing
*  conditions that just coincidentally erupted or what? Well, I think if I had the answer to the
*  why it went up question, I would be on the front page of every paper. I think academics and
*  criminologists have lots of theories about why it went up. And there are many of them, one of
*  which is, yeah, people's routine activities changed and they changed in a way that led to increases
*  in gun violence, but decreases in other sorts of violence. So it's hard to break in your house if
*  you're home, but if you're sitting at home looking at something at social media and your opposition
*  is taunting you, well, you know right where they are and you don't have any place else to go. So
*  it changed the way people could respond. Intimate partner violence would also go up if you're at home
*  with your abuser and can't get out. So there are lots of reasons. It's hard to say which one it
*  does. It also seems to be clear that people started carrying more guns during this time period because
*  they were afraid because a lot of things were happening. But that report you mentioned point
*  out the work my team and I have been doing for the past decade, which is when it comes
*  to gun violence in cities. And here we've studied Chicago and Boston and Oakland and New York and
*  Newark and Cincinnati and New Orleans and even Evanston, which is where Northwestern lives.
*  And we've noticed a pattern that is consistent, which is gun violence concentrates in very,
*  very small social networks, even in communities that have high levels of gun violence or experience
*  high levels of gun violence. Generally, the victims and potential perpetrators of shootings
*  are in a network of a couple hundred people, right? Or depending on the city or neighborhood,
*  a couple thousand people. So in our study of Boston, 85% of all fatal and non-fatal shootings
*  happened in a network of 700 people, less than 4% of this community's population.
*  And in Chicago, and we did the whole city of Chicago, again, less than 4%, about 75%
*  of the fatal and non-fatal shootings. And when I'm talking about networks here,
*  I'm talking about instances where people were either engaging in a crime together or arrested
*  together or were co-involved in an event that elicits some system response. But we can think
*  of it broadly as the people you hang out with. The people that hang out with that would have
*  your back in a fight tend to be your network. And it turns out what we found in Chicago in general,
*  but during this three-week period, was that your probability of being a victim is directly related
*  to how many people around you are getting shot. So if you're friends, if you're in parts of a
*  network where victimizations are happening, your probability skyrockets. And in fact,
*  these can create cascades. So one person gets shot, and then a few days later, somebody else,
*  or months later, somebody else. It's almost like a chain, a chain reaction, if you will.
*  And what we found during those three-week period was all of these old well-worn pathways,
*  these old networks that had been in the neighborhood, sometimes active, sometimes
*  unactive, started popping up. So again, not in new places or unexpected places, but among
*  groups and individuals and crews who were already at high level of risk, all of a sudden,
*  the light started going off and shooting started to happen. And in one of these chains, for instance,
*  there was four shootings in 10 days. And another one, there was six shootings within 15 or 16 days.
*  But again, a sequence that was knowable and predictable, potentially. And part of what we
*  were arguing and continuing to argue is that that's the sort of information that can be actionable
*  for on the ground violence prevention efforts to try to get ahead of not just shootings, but trauma
*  and responses to people who might be victimized. So the idea is that, obviously,
*  different sets of people have different likelihoods of being in one of these terrible
*  shootings, depending on your income, your geographical location, your race, your age,
*  and things like that. But you're saying there's even more fine-grained data about who your friends
*  are that could be used to really say, no, you in particular are at heightened risk.
*  Right. So the first way you described it are usually what we call the risk factors approach.
*  And to summarize a century of research, living in a poor neighborhood, being young, being black or
*  Latino, being male, all of those things carry high levels of risk in this country for a great
*  many things, from heart disease to dropping out of school, but especially to gun homicide,
*  to being a victim of gun homicides, one of the leading causes of death for young black men in
*  this country and young black women. Latinos, of course, have higher rates than their white peers.
*  But by and large, this is one of the main killers of young men of color. But when you start to look
*  at a city like Chicago and say you're going to, again, say the west side of Chicago, well, those
*  risk factors describe 90,000 people. And I'm using air quotes here for the radio, only a few hundred
*  will get shot. So it's not being poor or being in a neighborhood that has been disinvested in and
*  segregated for centuries. That's part of it. But most people that live there don't get shot
*  or don't shoot anybody. So how do you go from these structural conditions, which are real,
*  which create these networks, to trying to figure out who's in harm's way today? And that's the jump
*  we take. You want to create small networks with a lot of guns in them, you have a segregated
*  neighborhood with high rise housing projects and you close schools. But that condition is there
*  and it needs attention. And in the meantime, you have to save lives. And this network focus
*  is more triage than it is changing structural conditions. But you need to do both, of course.
*  But it is a piece of information instead of analytics that can be used to potentially,
*  again, mitigate trauma and maybe reduce harm while you're trying to figure out the big stuff.
*  But the end result is not a vague description of risk factors. It is potentially some estimates of
*  Sean's in harm's way or Andy's friends are getting shot, maybe we should reach out to Andy.
*  And that becomes actionable for, again, for on the ground prevention efforts.
*  So was this particular jump in June, July 2020 a Chicago phenomenon or did it happen in other
*  places as well in the US? So it happened in most, it happened across the US. Chicago is definitely
*  not unique, nor was Chicago the highest increase. I mean, some of the highest increases happened in
*  cities we're not talking about. Buffalo, Flint, Newark, Chicago did horribly. Let's just be clear.
*  But it affected the whole country as a whole. Chicago probably had the highest number,
*  which we continue to do, but we're not usually the highest per capita. And Chicago had a horrible
*  2021. Things are looking a little bit better so far this year in Chicago, but it's way too early
*  to know what's going to happen. I mean, this might be jumping ahead, but is there some sociological,
*  theoretical explanation of why Chicago in particular is very bad? When you say like
*  Buffalo, Flint, I can see economic issues that are looming very large. Chicago seems to be
*  economically to be doing pretty well, at least it was when I lived there. Obviously, it has a
*  tremendous history of segregation and racial issues, but other cities do too, New York, LA,
*  whatever. I mean, or there might just be kind of special circumstances that we can't explain
*  with some grand sociological theory. Well, first of all, Chicago is special. Let's just be clear.
*  It's the greatest city in the world. However, to answer your question, Chicago, I would say today,
*  the best comparison would be Los Angeles in the 1990s. Some of the things that keep Chicago's
*  homicide rate higher than its peers, and it often gets compared to New York and LA,
*  has to do with the levels and the size of the city. What keeps Chicago unique, one of the things
*  outside of segregation, racist housing policies and all the things that kind of create neighborhoods
*  that have high crime rates and keep them that way, is its history of gangs in the city,
*  which is fundamentally different than some of those other cities. LA had a similar history,
*  as did New York, but their gangs didn't grow as big and as pervasive as Chicago's in terms of the
*  level of organization and politicization, and that still lingers to this day. Guns, Chicago recovers
*  more guns. There are more guns in Chicago than there are in New York or LA, and part of that is
*  not necessarily the city's gun laws or the states, but our proximity to states like Indiana,
*  which is where our second largest source of guns come from, which is largely a cash and carry
*  state. The two other ones which are really important, and there are others, one is the
*  continued dominance of a political machine system, which has slowly changed over time,
*  but that's part of what keeps crime in some neighborhoods and not in other neighborhoods.
*  It creates the boundaries, almost criminological gerrymandering, in a sense where, I'm going to
*  actually write that one down. It's pretty much what you have. If you're a powerful ward boss,
*  you can get services. Cops will come. They will do sweeps and serve warrants. The last thing,
*  which is so important in Chicago, is of course the utter lack of, I'm using the word reform
*  broadly, but change in policing in this city. I point to LA because LA had similar gangs to
*  Chicago in the 90s. Horrific scandals in policing. The Rampart scandal was one of the worst in the
*  history of this country. It's no longer the worst. Chicago is beating it with the new Watts scandal,
*  but it was one of the worst, and they had a consent decree, and they had massive shakeup
*  of that department. Now, I'm not saying that's the solution because the same time LA did that,
*  they also started their grid office, which was their public office for gun violence reduction.
*  Chicago just started that office two years ago. We haven't seen the reforms for the justice system.
*  We haven't seen investment and on the ground community violence prevention, and our gangs
*  and our politics were stuck essentially decades behind. I think those are some of the key, key
*  reasons that keep our homicide levels higher. I actually think we need to address all of those,
*  starting from systemic racism all the way up to investments in community violence intervention
*  efforts to see real change in Chicago. But maybe the optimistic way of reading what you just said
*  is that police reform and changing in police practices or neighborhood, I don't know,
*  outreach practices, et cetera, could potentially have a really big positive impact.
*  I think they can. I think the key is you have to do them all at once. I think going back to the
*  networks we study, yeah, you can stop bleeding in networks, but the network is huge and it's going
*  to win. Unless you do something to mitigate, say, people's entrance into the network or dissipate,
*  say, segregation that can do those sorts of things, you're just going to try to stop the water from
*  coming through the dam in some ways. For example, when you look at trying to change policing
*  efforts and investment in community-based violence prevention efforts, Chicago's,
*  again, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but it's the largest single investment in community
*  violence intervention in the city's history, upwards of $36 million. That's a police budget
*  of $2 billion, right? We have 12,000 police officers and you have 200 street outreach workers
*  in the city. You're trying to build a profession of, say, street outreach with good investment for
*  the first time ever, but it's not on par with what it even needs to be close to being. I think
*  you have to get those things. I did mention in LA, they both had some serious efforts at changing
*  the structure of policing as they were also increasing investments in community violence
*  prevention. They were doing those things at the same time. If you look at Los Angeles today and
*  their grid office, they have officers that are assigned to these community places. Is the
*  relationship always great? No, but there is information sharing. There are accountability
*  mechanisms in place and there are just some things that we need to figure out that we're
*  just starting. I actually do think that the starting of the office, or excuse me, the expansion of the
*  Office for Violence Prevention in Chicago is great. The state of Illinois also just created its own
*  Office for Violence Prevention. That is hugely important. It turns out there are other cities
*  in Illinois and some of them need a lot of help and they haven't been getting attention
*  because of the dominance of Chicago and the public narrative.
*  I wanted to ask more about the gangs because clearly they play an important role and I suspect
*  that the typical person's view of gangs and how they work, etc., doesn't perfectly match up with
*  the reality of it, especially since you said how Chicago was especially a prevalent case.
*  Since I lived in both Chicago and LA, if you asked me, I would have said LA is the gang city
*  much more than Chicago is. Is that just because I'm out of date? You haven't realized Chicago's
*  specialness enough, essentially. I don't know enough about LA in terms of its neighborhood
*  factors. I would assume it's more similar to Chicago. Today, street gangs in Chicago cruise
*  cliques. They're much smaller than they were in their heyday of the 90s. They're very neighborhood
*  based. There are some groups that are still more organized and involved in high-level
*  criminal activities, but very few. There are, by some estimates, 900 small cliques and crews in
*  the city of Chicago. Most of them, again, are bound to a particular neighborhood, a couple blocks
*  that they have been. Their history goes back years and years and years and decades.
*  The dynamics change quickly. A lot of it has to do with, in Chicago, it's tied to, again,
*  old disputes, new disputes, things that might flare up online and could lead to offline violence,
*  which happens, but not as often as the media would have you think. But they're small. There's small
*  crews that are really tied to a neighborhood and their friends. That part is not as different than
*  groups in other cities. It's this long legacy, the length with which people can trace back
*  their ties to such and such a group goes back generations. It has meaning, gives meaning to
*  life. Sometimes it's a voice of resistance. Sometimes it's a voice of protection.
*  And that's one of the things that happens. As a real simple example, when you ask people
*  how they find their guns, the idea of a gang, the fundamental reason people join gangs
*  is for protection, which is the same reason people buy guns. And who in Chicago are more
*  likely to have guns? Gang members. So if you're feeling you need protection, safety in numbers,
*  and they have access to weapons, that's kind of a dangerous mix for the people who are involved,
*  because it really does. The truth is, the more you're involved, the more likely you are to get
*  harmed. And even though you need safety and that fact that people feel so unsafe, they're willing
*  to do things they know will make them less safe, speaks to the just the level of need there is to
*  make people, especially young people feel safe in schools and their community and their homes.
*  That's a tall order. That's a tall order that is not just one system or one agency.
*  It's definitely a whole level thing. And so it's not just the essence of what is going on with the
*  gangs here. It's not Al Capone and a machine that is doing big high level crime or anything like
*  that. It's more like a local social, us against the world kind of thing. If I'm a kid growing up
*  in a certain block of Chicago, what you're telling me is that life is tough. It's dangerous out
*  there. And I'm going to seek safety in the gang that has been either running, I guess, or at least
*  involved with my block for decades now. That's right. And I just want to just reiterate again,
*  you know, if there are 900 crews in Chicago, there are probably a handful that are actively involved
*  in some organized stuff. And every year, every other year, you'll see a big federal case from
*  the US Attorney's Office. Those four or five groups that are involved in that should be treated,
*  you know, in that way, figure out the activities. But that means, you know, 895 of them are not.
*  And so the danger when it comes to policy is that you treat those 895 or 885 as if they were Al
*  Capone, right? Or the gangster disciples of the 90s or whatever the case might be. And they're just
*  not. And that's the slippery slope with gang policies. Gangs become, you know, a catch-all
*  for everything bad and evil and the boogeyman. And in reality, most are, as you described,
*  a crew of people on the block who are protecting themselves and their friends. And by the way,
*  you know, sometimes avenging them. And that creates problems that need resolution for sure.
*  But, you know, I think, again, I think our US Attorney's Office in Illinois makes these big
*  cases because they can't because it's happening. But we have to remember that most groups are not
*  that. Most groups are these these sort of side corner groups. And some of them are a little bit
*  bigger, but they're small. And they're they the history is there. And it's tied to a very specific
*  place that's been segregated and locked up and locked out for generations. Other than just sort
*  of mutual protection or even just socializing or the gangs also involved in the drug trade or petty
*  crimes or protection rackets, anything like that. I don't know what the lifetime of the gang members
*  really like, to be honest. I think so. I think the the best way to describe, you know, delinquent or
*  criminal activity of gangs is cafeteria style. So which is most groups do a little of this,
*  a little of that. We sell something, we steal something, we're bored, we're at a party, we fight.
*  Most of it is not extremely well thought out or planned. Quite the opposite. Most of it's very
*  haphazard. You know, violence is ever present in their lives. It occupies, it consumes,
*  traumatizes and re-traumatizes. But they don't spend every day. In fact, they spend most of their
*  days in total compliance with the law, playing video games, looking at social media,
*  you know, hanging out like basically what young people do or people in their 20s do.
*  Most of it is not spent, you know, thinking about or even engaging in crime. But violence is ever
*  present. It really does consume all of their energy and time, but it's not something they're
*  engaging in constantly. If that were true, the, you know, the levels of violence would be even
*  worse than they are, but it's not. It's sporadic, it's rare, but traumatic and lingers like a ghost,
*  you know, on the block that haunts them and rehaunts them.
*  â€“ I'm kind of intrigued by the role of social media here, which I never really thought of. Like,
*  are the gangs insulting each other on Twitter or how is this working?
*  â€“ Yeah. So I'm going to have to defer to some of my great colleagues, Forest Stewart at Stanford,
*  Desmond Patton at Columbia and Jeffrey Lane at Rutgers. You know, it's complicated. So first of
*  all, I don't know anybody between 14 and say 26 who's not on social media. So it's important to
*  distinguish this is just normal behavior, being on social media, connecting, you know, ribbing
*  people, trolling people. It's not necessarily nice behavior, trolling people, but it's just part of,
*  I have teenagers myself, right? It's just part of, you know, what we do as a society.
*  What's happening on social media is people are using it to, you know, taunt rivals, to disrespect
*  rivals, to honor their friends. As one of our colleagues, Desmond Patton, talks about to express
*  grief deeply in ways that are hard to do in other spaces. All of that's playing out online.
*  The vast majority of these things that happen online never end up in violence, right? They are,
*  in fact, ways to do symbolic violence, which is not good either, to be clear. The problem is,
*  of course, when it does lead to offline violence. And we don't actually know enough about it yet
*  to understand what it does. It does seem, in my assessment, it does seem to make things ramp up
*  much more quickly because it's nonstop, right? And it can, you know, especially where music is
*  concerned, drill music, you can tell your story and it's out there and now other people can view
*  it. So it's almost public, it's public displays. People are watching and seeing and reacting,
*  which is not different than what people do offline, except it's immediate and you have
*  a broader audience. It can spread very quickly. But again, the link between online and offline
*  violence is it's hard to make it causal, but it definitely does happen. And I think people are
*  working on it to try and understand, you know, how can that be used? Because I will also tell you,
*  outreach workers in the city use it to calm things down as well, right? So you can use those tools.
*  And there are plenty of people talking about, well, can we have trained social workers in
*  this space or people that can respond? And outreach workers and violence preventionists are doing that
*  naturally. But again, it's sort of part of what you do. You got somebody's name, you look them up,
*  you Google them, right? So of course, it's going to permeate that part of work and culture as well.
*  Part of me wants to say that we should, you know, try to replace actual fights with guns on the
*  streets with fights in World of Warcraft or something like that. But I think you're probably
*  like you're implying maybe that if they did that, it would just spill over into the streets anyway.
*  So that's not the right thing to do. But well, again, I think we just need to take stock of where
*  we are as a society. This is not new, right? We used to the 1940s, there were entire senatorial
*  hearings on Mickey Mouse and comic books and Mad Magazine. Because it was a new form of media or
*  record hearings around, you know, Ozzy Osbourne or NWA, I guess is a common theme. This is just the
*  latest way of things kind of getting out there. But the speed with which it happens is quite
*  different, of course, because it's immediate and it can kind of you know, doesn't things don't get
*  to calm down as much. And you mentioned a little bit, but I wanted to focus in on just for a second
*  the role of the police in this. It can be for better or for worse, I imagine. Do you think
*  that there's an issue where police are just sort of ignoring certain neighborhoods, letting things
*  go? Or is it that there's a strategy that is just ill suited to the circumstances in these certain
*  neighborhoods? Well, it's so yes, and yes, you know, I think, again, the crime map in Chicago
*  about which neighborhoods have the highest levels of violence hasn't changed in a century. So it's
*  not a secret to anybody. How those places are policed are of course severe, right? And in fact,
*  it's changed. And this between the 60s and the 80s, the cry was there was no police presence.
*  And now we're on the other end of the spectrum where everything is hyper surveilled. So I think
*  you know, the idea of being constantly surveilled and constantly incarcerated or stopped is still
*  true. I think it's just it's a it is a tragic way of life. And it hasn't changed. And I think that's
*  kind of what some of the calls are. There are things in of course, policing that and again,
*  what we know about policing that is associated with gun violence reductions, it's actually
*  limited, very small and very precise. It's not it's the opposite of stop and frisk.
*  Right. So policing that is known to have an impact on gun violence tends to focus on a small number
*  of people, a small number of places in a small number of behaviors, which is an argument for
*  more focused rather than broadened policing powers and policing activity. Still a lot of problems,
*  which can cause damage, of course, as well, if you get the wrong people, or you're looking at the
*  wrong behaviors. But by and large, the research suggests that focused policing is much more
*  impactful on levels of gun violence than than expansion of it. But they continually show up
*  in the same neighborhoods time and time and time again. So you know, neighborhoods are subjected
*  to the same sorts of surveillance and policing. And it spills over into schools and parks and
*  libraries and sort of other spaces as well. So I think this is where the network analysis stuff
*  that you mentioned earlier begins to come in. There's a network of people let me just ask the
*  obvious question, are we talking about networks of victims of shootings or networks of people
*  shooting other people? So great question. So when I'm talking, the networks are created
*  through instances of co-arrest or being stopped together by the police. So it is actually setting
*  aside anything around culpability. It's an observation made by police at a point in time
*  and space. You know, there are biases in police data, which are important. We're able to see a
*  lot of those. So say failure to comply often is something that's officer based robbery, assault,
*  arson, things like that tend to be come to the attention of police from from civilians. So we
*  take all those things to account. But basically, if you and I robbed somebody together, we have a tie.
*  And then if I, you know, committed an assault with somebody else, we have a tie and you string these
*  things together and it creates actually a network of risky behaviors, right, things that are
*  inherently you and I engaging in a behavior that that could be risky. So but to your comment about
*  victim and suspect, or people that are involved, I focus mainly on victims, one because in Chicago,
*  we have abysmally low clearance rates, but more to the point, violence prevention is about saving
*  lives and focusing on who's in harm's way who's experiencing trauma is the kind of most immediately
*  actionable information. And we generally have all of the information about who was injured.
*  And, you know, from a public health standpoint, it shouldn't matter whether you have a felony
*  conviction or, you know, are a bad parent or you dropped out of school, none of that should matter
*  if you're focusing on saving somebody's life. So the focus tends to be on victims, but the victims
*  and suspects and sort of everybody else who's involved, they're all in the same network,
*  basically. And so but but really valuing life and prioritizing that is really key as we think about
*  how you use these things for for intervention purposes. But as far as your data are concerned,
*  then if there is someone who gets shot just as an accident, or, you know, was an innocent bystander
*  during a robbery, they would still count as in your network because you're not trying to, you're not
*  deciding ahead of time that doesn't count.
*  Correct, correct. They're in there. And by the way, you know, what one of the things we learned by
*  having them in there is many of these sort of stray bullet incidents aren't aren't that far
*  stray. Right? They're tragic. They weren't the intended target. But they were literally standing
*  next to somebody who was and so by the way, this often happens and you can change the name of the
*  individual I often do this when I go to different cities, I'll describe a seven year old who got
*  shot at a park or a birthday party. And their parent or their cousin was the intended target.
*  And we hear about the young seven year old, but we don't hear about the 27 year old who was holding
*  their hand. And so tragic, but not random, right? Well, I guess that that's that.
*  That was gonna be my next question. I mean, are there? Do we count also people who are clearly
*  related, either socially or biologically to the person in the network or, you know, an associate
*  of them or how much subjectivity versus objectivity is involved in drawing the lines between who's in
*  a network and who's not? In our particular case, we still rely on a metric that we have for everybody,
*  right? So if we have the all of the say arrests in Chicago, that's what includes you in this in the
*  sample, which by the way, to your point means we're severely underestimating relationships.
*  Okay, good. Right. So if you rob a bank with somebody is probably not a stranger. It's probably
*  somebody you know, could be kin, could be a neighbor, could be somebody, a classmate,
*  it's probably somebody you've known a long time. But we don't have that information. At a minimum,
*  we have we were connected at least once, sometimes more than once. But we're probably underestimating
*  behavior. And of course, most incidents never get reported to the police. It's to begin with. So,
*  you know, we're continuing. So our estimates are extremely conservative. If you have information
*  like you're talking about, and we see this qualitatively, like when we're working with
*  partners, or we're trying to understand more about a particular neighborhood or group or whatever,
*  then we start to get into this information. And to your point, yeah, somebody's, you know,
*  former romantic partner, or their year neighbor of 20 years, or their cousin or their uncle.
*  But we just don't have that systematically. But you know, qualitatively, it seems to be true,
*  but I don't have it at the same level of analysis as these other instances.
*  Yeah, you kind of begin to see as a scientist why the surveillance state is so attractive,
*  because we would have so much more data if we just tracked everybody and knew everything about them
*  and could plug it into a computer. I'm not actually in favor of a very high level surveillance state
*  like that, but the data would be cleaner if we knew everything.
*  So, Normi, to be clear, and also to be clear, we're using publicly available arrest records.
*  So we're not using CCTV, license plates, readers, you know, all those things are a totally different
*  level. Again, going to we rely on basically public data. You know, you can go to your court
*  and get arrest records. We're just looking at the digital versions of those, which again,
*  in most cases are available. We don't even have to FOIA them, but you could.
*  You know, it's just a matter of looking at them slightly differently.
*  You know, of course, the surveillance state in that way is also goes horribly wrong. I know you
*  were teasing, but we're on tape here. I want to make sure you're not allowed to joke on the podcast
*  without immediately saying that was a joke. Otherwise, people will take it out of context,
*  because that's absolutely true. But that does bring up, you know, the prospect of perhaps,
*  or maybe it's already happening, collaborating with either police departments or public health
*  agencies or something like that. I mean, you say that you just use publicly available data,
*  but are there further perspective investigations in the future where you use other kind of data sets?
*  So you named two. So short answer is there's lots of potential uses for the science,
*  but you named two agencies that use them very differently. You mentioned the police and public
*  health entities. There's a third one, which I'm working with, which are community-based entities.
*  Police have used these technologies and sort of approaches, and it hasn't gone extremely well.
*  And it hasn't gone extremely well because they've done typically what police do. They get
*  printout, they make a list, and they do what cops do, which is they work a list. And whoever's on
*  the top of the list is number one, and whoever's number two is number two. And, you know, that's
*  how policing tends to work. They work calls, they work lists, which is problematic when it's
*  something that's imperfect, like data and analytics, right? When you look at the predictions or when
*  you look at these statistical models, they're pretty good. They help, they give you information,
*  but if you follow them blindly, it's problematic. It's especially problematic when it's done from
*  the arm of the state that treats a victim like an offender, right? So as soon as you start
*  going into this world of trying to find a suspect or trying to find an offender,
*  there's this little thing called the constitution and even, you know,
*  bigger thing called morality about how do you do that in a way that's fair and just and transparent.
*  And we haven't seen that done successfully yet in the policing context. In a public health context,
*  the science is exactly the science of contact tracing. It's literally finding out who's in
*  harm's way, getting resources to keep them safe. And it can be done successfully. And we've seen
*  this done, by the way, in other epidemics, the HIV epidemic, when we have outbreaks of other
*  infectious diseases. You know, COVID is in one example, but COVID spreads much more quickly than
*  gun violence. It's an airborne pathogen, right? And so it's harder to contain COVID. Gun violence is
*  relational. So it's more like a bloodborne pathogen than an airborne pathogen. But you're still tracing
*  these patterns. This is what street outreach workers do, which is the last thing I'll mention
*  where we're trying to find the uses. Street outreach workers, these, you know, people with
*  lived experience that are trying to stop disputes, they literally place themselves in these networks.
*  That's how they do their job. They're trying to figure out what are the active disputes?
*  How do I get myself situated in there such that we reduce harm? That's a perfect use for it. That's
*  not tied to overly harsh penalties or removing somebody's liberties. Also not without potential
*  problems. But, you know, there are ways we've done this again in public health that I think
*  offer at least a starting point to use it. The last thing I'll say, this comparison is when you
*  think about science, right? Science is providing some tools. How do we use that tool? So when you
*  think about spatial models, well, it can help get a fire truck to the scene of a fire more quickly,
*  or it can be used to direct a drone. Same math, but the use is fundamentally different. And
*  we need to be honest about how it's being used. As an academic, I try to say, here's what I think,
*  I try to work with partners to make sure that happens. But, you know, science gets out there
*  in peer reviewed journals, and anybody can pick it up and take and go with it. I'm trying to
*  figure out ways to improve that approach. But, you know, it's tricky.
*  Well, I love the fact that you bring up the idea that the cops just tend to have a list and work
*  the list. And what you're doing is something a bit more sophisticated than that, because you have
*  more information than just an unordered list. And this is where it becomes a little mathy,
*  a little sciency in a fun way. When you have these networks, so you have nodes who are people and
*  they're connected by relationships. As far as I know, I'm not a super expert, but there are
*  different kinds of networks, right? There are dense networks, sparse networks, small world networks.
*  Are there characteristic features of the kinds of networks that you're seeing?
*  So this is a great question. Let me also just say, when you talk about, we all live in these worlds,
*  right? And we all know a lot about our own small world. And so when you bring these images, say,
*  to street outreach workers or teachers, my sister's a teacher, we often talk about like,
*  what, I was like, tell me what's going on in your school. She starts describing them. I see network
*  images. Right? So if you have that image, if you have the roadmap, the whole roadmap, and you have
*  experts that can be like, let me tell you about this network. I can only say you and I, you know,
*  Rob somebody together, but then somebody's like, no, let me tell you, Sean and Andy played football
*  together. And Sean used to date Andy's sister and then they broke up. And then he hung out.
*  All of a sudden, the context becomes important. And you only get that by engaging local experts,
*  good preachers, teachers, cops, outreach workers, social workers. They know a community or they
*  should know a community. That's what makes this information actionable. And that's what didn't
*  happen in some of these instances. Like if you're just working a list, you don't care whether Sean's
*  already got a job and turned his life around. He's on the list. Right? What, what similarities
*  are we seeing in these networks? What are we seeing to answer your other question?
*  One, they're super small and they're super concentrated. So even when you think of a
*  neighborhood that's disproportionately impacted by gun violence with say 40,000 people, this
*  network has a couple hundred people in it. It's very small. It's also not secret. That's the other
*  thing. If you actually talk to folks, they'll be like, oh, there's a crew over here. Well, who's
*  in the, like, they can tell you these things. So it's, it, it requires again, being really connected
*  to community approaches or the community itself to make it actionable. So it clusters. It's very
*  small. And that's, this is true in, in most communities and most cities, regardless of city
*  size, regardless of the size of the neighborhood, it's a very small part of any community that is
*  actively engaged in these things. And then of course, this, the other kind of thing we're seeing,
*  which is more the rule than the exception is gunshot victimizations cluster, they clump together.
*  So even within this space, this social space, there's still a pocket where these, where these
*  shootings cluster, which again, when you think about the implications for immediate intervention,
*  setting aside large scale interventions that are needed to keep people out of these networks in the
*  first place, it means you're talking about focused interventions, right? That can reach people as
*  opposed to broad scale, you know, stop and frisk, right? It's the opposite of that. It's, it's,
*  it's, it's kind of focusing on particular behaviors, particular individuals, particular
*  geographical locations. And that's where the attention is. And you can do that with therapy,
*  you can do that with interventions, you can do that with jobs, you can do that with schools,
*  but you also have to know, what are those, what are those individuals in that network need?
*  Do they already have high school diplomas? Do they already have jobs? Maybe they don't need a job
*  because they already have one. Spoiler alert, they need jobs, right? But like, if I already have a
*  job, the job program is not appealing. If I already have a high school diploma, I don't need a GED
*  program. We are smart enough as humans to be able to figure out what individuals who are in say,
*  a small network need. You ask them actually, right? Or you ask people who know them, hey,
*  there are these 20 folks, you know, in your, in your neighborhood, what do you know them? What
*  do they need? And then you can kind of direct accordingly. It can't just be everybody needs
*  to do these three things, go. It has to be like, what are we, what are we learning about the problem?
*  It might not involve groups or gangs. It might be family dispute. It might be intimate partner
*  violence. It's important to know that. And every neighborhood is a little different, you know,
*  in Chicago, Latino communities have a very different sort of gang presence still than
*  black communities, right? They're just, they're different groups. You can't do, you can't cut and
*  paste. You got to understand the contexts, you know, conversely, black communities don't have
*  to fear ICE the way Latino communities did, especially under Trump, right? There was a clear,
*  you know, fear that rose during that, during those four years that changed the dynamic of people
*  talking to people. And, you know, you wouldn't expect that say in a black community in Chicago.
*  Well, I'm not sure how helpful it is to your research, but I do have to ask about the topology
*  of these networks. Are they situations where there's like a set of a very, very, very small
*  set of super influencers who know everybody? Or is it that everybody else in the network knows
*  everybody else? I mean, that would presumably suggest different strategies for dealing with
*  things. So there are different topologies. The general rule is in networks, but we also see this
*  in where violence is concerned. Most people have one or two ties, right? Most people, most humans,
*  right? We're talking about people, right? They age out of crime. You know, when you think about young
*  men in particular, young men in particular do a lot of risky, stupid things until they're 26,
*  27 years old. This is true of humanity. And so that's what we see. Most people have one or two
*  ties. And then there are some people that have a lot of ties, right? And the people that have a lot
*  of ties are hubs. They are, you use the word influencer. We can think about super spreaders,
*  right? This idea that they are people who navigate different sorts of networks and bring stuff with
*  them. And part of what we're seeing is that those folks are especially vulnerable because they are,
*  you know, if you're, again, let's just use the context of street crews, right? Or gangs.
*  If you hang around with one gang, we know it increases your rate of victimization. But if
*  you're starting to hang around with two or three or four different crews and those crews don't like
*  each other, either you have some kind of predisposition to make everybody like you or
*  you're really putting yourself out there. And you could be putting it out there for all sorts
*  of reasons. Family ties that cross countries. You know, it could be an inadvertent ties about
*  schools or sports, or you could be running a scam or an operation, or you could actually be engaging
*  in dealing firearms or drugs, whatever. I don't know. But that person who is connecting disconnected
*  parts of the networks, they're unique and there aren't as many of them. Most folks have one or
*  two ties and it's not even a, it's not a, I say big deal. It is a big deal because it puts them
*  in harm's way, but it's not for stuff. These, we're not talking about kingpins, right? Most
*  of the people that are caught up in these spaces are just regular folks. I mean, I guess, I guess
*  that's the point. The short lesson here is that it's not really a dictatorship with one person
*  ruling everything and telling everyone what to do. It sounds like it's a little bit more organic
*  with people knowing each other and knowing each other. Yeah, that's right. I think, let me just,
*  just to say one important caveat. There's, and let's put this in scale. Right now,
*  it's hard to estimate. There are about 900 crews, gangs in Chicago. The way vast majority of them
*  are, are these neighborhood based small entities, which is a departure from Chicago in the nineties,
*  of course. But most of them are these side street, street crews, 20 guys, very informal structures,
*  there are absolutely one or two or three, maybe even 10 groups that are more organized and really
*  kind of, you know, involved in deep, deeper criminal activities. On those 10 though, turns out
*  law enforcement knows how to make cases on those 10. They've been doing it for years.
*  The mistake is when you treat those other 890 like those 10, right? And which, which is those other
*  890, which is the majority of the sort of groups, they're just different. You know, they are,
*  it's, it's not an on off switch. It's a toggle switch, right? You know, we have this crew,
*  it's from the block. There's some family ties in it. You know, somebody gets hurt, we rally together
*  and things get amped up. And then it kind of just calms down. And then I get a job and I leave,
*  or I have a kid and I stopped hanging out. Like, it's much more amorphous than that, which makes
*  it a little scarier in some ways, because you don't have these nice, neat categories, gang A,
*  gang B, gang C, gang D. It's messy. Unlike Chicago in the 90s, people liked it. There was this nation,
*  there was that nation, we didn't get along. I could draw a schematic, everybody understood it. It's
*  not like that anymore. And it's not like that in most cities in the US. And so what works, yeah.
*  I mean, part of your ambition, obviously, is just as an academic, you want to understand what's
*  going on. But you also want to do some good here, because it does seem like there's room for doing
*  some good. And the good to be done is not just help to arrest people who shoot others, but to
*  prevent it from happening ahead of time, right? To give some warning. I mean, can you say a little
*  bit about how we would imagine, in a very specific way, what we would do to lower the chances that
*  someone is going to be a victim of one of these shootings? Yeah. So I think the first thing,
*  if we take the lessons we've learned, and again, I want to stress that this is more of the triage
*  approach. But you do need to combine it with thinking about these bigger issues, like keeping
*  people out of these networks in the first place. When there's an event, when there's a shooting,
*  saturating that part of the network with a trauma response could be life-saving,
*  which is you can help mitigate retaliation, which happens in about a third of cases in Chicago.
*  But more than that, if you reduce the trauma of the people involved, you are saving lives.
*  And we're starting to see this in hospital-based programs as well. They're starting treating the
*  victim's trauma immediately and the victim's family's trauma immediately by trying to connect
*  them with services, by trying to divert aggression, by trying to really understand and unpack
*  the health consequences of individuals that are involved. I think that's one of the most
*  promising things, but we're still learning a lot about that. So one of the differences
*  in our prior research on, say, PTSD, a lot of which comes from veterans,
*  you know, veterans have in theory left the war zone, as it were, right? They're now home. And
*  so how do you reintegrate a vet into their home life, which is in theory safe? A lot of the
*  people who are caught up in shootings, they go right back to the same block. They were shot
*  600 feet away from their home and they walk past that every day. Right? And so they're
*  re-traumatized simply by living in the same neighborhood and they see the people that shot
*  them. So it's different. It's new. And understanding that element, that you have to deal with the
*  trauma and people that are continually re-exposed to it, and then somebody else gets shot, right,
*  on the same block, that's unique. And we need to really, you know, triple down on that and
*  invest in it and understand that it is different than other contexts. And, you know, and it's also
*  thinking about, it's not like the public health system has a glowing report card from black and
*  other non-white communities in this country. You know, there's cynicism, there's estrangement,
*  there's all of these things that have been done, you know, Tuskegee experiments and beyond that
*  we need to understand in this context. So, you know, but I do think responding to precise parts
*  of a network quickly can reduce some of the trauma. It won't eliminate it. You know, I think it's
*  when we get into this world and we use words like prediction, you know, chasing that as the answer
*  is not the solution. Understanding it's more information that you can respond to quickly,
*  that's kind of the key in my opinion. But let me just try to respond quickly. Yeah. Let me
*  just try to distinguish between what seems natural and obvious to me, which is that
*  literally the family members that go to the hospital with the shooting victim deserve some
*  care and attention to help them get over this trauma. But then, are you suggesting that there
*  are people that you can identify as being in the network with that victim, even though they don't
*  go to the hospital, even though they weren't there. But is there a broader strategy just to warn
*  people or help them lower their chances of being part of this cycle of violence?
*  Well, that's a good question. I think for folks that have been in, and you know, shout out to
*  other first responders in this space, when you're in a hospital room after a shooting,
*  it is a microcosm of the neighborhood and the dispute in many cases. So not only are the victim
*  and their family or somebody showing up there, so are the police. Oftentimes other people are
*  injured as well. And so you have in a matter of minutes or hours, you have the victim, the
*  victim's family, the police, the healthcare system, potentially child and protective services,
*  you know, who's like everybody is converging. And this time and pace while somebody is going
*  through the worst moment of their life. And so it is an opportunity to see and be firsthand
*  proximate to those folks that you might not have information on and reach them. And by the way,
*  when I talk about family, I don't, you know, just going back to the parts of our conversation,
*  the average age of a homicide victim in Chicago is 27 and a half years old. It's almost 28 years old.
*  When we look at some of the programs who are serving this population, a good chunk of those
*  27 and 28 year olds have kids. So you now have a child whose parent has been shot, potentially
*  murdered, might be incarcerated. And we talk about a cycle of violence. That's an instance where the
*  cycle of violence is occurring, right? A child experiencing this trauma, now having to have a
*  parent who's dead, incarcerated or injured. That kid needs some attention too, right?
*  Right.
*  Getting that. And when we work with outreach organizations and are dealing with folks that
*  are injured and have survived, I can't tell you the number of times people said, I wish this was
*  there when I was 12 or I was in middle school or what about my little cousin or what about my kid
*  that had access to these things. So thinking about those moments when you can make those connections
*  to non-punitive ways to improve people's lives, I think those are opportunities to be clear.
*  I think this space is people are innovating right now because we haven't done this.
*  And especially as we're in a time when there's an increase in gun violence nationwide,
*  the potential for innovation is huge. But it means we got to listen to folks that are doing the work.
*  Right. And it's listen to the doctors, first responders, community violence preventionists,
*  educators, social workers. There's lots of folks that know a lot about this that are there. How do
*  we boost the things we think are helpful? How do we make sure that we're not just going to be
*  doing the things we think are helpful? And how do we turn down the things we think are potentially
*  harmful? Which makes me wonder, I mean, coming the other way, do you find that those people who you
*  just listed as well as the law enforcement side of things, do they listen to you as the ivory tower
*  academic from Evanston coming in and saying, you really need some more network theory in your life?
*  Well, yeah, of course they listen to me. No, I like to think they listen to me. I should be more
*  precise and say I get invited to these spaces. And to be clear, I'm honored to be in those spaces
*  because I'm also invited into, again, from neighborhood organizations to the state houses.
*  I'm glad that I'm in those spaces and I appreciate being in those spaces. I think they listen.
*  Understanding that some of these things don't work on an election cycle is tricky,
*  or a funding cycle is tricky. But I think people inherently understand the importance of
*  context and networks. I think we err in the policy realm towards individual explanations.
*  And as a sociologist, as a social scientist, crime rates are way more than people making bad
*  decisions. That's an overly simplistic view of crime and violence. But you laugh. That's how
*  a lot of our programming and responses are, trying to get people to make better decisions.
*  Now, let's be clear, plenty of people make bad decisions. I'm not saying people don't have
*  choices and everything is forced. People make choices. Choices are tough. So if you feel unsafe,
*  if you feel your life is in danger to you carrying a gun, even if you're prohibited,
*  because the state is not there for you, is a reasonable choice. But then it comes back to,
*  why are there so many guns in my neighborhood? Why is the state failing to protect me? And why
*  am I in harm's way to begin with? All of those things, they have nothing to do with your choice.
*  You both froze.
*  They have everything to do with the context in which you live. And that part is harder to
*  think about in just an individual response. And going back to something we said earlier,
*  if you follow the program and you have 100% attendance and you get shot, does the program
*  fail? Because your opposition didn't change their behavior. Even if you as an individual
*  changed your behavior, it gets really, really complicated really fast. Even when you see
*  approaches that are trying to focus on individuals and change behaviors, which is important,
*  again, you don't want people carrying guns. You want people to make better decisions. You want
*  them to complete education and so on. You can have individuals who complete the programs,
*  who have 100% attendance, who stop carrying guns, but the neighborhood hasn't changed.
*  And so they're victimized not because they're still involved, but because the opposition is
*  still involved. And so if you're not paying attention to the context, all of a sudden,
*  what looks like an individual failure isn't. It's tricky because again, you want to reach people
*  and have services, but understanding context is so key. And thinking about neighborhood level
*  interventions, how do you understand the dynamics in a whole neighborhood? How do you understand all
*  these other reasons? We can't keep our eye off of that. So we have to move beyond purely individual
*  solutions, though we need plenty of individual solutions as well. We need everything.
*  But I do like to just caution that how we understand patterns is much more than just
*  individuals. Going back to networks, networks aren't about one person. They're about a system.
*  It's a systems approach to understanding these things, and that involves understanding dynamics
*  and time and context and all the other things that are involved. And then you can kind of zoom in and
*  out when you need an individual approach. It's an individual approach. When you need something
*  larger, it should be something larger. And do it all at once. PS. Well, you've certainly given us a
*  lot to think about. Let me just maybe for a final thought ask whether or not this kind of way of
*  thinking about things extends to the other kinds of gun violence that we opened the podcast talking
*  about, about suicides, mass shootings. You've been talking focusing on a specific way that gun
*  violence happens. Are there broader lessons to be drawn for this way higher than it should be
*  number of shootings that we have in our country? Yeah, it's hard because I don't study,
*  um, you know, I don't study suicide, but because suicide seems isolated, it's actually almost the
*  inverse. So when we think about what we know about suicide attempts, say among high school
*  age students, we actually know that those that have sparse networks or no networks have more
*  suicide attempts. Slightly different though than the types of networks that we're talking about.
*  So there's potentially some relationships, but I don't think it's the same pattern just given the
*  isolations. It's really hard to understand mass shootings in this context only because again,
*  in most cases, the target has some network related purpose, right? My former school,
*  my current school, a lover, a workplace that I was involved in. So there's non-random connection
*  in some instances, but it's not quite as clustered as you might think. Again,
*  thinking about warning signs, red flags, even in the domestic violence situations,
*  intimate partner violence, red flags kind of tell you still not random, still a network. We have
*  an intimate relationship, but slightly different. And I don't know enough about it to say it.
*  You know, I think that becomes kind of important. As usual, this is a perfect
*  place to end in the sense that you just said you don't know enough, which is good. I like it when
*  people say they don't know enough about something. Not everyone is willing to do that. And occasionally,
*  it's exactly the right thing to say. So Andrew Poppichristos, thanks very much for being on
*  the Winescape Podcast. It was a pleasure. I really appreciate it and happy to follow up on anything.
*  Thank you.
