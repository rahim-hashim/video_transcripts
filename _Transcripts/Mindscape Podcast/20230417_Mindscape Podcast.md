Here at the Mindscape Podcast, we are firmly pro-reason. But what does that mean, fundamentally and in practice? How did humanity come into the idea of not just doing things, but doing things for reasons? In this episode we talk with cognitive scientist Hugo Mercier about these issues. He is the co-author (with Dan Sperber) of The Enigma of Reason, about how the notion of reason came to be, and more recently author of Not Born Yesterday, about who we trust and what we believe. He argues that our main shortcoming is not being insufficiently skeptical of radical claims, but of being too skeptical of claims that don't fit our views.

Hugo Mercier received a Ph.D. in cognitive sciences from the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. He is currently a Permanent CNRS Research Scientist at the Institut Jean Nicod, Paris. Among his awards are the Prime d’excellence from the CNRS.

# Mindscape 233 | Hugo Mercier on Reasoning and Skepticism
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSRuojILolk)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  Human beings have a capacity for reasoning and I don't mean that in
*  contrast with other animals or anything like that, at least not right now. We're
*  not trying to figure out where we stand and the evolution of life or the
*  hierarchy or anything like that, but some of us like to think that we can actually
*  reason about things sometimes. I don't even mean rationality. Rationality is sort
*  of a particular kind of reason. There's different ways in which we reason about
*  the world. So where did that capacity come from? What is it? How does it work?
*  How do we make it better? This is something we've talked about on the
*  podcast before and it's a topic of great current interest. People falling prey to
*  misinformation, to cognitive biases, to conspiracy theories and so forth. How
*  does all that work at a deep cognitive science level? So today's guest, Hugo
*  Mercier, is a French cognitive scientist. He's done a lot of work and he's written
*  two wonderful books that I can highly recommend. One with Dan Sperber is called
*  The Enigma of Reason and that's literally about how reason came to be,
*  both as a philosophical question but also scientifically back there in the
*  origin of human beings. When did we start using reason to think about things
*  carefully rather than just acting in a if this then that simple kind of way? And
*  one of their main arguments, one of their main points is that reason evolved in
*  order to give reasons for things. Now that sounds kind of maybe tautological
*  but the point is to give reasons. In other words, a social function. Not just
*  you by yourself or your ancestor by yourself in isolation thinking about the
*  world and solving puzzles but in order to convince other people to do what we
*  wanted them to do. You know one of the big breakthroughs in human social
*  cognition is the ability to work together, to make an agreement. If I do
*  this now you'll do this tomorrow, right? This greatly enabled human beings to
*  cooperate and to build things greater than themselves. So sometimes you can get
*  other people to do what you want just by threatening them but other times
*  you're gonna want to offer a reason, right? Do this because of this reason.
*  Trust me for the following reasons and so Hugo and Dan Sperber argue that the
*  reason why we invented reason is to give reasons why to other people. It is more
*  reason book called Not Born Yesterday. Hugo makes a very interesting point
*  about our gullibility and our skepticism. You know that among people
*  who care a lot about rationality and getting the right answer, the idea of
*  being skeptical of crackpot theories is a very very big one, a very very important
*  one. Makes sense to me to be skeptical of crackpot theories but Hugo's point is
*  that if anything the usual human failure is on the other side of being too
*  skeptical but the point is we're skeptical of the wrong things. We are
*  actually being skeptical of all the enormous piles of information telling us
*  not to believe that kooky conspiracy theory. So rather than being more
*  skeptical of the crazy theories, being more open and honestly evaluating all the
*  potentially contrary information that comes in. There's a lot going on here. You
*  know reason is a complicated thing and both how it evolved over time, how it's
*  working in our brains right now and how we can make it better. These are
*  important questions. It's a very mindscapey kind of conversation. Let me
*  occasionally remind you as always that you can become a patreon supporter of
*  mindscape. You can go to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll. Pledge a dollar

*  Diego Mercier, welcome to the mindscape podcast.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  So we're talking about reason and obviously that's a big topic and we'll
*  get into what is precisely meant by that in detail but I bet that given previous
*  things we talked about in the podcast a lot of people will conflate it with
*  rationality right away. I know I sometimes do that but I think you don't
*  want us to do that right away so maybe I'll give you a chance to tell us what we
*  should be thinking about when we talk about reason.
*  So you know there's this thing that for psychologist theories are like
*  toothbrushes you know everybody has their own and no one wants to use anybody
*  else's and so we have we're a field that has a bit of trouble sometimes agreeing
*  on even basic terms so what I'm going to tell now is kind of my or ours with
*  Dan's program at my core on that work on reason definition of what we think
*  reason is and according to us reason is both the reasons we give each other so
*  when I try to convince you to do something or to believe something I will
*  give you reasons that you will evaluate and reason is also the cognitive
*  mechanisms that allow us to produce and to evaluate these reasons so it's very
*  specific and most of the mind goes on without using reasons at all so when you
*  perceive things when you engage in kind of motor behavior when you act in the
*  world when you draw a lot of inferences we know we're looking at you I can infer
*  things about you know whether you're healthy or not you know what you're
*  thinking etc etc all of that we do we believe without using reason so reason
*  reason is quite specific in our in our framework so in other words just to be
*  super duper clear here reason doesn't mean being logical or being rational no
*  so for instance you know you can think that most animals are rational in most
*  of the behaviors that they engage in and according to us they don't use reason to
*  do that they they have a host of other cognitive mechanisms that function very
*  well but they don't use reason and yet they are rational moreover in many of
*  the ways in which humans use reason they would they wouldn't really be qualified
*  as rational in most kind of normative models so people can use reasons to
*  engage in metriated reasoning to justify conclusions that they already believed
*  to kind of delude themselves into believing something so I think the two
*  of them are quite separate good okay that that does make a lot of sense so
*  and again just to let the audience in on the background that we're talking about
*  here you mentioned we're talking right now about your the book enigma of reason
*  you have a new book out on not born yesterday how we're less gullible you
*  think we'll get there at some point I don't want you to feel bad but in the
*  enigma of reason you do remind us that there is this not maybe not a consensus
*  but a feeling among a lot of people that there are dual process models of how we
*  think in the brain and and you think that a dual process two processes aren't
*  quite enough so maybe remind us what the dual process model is that we're
*  fighting against so the dual process model which has been not developed
*  really but at least popularized by by Danny Kahneman most famously holds that
*  you can divide most cognitive or kind of mental mechanisms in two types one is
*  kind of intuitive mechanism so again you see someone immediately you can infer
*  how old they are their gender you know they're maybe what you know where
*  they're looking etc etc and you do that effortlessly you do that
*  unconsciously and the conclusion you know that person is angry for instance
*  kind of pops into your mind without really knew you knowing how it got there
*  by contrast the system two processes would be things that would be more kind
*  of more cautious more careful more explicit so when you're like solving a
*  Sudoku problem maybe when you're doing you know mathematics you're taking your
*  time it's a Ford fool it's demanding it's conscious and so I think this entry
*  this this this dichotomy is quite intuitive and that's partly I think why
*  it is successful and maybe though it I'll confess I'm in the back of my mind
*  I just have been talking to Daniel Dennett for several days has he been
*  visiting Johns Hopkins and so all of his thoughts are talking to me in the back
*  of my mind great thoughts it's almost like a little homunculus model because
*  that system to the cognitive part is is rational all by itself in some way yes
*  that is one of the big problems with this thing is that in a way we think well
*  okay so system one is the stuff I don't control but there is as you are saying
*  this is a little this little homunculus is still person inside me who is system
*  two but then obviously as kind of cognitive scientists our tasks would be
*  to explain what that is like you know we can't you can't have you know you don't
*  solve the riddle of how people act by assuming that there's a little person
*  inside their head that's just you know pushing the problem further so you know
*  I completely agree with that criticism yeah and so the obvious thing if we're
*  going to critique a dual process model is to say we need a triple or quadruple
*  process model I mean what is the direction we should be moving in here so
*  yeah I think so at heart I guess I'm an evolutionary psychologist and one of the
*  insights of evolutionary psychology is that the human mind exactly as as much
*  as other any other organ or any like a cell or even any complex artifact or
*  complex piece of code is made of countless mechanisms that work in in
*  relative isolation from each other so for instance for you know you or your
*  listeners who've had any experience building something complex or writing a
*  piece of computer code if you just write one big thing it's not gonna work you
*  need to have modules and each of them is gonna accomplish a specific function
*  that way if something breaks down you can figure out what's going on you know
*  it's it's just that's the way anything that's complex or you know you men sell
*  with the mitochondria and the nucleus anything that's complex is modular to a
*  very high degree and so we believe that the mind this is also true of the human
*  mind so you have you know mechanisms that you get it to vision mechanisms and
*  within these mechanisms many you know mechanisms dedicated to perceiving in
*  simple shapes and assembling them together etc etc so we have a myriad of
*  mechanisms that work then again in relative isolation with each other
*  obviously they communicate with each other they send information to each
*  other but there are still relatively impervious to what's happening in the
*  rest of the brain otherwise it would just be a giant mess and nothing would
*  get done and so there is not just one sort of rationality module there's many
*  different modules and rationality somehow emerges out of a multiplicity of
*  interactions yes exactly so you know if you look at an animal and you can a
*  cognitively complex animal will have mechanisms that you get it to
*  perception to motor behavior to you know to finding a good mate to you know to
*  competing against against against you know other individuals and species to
*  fighting predators etc etc and all of these mechanisms will have to be
*  coordinated like the animal has to be able to make decisions whether this is
*  mate on one side and food on the other they have to decide it these sort of
*  things but but each mechanism is still relatively independent of the others but
*  there is some level at which things become conscious or we become
*  consciously aware of them right I mean is that to what extent how should I be
*  thinking about the role of consciousness or awareness in this picture so it's
*  not something that that I've really given enough thought I guess so I don't
*  have a super smart answer to give you you know then then it will be a much
*  better person to talk to you like that for us I guess what matters is that we
*  happen to be conscious of most of what we reason about so if we if we use
*  reason in the way that we use the term as this mechanism that allows us to
*  produce and to evaluate evaluate reasons we happen to be conscious of that all
*  the time so nothing that we're always conscious of that but whenever we do
*  reason we are we are conscious of it and so that's one of the of the traits that
*  I think make us equates reason with system to it because you know that's the
*  thing that we know goes on in our mind because we have access to it we can
*  report it to others whereas the vast majority like the you know the the
*  proverbial hidden part of the iceberg goes on all the time and consciously
*  and that also actually makes tend to make people forget that even when it
*  comes to reason a lot of it is unconscious so you know if I if I think
*  of a reason for to convince you of something I don't know how I found it
*  it just kind of pops into my head when I give you a reason instantaneously you
*  have an intuition about whether it's a good or a bad reason you don't know why
*  that's the case it just pops into your head so even if something in something
*  like reason that has then is quite explicit there is also an you know a
*  cognitive layer that's that's you know kind of basically an accessible to
*  consciousness good yeah okay so it's certainly very very good lesson that a
*  lot of what we come to believe through what we think of as reasoning and
*  reflection is a result of a lot of things going on below the surface that
*  we're completely unaware of yeah it has to be the case I mean you know otherwise
*  you have this kind of infinite regress like you know you have to have a reason
*  for your reason for your reasons at some point we just have intuitions and there
*  are some some cognitive processes that in the future people will be able to
*  explain but they have to be there you know things don't happen just by magic
*  and there is something about human beings and the way that they reason that
*  is maybe a little bit special here well according to us we're actually the only
*  ones to reason at all so other other animals engage in a lot of complex
*  thoughts and they can they can do a lot of you know wondrous things with them
*  with our minds but this ability we have of producing and evaluating reasons is
*  something that as far as we can tell no other animal has in part because it
*  really requires a complex system of communication to be able to express these
*  thoughts these reasons and so and so yeah other animals go on you know
*  completely fine without reason which then raises the question of you know why
*  do we have it like it seems you know we kind of take it for granted well you
*  know it sounds like a great idea but you know your dog or you know any wild
*  animal does perfectly fine without without reasoning at all and and so why
*  do we bother good I hope you can answer that question before at some point but
*  this is helping me figure out what to emphasize in things you've already said
*  so you've already said this but you know dogs and animals think and they can even
*  solve puzzles but you're saying that they don't do what you are calling
*  reasoning and there's a linguistic barrier here because you're you're
*  raising the importance of the idea of coming up with reasons as something that
*  reasoning does so maybe amplify that a little bit yes no exactly I mean as I
*  was saying for us reason is really the ability that we have of producing reasons
*  and it's not it's not something that we can take for granted at all so for
*  instance then again if you're a computer programmer you write a piece of code
*  that works perfectly well the piece of code is not going to be able by default
*  to explain to you why it's making these decisions you know so you write a code
*  and it tells you well are you if you look in your chat GPT you know this is
*  the output but then it's a black box if you want your code to be able to explain
*  to someone why it has come up with that decision you need to write another piece
*  of code that will somehow figure out well actually that decision I made
*  because of this and I can I can spell that out and I can tell someone that and
*  so the same would be true for humans so other animals they have this very very
*  complex piece of codes or the equivalent you're an all equivalent in their brains
*  and they function perfectly well but if someone you know if you ask your dog you
*  know but why did you do this which we often sometimes do I guess the dog is not
*  gonna give you a very informative answer and and for you know a buddy if you ask
*  that to someone they will tell you something that will be more or less
*  informative but in order to do that you need a different piece of software that
*  will look into your own mind and look into your decisions and your behavior
*  and try to give you a reason for why you believe something or why you did
*  something it doesn't come you know kind of prepackaged with the rest of the mind
*  like you need a different piece of software that only does that and so the
*  question is why do we why are we able to do this so it's really that meta level
*  that ability to talk about why we're doing things and to offer reasons
*  that's what you're saying is a little bit different in humans than in other
*  animals like my cat is very good at opening drawers but he will not tell me
*  why he's opening no very good reasons but yes and indeed I mean we we really
*  take it for granted in humans but but we don't expect it of any other animal
*  sometimes we ask them why they do things but it's obviously that we don't expect
*  answer and and from that perspective it makes perfect sense that language is
*  closely connected to this right the offering up of reasons is something that
*  sounds like it requires a language is there a chicken and egg problem about
*  which comes first reasoning or language so we believe that for reason to have
*  evolved for it to have made sense that reason would evolve people our ancestors
*  would already have had relatively complex communication place so you know
*  as a saying we have this theory about why reason evolved that you know I'll
*  delve into later and it's just first doesn't make sense that we people would
*  have or any other animal would have reason if they don't already communicate
*  that being said though what's really crucial is not language language per se
*  but more the ability to understand what people mean more generally so I can give
*  you a reason by pointing friends as you know but why do you think that and
*  there's something in our environment that clearly explains why you think that
*  I can just point to it and that's gonna you know that's going that's going to do
*  the job of explaining to you well I believe that you know I see like you know
*  why do you think that John is here I can just point to John and and so I don't
*  need language to do that but I need the ability to express my thoughts in a way
*  that you will understand and you need the ability to to to decode so to speak
*  that okay but now I guess I'm a little confused because I was gonna I was gonna
*  happily think that language came along and then we bootstrap from there to
*  inventing reasoning and and the appeal to reasons but I think animals can also
*  point at things right that's a good point actually they they in some cases
*  some quite a lot of species in particular domesticated species
*  understand pointing interestingly chimpanzees they can in some very rare
*  context but in most contexts they don't so for instance if you take a chimpanzee
*  there's two buckets two opaque buckets and they know that there is food under
*  one of the buckets and you point to the bucket that has the food they won't pick
*  it then they'll be a chance by contrast if you try grabbing one of the
*  buckets they will know that's where the food is okay that's because they don't
*  assume that you want to help them there they live in a very competitive world
*  and so you know they're smart they know that if you want to pick the that
*  bucket is the one with the food but pointing implies that I'm just going to
*  help you get at the food and it's not something that chimpanzees do to each
*  other a whole lot so in some contexts with some individuals who know each
*  other and they can get pointing but they usually don't understand it but oh like
*  a goat will understand pointing by human because goats have a long history of
*  interacting with humans and of humans being kind of nice to them because you
*  know the goats they were you know they're hurting them and so it's not it's
*  not a matter of general cognitive abilities more a matter of the
*  relationship that these animals have had with humans or with each other over
*  evolutionary time but even if they could point and chimpanzees raised that have
*  been raised by humans to point some extent they know other animal has the
*  human ability to express meanings through either words or you know gestures or any
*  other mean and to understand what other people mean in that way in this very kind
*  of flexible open-ended manner so they have you know many animal communication
*  is fascinating and endlessly complex but it's pretty specific we have kind of one
*  signal to mean one thing they don't have this kind of general mechanism for
*  communicating meaning that humans have so when an animal is pointing or when
*  we're pointing and they understand it it doesn't represent the offering of a
*  reason like it might for a human being no no no it's represent at best you know
*  they're going to get some some very basic information out of it like you
*  know where some food might be got it but we would say anyway I mean you know
*  someone could try to prove us wrong that they would not understand pointing in
*  the context of offering a reason okay so good so now we can turn to this
*  question of why it's so important I mean and I think as you say in the book
*  there's a double-edged question why do we have reason and then if it's so good
*  why doesn't everyone else have reason like why doesn't it's quickly you know
*  exactly so you need to have a story or a theory that Bruce explains why we have
*  it and you know when we needed to have it because like you know I was talking
*  about a piece of software but it's a you know it's a piece of your brain
*  somewhere some neurons that are dedicated to the task of finding and
*  evaluating reasons and neurons take a lot of energy to grow and some energy
*  to maintain so there has to have been selection pressures that meant that
*  among our ancestors those that had a better ability to reason managed to kind
*  of compete even if slightly other other individuals and then if we have a good
*  reason for why humans have reason then why you know why only us so the the
*  theory we have is that if you what characterizes humans by contrast with
*  other primates at least is their ability as we were saying to cooperate with each
*  other and to communicate with each other and that is something we do to an extent
*  that is really unprecedented among primates where many primates have some
*  communication system they cooperate to some extent with each other but nothing
*  like like what humans are able to do is like a whole really different ballpark
*  and in that context when you start communicating with each other and
*  cooperating with each other that creates we believe the right environment for
*  reason to evolve and that kind of true it to two explanations really there when
*  is when you cooperate with people it's really important for you to judge them
*  because you want to make sure that the people you cooperate with are nice that
*  they're you know they're going to reciprocate that they are competent they
*  know what they're doing and and the problem is that judging people if you
*  don't have access to their minds is really hard because you might do
*  something and you mean well but you know you mess up and so I might think all you
*  do a clumsy or you know maybe you're a bad person when in fact you meant really
*  well so if you can explain to me let's say you do something that appears maybe
*  a bit mean but then you explain to me that you meant well then I can correct
*  the way I perceive you in a way that's both good for you because you know you
*  protect your reputation and good for me because I don't think probably of you
*  when it was not justified and so when people cooperate it becomes super useful
*  to be able to justify themselves to give reasons for why they do the things they
*  do so that others can understand them and can and can judge them can accurately
*  so we believe that's one of the of the pressures that led to the emergence of
*  reason and indeed in our everyday lives we do that constantly so whenever you
*  do or you even mentioned that you did something that might appear a bit silly
*  or or not very good and immediately we justify ourselves oh you know but I did
*  this but I had a good reason there was this and there was that guy who did that
*  and I thought that so we do that constantly and if we couldn't do that so
*  for instance when you're driving you can't talk to the other drivers and I
*  think that's one of the main factors in road rage that someone can't explain you
*  know I coach you but I'm really in a hurry for that so like when you talk and
*  talk to people you can explain things and usually it smoothies things over
*  very well but as soon as you remove that ability to justify yourself things
*  go south pretty pretty quickly so that would be one of the reasons where we have
*  reason and the other would relate with communication in the sense that when
*  people talk to each other it's great and it's super useful but if there's a
*  disagreement what do you do so you know if you tell me something and I think
*  that it's false unless I really trust you a lot and I'm just going to change
*  my mind but that's kind of risky because you know maybe you're mistaken maybe you
*  want to mislead me even but if you can give you a reason that I can decide well
*  account maybe he has good grounds for building this maybe he doesn't but I can
*  I can you know make a more informed decision about whether I should trust
*  you or not and I can provide you reasons and so in a context in which
*  individuals do communicate then it starts making sense when people when
*  people communicate a lot and rely on communication a lot the way humans do
*  that it starts making sense to be able to exchange reasons so that when we
*  disagree we can figure out who is the most likely to be right it does seem
*  slightly strange at first hearing to imagine that reason came about for
*  primarily social reasons we tend to think of reason is something that is
*  sort of objectively out there in the world there are rules to being logical
*  or to updating our priors using Bayes's theorem etc and this evolutionary story
*  of why it came about seems very different but maybe it's compatible I
*  don't know what how does this relate to ideas that that logic and reasoning are
*  out there in the world objectively without even us constructing them so I'm
*  not going to go into kind of Platonism and whether you know ideas exist in the
*  world but what I want to point out is that for this whole thing to work it has
*  to lead us to more accurate beliefs on the whole so you know if the two of us
*  when we exchange reasons we exchange arguments you know we disagree so we
*  know you say this because of that I say that because of something else if
*  on average the outcome of that process was bad if on average we ended up with
*  worse ideas that we started from if on average the guy who was wrong ended up
*  convincing the other one that would be there would not be selected for that
*  would be bad and so that means that even without following back the strict
*  precepts of you know you know logical validity or Bayesianism the intuitions
*  people have about what is a good reason or what is a bad reason must somehow
*  have track what is actually true because otherwise we would not be doing
*  it so it is social but but we have to have kind of epistemic benefits at the
*  end of the day otherwise it would not be worth it okay so yeah for the purposes
*  of this conversation we're imagining that there are things that are true and
*  things that are false yes and however reason evolved it needs to bring us
*  closer to truth most of the time in order to be effective to truth or to to
*  things that are kind of you know good for your fitness more generally I guess
*  right and okay last question about the evolution of it I mean I think you said
*  something about this but I just want to get it super clear my own brain is there
*  a single kind of spark or phase transition or shift in you know how
*  thought works from let's say other great apes to humans that enables the whole
*  constellation of things that include social structures reasoning language or
*  did one of those come first or were there multiple things that appeared at
*  the same time yeah I mean I think the most commonly accepted theory would be
*  that it was a succession of events that led there but clearly they're
*  relative to each other for instance you know in the example of a prison we were
*  discussing it is because there's this this this base of cooperation
*  communication that it makes sense to start evolving reason and and I think
*  the same goes for the other so they must have been some changes in the
*  ecology of you know of kind of our ancestors and that meant that it made
*  more sense to cooperate more and won't you start cooperating more than then if
*  you can communicate better you are you're at a huge advantage and then when
*  you communicate better you know you're even better if you can reason with each
*  other so there's this kind of we don't know I don't think there's an agreement
*  over what is the spark you know where is the thing that the initial kind of
*  ecological change that made it that meant that our ancestors started
*  cooperating more than other primates but once you want to start going that way
*  you can see how we kind of one thing leads to the other in a relatively
*  natural manner but they're still you know they still took you know hundreds
*  of thousands of years if that millions of years probably actually millions of
*  years and it was pretty progressive we don't know exactly how or when it
*  happened because we know so little about about you know the species that preceded
*  us but I mean you know we do know things that we people are for instance we know
*  that you know they're so probably had language that was as sophisticated as
*  ours and so that means that our common ancestor and probably people about
*  300,000 years ago had about the same cognitive capacities broadly that we
*  have right but before that if you look at as species before homo sapiens it
*  becomes a bit trickier to infer exactly what they were able to do okay very good
*  yeah well you know look there's there needs to be some questions that we will
*  answer in the future that we there's no shortage but okay I want to my job as
*  the podcast host is to be a tiny bit of a skeptic just to give you the chance
*  to you know push back so you seem to be saying that in in some sense reasoning
*  evolved not to sit at home and do math or logic but to persuade other people
*  that we were right to you know ultimately is a rhetorical device and
*  but but you want to say that nevertheless it does lead us closer to
*  the truth so did that I mean surely there's some cases where the best
*  rhetorical devices are kind of disengaged from the truth yeah so
*  essentially we think of reason has having two sides so on the one hand we
*  use reason to produce reasons and arguments and justifications and when we
*  do that we are quite thoroughly biased so you know and that makes sense so if
*  my goal is to convince you of something I should have my side bias or a
*  confirmation bias in the sense that if I start giving you arguments you know
*  against my view and for your view I'm not going to convince you of this so I
*  need if my goal is to convince you I need to find arguments for my view and
*  against yours and this is indeed what people overwhelmingly do whether they
*  want to do it or not that's just how reason works but there's this other side
*  of reason which is how we evaluate arguments and when someone else gives you
*  an argument then your incentives are very different your incentives are are
*  much closer to the kind of normative goal of having an objective objectively
*  true answer in the sense that you know someone is giving you a reason you
*  disagree with them your goal is to know well should I change my mind and and the
*  end of the day you're going to benefit if the beliefs here that you form are
*  more accurate or if the decisions that you make are kind of more beneficial to
*  you and so when we evaluate reasons the the biases that kind of plague the
*  production of reasons completely disappear so we are quite objective we're
*  able both to to realize that bad arguments are bad but also to realize
*  that good arguments are good even if they challenge our points of view and so
*  when the two of them work together so when you're talking to someone and
*  people are being of good faith because you know maybe you have some common
*  incentive you know it's like playing poker or something like that then it
*  works well so you know I'm going to be biased when I give you reasons you will
*  evaluate them quite objectively if you find that they're crap you will tell me
*  and you will tell me why and I can give you other reasons you will give me your
*  reasons you'll be biased in doing so but I will evaluate them objectively and
*  that's what makes the whole thing work is this kind of back and forth between
*  the production of reasons which is biased and the evaluation of other
*  people's reasons which is much more objective and existence it's pretty easy
*  to come up with examples of people who are relatively reasonable and smart and
*  yet they have made up their minds about some things and it's almost impossible
*  to imagine them persuading each other and I I include myself in this on issues
*  from the existence of God to the right interpretation of quantum mechanics
*  right like I'm too old to really imagine that I will have a dramatic
*  change of my mind on these things is that is that feature of how we think and
*  reason explicable in terms of this framework I would I would think so but
*  not only so clearly there are things for which it would be hard to imagine that
*  there would be arguments that be sufficiently strong like you know when
*  you come to see interpretation of quantum mechanics of quantum physics you
*  know maybe that could be you know you I think you're just thinking too much in
*  the actual real world but I am it's imagine to imagine an alternative world
*  in which you know some new experimental data comes up and and that completely
*  leads logically to a change in the framework I think you would change your
*  mind in that world yeah so I think reason works quite well on its own the
*  problem is that reason is not by far the only cognitive mechanism we have or we
*  use and in many cases I think what's going on is that there is kind of
*  interference from from other cognitive mechanisms in particular mechanisms
*  related to our social lives and in particular those that tell us that if
*  you change your mind you're gonna look stupid and so you know we have we have
*  commitments to our views you know people think of us as being you know like a
*  lefty or someone who has such-and-such interpretation of quantum physics in
*  some cases and and and you know and you know rightly enough that if you were to
*  dramatically change your view people might think well you know that's weird
*  why did you do that I can't really rely on that person or you know maybe he was
*  wrong all along so you know maybe he's not as competent as I thought he was and
*  so we do have an incentive to some extent to appear maybe more coherent than
*  we are and I think we can see that and we can even fill it ourselves like we've
*  all been a bad face so you know you're in an argument and you know the other guy
*  is making a good point but you refuse to concede so you have reason telling you
*  actually that makes sense yeah have you saw the mechanic you tell you
*  mechanism tell you I don't know no no this is nonsense and sometimes actually
*  you can track I mean at least you know kind of you know personally experience I
*  think you know you have a discussion and you don't budge but then a few days later
*  like oh yeah it kind of made sense you know when you're in the public debate
*  you don't you don't you don't really change your mind but in fact the reason
*  is but is kind of working behind the scene to make you realize actually if
*  some of these arguments were pretty good is it fair or unfair to say that we sort
*  of first come to our beliefs and then use reason to justify them or we use
*  reason to come to our beliefs so in the overwhelming majority of cases we come
*  to our beliefs through you know everything else in your mind is designed
*  to you know are not everything many many other cognitive mechanisms like
*  perception you know you open your eyes you form a whole lot of beliefs about
*  you know the world around you you know who is there what they're doing etc etc
*  or people you know give you testimony you know I tell you my birthday then you
*  believe that my birthday such and such day and so we form these beliefs and
*  then when these beliefs are contested when people disagree with them then we
*  come up with reasons but there are cases in which is the other way around and
*  these are the cases in which someone has convinced you with a reason so you know
*  there are for instance you know as an experimental psychologist we use these
*  little kind of toy problems mathematical problems are very simple but very
*  deceptive and most people get them wrong but then when you explain the correct
*  answer to someone they change their minds most people change their mind
*  early immediately and in that case they have the correct answer because they
*  have accepted a good reason so you know both happen within the you know the vast
*  majority of cases people come up with the belief and then they when when the
*  need arises they justify it to others you emphasize the social aspect enough
*  that if I recall correctly you're willing to say that if you were just by yourself
*  if you were an isolated person there'd be no reason to use reason well you know
*  as humans we have it so you know whatever someone else is gonna do with
*  their brain when they're on their own I don't know but but if we had been a
*  solitary species I guess that's a better way to put it. I don't think we would have had
*  there would have been selection pressures for us to develop reason okay
*  but but then again I mean if you're in solitary confinement I'm sure some
*  people will try using reason to distract themselves so it's it's it's
*  interesting it's like a spandrel in some sense the fact that we can prove
*  mathematical theorems we there's no evolutionary pressure to prove
*  mathematical theorems but there's evolutionary pressure to persuade our
*  fellow human beings and that led us to develop a capacity that we now use to
*  prove mathematical theorems. Yes no no exactly that's that's there's the beauty
*  of it in a way is that it's it's it's an accident like the disability and I mean
*  reason is not the only ability that we use for science and but it is clearly a
*  crucial one it's not evil for that at all and it's you know it's our great
*  luck that that that we can also use it to prove mathematical theorems and to
*  develop you know physical theories and with that. And presumably this helps
*  explain why our reason has faults and why we are subjective subject to
*  cognitive biases, irrationalities of various forms. Yes exactly I think one of
*  the of the great strengths of our theories that explains this otherwise
*  extremely puzzling feature of reason which is well attested and you know
*  countless psychological experiments which is the confirmation bias or the
*  my side bias. So it's something I was mentioning earlier and the idea is very
*  simple whenever people have any kind of preconceived notion they have some
*  some intuition some idea about something and they start reasoning about it
*  overwhelmingly they will find arguments for why they're correct and that's you
*  know irrespective of whether they happen to be correct or not they will just
*  spontaneously think of arguments whether correct whether it's about a
*  logical problem or who they're going to vote for what car they're going to buy
*  anything if you have if you already start thinking well this one is the
*  best option then you will mostly find reasons for why that's the case. The very
*  very first podcast episode I ever did was with Carol Tavris who is a social
*  psychologist and she related a story you know other people's research but and
*  it's probably a famous example in psychology literature of this doomsday
*  cult that knew exactly when doomsday was going to happen. Social psychologist yeah. Yeah and so it
*  didn't happen and they interviewed them afterward and the evidence was
*  irrefutable because they said yes absolutely the world's gonna end and it
*  didn't end but none of them said oh we were wrong they all said well we just
*  prayed so hard and cared about it so much that it we stopped it. Actually how
*  it was kind of split so so half of them gave up on the cult and the other half dug deeper
*  and and you can see I think so my interpretation of that would be that
*  essentially in your mind your brain is computing the costs of different actions
*  so either you give up with a cult in which case you have a benefit which is
*  well you know clearly what they're saying doesn't seem to make much sense
*  and you can you can maybe you know recreate or rejoin kind of you know old
*  friendships and maybe a family that you might have can abandon on the other
*  sides if you stay with the cult then you you keep this very close-knit group of
*  friends that you can rely on and the fact that you know actually you know we
*  said the world was gonna end and it didn't end it's not the end of the world
*  if the benefit you get from saying that is that you you get to keep living with
*  these people who might be your only support group at that stage. I understand
*  so even in the most hardcore sense it is arguably not irrational to say those
*  things. Oh yeah no no no I mean I think I think it's really hard to show that
*  something is irrational and that it's really important to distinguish
*  irrational from false I mean obviously what they're saying is false but then
*  there are countless situations in which saying or believing false things may be
*  perfectly rational. And this segues very nicely into this idea that if we are so
*  we developed reasons to sort of persuade our fellow human beings and this gives
*  us this wonderful set of abilities but also sort of an obvious set of exploits
*  that are available mistakes that we make so does this make us susceptible to
*  being persuaded of false things by people who are very good at such
*  techniques? I don't think so because I think the the way these mechanisms should
*  work is they should err on the side of caution so if you don't really
*  understand an argument then you should just stay put and stay with your prior
*  belief and so the person should not manage to change your mind. So this anyway
*  that's the beauty of the mechanism is that it's not you know it's not
*  completely foolproof but you know by default if it's if it's a topic that you
*  really care about something that might impact you in your daily life that you
*  might pay you know genuine cost if you get wrong then people really have to
*  give you a good argument for you to change your mind otherwise you just you
*  know you're just gonna stick with your with your prior beliefs. I guess it makes
*  sense the process of updating our beliefs is an essentially conservative
*  one we don't want to make radical changes from moment to moment. Well no
*  but in that context it's really important to distinguish communication
*  from other modalities so in particular from perception so you know if you
*  believe that your keys are in your pocket but you see them on your desk
*  blam immediately you change your mind and you accept that they're on your desk
*  but if you believe that they're in your pocket and that someone tells you oh
*  actually I saw them somewhere else I'm not sure maybe you're mistaken
*  maybe those were not my keys so our minds process communicated information
*  very differently and the reason is quite obvious is that in an evolutionary
*  context we can trust our perception I mean obviously it's gonna make mistakes
*  sometimes nothing is perfect but it evolved so that you know to help us
*  form an accurate vision of the world and to behave adaptively in it. By contrast
*  other people evolved to serve their own interests that might very well and that
*  often do differ from ours and so you can't just take someone else's word for
*  it even you know even your kin even people who are close to you their
*  incentives are going to diverge from you from yours to some extent and so you
*  always have this filter that when it's communicated information you know you
*  need you need proof you need good reasons to change your mind whereas if
*  it's perception by default you're going to you know perception is going to
*  override memory. So I guess this feels like a mixed message to me in the sense
*  that we seem to have examples where lots of people believe false things and what
*  you're saying is not oh people generally believe true things but the reason why
*  they're believing false things is not because some very very persuasive
*  propagandist persuaded them it's because they were kind of ready to believe these
*  false things. Yes no exactly and I think you can see that because the type of
*  first the type of false things that people believe are surprisingly
*  consistent across the world so you know people will have beliefs in ancestors in
*  ghosts in witches in you know in some types of gods that you find recurrent you
*  know with a lot of you know fascinating variation obviously but the core
*  concepts tend to be recurrent in just about any human society and if you think
*  of what would be the concepts that would be like if you are someone who could
*  just you know persuade people at will you know why make them believe that I
*  mean you know there are so many things that you could make them believe that
*  would be better for you rather than them believing in ghosts for instance or
*  ancestors or whatever that it's not you know it doesn't fit with the idea that
*  someone is just influencing them in whatever way they want it just people
*  are prone as you are saying to have some beliefs and it's gonna be very easy for
*  them to grow up accepting these beliefs compared to others and and that's that's
*  the main reason why they have them. You do bring up a couple of fun examples of
*  exactly this one is the fun might not be the right word one is the skepticism
*  about vaccines worldwide which you say there's plenty of skepticism out there
*  but in different parts of the world the reasons offered for that skepticism are
*  completely incoherent from one to one. Yeah no completely and so you know and
*  that we saw that again during the obviously the the COVID the COVID
*  vaccine and the resistance in some parts to do to the COVID vaccine is that
*  people believe that people become other people become vaccine hesitant or can
*  anti-vax because they hear that you know vaccines is going to give you you know
*  5g something or whatever else which sounds great but anyway and in fact it's
*  really the other way around is that there is an audience for such views
*  because people have an intuitive resistance to vaccination and we can
*  tell that because in every country in the world there are some people who are
*  really anti-vax usually they're a very small portion of the population there
*  will be some people who are kind of vaccine hesitant who are not so sure and that
*  has been true from from the very beginning of kind of enforced vaccination
*  and inoculation in the UK and we don't have the same pattern of kind of
*  universal and not in the sense that everyone resists but in the sense that
*  everyone there are people who resist for other types of therapies indeed I mean
*  obviously there are some therapies that won't work at all that are very
*  successful in many places and so in everywhere in the world you have this
*  every this you know in some people this resistance to vaccination and then it is
*  fed by many many different stories you know it will give you autism it will
*  give you AIDS it will give you whatever else that are kind of custom-made to
*  appeal to two different cultures you know what is the the prevalent fear that
*  culture at that moment that will be then linked to vaccination but that does not
*  cause the fear in the first place it seems like rationalization is much more
*  common than rationality is one motto from this yes so in most cases we will
*  come up you know as you were saying earlier we'll have a belief then we'll
*  rationalize it will justify to others and it's it's rare although it does
*  happen that we we get our minds changed by by other people's reasons and the
*  other example that that struck me was the studies of Nazi propaganda there's
*  this feeling that Nazi propaganda was like hugely successful and led to all
*  these terrible things but apparently the studies are bring into question whether
*  or not they were really changing people's minds no exactly no those first
*  picked up on by Jan Kershaw like a very kind of standard historian one of the
*  main historians of the Third Reich who was one of the first to really look at
*  not only what was the content of Nazi propaganda and there was so much of it
*  unfortunately but whether it worked and his contention based on his broad
*  knowledge of the data and also kind of fascinatingly the Nazi they had their
*  their version of kind of gallop they wanted to know whether you know where
*  the German people were thinking so they couldn't you know do a proper poll but
*  they had someone some people who were tasked with figuring out what the
*  German people were thinking and you know in teralia vis-a-vis the propaganda and
*  what Kershaw thought was that Nazi propaganda worked so to speak only when
*  people already believed what the propaganda was saying and so
*  unfortunately in many places in Germany Germans were quite anti-semitic already
*  and so in these places that's the anti-semitic propaganda was very
*  successful at least in the sense of being widely accepted and you know
*  widely spread but the nancy made many other efforts like they wanted to
*  persuade you know factory workers to give up communism's they had no no no
*  like that all they wanted to impose like widespread euthanasia for the handicapped
*  and you know everybody hates them for it they wanted the Nazis to be liked and
*  the Nazis were never really liked in Germany they liked Hitler but they the
*  most Nazi operatives were mostly kind of reviled so in many fronts it was quite
*  kind of unsuccessful and more recently there had been there has been more
*  quantitative studies that have managed to look at whether how effective it had
*  been the Nazi propaganda in different ways and it really confirms Kershaw's
*  conclusion in the sense that it seems to have made things worse marginally in
*  areas where people were already very highly anti-semitic but it didn't have
*  any effect or even backfired in areas with with kind of low anti-semitism.
*  So if I'm trying to summarize this it sounds like in these attempts at mass
*  persuasion might work if what they're really doing is just heightening beliefs
*  that are already felt what about when people just have an empty spot where
*  that belief would be I mean can you just go in there and create a belief?
*  Yes so but to come back to the first point quickly propaganda can have many
*  insidious effects even if it doesn't persuade anybody so for instance the
*  once the German the Germans rightfully enough suddenly realized that the
*  government was kind of backing them up in their anti-semitism and that if they
*  engaged in anti-semitic acts they would not be prosecuted or
*  anything then you know obviously it gives them free range to do whatever
*  awful thing they want to do even if they're without changing their beliefs
*  about you know the Jewish people but their change their beliefs about what
*  would happen to them if they if they attack them it also creates this kind of
*  coordination points in which people realize that actually wow I'm surrounded
*  by a lot of people who don't like Jewish people either so you know that gives you
*  more strength and that you know allows to take you know more actions all of
*  these things are horrible but they're not persuasion in the basic sense like
*  these people are already anti-semitic they're just the propaganda allows them
*  to realize that the government that other people also are and obviously the
*  same thing can happen for good things like you know people can realize
*  actually there are more people who care about the climate than I thought so it's
*  not it doesn't have to be negative but but it's not gonna share persuasion and
*  now I forgot what was the other point that you don't when you don't have a
*  pre-existing strong belief can it can it can it can so this way it can a
*  political scientist called non attitudes and so you know if you ask me do you
*  have a take on on commercial treaty between France and Germany that I've
*  never heard about you know I might try to tell you something because I want to I
*  want you to think I'm knowledgeable but essentially I have no idea what's going
*  on and for these kind of attitudes people are quite easily influenced by
*  people they already trust so you know in the US if I'm a big you know Bernie
*  Sanders fan and I know he has that opinion on that specific topic then I
*  will tend to agree with him on that but that only works as you're saying for
*  things in which we have an empty slot and we don't have any intuition and we
*  affect us in any way so so it's not it's completely rational at the individual
*  level to do this because if you trust a guy because you think he has served your
*  your cause and your voice for decades then it makes sense to believe him on
*  some issue you have nothing to you know nothing about but it can still be
*  problematic at the collective level in the sense that a public opinion does
*  influence policy and so if a lot of people believe something then it might
*  actually influence policy so people don't they're not careful individually
*  because it you know it makes doesn't make sense for them to be really
*  careful about these ideas but it can still have some some commensal
*  impact and yet there's a lot of effort put into trying to persuade people at
*  large scale right whether it's political campaigns or advertising or
*  entertainment or what have you is that just a waste of time or are they just
*  do they secretly intuit what you've already said that they can sort of
*  heighten beliefs that are already there if done effectively I think it's
*  plausible that some of it is a waste of money especially in the case of
*  advertising there was a very good book suggesting that the you know if
*  advertisers realize how little advertising works online you know
*  Google and Facebook and all of them are going to crumble and the whole internet
*  as we know it is we can have threatened sweet but there's again working and
*  different things so I think what is clear is that it is not the case that
*  people's preferences are deeply shaped by advertising so you can say well people
*  are buying you know SUVs because of advertising people some people like big
*  powerful cars that is something that is there but if you're an advertising
*  agency so if you're sure most people you know whether you buy one SUV or a very
*  similar model from another brand you know it makes very little difference to
*  you so it you know the fact that you want to buy an SUV is because of your
*  preferences that you had before but from the point of view of the brand
*  whether you pick their SUV or some other SUV makes obviously all the difference
*  sure and so advertising can still work nothing makes you buy make not in
*  making you buy an SUV instead of a mini but in making you making you buy maybe
*  you know what SUV compared to another model that is you know pretty much the
*  same so it's not changing your mind it's just shifting your brand awareness and
*  yeah the margin a little bit and even these effects are relatively small right
*  but you know that can be a win for advertisers even if you know it doesn't
*  imply that that people have really changed their minds dramatically I
*  should mention that studies show that advertising on podcasts is very effective
*  but actually there was this brilliant anecdote by speaking of podcasts on the
*  Freakonomics podcast by Steve Levitt in which recounted being hired as a
*  consultant by a big company that sold the hardware tools okay and and he was
*  asking them so they're asking him to look into you know the advertising
*  they were doing and they were spending like dozens of millions of dollars a
*  year it was a big company so like big spending you think well they're gonna
*  think really carefully about what they're doing and what he reported is
*  that essentially they had no idea what they were doing and they say look you
*  know we know advertising works because every year before Father's Day and before
*  Christmas we do a lot of advertising and then people buy more tools in fact
*  well you know maybe it's Father's Day so yeah anyway and so yeah no it's a lot of
*  money might be wasted in that domain yeah well so what tell tell us more a
*  little bit about what are the I guess I'm thinking that this is sort of medical
*  analogy what are the forms of resistance or inoculation we have against being
*  gullible to crazy claims whether is that a personal level or a mass level like is
*  there is there something that the individual listeners can say oh yes if I
*  sharpen my ability at this I will become less gullible so on the whole I mean I'm
*  sure there are ways of achieving that but my my take on this is that people are
*  already too conservative if anything so the problem is not that people like
*  accept things too easily is that they reject things too easily and so if you
*  take like in a vaccine hesitant or cannot anti-vax people I think they can
*  go in with this preconception against vaccination which is something
*  understandable you know you're injecting something into someone is healthy etc
*  etc so and it's you know it's mistaken but you can see the intuition I think so
*  they go in with this and then the issue is not that they gullibly accept
*  messages because they already have that viewpoint the problem is that they
*  reject the medical consensus on vaccination and I think for most of us
*  what we should think about more is how can I open my mind more you know what is
*  the information out there maybe from people who come from different
*  disciplines different you know political parties you know different
*  countries whatever different you know I think background you know whatever that
*  what are these people saying that I might be missing out on because I don't
*  trust them because I don't listen to them enough I think that's a much more
*  important question than what are the messages that now and being influenced
*  by in a bad way well that's very interesting it would suggest that rather
*  than valorizing skeptical thinking although there's a place for that
*  clearly but open-mindedness or willingness to contemplate ideas you
*  don't already have is maybe even more valuable if you want to reach new
*  insights you don't already have oh yeah no bye bye I would say by orders of my
*  because by default we tend to be quite conservative and and so you know we
*  evolved in an environment that was obviously vastly different from the one
*  we were in now and so we for ancestors you know they knew just about everybody
*  they would ever talk to in their lives and they could discuss things at length
*  and so if someone has a good idea you know you know that they whether they're
*  knowledgeable in that area or not you can you know whether you can trust them
*  or not you can you can talk about it and exchange arguments so it's quite likely
*  that you'll end up changing your mind if it's warranted whereas nowadays you're
*  confronted with a lot of information that you don't really know the source
*  you don't know if you can trust them or not you don't know if they're competent
*  you don't you can't talk to them it's as a result you just you know you're not
*  persuaded by them even if sometimes you should okay actually this is yeah that's
*  very interesting so just to put bring it down to earth and see if I get it right
*  there's this feeling that you know there's a bunch of people out there who
*  believe in Bigfoot let's say and the criticism of those people is that
*  they're not skeptical enough they're too open to this crazy idea and what you're
*  saying is actually like any reasonable person has heard plenty of other people
*  say no Bigfoot does not exist there's no evidence for it and their actual
*  problem is not that they're too credulous and they they're willing to
*  they're too they're not skeptical enough about Bigfoot is it too skeptical about
*  the very good reasons given why Bigfoot does not exist exactly I think it's very
*  very rare to find someone who has not in our societies who hasn't been exposed to
*  the to you know crying versions or better versions of their ideas and who
*  has kind of refused them and so if you start with the idea so Bigfoot is a bit
*  of a you know that that many people believe in Bigfoot but then again if
*  you look at things are vastly more common like you know vaccine come you
*  know vaccine hesitancy or conspiracy theories and and that people seem to
*  have a knack for kind of intuitively you know in every culture people have
*  some good portion of the population will have those beliefs then the issue is
*  that they fail to correct themselves or they felt they fail to accept to be
*  corrected by others and I think that's that's the that's the main problem we
*  have and it really does sound like part of that main problem is our fondness
*  for whatever set of priors or folk beliefs that we start with or or even
*  just wishful thinking I guess yeah I mean some of it is is kind of some some
*  you know personal attachment I guess but as we mentioned earlier in the case of
*  that of that group of that that had predicted the end of the world that had
*  been fortunately proven wrong a lot of it is social so if you're a conspiracy
*  theorist like someone who's quite you know into that movement if you're like
*  a big Shannon person that's a lot of who you are that's a lot of the time you
*  spend that's a lot of the people you know and so abandoning that belief or
*  that set of beliefs would entail typically large social costs in terms
*  of you know friendships that are broken and you know you lose your hobby so
*  people are then again feel are not being necessarily rational even though at the
*  societal level the costs can be can can it can can be significant well I guess
*  there's a down-to-earth set of questions here in the modern world it does seem to
*  be that there's lots of people who believe lots of false things I guess
*  you've given us some framework for understanding why that is is there is
*  there some suggestions for how to fight it how to fix it to get against
*  misinformation etc yeah so usually my the set of solutions I would advocate for
*  the most are things that are hard to do and that are very systemic so for
*  instance if you take something like conspiracy theories in every country in
*  the world there are conspiracy theories and you have you know 10 15 20 percent of
*  the population who will tend to believe many of these things as far as I can
*  tell the only thing that really matters at that scale is how how good of a
*  government you have so if your government is very trustworthy and not
*  corrupt there will be fewer conspiracy theories so that doesn't mean that the
*  conspiracy so if you're in a country like Pakistan or that that has a pretty
*  not very functional government and a lot of actual conspiracies yeah it doesn't
*  mean that the conspiracy people believe are actual conspiracies but you're in
*  this mindset of it's plausible that there will be conspiracies so if you
*  first tell you look you know it's the government is the US government that
*  goes 9-11 it's plausible because you know the Pakistani government does bad
*  stuff yeah and and so and so that's the thing if you want to know if you want
*  people to accept vaccination more than to some extent from us to kill
*  pharmaceutical companies can also clean up their act even more and you know be
*  even more transparent and and be even more trustworthy it's not gonna solve
*  everything but if you really look at the aggregate level the only thing that is
*  going to meaningfully lower the rates of things like conspiracy theory is if
*  people have no grounds like fewer grounds for believing in this it's not
*  gonna bring them to zero they'll be kind of paranoid ish people everywhere but
*  it's going and we know it's gonna lower the aggregate level so that does seem to
*  suggest that a government that might be tempted by paternalistically keeping
*  people from the truth would be better off just letting people in on the truth
*  because that would in the long term increase people's trust in government and
*  then the people will be more willing to believe them when it's very important
*  yes no no completely I mean that's that's there would be a conclusion I
*  mean obviously you know trustworthiness of a government can can take many forms
*  and have many forms that have many many causes but the transparency would
*  clearly be important yeah I don't know you know how much you're into it living
*  in a different country and so forth but of course we have radical polarization
*  here in the United States a part of which is an epistemic polarization people
*  just believe very very different things and it to the point where it's hard to
*  find a common ground to imagine changing people's minds let me not put
*  words in your mouth is there is there some way to deal with this partisan
*  epistemic polarization that is suggested by this way of thinking so
*  first of all as far as I've kept tabs on that literature there is some I can
*  ideological or kind of epistemic polarization it's not as bad as people
*  tend to think so if you look at polls regarding you know how would you think
*  about gun control or abortion or whatever and the average Republican or
*  Democrat tends to be much closer to each other than people think it seems as if
*  the thing that is really clearly growing a lot in the US at the moment is
*  affective polarization where people from both parties increasingly dislike each
*  other yeah okay and interestingly this is likely due to mix of factors one of
*  them is people are increasingly ideologically coherent so increasingly
*  like if you look at you know 30 40 50 years ago right you could be you know a
*  Democrat but you were you know pro-gun and you were in anti-texas or whatever
*  it was kind of all over the place whereas nowadays increasingly people are
*  maybe more informed about politics they follow they know more about politics and
*  that means that if you're a Democrats or vice versa Republican you feel more
*  compelled to agree with most of the you know the points that the Democrats
*  defend and then obviously then it means that if you know that someone is a
*  Democrat then you can infer that if you're a Republican yourself that you're
*  going to disagree with them on many many things which gives you some grounds for
*  not liking them so much so it so yeah so but then again it seems as if and the
*  solutions aren't gonna be easy because we know it's not just it's not just
*  Social media can amplify the problem partly because it tends to show you the
*  most extreme versions of the of the other side so some people believe that
*  social media creates issues because it cuts you off from seeing what's on the
*  other side of the political spectrum but that doesn't seem to be the case if
*  anything you are more exposed to kind of cross cutting information from the
*  other side of the spectrum on social media than in real life but the type of
*  information you tend to be you tend to be exposed to on social media is some of
*  the most extreme information so if you're a Democrat you might only
*  encounter you know some Republicans saying some extremely steely offensive
*  thing because that's the thing that will create outrage and be retweeted and so
*  you have people have increasingly this distorted view of the other side and
*  that is kind of what is driving ideological polarization but as a
*  caveat to that obviously social media has been rising in just about every
*  country but there hasn't been a rise in effective polarization everywhere so
*  clearly effective polarization social media on its own is not sufficient to
*  generate kind of by by magic or by necessity effective polarization and some
*  people suspect that in the US is still kind of kind of racial tensions and
*  another kind of historical problems that still kind of haunts the US and that it
*  may be amplified by social media but it's not it's not just social media but
*  I'm wondering it's interesting it's not the same everywhere it is not all also
*  just the US right it is also true in some other places so it's not some weird
*  in between but I'm wondering it how much of it is just I talked to Ezra Klein
*  about polarization here in the United States and part of it is just sort of a
*  game theoretic calculation on the part of the politicians that undermining
*  trust in the other side helps them win and and maybe this points to a
*  fundamental instability of democracies in a world where technology lets people
*  get messages out so effectively yeah no that's possible that's you know that's
*  quite pessimistic but you know I don't know it's possible on the whole I tend
*  to be quite skeptical of overly pessimistic stances about the effect of
*  new media partly because you know across history for every new type of media
*  whether it's print or whatever else there has been a lot of people saying
*  it's gonna be the end of the world and in every case it has made things better
*  so you know I want to believe that this series is going to is going to continue
*  but clearly you know modern societies have issues that I mean I think people
*  tend to underestimate the potential of social media so for instance there's a
*  lot of talk about the effects of kind of tick-tock on teenagers and teenagers
*  are only consuming tink-tock and it's you know it's terrible but in a way I mean
*  before social media there was literally no way of reaching to teenagers on mass
*  I mean they don't read the New York Times they talk to their friends they
*  you know whereas now you do have something that possibly the government
*  or you know other organizations can use to convey messages to teenagers at a
*  large scale that was not possible before so there are dangerous but there are
*  also a lot of opportunities that that increasingly hopefully people will tap
*  for the best yeah no I mean my inclination is always like you to try
*  to be optimistic about these things especially just like you say we've
*  really come a long way and been able to do some great things with seen things
*  that seemed scary but also it is kind of our job if we are in a new situation
*  does that raise new dangers right for the old reliable forms of government and
*  social organization that we have been relying on for so long it does I mean if
*  anything it's probably it's kind of it speeds things up in a way so it makes
*  social change happen faster so it's not clear it dramatically changes the
*  direction in which is going to happen but you can see how it can happen faster
*  because just people communicate better they can coordinate more easily but
*  fundamentally people's preferences are are not that different so yeah okay good
*  so and I do actually like to conclude each podcast on a more or less
*  optimistic note I mean is there is there some optimistic message here about how
*  given that we did develop reasoning for social reasons and that were less
*  gullible than some people might have us believe can we become even more
*  reasonable by finding people we trust and letting them criticize us or
*  something like that you know is there is there some yeah no no completely no no
*  I mean you know the ideal context for us to reason well is to find people you
*  know we respect and and and you know who are of good faith and but still we have
*  to disagree about something like if you agree about everything things are gonna
*  make are gonna become worse so we have to be we have to be careful about that
*  maybe you can have one kind of optimistic messages to drop up is that
*  that's something we've touched upon already is that we probably don't don't
*  trust other people enough so it's likely that on the whole we tend to be a bit
*  too conservative and that's there's some some nice idea by by this Japanese
*  researchers unfortunately passed away a few years ago to show Yamagishi and his
*  ideas that trust is is something like other skills and the more you try
*  trusting people the better you get at trusting thing figuring out who you
*  should trust which makes sense in a way because if you never trust anybody you
*  never know whether you should have trusted them so you know if you ask me
*  on your podcast and say oh no I don't trust that guy I never know whether I'm
*  going to have a good time or not whereas if I do trust you well sometimes
*  I'll get burned sometimes you know it'll be great but at least I'll know whether I
*  can trust you maybe I can extrapolate that to other people so as long as the
*  stakes aren't massive there is a there is a big benefit in just trusting people
*  because then you learn more about you know whom to trust and who not to trust
*  whereas if you if you're too conservative then you just stay stuck in
*  your little bubble and you never you know you miss out on all these amazing
*  opportunities that yet other people can provide you I think I'm violating my own
*  rule here by letting my little pessimistic side come out but whenever I
*  hear suggestions like you know yes we should trust other people more I suspect
*  that a lot of people hear that as yes other people should trust me more I
*  completely agree with that people have this kind of biases that they they see
*  biases in others but not but not in themselves but yeah I mean in particular
*  I think that's partly true there it's been shown in experiments when you have
*  kind of groups of people that you might have some kind of prejudice against you
*  know if the stakes aren't high I'm not advising that you put your head your
*  your life in the hands of someone you've never met or anything like that obviously
*  but the stakes aren't very high I think so I think in a lot of cases what stops
*  us from trusting people is not so much the the thing that we may lose a bit of
*  time or a little bit of money is that we're afraid we're gonna look silly if
*  we get duped and I think it's worth you know overcoming that to say well okay if
*  I lose you know then again a bit of time or money it's not the end of the world
*  maybe I'll look a bit silly but at the end of the day I'll be I'll be the
*  winner we have to make some mistakes if we're gonna make progress exactly that's
*  very optimistic advice I'm very happy to end there so you go mercy a thanks so
*  much for being on the winescape podcast thanks so much on
*  you
