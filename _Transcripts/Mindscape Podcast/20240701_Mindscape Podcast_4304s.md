Just like with physics, in biology it is perfectly possible to do most respectable work without thinking much about philosophy, but there are unmistakably foundational questions where philosophy becomes crucial. When do we say that a collection of matter (or bits) is alive? When does it become an agent, capable of making decisions? What are the origins of morality and altruistic behavior? We talk with one of the world's leading experts, Samir Okasha, about the biggest issues in modern philosophy of biology.

Samir Okasha received his D.Phil. in Philosophy from the University of Oxford. He is currently Professor of the Philosophy of Science at the University of Bristol. He is a winner of the Lakatos Award for his book Evolution and the Levels of Selection, and is a Fellow of the British Academy.

# Mindscape 281 | Samir Okasha on the Philosophy of Agency and Evolution
**Mindscape Podcast:** [July 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPQShSo1p5s)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Sometimes,
*  now as a card-carrying philosopher, right, I'm a member of a philosophy department as
*  well as a physics department, people will say either in some natural conversation or
*  just blurting it out because they've been meaning to, philosophy is kind of useless,
*  it's silly, it doesn't address problems that are real and important, it doesn't take into
*  account data and experiment and things like that. Now most of these objections are prima
*  facie, not worth paying attention to, but what really makes me laugh is the idea that
*  philosophy doesn't matter, that it's not important, right, that it doesn't affect how we go through
*  our lives. The simple response to all of these objections is that you can't help but do philosophy,
*  you can only do it well or do it badly. Take for example a very basic question, what is a human
*  being? What things here on earth count as human beings? This is a very important question, it's
*  important question for the modern world not only because we now have artificial intelligence and
*  you might wonder whether some thing that was created by human beings in a computer or in a
*  robot should count as a human being, but also what about things that clearly aren't human beings but
*  might deserve some rights that human beings have like other species of animals here on earth? Where
*  is the boundary line between human beings and other species? What about an octopus? Octopus is
*  clearly not a human being but as we learned by talking with Peter Godfrey Smith they think in
*  quite advanced ways, you might very well think that something like that deserves the kind of
*  moral status as a human being and you have to answer these questions, you know you might just say
*  ah here's my answer and move on, you might be unreflective or not very deep about it but that's
*  not a virtue, that's just you being lazy. So today's podcast with Samir Okasha who is a
*  philosopher of biology is about these kinds of questions. In some places it's exactly about
*  these questions, what is a species, what is a purpose, what is an agent, things like that,
*  but I think that more importantly than any of the specific answers that are offered here because
*  Samir is very good at sort of saying here's what all the plausible answers are without being too
*  picky about which one is the correct one, the idea of thinking about these questions carefully
*  and reflectively. Philosophy of biology is clearly related or similar to in some ways philosophy of
*  physics but also different because the things being studied, animals, plants, organisms, species,
*  genes, evolution are all things that are emergent right, they're higher level things so where to
*  draw the boundaries around them becomes an important question and it might get frustrating
*  to you but these are really really important questions to policy, to morality, to how we get
*  through our lives. So it's gonna be an important conversation I think for getting straight on some
*  of those issues and we also address some big picture, very loud and noisy controversies in
*  biology such as the levels of selection, the kin selection versus group selections controversies
*  and so forth. So with that let's go.
*  Samir Okasha, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Thanks very much Sean. You know I hang out with
*  both physicists and philosophers myself, arguably M1 myself. You're a philosopher of biology and I
*  guess my first question is the relationship of philosophy to biology and we have philosophy of
*  science and that often talks about theories and theory choices and things like that. In philosophy
*  of physics we have this subset called the foundations of physics where we're really kind
*  of doing physics but in a way that would only let you get hired in a philosophy department,
*  not in a physics department. Is there foundations of biology, is that a recognizable thing?
*  Sean There is and that's to some extent what I think of myself as doing. However I don't think
*  everybody in philosophy of biology would recognize that label. So perhaps I should say a few words
*  about how this sub-discipline of the philosophy of science came into being. I mean I think it
*  crystallized into a subject in its own right in the early 1970s and in part this was because of
*  a feeling in the Anglophone philosophy of science community that what passed for general philosophy
*  of science which dealt with sort of general methodological questions about the relation
*  between hypothesis and evidence, about what explanation looked like, about how theory choice
*  is made and so on. While purporting to be fully general in reality was physics-centric and so a
*  lot of people started to ask the question well wait a minute where do the life sciences fit into
*  this picture and to start thinking of biology as an interesting sort of test case if you like for
*  general ideas from philosophy of science and very often the question was how well do these ideas
*  about explanation confirmation or reduction for example transpose over from the implicitly assumed
*  domain of the physical sciences to the life sciences. That was I think the initial impetus
*  for the subject but it quickly gained a following and I think the motivation for linking philosophy
*  and biology changed somewhat in the ensuing decades in that very many philosophers and I
*  think I've heard someone like Daniel Dennett being a key person to illustrate this came to
*  think that certain ideas in biology particularly in evolutionary biology particularly to do with
*  natural selection had a significance for philosophical questions that was quite unique
*  that one wouldn't find necessarily in other bits of science including other bits of the
*  life sciences and so for that reason evolution came to be at the centerpiece of this attempt
*  to link up modern biological science with traditional philosophical ideas that constitutes
*  the core of the philosophy of biology today. Yeah it makes perfect sense to me that evolution
*  plays the same role or that stands in the same relationship to philosophy of biology
*  that quantum mechanics stands in relationship to philosophy of physics like centrally important
*  and obviously raising some hugely important philosophical questions. Yeah no that's absolutely
*  right I mean Darwin himself noted this so in a famous comment he made in a notebook never
*  intended for publication then Darwin wrote origin of man now proved he who understands
*  baboon would do more for metaphysics than Locke in an allusion to the 17th century English philosopher
*  John Locke. Now he didn't expand on what he meant by that and you know a very modest man never
*  intended that to see the light of day but I think it nicely captures that the sentiment you express
*  Sean that there's something about the theory of evolution by natural selection that is of unique
*  significance for philosophy and this was a point picked up again by many thinkers in ensuing decades
*  it's interesting that the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in the tractatus logico philosophicus
*  from I think it was 1916 or 19 or something who was not a fan of the what we now call the
*  naturalistic way of doing philosophy so in that in that book Wittgenstein says at one point Darwin's
*  theory has no greater relevance for philosophy than any other hypothesis in natural science and you
*  can almost hear the plaintiff tone in Wittgenstein's voice as he says that because and I think the fact
*  that he needed to say it illustrates how the contrary opinion must have been in the air at
*  the time. Well okay but then yes I completely agree that evolution clearly is going to be relevant
*  but there's fuzzy things going on in our understanding of evolution right like what are the units of
*  selection we we famously have had debates relatively recently is it the gene that is the unit
*  of selection is it the organism is it the species is it the is it groups is it kin is I presume this
*  is an active area of what you guys talk about. Very much so and this was indeed the subject of
*  my first book on evolution called evolution and the levels of selection from 2006 which was a
*  philosophical attempt to come to grips with this the very question that you discuss the fact that
*  within the prompted by the fact that within the the evolutionary biology community there were
*  apparent disagreements about how exactly we should think of natural selection as operating
*  should we describe it as a process that ultimately selects some genetic variance over others perhaps
*  the orthodox neo-dohinian viewpoint and enshrined in popular works such as Richard Dawkins the
*  selfish gene or should we think instead of it as a process that fundamentally operates at the level
*  of individual organisms much as the way Darwin thought most of the time or as some people would
*  have it should we adopt an expanded perspective according to which natural selection can in
*  principle operate at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy at once including in some
*  cases selecting whole groups over others and in the in the more extreme versions of this
*  possibly even selecting some species over others those are ideas that for a long time and I think
*  to some extent still today regarded as controversial if not heterodox by the mainstream in evolutionary
*  biology but they have always had an important following particularly this idea of group level
*  selection. So what's the right answer? Oh it's a long story and the answer as ever in philosophy
*  and in most things is it depends on what you mean but I think one of the striking things about this
*  debate and what attracted me to it initially was that it was not always obvious whether the
*  disagreements reflected empirical disagreements about the selective processes actually occurring
*  in nature or were rather disagreements of a different character where it was really a matter
*  of convention if you like how one described which formulation of the same theory one adopted. So to
*  make that more concrete it's been this long clash between proponents of the Darwinian idea of
*  individual level selection which basically hypothesizes that natural selection is choosing
*  individual variants in a population typically a population of conspecifics over other ones
*  according to the criterion of greater enhanced survival or reproductive success so the better
*  or fitter variants get selected as the bearers of those variants survive better than other
*  individual organisms. But beginning with Darwin himself the idea has been around that in certain
*  cases the process of natural selection could operate on whole groups so favoring it so it could
*  be group on group competition if you like particularly and this is particularly relevant given that many
*  organisms live in groups of various different sorts from family groups up to larger tribes and
*  larger aggregations all within a single species in the case I'm thinking of and it's inconceivable
*  that in principle some groups might do better than others so the idea of natural selection if you like
*  could be frame shifted from the individual level up to the group level and the significance of
*  this idea is that it's a positive mechanism by which so-called altruistic behaviors could evolve
*  so something that's individually harmful or some sort of self-sacrifice on the part of an individual
*  to help others would seem impossible to evolve by the mechanism Darwin mostly had in mind
*  individual level selection but if you think of selection as favoring some groups over others
*  then it's conceivable that things that are beneficial for the collective even if they're
*  individually costly could prosper and that's the historical reason for being interested in this
*  issue of group level selection but what attracted me to this debate and I think other philosophers
*  too was that it wasn't really always clear whether the proponents of these two views
*  were talking past each other or not on the face of it it started out as a resolutely empirical
*  issue I mean here's a hypothetical process that we can model and describe does it go on in nature
*  or not and if it does how common is it and how important is it that's to say selection at the
*  group level but alongside that you had a group of other people arguing that no
*  selection at the group level is really just a different way of talking about a process that
*  they referred to as kin selection which is a process of selection on individuals that takes
*  into account the fact that many behaviors an individual engages in may have consequences for
*  the reproductive fitness of its kin it's so in short you had it you had a situation where
*  it wasn't clear whether we had a disagreement of fact or two different ways of stating the
*  same facts or the same hypothesis I always felt a little naive about this because it seems to me
*  obviously true that altruistic behavior can be naturally selected for and maybe this is group
*  selection seems kind of natural to me if if I have a group of people who are fighting for
*  each other and cooperating I can easily see them surviving over a bunch of rugged individualists
*  who are just in it for themselves yeah no that I mean that that's exactly right I mean here
*  although there is a problem in that you're right that there is there would be a selective advantage
*  to a highly cooperative cohesive group where everyone looks out for the group rather than
*  a group composed of rugged individualists who only look out for themselves and don't care about
*  group welfare however one has to ask the question is the is that going to be evolutionarily stable
*  because you're certainly right that in group on group competition the group containing the altruists
*  will will likely do better however if you think of the selective dynamics taking place within a group
*  then it would seem that the the selfish free rider who looks out for themselves is going to
*  outdo the altruist who cares about group welfare and so the the mechanism it's not obvious that
*  the mechanism can work particularly over longer periods of time interestingly darwin himself
*  put his finger on exactly this tension in the idea of natural selection in his book the descent of
*  man in a famous discussion of the evolution of self-sacrificial tendencies among early hominids
*  so darwin claimed that self-sacrifice was was something one found in in hominids a willingness
*  to put one's own life on the line for the good of one's of the tribe or the larger unit and he and
*  he then said well how could that have got there the first thing he said was precisely to make
*  the point that individually that would seem hard to evolve by individual selection so darwin said
*  he who was ready to sacrifice his life as many as savage has been would often leave no offspring to
*  inherit his noble nature so what darwin is saying there is that the the altruist comes last well
*  yeah okay so this but then but then he continued and immediately in the next sentence darwin
*  continued sorry to interrupt yeah um by by saying however a tribe including many members who were
*  always willing to sacrifice themselves for the common good might be victorious over another tribe
*  and this would be natural selection too so darwin himself in that in that very insightful passage
*  firstly points out the problem points out the puzzle how is it that a process of natural
*  selection could could lead individuals to behave in ways that are costly but benefit others with a
*  putative solution namely the hypothesis of natural selection up at the group level
*  so that attempts me to amend my previous suggestion and say that now the robust group will be one in
*  which there are many altruistic cooperators but also several selfish free riders and perhaps
*  the mixture of them will vary with time depending on how much pressure they're getting from the
*  outside world yeah no that i mean that's exactly right i mean sean you put your your finger on it
*  i mean it depends on the balance between the different selective forces so you can immediately
*  see you know why why evolutionists realized that they had to they had to mathematically model this
*  it was no good just to sort of bounce around scenarios the way darwin was doing and that
*  effort really only came to fruition um it's quite significant time later i mean jbs hal dame the
*  english evolutionist in a 1930 book the causes of evolution gestured at the suggest at the problem
*  in in formally in quantitative terms but it was really only with work in the 1960s that people
*  came to think in a systematic way about what the different selective forces are and whether the
*  mechanism of group level selection favoring altruism could evolve and for a long time the
*  receive you on that question was no that it's it's an it's an an implausible evolutionary mechanism
*  essentially because the models the early gen models designed to probe that question made this
*  assumption that the the turnover rate of individuals was much faster than that of groups
*  so if you like the group would stick around for many individual generations and that meant that
*  selection or at the individual level would be faster and would lead the groups quickly to become
*  um selfish dominated by selfish individuals so in short although it was still true that a
*  cooperative or altruistic group would do better than a selfish group the problem was that group
*  level variation wouldn't be likely to arise in the first place um because the individual level
*  process would tend to undermine it if you like however i mean more recently opinion has changed
*  on this matter somewhat i should say and the idea of what's now called multi-level selection
*  as in has enthusiastic advocates well that's kind of where i was going to go because at the
*  philosophical level this seems like a wonderful test ground for thinking about emergence right
*  i mean in some level all of these goings on could be described as a bunch of atoms and molecules
*  bumping into each other and obeying the laws of physics and we're saying but there's a more
*  efficient surveyor
*  understandable higher level description and in this case unlike atoms going to fluids
*  when you go from molecules to organisms or species or groups it's messier and maybe
*  all the emergent levels do interact with each other in some way
*  yeah no no no i think i agree with that yes i mean what does the general issue of emergence
*  um and this the the idea of course of emergent property um the idea that sort of aggregates of
*  things that are not fundamental particles if you like will often come to you know exhibit emergent
*  properties be they you know chemical bonds or or um larger things such as such as biomolecules or
*  cells or or or whole organisms and i think that that that certainly is right and most of us think
*  in philosophy and i'm sure in most branches of science too that although in principle there's
*  presumably a physical level story going on that nonetheless there are laws deep and important laws
*  governing these larger entities in virtue precisely because they they exhibit these
*  emergent properties in a systematic way how the emergent property idea bears on this question of
*  levels of organization in nature levels of selection is i think an interesting question
*  and one idea that's um always been been out there is the idea that um
*  natural selection acting above the individual level where individual roughly means multi-celled
*  organism in this context so natural selection acting at a higher level at the level of a family
*  group or a tribe or a community or a species or something like that
*  requires that higher level entity to have properties that are emergent with respect to
*  the lower level um so if you think for example of the contrast between an insect colony
*  and a buffalo herd for example i mean a buffalo herd is basically just a bunch of buffalo you know
*  all living together now they do interact in interesting ways and so on but it's stretched
*  to think of the herd itself as having any emergent properties i mean obviously you could say some true
*  things about the herd it has a certain population density for example occupies a certain geographical
*  area there's a certain total body mass and so on and those are in a sense all properties of the herd
*  but they clearly depend in a very direct and obvious way on the properties of the individual
*  buffalo that make up the herd contrast that with something like a honeybee colony which is an
*  incredibly sophisticated grouping you know whether those bees are divided into different castes
*  you've got the queen you've got the workers who don't reproduce themselves but who you spend their
*  time defending the nest tending the queen's brood foraging for food working for the common good in
*  short and so you have a complex division of labor and what people often loosely refer to as a sort
*  of functional integration at the level of the whole colony and that's exactly the sort of thing that
*  emergent property might usefully describe that the term emergent property might usefully describe
*  in a biological or ecological context and it's no accident that things like honeybee colonies are
*  often taken to be higher units of selection. Interesting and so this is this is you're bumping
*  right up against the you know famous question of whether or not the higher level emergent properties
*  are truly new or whether they could be derived from the underlying thing I'm literally trying
*  to finish a paper myself about this right now but I'm the person you described at the beginning I
*  just have all my examples are physics examples and I need to have more biology examples in the back
*  of my mind. Right and I think I think there certainly are some yeah I mean I would distinguish
*  two things I mean one is the general question of whether biological entities you know including
*  biomolecules for example exhibit emergent properties to which I think the answer is definitely yes in
*  in one sense of the term emergent property from the question of whether emergent properties
*  sort of feature in certain types of natural selection or must feature in certain types
*  of natural selection which is perhaps a slightly different question and to see the distinction is
*  just that one can ask the former question even in the in the hypothetical circumstance that
*  creationism were true yeah it doesn't depend on evolution per se it's really a question
*  about levels of organization. My own experience in the emergence literature is that there are
*  people who mostly bring up either physics examples or maybe computer science examples like the game
*  of life and there are other people who leap right to consciousness right and they want to say that
*  consciousness is strongly emergent I mean would you would you advocate for more people living
*  spending some time in between and thinking about biology? Maybe I mean I think well I think it's
*  certainly true that there is an established use of the term emergent property in ecology particularly
*  where people talk about ecosystems having emergent properties such as the property of stability for
*  example or a certain degree of complexity or a certain amount of nutrient recycling in a
*  in the ecosystem at large or something so people know what they mean when they talk about emergent
*  properties in well they pick out something that they all agree on at least when they talk about
*  emergent properties in a biological context. Whether I would advocate that people interested
*  in emergence in general expand into their repertoire of examples from the physical
*  case and the consciousness case to the more general biological case I think it depends on
*  what the goal of the inquiry is I mean it's long seemed to me that much of the talk about emergence
*  really that people are talking past each other. I think I'm not the first person to have made this
*  observation by any means but I think it's interesting that I think philosophers and scientists
*  often are talking past each other when they use the term emergence in that for many philosophers
*  it came to connote something really extremely puzzling and there's some debate about whether
*  those things really exist at all whereas I think for many scientists then the notion that
*  emergent properties exist is obvious it's not up for grabs and it's just another way of saying
*  that you know there are things that aren't quarks if you like. It is hard and I've often tried to
*  figure out a better word to use for what the physicists call emergence because I don't want
*  to get confused when talking to people who come at it from a different angle but it's a good word
*  it's we're here we're stuck with it we just kind of try to use it carefully I think. Yeah and that's
*  certainly true I mean there's probably no escaping it. And the other for me the other big
*  philosophical issue well scientific slash philosophical issue foundational issue in
*  evolutionary biology is the role of how much change how much evolution is adaptive versus
*  just random drift or accidental spandrels or things like that is that something that you
*  have tackled or thought about? Yeah though absolutely I mean I think of that as being
*  well in principle an empirical issue at least when formulated carefully.
*  So with your reference to spandrel then that brings to mind the famous paper by Richard
*  Launton and Stephen Jay Gould from 1979 where they castigated traditional neo-Darwinians
*  for being too ready to assume that everything they find has an adaptive explanation and for
*  telling what they call just-so stories and I think it was a partially valid if overstated critique
*  in my opinion. I mean I think they certainly engaged in one too many rhetorical flourishes
*  in that paper but they also made some sound points which is one has to really consider
*  quite carefully what the the data well what the test is for whether some particular
*  organismic trait really is an evolved response to some environmental situation or not. However,
*  in the molecular biological age then a whole lot you know far more sophisticated methods are
*  available than were when Gould and Launton were writing in the you know in the age of DNA sequencing
*  by which it's far easier for theorists to find signatures of adaptive evolution and to get to the
*  heart of this question of whether chance or adaptation is really the dominant feature leading
*  to change at the genomic level at least. I mean I think at the phenotypic level then although that
*  I mean the role of chance the importance of chance processes can't be underestimated in
*  evolution they play an absolutely critical role particularly in small populations where gene
*  frequency dynamics will typically depend very heavily on population size and if there's a small
*  population then chance is likely to be the dominant factor explaining changes in gene
*  frequencies over over time. However, the level of the whole organism's phenotype I think the
*  dominant view in a lot of biology has been that you know if the if we're talking about something
*  that's extremely complex you know if you're talking about I don't know some signaling pathway within a
*  cell or some organ you know if you think of a kidney or something like that or some aspect of
*  a you know say a crab's exoskeleton some aspect of anatomical structure that's not the result
*  of one gene but is the result of many many many genes and a complex process of development each
*  generation giving rise to it then it's inconceivable that that could be the result of chance alone.
*  Certainly you know mutations originally arise by chance that's agreed on by all parties but
*  the traits in question are so complex and so clearly adaptive well what's so apparently
*  adaptive I should say that the hypothesis that they could have evolved by anything other than
*  cumulative rounds of natural selection seems implausible so there's long been a tension
*  within biology when people are thinking about chance versus adaptation between those who
*  are discussing the question at the genomic level where they're discussing genome level evolution
*  changes in gene sequence basically over time and those who are discussing phenotypic evolution
*  where they're focusing on observed phenotypic characteristics of organisms and there's a bit
*  of a disconnect between those in that a lot of genomic evolution doesn't have phenotypic consequences
*  in that many mutations indeed most mutations that are not deleterious are just silent they make no
*  difference very often will make no difference to the protein that the gene produces and so make no
*  difference to the phenotype and so you can have a lot of genetic change that isn't manifest up at
*  the phenotypic level and that's why chance can be a dominant factor down at the genomic level
*  but playing less of a role although still a role when one is considering the evolution of
*  organisms phenotypes have you paid attention at all or followed the recent discussion about
*  assembly theory and its role in the origin of life yeah I have there was a paper wasn't there
*  about five years ago or so in nature I think that that did the rounds or was it in PNAS that did the
*  rounds about that yeah no I don't have anything good to say about it okay I'm afraid I have read
*  that I have read that paper and did I do remember thinking interesting but overstated well for the
*  for the people who are listening I give my tiny gloss on it Sarah Walker was a previous mindscape
*  guest and she was one of the authors of the paper but they seem to be saying you know I think
*  overstated is very much my own reaction to it they say something that is interesting and
*  completely plausible namely that the specific ways that complex structures can arise over
*  evolutionary history are very path dependent right you know the specific steps are going to matter
*  you're not just throwing things randomly together but then they say or at least they very very
*  strongly imply therefore we need to change the laws of physics to account for what is going on at a
*  fundamental level and that I just don't see at all yeah no that sounds like a big leap that's
*  that second conclusion I'm probably thinking when I read that paper that it belonged in a lineage of
*  sort of somewhat anti-darwinian thinking in that I mean the more extreme versions of darwinism have
*  always basically painted organisms as kind of a blank canvas and just assumed that whatever
*  anything could evolve you know the broadly speaking that the constraints imposed by the laws of
*  chemistry and physics are not particularly strong relative to the range of amazing things the ways
*  that a lineage could it could go the trajectory through evolutionary space that it could take
*  evolutionary space that it could take and so really the actual trajectories taken are going
*  to depend heavily on what was advantageous in the ancestral environments and so the darwinian story
*  can proceed and that contrasts with a different tradition that has always emphasized the importance
*  of structure in constraining and the physical constraints and and physical chemical constraints
*  in constraining the the type of things that can evolve and so have accorded a far lesser role to
*  darwin darwinism thinking of darwinism as basically a filtering mechanism for choosing among the few
*  things that are physically feasible at all and that way of thinking obviously downplays the
*  significance of the darwinian mechanism for accounting for what we have and that's a that's
*  an old and fascinating tension i think within within evolutionary thinking or biological thinking
*  perhaps i should say yeah i mean i think one of the ways in which the assembly theory folks want
*  to contemplate modifying the laws of nature is to make them more explicitly teleological
*  and that's always sort of a fraught word in discussions of biology and philosophy the idea
*  that there's move motion toward a goal of some sort it seems to me to be exactly the opposite maybe
*  this is what you're saying of the darwinian spirit yeah well it's interesting um i mean i
*  i think there are two ways of of describing um how darwinian ideas bear on on the issue of
*  teleology or goal directedness which is as you rightly point out sean is you know it's a topic
*  of age-old philosophical concern i mean this goes all the way back to aristotle and probably before
*  um i mean one one line of argument and and this was um perhaps the dominant or probably still is
*  the dominant view in in evolutionary circles is that what darwin did was to basically banish
*  teleology uh from nature so the so looked as if there was all there was a t loss and there were
*  you know that life had a a kind of t loss and and what darwin showed was that a brute blind
*  causal process that is not foresighted in any way that simply is choosing between variants according
*  to how currently good they are in the current environment could give rise to the appearance
*  of purpose and of goal directedness in the world so according to this view what darwin did is show
*  that there isn't any teleology in nature and to show how what looked to be teleological explanations
*  such as things like trees grow tall in order to get more sunlight could be recast as valid
*  causal explanations by invoking the feedback process of natural selection so in a sense it's
*  perfectly true that trees grow tall in order to get more sunlight but when we paraphrase that
*  correctly we realize that it's not a teleological explanation at all but a brute causal explanation
*  about the selective advantage to a tree of being a little bit taller than its neighbors
*  and then the the the outcome of the the cumulative process of selection that that gave rise to
*  so that's the first view says darwin banished teleology second view however says no he didn't
*  that what darwin did is naturalize teleology or if you like is to make the make make the world safe
*  for teleology and to show how in fact it could be it could be rescued and it's interesting an
*  interesting concept arose here in the work of originally due to an author called colin pittendrick
*  in in the 1960s called teleonomy and then this was taken up by the the later evolutionist urnst meier
*  um and is still widely used today so teleonomy is meant to denote the sort of respectable form of
*  goal directedness that could survive the um the the refutation of teleology by darwin if you like
*  so the idea is that darwin threw out you know the bad teleology an example of the bad teleology would
*  be the idea that evolutionary change itself is directed towards a goal right you know such as
*  you know humans or something like that organic change right so that's that's the bad sword um or
*  more generally the idea that natural selection has an eye on the future would be an example of the
*  bad sword the illegitimate sword but what many theorists who talk about teleonomy want to say is
*  that you know organisms really do engage in goal-directed activities and behaviors and that
*  that's not just in the eye of the beholder and isn't something you can try and explain away
*  in that you know aspects of say organismic reproduction and development of an organism
*  and organismic behavior and of organismic physiology all involve you know the the movement
*  of a system towards a goal and and that's implicit in how we speak about organisms so you know imagine
*  if you're observing animals engaging in some unusual behavior in the wild i mean the first
*  thing that you say is you know what are they doing what are they trying to achieve why why are
*  they doing that yeah right and the suggestion is that you know that's not illegitimate that way to
*  speak that much animal behavior really is goal-directed so take for example a salmon
*  um you know engages in that incredibly complex behavior where it's navigates all the way back
*  to its natal stream thousands of kilometers from where it is in order to spawn imagine if you didn't
*  know um about the phenomenon of of homing in salmon and you know biology studying the first
*  time and they track these salmon and find they're all doing this journey first thing they can say is
*  what are they doing what are they trying to achieve what's their goal and and so this this is the
*  underlying idea then is that a notion of goal-directedness is just a true descriptive
*  fact right about many organisms about all organisms really and that there's absolutely
*  no reason to disavow that in the light of darwin this is actually very those are the opposing poles
*  yeah no that's very very helpful because i recently on the podcast talked to david krakauer from san
*  african institute and he defined complex systems research as the study of telonomic matter and i
*  didn't bother to in my mind or in the discussion draw a distinction between teleological and
*  teleonomic but you you've explained it to me very nicely i kind of want to say
*  teleonomy is just emergent teleology i don't know if that's right no that and that may well be right
*  i mean it's partly complicated by the fact that as ever these terms have conflicting definitions
*  so in particular that i referred earlier to the german evolutionist ernst meier
*  who wrote you know important works over many decades from sort of 50s to the 80s
*  in in and also also touched on themes in philosophy of biology and he borrowed this
*  word teleonomy but invested it with a completely different meaning from the one that pitendre and
*  and others had originally coined it for so i think one has to be careful with that but roughly
*  speaking that i guess the definition is teleology real goals erectedness teleonomy apparent goal
*  directedness if you like which very nicely segues into the other thing i wanted to talk about which
*  is there are as you already have said individual organisms that act in very goal-directed ways
*  sometimes we call them agents and you've written a whole book about this and so but it's fascinating
*  to me like forget about the overall goal directedness of evolution or anything like that
*  individuals have goals right i have goals i know that's true and i think that i'm part of the
*  natural world how did that you know in some sense over the course of evolutionary history
*  some organisms started caring about the future in some way i'm sure that's an overly naive way
*  to put it but you know what do we think about how that happened yeah no i i think these are
*  these are interesting questions one way to think about it perhaps is this i mean if you think of
*  humans like you or i we have goals in you know having this discussion we've got a goal we want
*  to we've got a joint goal of making a podcast and you know then you know in an hour's time i'll have
*  the goal of cycling home safely cooking some dinner from a family or or whatever um so think
*  of that sense in which humans have goals then one standard way to think about that is to say that
*  we have a mental representation of the goal i mean so there's a goal state yeah that we make
*  a podcast and you are and you and i both mentally represent that that state meaning you know that we
*  intend we actually consciously intend to achieve that um now whether or not other animals mentally
*  represent their goals is a is a complex discussion um within the field of comparative cognition
*  um and opinions divide on that i mean i think most most people would allow that you know certainly
*  certainly many primates do possibly other vertebrates such as birds some authors want to extend
*  you know belief and mental representation of a goal all the way down the the animal kingdom
*  and some indeed would extend it to plants and microbes but that's a more heterodox view i think
*  but in any case i think everyone would agree that not all life on earth exist has
*  not all organisms that exist on earth have mental representations of their goals
*  but nonetheless most of them and perhaps all of them seem to have goals in a weaker sense
*  seem to engage in goal-directed behavior even if it's just something as simple as a bacterium
*  you know swimming up an oxygen gradient i mean obviously it would be it would be anthropomorphic
*  to say that the the bacterium is trying to reach an area of higher oxygen concentration
*  but nonetheless in a fairly obvious sense its goal in moving is to achieve a region of higher
*  oxygen concentration just in the sense that it consistently moves towards up the gradient
*  and it stops once the it's got enough oxygen so so one idea you might have is that conscious
*  goal-directedness that involves a mental representation of a goal that humans and
*  perhaps other animals have evolved from the simpler sort of goal-directedness that's manifest in the
*  telonomic behavior of all living organisms if you like and then the task if one accepts that
*  conceptualization of the problem the task then is to tell a plausible evolutionary story
*  about how that might have occurred what the intermediate steps might have been
*  and that's no easy task in part because it's not just a scientific one in that you know as i'm sure
*  you know a lot of philosophers have long problematized this idea of mental representation
*  of a goal or intentionality and wondered what it really amounts to and indeed some have wondered
*  whether it really exists so it's not as simple as saying we now we just need to tell to discover what
*  the evolutionary pathway was from sort of implicit goal-directedness of the sort that even bacteria
*  have to the conscious goal-directedness of the sort humans have because the end point there the
*  conscious goal-directedness of the sort humans have not all theorists even agree on what that is
*  right and it's hard to tell the good evolutionary story about how some attribute came into being
*  unless one can agree on what that attribute is well that's why you pay philosophers the big bucks
*  here right to help clarify these things i mean i think it is a trickier set of questions than
*  uh they initially appear to be i mean a ball rolls down a hill and it comes to rest at the bottom of
*  the hill um essentially nobody would say that it had the goal of getting to the bottom of the hill
*  and maybe ariestotle would have but i think we wouldn't and you know when my cat breaks into the
*  bread box to get the cat treats i think it pretty clearly does have a goal of getting those cat
*  treats the bacteria is somewhere in the middle is it that we need a richer conception of goal-
*  directedness is are there subdivisions or is it just that we've been too loose and we got we should
*  pick the right one i think these are very difficult questions um yeah i mean one one thing i try to do
*  in in my book about agency is just prise apart a number of different notions of agent which i
*  claim are actually at work in different scientific fields so i start with what we have traditionally
*  meant by agent in philosophy uh sometimes called intentional agent and according to this notion then
*  to be an agent is to act rather than just to behave that means one has to explicitly consciously
*  have the goal of trying to achieve something so intentional agency requires a complex a certain
*  psychology you've got to have a certain psychological makeup in order to be an intentional agent
*  exactly where who has that and who doesn't is it is perhaps a is a tricky question but in any case
*  most things many things don't bacteria don't balls rolling down inclined planes certainly don't
*  the weakest notion of agent that i i see at work is what i call a minimal agent and i should point
*  note that i use this term differently from some other authors and by minimal agent i just mean
*  you're something any entity that does something where the distinction here is between doing
*  something and merely having something happen to one if you like and here i draw on a very interesting
*  discussion by the philosopher fred dretzky in a 1988 book explaining behavior where dretzky just
*  says look there's contrast these two things right a rat is in a in a cage and um it it moves its
*  paw to press a lever to get a pellet it's learned it gets a pellet of food when it does that an
*  experimental rat so there we say the rat moved its paw scenario one scenario two an experimental
*  biologist puts their hand into the cage and manipulates the rat's paw and so in that case
*  the rat's paw was moved but that's not a movement that's not something the rat did it's something
*  that was done to it and so the suggestion then is the most minimal notion of agents is just something
*  that does things as opposed to merely having them things happen to them and what is how how do how
*  do we make that distinction precise well some philosophers have thought that the key just lies
*  and whether the cause of the motion is or the motor output is internal right to the organism
*  or is some external force acting on it and again i'm not saying that that's completely clear like
*  everything in this domain it's all a bit murky but i think there's a very intuitive distinction there
*  and that i think serves to define the most minimal notion of agency so we got the the most demanding
*  notion intentional agent the most minimal sorry the most undemanding notion minimal agent and
*  between those i think we get notions of agency in different fields such as in ai where people talk
*  about an intelligent agent and that just means anything that changes its behavior depending on
*  the circumstance basically so it doesn't always do the same thing it's what it does depends on
*  the circumstances will implement stimulus response conditionals if you like if this then do that
*  does a volcano that is about to erupt count as a minimal agent well it might do it might do
*  um yeah i mean and we it's i think it's not accidental that we use the the active voice
*  there we say the the volcano erupted as well we obviously it's true to say there was an eruption
*  of the volcano but we think it's not wrong to say the volcano erupted now how much to hang on
*  linguistic features like that is never clear i mean i think it can only be indicative
*  uh but i do think that there's no reason to think that minimal notion of agency
*  picks out the the biological domain particularly sure okay um and for the maximal notion for the
*  intentional agent clearly this idea of a mental representation of the world is crucially important
*  so let me kind of and this is going to be a hard question again but that's why we're here um
*  there must be levels there uh the the sort of richness and um capacity of our mental
*  representations of the world i mean does the bacterium have a one bit's worth of mental
*  representation of the world there's more nutrients in this direction less nutrients in that direction
*  or is that going a bit too far yeah i don't know i mean i think i think it depends i mean the
*  certainly certainly it has some internal state which one could take to be a representation of
*  well i don't know actually quite how bacterial chemotaxis works i mean okay what i'm saying
*  isn't true but could have been right so might be you could well imagine a simple a simple micro
*  perhaps a bit more complicated in the bacterium that had an internal state which represented the
*  amount of oxygen in the environment and the level of that internal variable dictated what the
*  you know along with other things what the what the microbe does now i think in fact that's not how
*  bacteria i think you're right yeah that's right but it could it could have been um so in that case
*  you might well say that an internal um variable or state of the um of the of the organism represents
*  some worldly circumstance but whether it would be a mental representation is perhaps a bit less
*  clear because you might say well that to have a mental representation you need to have a mind
*  right to start with and so maybe there is sort of independent criteria for what that means
*  um but in short i think i agree with you shaw that it's not a simple question to say exactly
*  what mental representation is and what the the bounds of it are and indeed i should say that
*  in the philosophy of mind and psychology not all authors are happy with this notion of mental
*  representation so in some of his early work daniel denert made the the argument that there wasn't
*  really any fact of the matter about whether some creature has intentional states such as believing
*  that the world is a certain way wanting to achieve a certain thing classic sort of examples of mental
*  representations for denet then the only question is is it heuristically useful to treat it that way
*  and he insisted that it was a fool's errand to think that there was a distinction out there in
*  nature between real intentionality that we humans have and the as if variety right um
*  in that he said in a way he wanted to say look it's all as if right it's this is the idea of
*  the intentional stance that it's really just a question of the heuristic utility of thinking
*  of something this way rather than describing it in terms of its physical makeup directly do we
*  i'm not saying den it was right about that and i think he he backtracked to some extent in his
*  later work and seemed happier with the notion of mental representation taken literally but i i
*  think it was a very profound idea in fact that idea of the intentional stance and that idea that
*  the question is really is this heuristically useful to describe things this way not do they
*  really have this attribute do we know much about the actual evolutionary history of mental
*  representations or other aspects of agency were there big thresholds that we can point to where
*  organisms develop the new capacity to do the kind of thing well i suppose the big probably the big
*  threshold would be the evolution of a nervous system of a rudimentary nervous system of some
*  sort that you know enables the organism to process environmental information or environmental
*  signals in a radically new way and to respond adaptively as a result the person who's thought
*  thought great length about this is the is the philosopher and geneticist ever yablonka in her
*  book the evolution of the sensitive soul who who tries to adopt quite an interesting methodology of
*  trying to find instead of taking the notion of consciousness as primitive she tries to find
*  substantive correlates if you like for for what we ordinarily call consciousness
*  such as unlimited learning potential for example the ability in principle to make associations
*  between any any two things and to act on them to take one thing to be a cue for another thing
*  and then to tell an evolutionary story about how these these came to be but for me then it's um
*  yeah i mean until you've got a nervous system then you're a fundamentally different sort
*  of a creature i guess well computers don't have nervous systems and you've already brought up
*  uh ai a little bit is there some difference in principle between the level of agency in a large
*  language model versus just a really big lookup table or something like that is it is it just a
*  matter of our perception as outsiders or is there something that you can point to inside that really
*  makes a difference yeah no this is a classic a classic question in the philosophy of psychology
*  and artificial intelligence to which i don't know the answer um i mean my my intuitive naive reaction
*  is to say no of course they're not really intelligent they're not really thinking
*  um it's all it's all of the as if variety right all it's doing is machine learning
*  all it's doing is pattern pattern recognition and that's fundamentally different from the real thing
*  but then of course the question is i mean well what is the real thing and is this just a an
*  anthropomorphic illusion that we have i mean surely what what is thinking if not computing a function
*  and surely computers are doing that too have you i mean being the world's experts on what an agent
*  is have you been thinking a lot about ai um well to some extent in that i think that what they're
*  doing the notion of agency that they're operating within in ai that as they call it what they call
*  intelligent agent it seems to me to occupy an intermediate position but in my sort of taxonomy
*  of agent notions between the real the real deal and the minimal thing
*  but i am conscious that you know ai is a huge topic now and it would be a
*  a natural a natural next avenue for me to look into but as yet no is there something that
*  you would you would personally take as necessary before you called something an agent that that
*  people who do ai could propose as a benchmark well um it's a difficult game to play that isn't
*  it because i mean you know famously turing played that game yep and one could argue
*  that he lost i mean yeah so he propounded this turing test and everybody was happy with it
*  but then they made things that passed it and now we're sort of now we want to say well therefore
*  the test must have been wrong right yeah rather than saying that they passed it with flying colors
*  so yeah yeah no i don't know i mean i've always been partially sympathetic to the idea that
*  you know you've really got to move
*  and you've maybe got to have a body of some sort right so it's the famous heideggerian
*  so merle pontian critique of ai that says look you could never you know until you engage with
*  the world through your body then you could you could never really have thought if you like so
*  according to that line of argument it's a it's almost a category mistake to think that
*  you could have a thinking machine unless the machine was you had some sort of sensory capacities
*  of some sort but that seems very easy right how hard is it to put it in a drone or a robot or
*  whatever maybe yeah and if yeah as you as you say if it's just about moving around yeah as you
*  were sensing what could be easier yeah affecting the world or even sensing yeah in a sense yeah
*  no and always one confronts this fundamental question of whether any criterion that anyone
*  puts forward is anything other than just some anthropomorphic that's the worry ideal that
*  while that they that they've they've unwittingly taken on board and are now claiming to be the
*  true hallmark of whatever attribute may in fact be shared yeah that's right i think it's one of
*  those questions that's almost impossible to to really even think about or to conceive isn't it
*  because i mean at some level you know intuitively well you do know that humans obviously were an
*  evolved species so you know all of our all of our cognitive capacities and our neural capacities
*  have antecedents and have evolutionary antecedents and you know homologues of many of them are found
*  in other animals non-human animals but nonetheless we do have this deep sense that there's something
*  you know uniquely human about us too well good i mean we can put away the computers and ai for the
*  for the wrapping up the end of the podcast here but because we still left on the table
*  big human-sized questions about free will and moral responsibility and things like that is
*  let me just ask what might be the easier question does the discussion of what counts as an agent
*  from a philosophical evolutionarily informed perspective help us understand how we should
*  think about responsibility and free will possibly i mean i think the question of free will versus
*  determinism is a really difficult philosophical question and i think interestingly it's one of
*  those questions that doesn't i mean the way the basic formulation of the issue doesn't seem to
*  change much despite all the great advances in neuroscience and you know and and in
*  in comparative cognition and in evolutionary biology that we've made i mean the basic issue is
*  really seems to be a more metaphysical one doesn't it it's just that on the one hand
*  we seem to think that you know quantum stuff aside the world's pretty deterministic
*  and on the other hand we can't understand how if the world's deterministic there could possibly
*  be free will now i mean the puzzle is deepened by the line of argument that says look even if
*  the world were indeterministic that wouldn't help in a way yeah because what i mean that's not that's
*  not our conception of human freedom either just that you know as actions happening randomly with
*  no causal antecedents i mean is that what we really meant by freedom surely not so i mean if
*  one if one finds that that's persuasive then it it must clearly indicate that there's something
*  amiss with our concept of free will i mean if we think that it's incompatible both with determinism
*  and with indeterminism the only way that could be just as a matter of logic is if it's self-contradictory
*  i mean the only you know if any way for proposition p is incompatible with x and incompatible with not
*  x then p cannot be true in any possible world right so p is therefore self-contradiction now
*  this is a familiar and old line of thought in the in the in the philosophical discussion of free
*  will but i do think it's an important one that is sometimes lost sight of in the enthusiasm for the
*  idea that a biological or neuroscientific insights will resolve the issue because for me the the
*  fundamental issue is really to do is to do with what the concept of free will actually amounts to
*  right well and we can say the same thing about these questions of moral responsibility right
*  it does thinking hard about how humans came to evolve over evolutionary time scales nudge you
*  in the direction of not being a moral realist or is it that's completely independent considerations
*  this is a really good question yeah so i mean for me when when when one becomes appraised of
*  evolutionary ideas and takes takes on board the idea of evolution by natural selection then
*  yeah moral realism is one of the first things that go
*  now so moral realism the you know being the idea that there's an objective
*  truth about what the right thing the right course of action is or something like that
*  i mean i've always been persuaded of that idea that's sometimes called evolutionary debunking
*  in the in the philosophy literature which says that evolution debunks
*  our our belief if we had one in in moral realism or in the objectivity of the moral realm
*  um now of course plenty of non-evolutionists were also didn't we had no truck with moral realism
*  famously david hugh well maybe it's no coincidence that david hugh came pretty close to to the idea
*  of evolution by natural selection but didn't quite get there and so hugh of course was was a
*  subjectivist about ethics thought that you know the ethical values were not part of the natural
*  order but were projected onto the natural order by the human mind and i think that's broadly what
*  a view i would endorse too and i do think evolution supports it or at least may not
*  proves it if you like but makes it the most reasonable thing to think um that the contrary
*  opinion that there are you know objective values out there out there in the world would seem to
*  demand that humans are somehow above the natural order and so the the darwinian the demonstration
*  that humans are fundamentally part of the natural order and we basically understand how we came to
*  be here seems to me to to sit uneasily with any belief in moral objectivity or moral realism
*  however as ever in philosophy not everyone agrees and there has recently there has recently been an
*  interesting body of work um is suggesting that no form of moral realism might in fact be compatible
*  with evolutionary biology that maybe there could be objective moral truths which are going to be
*  you know truths about cooperation or something like that
*  um that there's an evolutionary explanation of why they are true if you like so they so we can
*  according to this line of argument naturalize um moral values rather than eliminate them
*  okay last question we let our hair down at the end of the podcast so um given all that we've learned
*  about natural selection and agency and responsibility and things like that
*  what would you expect to find if we discovered life elsewhere do you think it would be more or
*  less similar to humans or would would it be entirely utterly different yeah it's a really
*  difficult question um i mean my my temptation is to again give the philosophers answer it depends
*  on what we mean by life um which in in a way is true i mean i take it that there's no particular
*  reason to think that the biochemistry of life on it on another planet would be relevantly similar to
*  our biochemistry sure so i think that yeah we would not really recognize we would not necessarily
*  recognize the living forms as anything akin to what we're familiar with even even the weirdest
*  you know the sorts of microbes that are as far from sort of direct perception um direct human
*  perception as any as any part of the organic world um so not much like us in terms of intrinsic makeup
*  functionally i think we could expect them you know any life form to be engaged in some form of
*  some metabolism or energy exchange with the environment um i expect one would have to
*  presumably have some form of reproduction unless they're only you know finitely many of them and
*  they just persisted for a bit but then presumably they would die through i mean chance uh misfortune
*  is presumably going to be found on any planet is not a just a phenomenon that we're going to have
*  here so presumably in order to escape that you have to be able to reproduce otherwise the lineage
*  will just die out um so maybe it depends on whether you mean sort of conditionally on us
*  discovering them i mean i think if you mean unconditionally then there's very little we
*  can say about what life on earth would look life on other planets would look like other than that
*  it would have to satisfy whatever condition we think defines life but if you mean that we would
*  that we that we might discover then it would have to be conditional on our having discovered them
*  and that may well make some things much more likely or and other things less likely than they
*  were unconditionally if you see what i mean i do at least they'd have to be perceptible by or
*  discoverable by yeah you know human perception i think it would be at the very least very nice to
*  have more than one data point when it comes to when it comes to an ecosystem on a biosphere
*  that would help us both philosophically and scientifically it certainly would although those
*  statistical arguments are powerful ones aren't they just about yeah you know how many how many
*  possibilities there are for life and just how unlikely it is that we're really alone here in
*  the universe we'll see it's a difficult question but an empirical and ultimately so
