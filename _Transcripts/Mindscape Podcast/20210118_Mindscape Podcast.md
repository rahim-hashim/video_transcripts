Video Description: What is the world made of? How does it behave? These questions, aimed at the most basic level of reality, are the subject of fundamental physics. What counts as fundamental is somewhat contestable, but it includes our best understanding of matter and energy, space and time, and dynamical laws, as well as complex emergent structures and the sweep of the cosmos. Few people are better positioned to talk about fundamental physics than Frank Wilczek, a Nobel Laureate who has made significant contributions to our understanding of the strong interactions, dark matter, black holes, and condensed matter, as well as proposing the existence of time crystals. We talk about what we currently know about fundamental physics, but also the directions in which it is heading, for better and for worse.

Frank Wilczek received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University. He is currently the Herman Feshbach professor of physics at the MIT; Founding Director of the T. D. Lee Institute and Chief Scientist at Wilczek Quantum Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Distinguished Professor at Arizona State University; and Professor at Stockholm University. Among his numerous awards are the MacArthur Fellowship, the Nobel Prize in Physics (2004, for asymptotic freedom), membership in the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is the author of numerous books, most recently Fundamentals: Ten Keys to Reality.

# Mindscape 130 | Frank Wilczek on the Present and Future of Fundamental Physics
**Mindscape Podcast:** [January 18, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zAlEjFU7xo)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll.
*  And as many of you know, I'm a physicist by training and occupation.
*  And the kinds of physics I do, right, cosmology, relativity, gravitation, space-time, particle physics, field theory, all this stuff,
*  sometimes goes under the name fundamental physics.
*  It's a somewhat contentious name because fundamental sounds more important and that's not what it's supposed to mean.
*  At one point in my life, I tried to start a campaign to rename fundamental physics elementary physics,
*  because elementary sounds a little bit less pretentious and it's about the same idea.
*  That's the underlying stuff, right?
*  The most fundamental bottom layer stuff at which everything else is made.
*  Anyway, that never caught on. That never does catch on.
*  Changing names is very hard.
*  Fundamental physics is what we call it.
*  As many of you know, fundamental physics is in a weird phase right now.
*  In some sense, it's a little bit stuck, not completely stuck, but let's say progress is slower than it used to be.
*  In some sense, that's because we were spoiled by the first half of the 20th century,
*  where we invented quantum mechanics and relativity and found the expanding universe.
*  And it was just an amazing change every decade.
*  So maybe now we're in a more natural state of being.
*  But still, we long for the good days when we could revolutionize physics every so often.
*  And right now, our theories are just too good.
*  We have standard models of gravity, of particle physics, of cosmology, and they fit a wide variety of data.
*  Under that kind of circumstance, how do you make progress?
*  How do you move forward?
*  So I can think of no one better to talk to about these kinds of questions than today's guest, Frank Wilczek,
*  who's a professor of physics at MIT, Nobel Prize winner.
*  Back when he was a graduate student, he helped understand quantum chromodynamics and the phenomenon called asymptotic freedom.
*  That's what he won the Nobel Prize for.
*  But since then, he's done many other interesting things on the Higgs boson.
*  He co-invented the particle called the axion, which is still hypothetical, but might be out there.
*  He invented a new kind of particle called any ions, which can exist in two plus one dimensions.
*  He's the pioneer of time crystals, a whole bunch of other things.
*  And Frank has a very specific, very grounded point of view on fundamental physics.
*  He wants to push it forward in interesting ways,
*  but he worries that it's become a little bit separated, disjointed from the data, the experiment, the phenomena on the ground.
*  And that's not because, you know, he's just a crotchety old man getting grumpy about the kids today.
*  He's very willing to think about black hole information, the multiverse, the anthropic principle.
*  But at the end of the day, he wants to account for what we see.
*  And he worries, I think with some good reason, that if you lose sight of that prize,
*  you can sort of wander out in the wilderness without making substantial progress.
*  Easy to say, of course. So how do you make substantial progress?
*  Well, that's a good question. And we'll talk about that, too.
*  So Frank has a new book out called Fundamentals.
*  It's about, you know, it's a very popular book accessible to everyone about all the big ideas in physics.
*  And we talk about in this podcast both what those ideas are and then maybe how we can move beyond them.
*  If we can't just speculate, what is the right way to make progress?
*  Nobody has any easy answers there, but there are some hot takes.
*  There's some saucy opinions given in this podcast. So I think you'll like it. Let's go.
*  Frank Wilczek, welcome to Mindscape Podcast.
*  Good to be here.
*  So, yeah, here in some virtual sense, of course, like I haven't actually seen anyone in person to do a podcast in for many months now.
*  But in our minds, exactly.
*  What is the difference between spatial locality?
*  Speaking of which, you've written a new book called Fundamentals, Ten Keys to Reality.
*  And I thought that would be just a good theme for a podcast interview, because obviously fundamental physics is something we both care a lot about, try to push forward.
*  But it's also something that is in a fun, funny situation right now.
*  And so I thought I would just start with your opinions about the use of the word fundamentals.
*  Like some people don't want to call certain kinds of physics fundamental and not others.
*  How do you conceptualize what that means to say fundamentals?
*  Well, I guess I'm in favor of a broad interpretation, although it varies with context, of course.
*  So but as far as calling things fundamental or not within physics, I think it's fair to call things like the second law of thermodynamics pretty fundamental or emergent phenomena that don't...
*  In principle could be explained from more basic principles.
*  Can if they're sufficiently wide ranging, non obvious, they just I don't begrudge them the label fundamental.
*  But on the other hand, if you say what you mean by fundamental and if by fundamental you mean things that can't be deduced from other things,
*  that's also a legitimate use of the word and sometimes handy.
*  So I, you know, as long as to me, it's not so much the word, but the meaning in context of it.
*  Yeah, and I think you probably have more credibility on this issue than many people, since you've done both fundamental particle physics, but also work in condensed matter physics and more complex systems.
*  Yeah, and and I'm proud of both.
*  And I, I do not have the well, I don't have the prejudice that that things in physics that in principle could have derived or otherwise that could have been derived from more basic principles in principle don't somehow are lesser.
*  Doesn't make them more important, right?
*  No, not at all.
*  And in fact, right now, we have a pretty good account, pretty good understanding of fundamentals that are necessary to explain chemistry, biology, almost all of astrophysics and so on.
*  And I think also a great challenge understanding how mind emerges from matter.
*  And to me, trying to add to those principles is certainly and get them from more basic foundations is a worthwhile enterprise.
*  But I don't think it it is in any sense, more privileged or better than than the great enterprise of getting on with it, so to speak, any more than the study.
*  Take another example, which in geometry, there are attempts to develop new systems of geometry or to to discover new theorems and at the frontiers of well developed subjects like algebraic geometry or algebraic topology and so forth and so on.
*  And I don't think that that kind of activity is any less basic than the examination of whether you could get by with fewer axioms.
*  On the contrary, when a subject becomes mature, then it's not so interesting to look for fewer axioms anymore.
*  The growth point is not that the growth point is the exuberant flourishing of a structure that that's very rich already.
*  There's an obvious question that I haven't quite figured out how to ask, but maybe just answer whatever you feel is best.
*  So for the people out there who are not physicists, what are the fundamental laws of physics?
*  How do you know this is a several hour lecture?
*  I know. But how do you summarize it?
*  Well, you wrote a book about it.
*  I did.
*  And you wrote a t-shirt about it.
*  The fundamental laws of physics, as we understand them today, are pretty well encoded in what's called the standard model or the core, which includes a framework in which you state the laws, which involves relativity and quantum mechanics.
*  And I don't in the case of relativity, I know what the I could state stated axiomatically in quantum mechanics is a little more tricky to say exactly what the axioms are.
*  But OK, we know in practice well enough.
*  And then there are four forces and a small number of forces and a small number of ingredients.
*  And you can write down very compact equations that, as far as we can tell, are an accurate description of all the behavior that is simple enough to study that we can and fully document that we've observed.
*  The interactions among elementary particles or interactions that are simple to analyze in cosmology and astrophysics.
*  And that's it.
*  And so you can write.
*  And I can tell you I could, in principle, write a computer program that has these laws.
*  I could explain it to a computer and that that's the fundamental.
*  Those are the fundamental laws right now.
*  Maybe this is a good jumping off point for what I thought would be much later the conversation.
*  But the fact that we know so much this core theory that I've made T-shirts of you, you're the one who labeled at the core.
*  How do you express this this amazing fact that if you if you care about biology or psychology or something like that, we know the laws of physics.
*  We're not going to discover new particles, new forces that are relevant to biology.
*  That's hard to get across to people who say, well, there's a lot of things we don't know.
*  So how do you know?
*  How do how do I know what?
*  How do I know that those are those laws are good enough?
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  Well, it's hard to you know, can't be absolutely sure.
*  But what what is true is that these laws have been checked, tested as vigorously as people know how in very extreme circumstances.
*  At high energies, at low temperatures, with great sensitivity.
*  And people have high motivations to try to find deviations.
*  There have been Nobel prizes and all kinds of all kinds of glory.
*  But so far, they've stood up to to all these tests.
*  Now, this is all in the framework of the program of I guess you could call reductionism of saying that we if we understand the laws as they act between a few simple objects, then we can build up mathematically.
*  Right.
*  We description of more complicated things.
*  In principle, there could be forces that involve many bodies at once or or outside the framework of quantum mechanics.
*  In principle, it's it's the evidence is empirical that it works.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And and and it seems very it's been tested so exact so precisely.
*  And so under such extreme conditions, such a variety of conditions that it easily encompasses the degree of accuracy and the domain of conditions that one encounters in chemistry by the way.
*  And in biology and most almost all of astrophysics.
*  And in fact, all known astrophysics and yeah, well, you know, so at some point the the burden of proof is on some to to show how it doesn't work.
*  Right.
*  Now, there are plenty of loose ends.
*  There are definitely things we don't know.
*  I'm sure we'll come to discuss those.
*  But but none of them, as far as I can tell, seem likely to affect biology, even psychology.
*  Right.
*  How the mind we or chemistry or astrophysics, geophysics or any any any branch of engineering.
*  It seems unlikely that that significant changes in that in those equations are going going significant enough to change the applications are going to occur.

*  Have you ever played around?
*  I mean, I know I know I haven't.
*  I've sort of failed with trying to modify the standard model or quantum field theory in some way that there be new forces that arise when matter arranges itself in certain complex ways.
*  Like, you know, that sort of try to make a little bit more careful the idea of some kind of strong emergence.
*  Yeah, well, it's sort of been on my agenda for a long time, but it's one of those things I never really get around to.
*  It you know, we work, as you know, in the in the context of effective field theory, and then you can discuss effects that involve many, many bodies at once that that that do not succumb to this program of reduction where you study.
*  You build up from interactions involving just a few bodies and and and and that's sufficient.
*  Now we have a rationalization and understanding of how that could work in terms of the successive interactions among many bodies getting systematically smaller, drastically smaller than the interactions, the fundamental interactions among small numbers of particles.
*  But maybe that breaks down at some level and maybe there are 27 body interactions that that somehow kick in or tend to the 27 body interactions that somehow.
*  Kick in and and the the drastic decrease with number of particles somehow reverses.
*  So that's the most concrete idea I've had along those lines.
*  But if the laws break down, I would be very surprised if that's the way they break down.
*  It's true. It's true. It's hard to imagine being that way.
*  Now, of course, another thing that's more or less plausible and you can play with is interactions that like gravity build up from being very small because they're long range and additive like gravity.
*  They could build up. And I mean, not only have I played with that, I think those are quite plausible ax.
*  Axions give you something like that.
*  But people have, you know, there are constraints on how powerful those effects can be.
*  People have looked for so-called fifth forces and so far come up empty.
*  And so, so again, they are highly constrained and seem unlikely to affect any practical application.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's an amazing fact about the theory as we currently understand it.
*  On the one hand, you know, there's the four forces you mentioned, right?
*  The weak force, strong force, electromagnetism, gravity.
*  On the one hand, it looks like kind of a mess.
*  There's various forces doing various things.
*  There's a difference between right handed and left handed particles.
*  But on the other hand, it's it's quite compact compared to the scope of what it is attempting to explain or account for.
*  I mean, should we should we count the core theory as simple or as complicated?
*  Well, it's both.
*  But I think we understand or have a good guess about how that happened.
*  If you look at the four forces at short distances, it seems that a lot of the complications and the apparent differences between the forces melt away.
*  They come to look very much more like each other.
*  Certainly the three of the four look very much like each other.
*  They're all mediated by photon like particles, gluons, W bosons, and so forth, which which have the same sort of governed by the same sort of principles in remarkable detail.
*  And even the strength of the different interactions comes together if you extrapolate the known laws to high enough to small enough distances.
*  So that's that's on the one hand, a lot of these complications melt away if you go to short distances.
*  On the other hand, we understand that as you go to long distances from simplicity,
*  complications can set in due to what we call symmetry breaking.
*  Roughly speaking, you know this, but but for the audience, condensation condensations occur that can muck up the law,
*  muck up the appearance of the laws.
*  And so from an underlying simplicity, if you view, if you can't get to look at the what's going on at very small distances, it can look much more complicated.
*  And that thought works out remarkably well, certainly in the weak interaction where there's an abundance of evidence for symmetry breaking and the strong interaction where there's an abundance of
*  understanding of confinement and other and symmetry breaking also.
*  And so we we know of mechanisms that we have a lot of evidence for this general picture and the unification of forces that small distances works pretty darn well.
*  So I think it's both simple and complicated and simple fundamentally, so to speak, at short enough distances.
*  But its own internal logic tells you that it could look and in fact it does look more complicated phenomenologically when you view it at long distances.
*  So it's the complexity emerges, I guess is the two-word summary of complexity emerges from simplicity is the four-word summary.
*  And I can imagine that when this is first put together, the standard model in the early 70s, obviously you were a major player here.
*  It was, it must have just been overwhelmingly compelling to say, well, this idea of unifying all the forces and simple structures is so good, let's keep doing it.
*  And we tried to do that with grand unification, but we haven't found the evidence for it yet.
*  I mean, are you, I know that you're a fan of the idea of grand unification.
*  Have you, has your, has your Bayesian prior wavered a little bit?
*  What was, was that my Bayesian?
*  Yeah.
*  Have you, have you decreased your credences a little bit?
*  Well, I think, I think the general art, I think there are very strong general conclusions that, that, that, or circumstantial evidence, pieces of circumstantial evidence that support this view.
*  There's first of all, the primary fact that all the forces are governed by mathematically very similar structures, gauge, gauge theories.
*  And then if you examine in detail the particles that actually exist, they fit together in, into a structure that allows you to imagine that all these theories that are actually, all these apparently different forces at long distances.
*  Actually represent one unified force at small distances where all of them become equal and are on the same footing and are all symmetric with each other.
*  That is not at all automatic.
*  It requires a very strong conspiracies among the different particles that as to their quantum numbers, as to how they behave under these different interactions.
*  If it were different, then you couldn't put them together.
*  So that's circumstantial evidence.
*  The other circumstantial evidence is that if apparently the couple, as we see them, the coupling strengths are very different.
*  But if you extrapolate to short distances or high energies, again, to get to the basics, stripping away complications, they appear to become numerically equal to pretty good accurate.
*  So that's two.
*  And then another aspect of that is that at the scale at which they come together, where things, you know, sort of where the veil is lifted and you should see the ultimate simplicity, you find that gravity also, which appears to be very, very different in strength, is approximately the same.
*  So I think we have strong encouragement from nature to think along these lines.
*  One last piece of evidence is more complicated to explain, which is that neutrinos have been discovered, been found to have small but non zero masses.
*  So much sort of anomalously small compared to all other masses that are not zero.
*  And that can be understood in terms of these unified theories where tiny effects that come from short distances trickle down to give neutrino masses.
*  But would otherwise appear very mysterious.
*  So to make the boiled all that down into a couple of sentences, there are many aspects of our scattered theories within the core that appear to be anomalous or lopsided or somehow unsatisfactory that become much more ideal, much more in the platonic sense, much more beautiful.
*  In this larger framework.
*  Now, there's one piece of evidence, one piece that's missing here that's really tantalizing, which is the besides the small neutrino masses, kind of the other new prediction that's not just aesthetic and not just numerical.
*  I don't know why we say just numerical.
*  That's pretty good.
*  The unification.
*  The is is but a spectacular new phenomenon that's promised by these unified theories is the decay of protons or violation of baryon number, we say.
*  And people have looked very hard for that.
*  And so far, they haven't found it.
*  And our only answer is, well, maybe you haven't looked hard enough.
*  So and the limits are not powerful enough to really decisively rule out the picture.
*  But but it certainly would be better to have positive evidence on that front.
*  And that would that would really, to me, lock it up.
*  So there's one missing piece that that we need to define.
*  I know a lot of people who think along these lines are also fans of supersymmetry as an extra ingredient that we haven't seen evidence for.
*  And I think that probably the people out there listening, they might not quite understand the distinction between superstring theory and supersymmetry and things like that.
*  So what is your attitude towards the current state of that idea?
*  OK, well, supersymmetry makes this unification of couplings work better quantitatively.
*  So that's that's I was hoping that we would see supersymmetry at the LHC.
*  Maybe explain to us what it is.
*  Because what's that?
*  Maybe explain what it is, what supersymmetry is for the people.
*  So supersymmetry is an extension of the idea of well, you can phrase it in various ways.
*  But maybe the nicest way to phrase it is it's an extension of the idea of space time to include not only the ordinary kind of dimensions of space and time that we're familiar with,
*  that are based on numbers that satisfy X times Y equals Y times X, but into what are called quantum dimensions that are that are governed by numbers that satisfy X times Y equals minus Y times X.
*  Now, this sounds very mystical.
*  That level it is.
*  But it turns out that if you want to unite two big classes of two kingdoms of particles that people know about so-called fermions and bosons,
*  or more generally, if you want to consider making symmetries that relate particles of different spin, you have to go beyond the framework of ordinary space and time.
*  And it turns out that it's very difficult to do that in a mathematically consistent way.
*  But using these quantum dimensions is one way you can do it.
*  So you have motions in space and time and boosts in space and time, special relativity that relates space and time, and the natural extension of that.
*  And really, the only one that's that's known how to do it is to add these quantum dimensions.
*  And then if you if you do that, though, you need to account for what happens to particles when they move into these quantum dimensions.
*  And they don't change where they are because they're in the sense of space and time, because those are the ordinary dimensions.
*  If you move into the quantum directions, what happens is you change into a different kind of particle that has a different spin, a different character.
*  So if it's a force or boson particle, it turns into a substance or fermion particle and vice versa and a different mass.
*  But many of the same properties, many of the same electric charge, the same color charges, the same kind of behavior under weak interactions,
*  all the standard, all the basic interactions of the standard model are common between these particles.
*  So these are called superpartners, and they are the price you have to pay if you want to have supersymmetry.
*  Because no particles with the requisite properties have been observed.
*  No particle that we have actually observed has a candidate superpartner that it could that it could be is a candidate for what happens to it when it moves in super space.
*  Nevertheless, it's just as we think about higher symmetries that are obscured by condensates, as we talked in talked about in our earlier discussion here, too.
*  You apply the same idea that the underlying supersymmetry at short distances is hidden from us by spontaneous breaking of the symmetry so that the basic laws would have this feature.
*  But they're obscured from from view.
*  And then it becomes a question of how obscured, how heavy are these particles?
*  And again, because detailed considerations indicate that if we want to preserve this wonderful improvement in how the couplings unify, they the new particles shouldn't be too heavy.
*  And some of us were optimistic.
*  Some of us were not me.
*  Some of us were super optimistic that that that they would be light enough to be observed at the at the Large Hadron Collider.
*  That is still not completely ruled out, but certainly the most straightforward searches have not found evidence for any of these particles.
*  Now, the data is very complicated and difficult to analyze, so it may be that it's somehow hiding in the data.
*  But more likely, in my view, is either that supersymmetry.
*  It's just the whole idea. The whole line of thought is somehow flawed or the particles are much or the particles are just a little too heavy to to have been observed at the LHC, unfortunately.
*  And it would take a bigger and better collider to start producing them.
*  Yeah, I mean, maybe you can opine on this, but the way that I like to say it is we could in the space of all possible worlds that we live in, only one of them, we could have found supersymmetry already at the LHC very easily.
*  But the fact that we haven't doesn't mean it's not there.
*  It's maybe it's less likely that it's there, but it's easy also to imagine theories where supersymmetry is real and we just haven't seen it yet.
*  Right. So supersymmetry, as I said, there have to be for supersymmetry to be valid.
*  There have to be these super partner particles that are the particles that the particles we know about turn into when they move into the quantum dimensions.
*  But we don't know what their masses are.
*  We know some of their properties, but not their masses.
*  And they could be very heavy.
*  If they're very, very heavy, we lose the benefit of improving the benefit that supersymmetry would otherwise give in improving how the couplings unify.
*  But OK, that may be that's maybe that was a cruel joke on the part of nature.
*  I want to think not, but the alternative is that they're just a little bit too heavy to have been produced easily and identified easily at the LHC.
*  And we just have to work a little bit harder and spend a little more money.
*  A little more.
*  On the scale of national debt to make bigger and better accelerators and do bigger and better searches.
*  I should say another another aspect of this is that many implementations of supersymmetry produce a candidate for the dark matter,
*  usually called the neutralino, and that people have searched also very hard for that and have not found it.
*  So that's also somewhat discouraging, although that's that's even more indirect, I would say,
*  because there are cosmological considerations that come in and the abundance might just be smaller than is necessary to produce the dark matter or the particles might not be stable.
*  After all, on cosmological scales, there are many outs for that.
*  But nevertheless, I mean, it was a it was something that might have been observed and hasn't.
*  So, yep, there it is.
*  And maybe it's also worth mentioning something that I think focuses the attention of a lot of particle theorists in this era,
*  which is the hierarchy problem, the mismatch, apparently, between the energy scale of the weak interactions and the Higgs boson versus the energy scales of grand unification and gravity.
*  I think that for a lot of us, definitely for me, even without a specific solution to that problem in mind,
*  that was a big motivation for thinking that when the LHC turned on, we'd see a bunch of new particles one way or the other.
*  Well, I did not really share that intuition.
*  If to me, the likely alternatives were either supersymmetry showed up or something close to minimal,
*  which has turned out to be very close to minimal implementation with just a Higgs particle and nothing else.
*  But we'll see. I still would be hopeful that at somewhat higher energies, supersymmetry would come roaring in and lots of stuff.
*  But, well, I don't know how much you want to enter into the technicalities, probably not very much.
*  But probably not very much.
*  The smallness of radiative corrections of various kinds, especially CP violation,
*  indicated that a pretty close to minimal structure or else a highly symmetric structure were the only consistent possibilities.
*  Right. Phenomenologically.

*  And then we have the Planck scale or the grand unification scale way, way bigger than that.
*  And to many of us, this is a mystery.
*  But other people think, well, you know, it's just a number. We measured it.
*  It's not a mystery at all. So is this a motivating feature of the data for you?
*  Yeah, it's well, it's it's a motivation, but it's a very broad motivation.
*  And to me, it's kind of been superseded by this unification of couplings,
*  which is much more quantitative and sort of a much more positive clue.
*  So, you know, the hierarchy problem, I think they go together.
*  But to me, the unification of couplings is stronger. Right.
*  As a guiding principle. So do you take then the unification of couplings?
*  I think you answered this, but just to make sure that I didn't misunderstand.
*  Do you take that as good motivation for thinking that if we do keep pressing on to higher energies,
*  either at the Large Hadron Collider, at a new accelerator, we still have good reason to believe we'll find some new particles?
*  Yes. Yeah, I still I'm a supersymmetry diehard.
*  I think, yeah, so I would be full of hope, of course.
*  It's easy for me to spend other people's money, but I would be pretty hopeful about that.
*  Well, in a similar vein, I'm hopeful about pressing proton decay experiments harder,
*  because the existing constraints are just kind of at the edge of compatibility with unification ideas.
*  And a little harder pressing might might get us there.
*  So so if I were a young experimentalist, neither of which is true, but I would not be discouraged.
*  I think there are. And if I wanted to make an impact in fundamental physics,
*  I don't I think it's not out of the question that there be breakthroughs on either of those fronts.
*  And either of them would be very rich. Right.
*  If proton decay is discovered, there would be many, many follow up studies of how it decays,
*  what it decays into, is it CP violating, blah, blah, blah.
*  And then and similarly, certainly, if supersymmetry is found that be zillions of new particles and phenomena to study,
*  we get be able to get a much more detailed picture of how unification works.
*  It's very mysterious exactly how supersymmetry gets spontaneously broken.
*  So that would be a real goldmine of of information and also really would would bring the prospects of making contact between making detailed contact between quantum mechanics and gravity much closer.
*  Yeah, that's certainly true. And but there does seem to be the possibility,
*  just to play devil's advocate here as a as a middle aged theoretical physicist, that we don't find anything right.
*  I mean, that we don't find dark matter directly, that we don't find new particles at the LHC.
*  And then what what in your mind is the best strategy for moving forward if that's what happened?
*  Well, we've we've had kind of a several decade experiment along along these lines.
*  And well, there are several possible reactions.
*  One is to try to push aesthetic considerations of how sort of sort of how an ultimately unified theory might should look.
*  And this leads us into super string theory is probably the most ambitious and accomplished of those attempts.
*  So that's one one attitude.
*  Another attitude is to try to help the experimentalists make new kinds of experiments that will give further guidance to sort out LHC's signals better or just or astrophysical consequences of unified theories.
*  We did better experiments to look for axions and dark matter.
*  There are there are a whole variety of different experimental quasi phenomenological approaches to improving the fundamental laws.
*  And then there's another alternative, which says, no, do something else.
*  No one no one puts a gun to your head and says you have to work on quantum gravity or you you have to try to improve the core theory.
*  There are great problems having to do with applications of the physics we've understood, which maybe sounds less glamorous, but is every bit as glamorous and rewarding and fundamental and in the good sense.
*  And or, you know, there are problems like understanding how a mind emerges from matter.
*  There are many, many other things you can do that are entertaining and useful to mankind and rewarding.
*  So if fundamental physics seems too arid to you or then do something else.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  You know, my own idiosyncratic minority view is that we there's still a lot to be learned by thinking about the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  I think that we have not really mastered that yet, which is a bit of an embarrassment.
*  Yes. And well, and that that has become to me a a much more attractive thing to do now,
*  because the technology of looking at the really basic processes of quantum mechanics where you probe consequences of entanglement and superposition and and of course now the prospect of quantum information processing has made these formally
*  kind of academic questions that were divorced from experiment all and technological practice.
*  Now they are at the forefront of experimental and technological exploration.
*  And and the questions get posed in really new ways that to me are much richer than than philosophical discussions of the measurement problem or what you know, which is not.
*  I always used to warn students away from and still do.
*  I warn them toward it.
*  But but but in this in this new form of, you know, real real real questions that arise in in practice and real opportunities, I think the same sort of questions arise much more fruit.
*  I guess an operational way of putting it is given that we haven't yet seen new particles at the Large Hadron Collider, we haven't yet seen dark matter.
*  How much of our effort should be in sort of taking a step back and saying, well, maybe it's just quantum field theory is not the right paradigm to think about things for moving forward or something even deeper?
*  Well, that could be. But but how should I say?
*  Saying maybe this is all wrong.
*  So it's not doesn't tell you what to do when you wake up in the morning.
*  And we discussed previously that the tremendous success of our core theories.
*  And so if something else is going on at a deeper level, it has the first job has to be to explain why the framework of quantum field theory looks so good.
*  And well, OK, maybe that can be done.
*  But but but yeah, that I mean, that's what you have to that's what you're up again.
*  And what I thought you were going to say is that if you don't if you're not optimistic about finding new elementary particles or new phenomena in that accelerators to think about
*  other worlds that that can be realized in the laboratory, to me, what it's kind of a realization that that an epiphany that I had sort of subconsciously for many years.
*  But that just came to me when I was thinking sort of philosophically in connection with the book and which is that every material defines a world in itself.
*  You know, you can imagine yourself living inside that material.
*  And nowadays, with strong AI, there are even ideas about how in certain kinds of materials, intelligences could live and the laws would look quite different and the particles would be quite different.
*  And that, to me, gives a whole new dimension to the idea of the issues of what's fundamental and what are fundamental particles and so forth.
*  So I was really ecstatic in the last few months in the midst of the covid and all a tremendous bright spot has been finally the observation of any arms, the clear observation of things that are not bosons and not fermions that we've been playing with for almost 40 years now.
*  And now there's beautiful experiments that show the behavior.
*  And that's also that happened because a lot more attention has been focused on these things because of their potential use in quantum technology.
*  So that's to me a beautiful example of how physics grows and the questions that are its most fruitful focus change over time.
*  I mean, this is I think something that will be worth we should do this a little bit more justice because it's a different way of thinking that I think a lot of people aren't familiar with.
*  Like everyone knows you can go look for new particles that you haven't found.
*  Everyone knows these days that there could be other universes out there cosmologically very, very far away.
*  But but this idea that you can make a material and essentially conjure into existence effectively new laws of physics in that material.
*  Explain that a little bit more because people are less familiar with that.
*  Yeah, well, I like to talk about quasi worlds.
*  There's a there's a concept that's that's come to dominate our understanding of matter at the quantum level called quasi particles.
*  And what quasi particles are are concentrations of energy that behave like particles inside but inside materials.
*  And they can have quite different properties from the particles outside of materials.
*  I mean, for instance, one example that's changed the world is inside semiconductors,
*  the particles that carry positive charge, which are called holes usually can have quite a small mass, much smaller than the mass of the proton,
*  more comparable to the mass of the electron and or even smaller.
*  And this makes it possible to manipulate charge, create charge and and use it in ways that are practical and very versatile.
*  And this is what led to the discovery of the transistor.
*  Similarly, and the properties of superconductors, we can understand as photons getting a mass inside the superconductor.
*  So the particles, the behavior of particles inside matter can be quite different from outside matter.
*  You can also have qualitatively different emergent kind of phenomena.
*  So quasi particles are a very popular concept.
*  But even if you if you take away the particles and think about what they're embedded in, that's a quasi world.
*  It's a it's a world with its own particles, its own laws of physics.
*  And each one of them deserves to be given its respect.
*  Right. And and that to me has been an epiphany, as I said, and and really a wonderful stimulus to imagination.
*  What would it be like to live in these worlds? What what could you do to what?
*  What sort of questions would you ask? How strange would the world we ordinarily experience an empty space look?
*  So, yeah, so that that that's another example of of Chazer evolving the meaning of what it means to be fundamental,
*  what it means to understand things and just to to have fun and use your imagination.
*  And just to be clear, these are not purely imaginative.
*  These are things that are technologically explorable.
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. And and and by imagining worlds that have wonderful properties, wonderful possibilities,
*  you can then help, you know, help experimentalists to do new things, explore these possibilities.
*  So, yeah, it's it's it's how should I say if if you're frustrated with high energy accelerators,
*  if you're willing to go to a quasi world and the energies don't have to be so high
*  and you can have experiments which take on the unfavorable cases on the time scale of days rather than
*  years or decades, sometimes, as I said, with any answers did take decades.
*  But but at least it's happened. And yeah, so and and it also I just to complete the circle on this,
*  it raises also a question, which is whether our world should be considered as a quasi world.
*  So you're going to go there.
*  Yeah. So so that as we discussed, the laws that we actually observe are very much conditioned
*  by condensates and spontaneous symmetry breaking.
*  We know that often in physics, when symmetries break, they can break in different ways.
*  And also that materials, for instance, that define worlds can also be layers within materials that
*  within different materials or or be riddled with impurities or.
*  So it raises questions about whether our world can be fruitfully considered as
*  a representative of a much wider class or something that's embedded in a larger scheme.
*  And even the question of whether of what kinds of defects there might be
*  that would reveal that kind of possibility. So
*  I love this idea of extending quasi particles to quasi worlds.
*  Yeah, I mean, to me, they're both it's not it's not even speculative. I mean, it's it's
*  it's worse. I should say it's not purely speculative.
*  It has many contacts with reality with real experiments and with technology and not exotic
*  technology. The understanding of quasi particles was absolutely basic to microelectronics and the
*  kind of thing that makes it possible for you and me to be speaking right now in very different
*  locations and recording it and sharing it eventually with many other people.
*  That all comes from basic quantum mechanics and understanding quasi particles and semiconductors.

*  I've done recent podcasts both with Nick Bostrom, who is famous for the simulation argument,
*  and with your MIT colleague, Max Tegmark, who thinks that all possible universes exist. I mean,
*  is it even in your mind worth thinking about this question of, like, is our universe part of some
*  way bigger structure? Oh, it's worth thinking about. Yeah, but it doesn't take much thought
*  to discredit it. In my opinion, the the laws that we observe just don't look like a competently
*  programmed simulation. In what sense? Well, they, I guess, most profoundly, they have a lot of hidden
*  complexity. Yeah. So when you dig deeper, you find that there's hidden structure that's not used for
*  anything. Why would you do that if you're simulating a world? Also, the laws are very
*  constrained. They're local, they don't change in time, they don't change in place. In a programmed
*  environment, there's no reason to obey any of those constraints. And you know, people who build
*  computer games typically trash them all. So why? Yeah, so it just doesn't look that way. And then
*  there's the embarrassing question of, okay, if this is a simulated world, what is the thing in
*  which it's simulated made out of? What are the laws for that? Yeah. So it begs the question. And
*  then when you think about it, put off that question, which is, but if you even think about it
*  coherently, it just doesn't seem at all likely. Now, a very different question is whether it's
*  logically possible. And I do think it's logically possible. And I think it may even be the future.
*  I think I like to say that natural intelligence is a special case of artificial intelligence,
*  because I think we understand the laws well enough to say that we can make sufficiently
*  complicated structures that can carry out intelligent operations. I mean, we make computers
*  that do fantastically difficult things and play chess better than I can or anyone can, and so forth.
*  So there's every reason to think that intelligence can be embodied materially. And furthermore, that
*  within our brains, people have studied how the nervous system works in great detail, how signals
*  are transmitted, and never had to get beyond the framework of the laws of physics that we know.
*  On the contrary, there are very many non-trivial applications of the laws of physics
*  into designing instruments that probe the brain and also to making models of what's going on
*  inside the brain. Now, our understanding is far from complete, but so far, there's been no need,
*  despite tremendous amounts of research, some of it very delicate, to change the laws of physics.
*  So for instance, to think if there was a power of mind that was separate from the laws of physics,
*  you would expect that we'd have to somehow shield delicate experiments from that power of mind,
*  but that's never been true. You have to shield from vibration and temperature variation and
*  all kinds of things, but never worry about what the guy in the next office is thinking.
*  And that hasn't been necessary. It might have been necessary, but in fact, it's not.
*  So there's every reason to think, every reason to believe, even if it's not fully established,
*  that mind as we know it emerges from matter and that we know the laws of matters efficiently well
*  to stimulate them on a computer so that we should be able to, in principle,
*  simulate the operation of the mind of a brain on a computer. So in that sense, I think it's hard
*  to avoid the conclusion, if you think hard about it, that natural intelligence is a special case
*  of artificial intelligence, and that means that you could imagine producing human-level
*  or better intelligence within a computer of some kind. It's a quantitative question how
*  fast and big the computer has to be. Maybe it has to be a quantum computer,
*  but in principle it is. And then you could imagine intelligences that live in a simulated
*  universe so that they are not experiencing the external world as we know it, but just a stream
*  of data that's inside this machine. So I think it's logically possible, but I don't think that I
*  don't think that I work that way, and I don't think our world works that way, because the
*  way our world works doesn't conform to any kind of reasonable programming practice.
*  It's too constrained and too wasteful of resources on hidden complexity.
*  HOFFMAN I think I'm on your side as far as our world is concerned, but the argument for the
*  simulation argument at least bears a family resemblance to arguments that are used in
*  cosmology with the multiverse and the anthropic principle and so forth. And if I'm remembering
*  correctly, you are sympathetic to that kind of reasoning, whereas I know that some of our
*  colleagues think that you're just giving up on science entirely if you invoke a cosmological
*  multiverse. KUHN Oh, no, I think it's not only a logical possibility, but in some form it's true.
*  I don't want to get into the technical details, but if you believe in axions, which I do,
*  and you believe in inflation, which I do, and if you believe that inflation occurred after
*  the Peche-Quinn transition, then different parts of the post-inflationary universe,
*  or what we would call a multiverse, have vastly different amounts of dark matter in the form of
*  axions, and so they have significantly different physical behavior. So you can construct very
*  concrete models that are models that we use for good reasons in other contexts that do embody a
*  multiverse. And so I better not have a prejudice against it because I work with those models all
*  the time. So they're logically possible and I think very natural. They are, however, sort of,
*  let me say, epistemologically dangerous because they encourage giving up.
*  KUHN Theoretical physics, and especially fundamental physics, can be very difficult. You ask,
*  because we know so much, as we discussed earlier, it's very hard to make improvements. And we look
*  for aesthetic flaws, we look for loose ends, of which there are plenty, but it's been very
*  difficult to make improvements. And one way to get off the hook, so to speak,
*  and say, well, why aren't you improving the laws of physics? Is to say, well, it's not because
*  I lack cleverness, it's because it's impossible. It's because different laws of physics are
*  realized in different places, and it's just an accident which ones we happen to observe here.
*  Okay, so maybe that's right, but it's too easy. It's much too easy. And
*  yeah, so that's the epistemological danger, I would say. Now, of course, if there is a
*  multiverse with enough loose ends, so to speak, so the laws do change drastically, not just in the
*  amount of dark matter, but in many ways, from place to place, then in fact, it's going to be
*  impossible to improve the standard model or the core to the bitter end, so to speak, because some
*  of it will be accidental. But I think it's way premature to give up on that, way premature,
*  and it's too easy. It lets people off the hook. So yeah. Well, it brings us to this fact that many-
*  It's not my fault that I can't do better. It's God's fault. I don't like that.
*  Well, some of this worry has come out of string theory, right? Many of our colleagues for the
*  last several decades have pointed to string theory as the most promising way forward.
*  As far as I know, you have not done a lot of work directly on unconventional string theory. What is
*  your feeling about that approach to moving beyond quantum field theory? Well, I think it has
*  produced a lot of attractive work that's intellectually rich and has spun off into
*  fertile mathematics, but I don't see that it's been converging towards informative assertions
*  about the physical world. That's very eloquently stated, actually. Yes.
*  You can check. For me personally, I've kind of voted with my feet. I think there are more
*  promising things to think about. That's partially a sociological statement. I think string theory is
*  getting plenty of attention. It doesn't need me. So I'm happier doing things that other people
*  aren't doing. But that's a personal statement. So far, I haven't regretted my choice.
*  But I watch the subject and I watch what people are doing and I wish them good luck. If and when
*  things that I think are promising insights into the physical world emerge, I will pay a lot of
*  attention. Do you think that the rest of the field has voted with their feet in a slightly
*  too uniform way? Do you think that too much of our intellectual effort is going in that particular
*  direction? I do, but I might be wrong. So I don't want to discourage. Plenty of people are doing
*  other things. So it's not as if the rest of the world is feeling the lack of input from people
*  who are working on string theory. It's fine. People can work on string theory. It doesn't hurt
*  anything. I don't want to be patronizing. The people who do it are mostly adults and they know
*  what they're doing. But students and people who are thinking about what they're going to do
*  should go into it with open eyes. They should realize that the prospect of making an impact
*  in our understanding of empirical science or technology is probably not optimized by
*  going into string theory. I think that we're in exact alignment here. I feel a need to defend
*  the string theory against unfair criticisms, but I do worry a little bit about the fact that
*  it seems hard these days to connect it directly to empirical reality.
*  Some nice ideas are coming out as spin-offs. Very clever people do string theory and they
*  do clever things. As I said, there's been a lot of fruitful mathematics. There have been
*  new techniques that have proved somewhat useful in condensed matter, although it's certainly not
*  proportional to the amount of effort that's going into it. The future may look different.
*  There may be real breakthroughs that come out of string theory that wouldn't have come otherwise.
*  But so far, other people may disagree and I might be very unpopular among some of my colleagues for
*  saying this, but I think the output compared to the input has been pretty disappointing
*  on the empirical side. You have been involved in productive ways on the black hole information
*  problem, which a lot of string theorists care about. What is your feeling these days? I just
*  did a wonderful podcast with Neda Engelhardt, another of your MIT colleagues. What is your
*  current feeling on the state of that problem? Do you think we're making real progress?
*  I think progress is being made in the sense that more intellectually coherent pictures are being
*  drawn and some surprising connections to error correction and really interesting new
*  chapters of quantum theory are emerging. On the other hand, it is a very esoteric problem.
*  I don't see a way, but who knows? Nobody has produced an experimental system to which these
*  ideas apply in any reasonably direct way. What does it mean to solve a problem like that? I'm
*  not even sure what it means. You can't check. Many hypotheses go into it. The distance between
*  the models and actual black holes or phenomena you can observe are vast and many things could
*  go wrong along the way in making these models. It's wonderful that people are making progress,
*  feel they're making progress, and have a literature that they enjoy. It really is interesting from
*  any point of view. It's good. Maybe I should leave it at that. I don't think it's the pinnacle of
*  physics. Let me put it that way. That's a perfectly good attitude in the sense that, like you say,
*  we have this enormously successful set of ideas in the core theory, etc. Unlike the 1960s,
*  where there were these big puzzles given to us by the data, it's harder to figure out
*  where to best put our intellectual efforts. It's hard to judge what the good work is.
*  Is it just what the smart people say? No one is predicting a new experimental result at the moment.
*  I did. In materials, sure. That's the point. Of course, that was a long time ago. Other things
*  happen, time crystals. People vote with their feet. For instance, I'm spending a lot of time now
*  working with experimentalists and even engineers to design better axion detectors. That's an
*  activity that calls on very different kinds of expertise. It's really fun. The chance that we'll
*  succeed, of course, is not enormous, but it's not zero either. That's one reaction, is to try to
*  devise new kinds of experiments, to think about other worlds in the sense that we talked about
*  before. There are many creative things you can be doing. I think it's wonderful that people do
*  different things. Let me make a terrible confession here because you've done so many
*  interesting things that I completely forgot about the time crystals. Why don't you tell us a little
*  bit about time crystals, what they are and what the state of the art is there?
*  Yeah, well, I guess the best non-technical way to describe it is to say that, well, maybe I should
*  stop back a little. What is a crystal? A crystal is an arrangement of atoms in a regular system,
*  from the point of view of basic description, fundamental physics, if you like, is an arrangement
*  of atoms in a definite pattern in space that is not fully translation invariant in the sense that
*  if you move it a little bit, it's not quite the same thing, but if you move it by a finite amount,
*  it becomes the same thing if you translate it. So the one atom goes into the next atom.
*  And we're accustomed in physics to making analogies between space and time these days. I mean,
*  they just reuse any of the same concepts for both. They're continuous dimensions. So it's natural
*  to ask, and I raised this question in a serious way in 2012, whether you can have materials that
*  are like crystals but in time. So this, of course, wouldn't be atoms that come to exist and pass away,
*  but it could be some kind of phenomena, some kind of marker that
*  spontaneously arises within a physical system that has less than full-time symmetry. And so
*  it's something that doesn't settle down in a normal way into a boring equilibrium,
*  but somehow in its preferred ground state, or maybe you have to generalize the definition
*  of ground state slightly into something that has non-trivial behavior in time. And this was very
*  controversial when I first proposed it, but now some beautiful experiments have discovered this
*  phenomena in a very convincing way, and it's become a thriving field. And another way to phrase it
*  that's more colloquial is to say that these are materials that spontaneously form clocks.
*  They're sort of, it's like the blind watchmaker, but you find these clocks flying around
*  under the right circumstance. If you're finding the right material at the right, at low temperatures
*  and this and that, and maybe you have to sculpt it a little, that it forms a clock with very little
*  prodding. And so that's basically what a time crystal is. There are many variants, but that's
*  the basic idea and the basic hope for the field, I think. There are many hopes because it's a whole
*  new kind of states of matter. But to me, one very tangible possibility that would be extremely
*  important is if these kinds of ideas about things that form clocks spontaneously would let us build
*  better clocks. Forming accurate clocks is a frontier of physics. As you probably know,
*  people are working very hard and constantly trying to push the accuracy of clocks because
*  they're very useful. It may seem absurd, for instance, to try to get clocks that would lose
*  one second over the whole lifetime of the universe, but that's the frontier right now.
*  And it's very valuable to have those things because it allows you to look for very small effects,
*  like the effect of passing gravitational waves for scientific purposes. So if a clock slows
*  down a little bit due to a passing disturbance in the gravitational field, you can hope to sense it.
*  But another use is in GPS-like systems because small errors in measurements of time translate
*  into much larger errors in estimates of distance just because the speed of light is so big.
*  That's why getting accurate, cheap clocks is a frontier of physics that's very, very important.
*  I'm hoping that thinking about time crystals and maybe some kind of hybrid between a time
*  crystal and atomic clocks would allow us to push the frontier of accurate timekeeping further.
*  This has been great. I think you've been giving us a lot of inspiration and evidence for the idea
*  that fundamental physics is in an exciting phase. There's a lot of good questions
*  that we're struggling with and we're going to learn a lot in the years to come.
*  Yeah, including what fundamental means. To me, and time crystals was a good example of this,
*  the meaning of words evolves and sometimes the most fruitful meaning of a word emerges from its
*  use. We find out what the energy was like that. I think as physics advances and we
*  conquer more and more new frontiers of knowledge, what we regard as fundamental advances and
*  fundamental questions will also evolve and it's a never-ending frontier, as far as I can tell.
*  Yeah, that's what makes it fun to me. Frank Wojcik, thanks so much for being on the Mindscape
*  Podcast. Okay, thank you very much, Sean. It was fun.
