Time! It doesn’t stop, psychological effects of being under lockdown notwithstanding. How we experience time depends on our situation, but time itself just marches forward. Unless, of course, it’s possible to travel to the past, as countless science-fiction scenarios have depicted. But does that really make sense? Couldn’t we then change the past, even so dramatically that our own existence would never have happened? In this solo podcast I talk about both the physics and fiction of time travel. I point out that it might be allowed by the laws of physics, and explain how that would work, but that we really don’t know. And I try to make sense of some of the less-sensible depictions of cinematic time travel. Coming up with a logical theory that could account for Back to the Future isn’t easy, but podcasting isn’t for the squeamish.

But wait, there’s more! I was contacted by Janna Levin, who we fondly remember from Episode 27. Janna moonlights as Chair and Director of Sciences at Pioneer Works, an institution dedicated to bringing together creative people in art and science. Like the rest of us, they’ve been looking for ways to offer more online content in these pandemic times, so we thought about ways to collaborate. Here’s what they came up with: artist Azikiwe Mohammed has created an animated video backdrop to this podcast episode. The visuals are trippy, colorful, and inspired by (without trying to directly illustrate) what I talk about in the episode. You can check it out at the links above. (This video is just a teaser trailer for the full experience.)

# Mindscape 124 | Solo: How Time Travel Could and Should Work -- TRAILER
**Mindscape Podcast:** [November 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7wUgahDswA)
*  Hello everyone, quick note here to let you know that this that you're looking at listening to
*  right now is not the traditional full-length Mindscape podcast episode. That exists. You can
*  either listen to it in a regular podcast browser or even better, you can see a different video for
*  it. See the link right below to click on it right away. The point being that our old friend Jana
*  Levin, who was on the podcast earlier, Jana in addition to being a physics professor is also
*  science curator at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, which is an organization that brings together
*  not only scientists but also artists and a whole bunch of creative people to do fun things.
*  We thought that for this solo episode of Mindscape we could team up Pioneer Works and Mindscape and
*  do an actual video. Artist Ezekueh Mohammed has made a little video background for you to look at
*  while you're listening to this episode that I did, which is a solo episode on the subject of
*  time travel. So this is not that whole thing. This is just a teaser trailer if you like. You
*  can find the whole video below. So listen to this teaser. If you like what you hear, click over to
*  the entire video. Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll.
*  I wanted to tell you, those of you who have not already heard it, a little anecdote about one of
*  the ways in which in a very tiny manner I have influenced popular culture myself. You may have
*  heard of the movie Avengers Endgame. You probably have heard of it. It's the highest-grossing movie
*  of all time. And in that movie, a prominent role is played by the idea of time travel.
*  So I'm not going to give away any spoilers for the movie, but there was a previous movie,
*  Infinity War, in which bad things happened and the heroes in Endgame want to fix those bad things by
*  going to the past. So when you want to have time travel in your movie, you have to make some
*  choices about how it works. We haven't seen time travel in the real world, so there's different
*  theories of how it could possibly happen. And at one point, Paul Rudd, who's the actor playing Scott
*  Lang, aka Ant-Man, he and everyone else are talking about the ideas of time travel. And
*  Paul Rudd says, so you're telling me that Back to the Future is just bullshit? And I was actually
*  serving as a science advisor for Endgame. Many people did. I was not the only one, but I remember
*  I was in a room with the writers, the directors, the producers, and we were talking about the idea
*  of time travel, time being one of my areas of expertise, purportedly, as a physicist. And I
*  explained why I had bad feelings about Back to the Future, why I thought it was illogical, and so
*  forth. And so one of the people in the room said, you're telling me Back to the Future is just
*  bullshit. And I agreed. And so that line appeared in the movie. I think I helped that line come into
*  existence in a very tiny way. And I think for the most part, Endgame did a good job at time travel.
*  It was a little bit hazy on this idea of whether or not you can affect the past by going into it,
*  but it was much more respectable and logical than something like Back to the Future would be. But
*  it always bothered me a little bit, that line, because I have an attitude, a philosophy of how
*  you should approach being a science advisor on movies. It's easy to get a bad reputation in
*  Hollywood as a scientist if all you do is hear what they want to do in the movie and say, no,
*  you can't do that. There are plenty of scientists who are very happy to join the writers and directors
*  and tell them that they can't do that. They don't really need extra people doing that.
*  So my attitude is when you get a screenplay or a detailed outline that already exists,
*  and you're the science advisor, your job is not to scold them or tell them why they're wrong or
*  give them a bad grade. Your job is to help them. Your job is to serve the movie, tell the best,
*  most interesting story it possibly can. And the way that I find is helpful to mentally align yourself
*  to that job, that responsibility, is to think of the screenplay as data rather than as a theory.
*  In other words, you're not looking at the screenplay and go, no, I don't think that's the
*  way it would work. I don't think that's an accurate description of reality. That's a bad
*  attitude to have to a screenplay. The screenplay is in this world, what actually did happen?
*  And so a scientist who gets data, gets an experimental result and whose response is,
*  no, that can't happen, is not going to get that far. Once you shift your
*  mental orientation from explaining what can and cannot happen to, oh, this is what happened. It's
*  now my job to come up with an explanation for it. It frees your mind quite a bit. And it's almost
*  always possible to come up with explanations of how things can happen. So in my mind, a movie that
*  would be the greatest challenge to turn into something logical would be something like Back
*  to the Future. And it's sort of time travel. Let's just say it was a little freewheeling when it came
*  to the logic of time travel, which is actually admitted by the writers of the movie. They know
*  it. But it's a much beloved movie, right? Like it served its purposes narratively. So something good
*  must be going on. And of course, time travel stories are still very, very popular. Recently,
*  Ed Solomon tweeted the following tweet, over the next few weeks, people will have a chance to watch
*  an exquisitely crafted physics bending very important filmic meditation on the quandaries
*  of time and space. And also the much anticipated Tenet. The joke, of course, here is that Tenet is
*  a much anticipated movie by Christopher Nolan that was just released. I haven't seen it because
*  it's only in theaters and we're in a quarantine, so I'm not going to the theater. But apparently
*  time and space bendiness is a big part of it. Ed Solomon is one of the screenwriters on another
*  such movie, namely Bill and Ted Face the Music. Ed was also a screenwriter for the original Bill
*  and Ted movies. And Bill and Ted in a very different way have time travel as crucial plot points. So
*  we're not tired yet of time travel movies and time travel logic. It's important to see how far we can
*  go in figuring it out. Thus, this podcast, which will be a solo job, I'm not going to talk to anyone
*  else. I have my own things to say about time travel. I want to talk about what time travel
*  would be like, like how it could possibly work. What is the science behind it? What do general
*  relativity and quantum mechanics have to say about it? But then also philosophically, what would it
*  mean? What would it mean for issues of causality and predetermination and free will? And finally,
*  what does it mean narratively? Why do time travel stories work? How can they work? How should they
*  work? What is the guide to either understanding time travel stories that already exist or maybe
*  going out there and writing your own time travel story? So bringing all of these different issues
*  together and all these considerations is just the most fun thing in the world. And it's intellectually
*  a gas. And that's what Mindscape is all about. So if you're ready, let's go.
