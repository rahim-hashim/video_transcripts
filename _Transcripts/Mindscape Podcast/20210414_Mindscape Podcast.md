Welcome to the April 2021 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). I take the large number of questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable size — based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good — and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic. Enjoy!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | April 2021
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 14, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt8zAAZ-u38)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the April 2021 Ask Me Anything edition of the
*  Mindscape podcast. I'm your host Sean Carroll and we're once again in the
*  format where we're getting way too many questions for the AMA. For those of you
*  who don't know, questions are asked by Patreon supporters so you can go to
*  patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll and if you want to support Mindscape that's
*  always a good thing and some fraction of the people who support on Patreon like
*  to ask questions so we have the monthly AMA. There are too many questions for me
*  to really feasibly answer all of them or even almost all of them so I'm trying
*  these days to go through, pick out some, group some together and so forth and
*  look it breaks my heart honestly like I would like to answer all these questions
*  but I have to pick and choose and what I want to emphasize is it's not you it's
*  me if I'm not answering your question. It's not that the questions aren't good
*  really like the questions are all good I could try to answer any of them but
*  what I'm trying to do when I'm picking questions to answer is pick the
*  questions that I have something interesting to say about so it's not
*  only useful for the asker but also for the people who are listening hopefully
*  people listen to the content here and get something out of it so either it's a
*  perfectly good question that I'm just not inspired to say anything interesting
*  about or it's a perfectly good question that someone else could answer or you
*  know you could Google or Wikipedia or whatever those are not the questions I'm
*  going to answer and in addition of course as I say in the call for questions
*  I'm not gonna do any work to answer these questions so if it's like read
*  this person's theory and tell me what you think that's never gonna happen
*  sorry about that you know again I would like to in a world of infinite resources
*  or multiple copies of myself that I could then talk to and get information
*  from I would be able to do that in the version of many worlds in which we
*  actually live I don't get to talk to the other selves that are doing all this
*  work out there so they're kind of useless anyway having said all that lots
*  of good questions today so let's go
*  I wanted to start with this news report that we recently had that the large
*  hadron collider in particular the LHCB experiment at CERN has an anomaly it has
*  a result that does not exactly fit into the standard model of particle physics
*  and a couple people asked about it joy callback Maxim Alexandrovich Michael
*  Rinaldi all asked different questions about it and I don't want to go into
*  too much detail about it because I think that I can probably use it as a jumping
*  off point for either for talking to someone maybe just talking myself as a
*  solo episode but for digging in deeply into related issues about the standard
*  model and how it works and what we expect from it things like that I'm not
*  sure that I'm gonna do that but it's a prospect so rather than spending half an
*  hour 20 minutes explaining it here let me just note that I'll give you the 32nd
*  version here what they found is that there's a certain decay of a certain
*  kind of quark the bottom quark joy asked what what happened to the beauty quark
*  didn't we used to call it the beauty quark you know early in the days when
*  you either hypothesize or discover a new particle people will try to name it
*  there's some kind of collective intelligence action that goes on and you
*  decide what to pick so the the third generation of quarks some people wanted
*  to call them truth and beauty other people want to call them top and bottom
*  and the less evocative names one I wasn't there for that discussion so I'm
*  not exactly sure why they chose that but there you go anyway the prediction of
*  the standard model is that to a very good approximation the bottom quark
*  should couple the same to things like electrons and muons that's basically
*  because the coupling is through things like W and Z bosons and those couple
*  exactly the same but you could imagine that if there was a new particle that
*  coupled to the bottom quark and two electrons and muons then the decay of
*  the bottom quark into electrons or muons would be a little bit different
*  right a different ratio that was not quite one of the number of electrons
*  produced to the number of muons produced and that is apparently what
*  they are seeing so the question is is it real will it go away it is a three
*  sigma event if you're if you're familiar with that statistical nomenclature which
*  means you know it's worth paying attention to but we don't know if it's
*  going to survive or not so I always preach patience in these cases it would
*  be easy to explain if it were real easy in terms of we would need to introduce
*  new physics to explain it but it's not hard to invent versions of new physics
*  that would do the job you just need a particle that a virtual particle inside
*  the Feynman diagram as it were that would couple to bottom quarks and
*  differently to up to muons and electrons you know the Higgs boson does
*  that Higgs boson is an example in this particular decay the Higgs boson just
*  plays a very very tiny role but if there's a particle that's more important
*  to affecting that then that'll be really really interesting in fact the
*  the bad thing is there are too many ways to explain it so if it's just that one
*  little fact even if it becomes true you don't then get to say oh it's
*  supersymmetry or oh it's grand unification or oh it's whatever because
*  there's more than one way of doing it so I would say hold on try to collect more
*  data see where things are going Douglas Albrecht asks have you or others
*  speculated what might be emergent properties at much larger distances and
*  timescales than we are accustomed to considering is there a reason not to
*  think that there might be radically different emergent phenomena if we were
*  somehow able to appreciate our universe from this kind of perspective so if I
*  understand correctly what you're saying is if I understand it which I'm not sure
*  but what we know is that you know we're made of atoms and things like that and
*  these atoms come together to make molecules and cells and organs and bodies
*  and then the bodies come together to make groups and societies and
*  civilizations and so as you go to bigger and bigger levels you get different
*  kinds of emergent descriptions of what's going on and the question is could we
*  imagine going to bigger and bigger levels right much bigger than planets or
*  people or maybe galaxies well I actually think the answer is no here I mean it's
*  a very good question to ask it's perfectly reasonable thing to wonder I
*  suspect the answer is no for the following reasons number one we know a
*  little bit about things on the scale of galaxies right and you know galaxies in
*  the universe are pretty far apart from each other in a cluster of galaxies
*  they can be very nearby and they bump into each other all the time the Milky
*  Way is gonna bump into Andromeda but individual galaxies out in the field are
*  far away from each other and don't bump into each other and clusters generally
*  don't bump into each other so galaxies just don't interact that much right I
*  mean part of getting an emergent phenomenon is that not only you're on a
*  big length scale but the little individual pieces of which you're made
*  are constantly interacting right are constantly bumping into each other so
*  rather than describing them as just individual pieces occasionally
*  interacting there's some average behavior that can emerge when the
*  individual pieces only occasionally interact that doesn't become a useful
*  way of talking and the other thing is on very large scales much larger than
*  galaxies or the universe the universe just not that old right you know we
*  have the Big Bang 14 billion years ago and the visible universe is some tens of
*  billions of light-years across which means which by the way that those two
*  numbers are not the same the size of the visible universe is not exactly the age
*  of the universe in light-years because in years because the universe is
*  expanding and there's a complicated interaction there going on but roughly
*  speaking order of magnitude the size of the visible universe in light-years is
*  the same as the age of the universe measured in years which means that on
*  scales larger than the observable universe there's been literally no
*  interaction there's not been enough time for things to interact very often and
*  there won't be you know the universe is accelerating so the things that have not
*  yet interacted that are on cosmological distances from each other will never
*  interact roughly speaking with each other so they're not there's no chance
*  there's no opportunity for these things to come together and be described in an
*  interesting way as an emergent phenomenon that's my that's my take on it
*  and I hope that I'm answering the question you're actually asking Adrian
*  says you strike me as someone with a special talent for expressing even
*  controversial ideas in a very diplomatic and respectful manner it's probably
*  easier when debating intellectuals but do you have any tips for someone who has
*  trouble staying calm and not getting angry when debating let's say a close
*  family member with some rather non-standard ideas about epidemiology
*  and virology well thank you for the compliment of having the talent for
*  expressing the even controversial ideas you know I don't have any simple basic
*  rules for these kind of situation I think the first thing to ask yourself
*  is what kind of situation are you actually in look sometimes people don't
*  want to be reasoned with right some people are just not in it for an
*  intellectual debate some people are not open-minded about certain beliefs that
*  they have either those particular beliefs or those particular people more
*  more generally and in that case save your breath don't waste your effort
*  right I one of the things that makes me able to talk to people who with whom I
*  disagree is that the people who I choose to talk to are people who can be talked
*  to right people who can be reasoned with people who are saying well I think this
*  but let's talk about it let's you know that's actually reason I'm willing to
*  listen to what you have to say and you know I'm too old to just sort of debate
*  people who I don't agree with you know as I said before for the podcast I
*  specifically will occasionally bring people on who I disagree with and but
*  only if I think that their ideas are somehow worth contemplating I think it's
*  possible to disagree with someone and yet say that their ideas are not
*  worthless right we have to we have to admit that we could sometimes be wrong
*  if you're gonna ask your interlocutor or your partner to admit that they could be
*  wrong you gotta admit that maybe you could be wrong also so the people I
*  bring on to mindscape are ones who I think we can all learn from or at least
*  provoke interesting ideas in our head whether I agree with them or not I will
*  and have of course done formal debates with people I deeply disagree with
*  but they're really I'm not trying to convince that person that they're wrong
*  they're you know up there on stage making a performative act in whatever
*  they believe I'm trying to reach the audience right when I debated William
*  Lane Craig there were a lot of people in the audience who were you know young
*  people who might have been religious who had just never heard the perspective of
*  an atheist who was a reasonable person with a some answers to the questions
*  that might have been bugging them so the purpose of a debate like that it's not
*  for me to win the debate or to convince the other person it's to put some ideas
*  into the head of audience members who might not have otherwise heard them now
*  family members are a different issue right because on the one hand you kind
*  of have to deal with them and you want to you know they're in your family you
*  care about them on the other hand they might not be rational or reasonable and
*  there you know I don't have advice about how to not get angry I think it's good
*  not to get angry I mean that kind of advice should come from I don't know
*  either a psychologist or a Zen master or somebody like that but I agree that you
*  should aim you should aspire to not getting angry it never helps to get
*  angry with people when you're just debating about something you know there
*  are people who like to debate not because they have irrational beliefs
*  that they were going to stick to but because they have no beliefs at all they
*  just like to win debates those people to me are just as annoying as ones who have
*  irrational beliefs that they're going to stick to like I'm not interested in
*  that my my participating in debates is always about raising the overall
*  understanding of the world on the part of either the people participating or
*  the people listening it's never about showing off some intellectual chops or
*  anything like that so if you find those people who are just like like to debate
*  then you know again I would just choose to do other things as far as your family
*  members you have to remember that you do care about them and sometimes even
*  though you care about them they're gonna be wrong and you're gonna live with that
*  right you know forget about people with opinions about vaccines or something
*  like that this very often happens when you have very elderly relatives whether
*  it's parents or grandparents or whatever and you know they want to live their
*  lives in a certain way and you don't agree like you think that they're
*  taking risks or something like that you know they're they're not using their
*  remaining days in the best way possible and my attitude there is that if someone
*  is not endangering others like I don't want people who can't drive anymore to
*  be driving right that's that would be bad but if people choose to you know
*  live a lifestyle when they're older that is maybe a little bit riskier to their
*  health but makes them much much happier let them do it that's my philosophy I
*  think the motto is autonomy is more important than rationality when you get
*  to that point in your life you know when you're to the point in your life where
*  you don't have many years left let people live their lives obviously if
*  they're suffering from dementia or something like that or like I said if
*  there are danger to others that would not count but if people are relatively
*  in control of their faculties I like to let people make choices that are their
*  choices even if it's not the choices I would wish they could make I know that's
*  not the question you asked but I sort of got rambling there sorry about that
*  Brian Davis says if dark matter did not exist or any of its observed effects do
*  you think that the resulting conditions could have allowed would have allowed
*  for life to emerge so this is sneakily a really good question I don't know Brian
*  if you know the story here but for life as we know it right now here on earth
*  dark matter plays zero role okay if all the dark matter in the universe
*  disappeared right now you and I would not even notice it would certainly not
*  affect our lives but it is possible that dark matter played a role in
*  creating the first generation of stars I mean we know that dark matter create had
*  a role creating the first generation of galaxies right but dark matter doesn't
*  like to clump together as I've said before on the podcast so dark matter
*  doesn't clump together into star-like things but yet people have suggested
*  that maybe the combination of dark matter dynamics and ordinary matter
*  dynamics in the early universe helped create really big stars in the very
*  first generation and then those would explode and create heavier elements and
*  lead to other star formation down the line etc so I don't know what the answer
*  is to your question but it is conceivable to me that without dark matter life the
*  kinds of stars and planets that support life would at least be much more rare in
*  the universe than they are I don't know if it would be impossible usually it's
*  a big universe out there right so maybe without dark matter stars would be much
*  less common but they would still be there occasionally in the universe okay
*  I'm going to group together four different questions let me just ask them
*  all explicitly here hopefully the theme will come through Chris Rogers says is
*  gravity a force Eugene Novikov says we lay people are taught using trampoline
*  analogies that gravity is the manifestation of the curvature of
*  space-time itself that seems conceptually very different from the
*  idea that gravity is a force mediated by an elementary particle called the
*  graviton how should we think about the relationship between these ideas Sean
*  Atkinson says I understand we are confident that gravity must be
*  communicated by via an additional quantum particle referred to as the
*  gravitino and it's just a matter of discovery but I've also heard on
*  multiple occasions that gravity is not so much a regular force but rather how
*  space-time is curved these explanations have always felt like some kind of
*  contradiction and I'm missing something and anonymous says I have a question
*  about what it means for space to be curved if I put a cantaloupe on an empty
*  cereal box the that's a very specific analogy by the way but if you put a
*  cantaloupe on empty cereal box the surface of the box will bend inward and
*  curve but I could still think of the box is curved with respect to rigid
*  three-dimensional coordinates can space be thought of as a curved medium that's
*  completely filling true empty space like a bunched up scarf in China's shoebox
*  or is there just the scarf okay so I hope you get the theme of what is
*  gravity and what is curvature of space-time is it really a force is it
*  really a particle of these four questions it's interesting you know maybe
*  someone could do some deep learning analysis of the AMA questions and why
*  certain topics pop up multiple times something in the air I don't know
*  someone out there talking about curved space-time and is gravity a force so you
*  know I when I was young when I was your age I was pretty doctrinaire
*  about saying gravity is not a force once you understand general relativity and
*  the reason for saying that is that Einstein's great insight in general
*  relativity is that unlike so he already had the insight he didn't have the
*  insight but due to special relativity Hermann Minkowski Einstein's former
*  teacher had the insight that we should dissolve space and time separately and
*  make them into one four-dimensional space-time Einstein was reluctant to
*  accept that but eventually accepted it and said you know what gravity is not a
*  force propagating on top of space-time it is a feature of space-time itself okay
*  so there's a way of thinking that says we should separate out forces that live
*  within the space-time like electromagnetism and the nuclear forces
*  from features of space-time itself and this helps understand the principle of
*  equivalence if you're in a small region of space you can't even tell whether
*  you're in a gravitational field or not space-time I should say whereas you can
*  tell if there's an electric field or if there's a magnetic field or something
*  like that so that's the justification for saying that you shouldn't think of
*  gravity as a force but you know I'm in my old age in my dotage I'm much more
*  open-minded about these things you know sure gravity is a force in some sense
*  when I drop this pen that is right in front of me if I drop it there you heard
*  it drop it fell on the desk I can describe that as the force of gravity
*  pulling on the pen that's not a bad or illegal move to make so the point is
*  that the idea of a force or any idea like force or energy or acceleration or
*  any of these things these are not pre theoretic ideas okay all of these ideas
*  are words that we invent in the context of some understanding of the world and
*  maybe within some sort of way of talking they're useful words some other way of
*  talking they're not the best way we have of describing gravity in the
*  macroscopic classical world is as the curvature of space-time if you wanted
*  therefore say it's not a force it's not a particle is the curvature of space-time
*  fine but there could very well be other circumstances either more limited or
*  more specialized or more general where there's another way of talking about
*  gravity so you can also hear in the room where the Newtonian approximation is
*  really really good talking about gravity as a force is perfectly fine talking
*  about as a it as a particle being exchanged as the exchange of a
*  graviton is also perfectly fine it's exactly analogous to how we talk about
*  electromagnetism and electromagnetic fields or we talk about the exchange of
*  individual gravitons so one of the questions called the Gravitino that's
*  not right that is definitely a mistake so it's called the Graviton the
*  particle of gravity Gravitino would be the supersymmetric partner of the
*  Graviton if such a thing exists we've never discovered either one so
*  Gravitino's are truly hypothetical Gravitons almost certainly exist I say
*  almost certainly because quantum mechanics is correct and gravity is
*  correct and if you believe both of those things there's going to be a particle
*  called the Graviton it's just too weak too weakly interacting with us for us to
*  ever realistically discover individual Gravitons unless something crazy
*  happens like gravity becomes much stronger at higher energies which is
*  possible but not very likely these days so it's not that it's a contradiction
*  this is two different languages for describing the same thing now one more
*  piece of physics I need to say and I forget I might have
*  erased by mistake the question about this but when you or it might be later
*  so I might be answering it earlier than necessary here but here is a question
*  you could reasonably have when you draw like a Feynman diagram and you imagine
*  two electrons okay and there the electrons approach each other and they
*  exchange a photon and they scatter okay that makes sense like it makes sense
*  from an intuitive point of view you know if you have two people on a boat on two
*  different boats and they're sort of moving through the lake and it's not
*  very windy or anything and one of them throws a medicine ball to the other the
*  the one who throws you know there's some momentum imparted to that medicine ball
*  and it pushes them in the other direction and likewise the one who catches
*  it is pushed in the other direction so by the exchange of the medicine ball the
*  two little boats the two little canoes are pushed apart that makes sense much
*  like two little electrons are pushed apart by the electromagnetic force but
*  if you have an electron and a positron or if you have two objects exchanging
*  gravitons they're not pushed apart they're pulled together how in the world
*  do you pull something together by throwing something back and forth right
*  it seems like the only thing you could do is push yourself apart the secret is
*  that virtual particles I discussed this in the biggest ideas in the universe
*  videos virtual particles don't necessarily have a positive value of
*  the momentum you can throw a virtual particle from one particle to another
*  one with a negative momentum when you throw a particle with a negative
*  momentum in some direction you start moving in that direction to conserve
*  momentum right and this is all the math all works out it's a little bit
*  counterintuitive but trust me on that I just want to let you know there's a
*  little bit of counterintuitive goings-on to help explain how you can get both
*  attractive and repulsive forces from exchange of particles in Feynman diagrams
*  and finally to the you know the space versus the scarf question so what what I
*  take it here is being asked is when we visualize curved spaces or surfaces we
*  inevitably do it as a three as a two-dimensional surface being bent you
*  know like the rubber sheet with the bowling ball on it embedded in a
*  three-dimensional space that we live right and that is entirely a feature of
*  our visualization capacities that is not a feature of nature so we do not
*  think that because our three-dimensional space or our
*  four-dimensional space-time is curved that it therefore must be embedded in a
*  higher dimensional flat space-time this was really the insight that came from
*  the 1800s when Gauss and Riemann and others discovered how to do intrinsic
*  geometry rather than extrinsic geometry the extrinsic geometry is talking about
*  how you're embedded in a bigger space intrinsic geometry is just what's going
*  on to you internally in the space that you are in and you don't need to be
*  embedded in any bigger space you can ask questions like if I start two photons
*  off and they're initially parallel do they converge on each other do they get
*  deflected away from each other do they twist in some direction these are all
*  askable questions and they're all answerable questions from the
*  perspective of someone inside the space you don't need to be embedded in a
*  bigger space outside and that's kind of what we do when we do general relativity
*  that's essentially the kind of thought experiment that we're doing in some more
*  technically relevant way to some real physical situation so we don't need
*  anything outside when the universe is expanding when it's curved etc it does
*  not imply there's any other universe that we are that it is part of or that
*  we're embedded in oh yeah it's right here it's the very next question should
*  have been grouped into there it's from Thomas Prunty he says in last month's AMA
*  you talked about how a classical field arises from a collection of bosons how
*  then would you describe the corresponding force in terms of
*  particles for example how does the classical electrostatic force arise
*  from exchange of photons what makes it attractive or repulsive so there you go
*  that's what it is you know the details are in things like the charge of the
*  particles right and that affects the value of the Feynman diagram that you
*  calculate and beyond that at the level of this AMA with no pictures or no
*  equations I'm gonna have to say trust me on that but it all does fit together it's
*  all you know you think of tiny little fluctuations in fields as corresponding
*  to particles and big coherent bending or expectation values of fields as
*  corresponding to classical fields that you would notice in your everyday life
*  okay Gerald Swan says regarding the Fermi paradox do you think it's
*  plausible that other technological civilizations exist but interstellar
*  travel is simply intractable engineering no I don't really think that that's a
*  very viable solution I don't think the interstellar travel is intractable
*  engineering I mean look even we puny humans have sent spacecraft outside the
*  solar system right the voyagers the pioneers etc now they're moving very
*  very slowly but we really are very backward right now compared to where we
*  could imagine being in terms of rocket propulsion etc the other thing you have
*  to keep in mind is that you know everyone worries about the speed of light
*  it takes years or tens of years or hundreds of years to travel from our
*  solar system to other solar systems at reasonable fractions of the speed of
*  light that sounds like a long time what if it takes 10,000 years to get to the
*  star you want to get to well that's fine you won't survive right but number one
*  maybe you will survive because maybe we'll solve longevity of human beings
*  maybe we'll be able to solve aging that's a possibility number two there
*  could be cryogenic suspended animation number three we could just send robots
*  most importantly 10,000 years is nothing compared to the lifespan of a planet or
*  a star or the galaxy right so I don't see any reason why you should think that
*  interstellar travel is so hard that no one has left their solar system that
*  maybe it's true I mean anything's possible I don't know for sure but that
*  would not be the way that I would bet Justin Bailey says would you summarize
*  how you avoid the Boltzmann brain paradox in your view of the universe you
*  know I don't have a view of the universe once and for all I as a theoretical
*  physicist investigate different scenarios right we propose different
*  hypotheses and we try to figure out which ones are the best fit to the data
*  so I'm not sure if you mean specifically I did with Jennifer Chen proposed in
*  2004 a view of the multiverse where baby universes were created from quantum
*  fluctuations in empty space and those baby universes grew up into big
*  inflationary universes so in that particular situation the reason why you
*  avoid the Boltzmann brain problem is because you create Boltzmann brains
*  very plausibly you also create universes and those universes grow up
*  and create lots of ordinary observers and the point is you can show that you
*  create more universes than brains a universe that sounds like a lot to
*  create sounds like harder to create but in fact this is the miracle of
*  inflationary cosmology and general relativity for that matter creating a
*  universe is not that hard universes can start really really tiny okay near the
*  Planck scale they can inflate upward to whatever size you want and the total
*  amount of energy caused to create a universe is zero that's a tricky thing
*  because there's both negative energy and positive energy in general relativity
*  much like much like but not exactly like the negative and positive momenta
*  inside Feynman diagrams that we just talked about so the point of the point
*  is that if you just calculate the chance that you will get a random quantum
*  fluctuation into a brain or a living being that is lower than the chance you
*  will get a random quantum fluctuation into a little bubble ready to make a
*  whole universe and every bubble corresponds maybe two billions or
*  trillions or quadrillions of ordinary observers so the hope is that to the
*  extent that is possible to compare them you make more ordinary observers than
*  Boltzmann brains now I don't necessarily think that scenario is right I think
*  it's possibly right I think there's a credence that you should have that
*  something like that is on the right track but we don't know for sure
*  certainly so I'm not sure if that's the right way that the universe avoids the
*  Boltzmann brain problem I think there's roughly speaking to possibilities the
*  Boltzmann brain problem arises when you have a universe that lasts forever and
*  randomly fluctuates okay so there's be random fluctuations then you're more
*  likely overall to get if you if you have a finite number of things that can
*  happen in the universe then small fluctuations away from equilibrium will
*  always be more likely than large fluctuations that's when you get the
*  Boltzmann brain problem when you have a finite number of things that can happen
*  and an infinite number amount of time for them to happen in so that's why I
*  said there's roughly speaking two ways out one way is have an infinite number
*  of things that can happen not just a finite way that's what we take advantage
*  of in our scenario but the other way is to not let the universe last forever
*  have a universe that really not just within our observable universe but
*  overall lasts a finite time then it's very very easy to have more ordinary
*  observers than Boltzmann brains which one is actually true I don't know I
*  don't know we're at the way to think about that we have a long way to go to
*  really have confidence one way or the other
*  pair Magnuson says what are your thoughts on the possibility and time
*  frame of a future technological singularity it seems to me like we are
*  making very fast technological progress in some regards but in others we seem to
*  have picked most of the low-hanging fruit and progress is not obviously
*  exponential yeah I have zero credence not quite zero but almost zero in a
*  future technological singularity of course it depends on what you mean but I
*  take it at face value that a technological singularity is really
*  equivalent to an essentially infinite rate of progress in technology and that
*  is what people have tried to argue for but there's no way to quantify rate of
*  progress in technology or that mean there's no one way that captures
*  everything you can invent ways but a lot of it has just been hand-waving
*  honestly and I think that besides just being hand-waving and and ungrounded
*  optimism the other problem is that people take you know exponentials
*  exponential growth curves and just extrapolate them by the way you need
*  worse than exponential you not worse better than exponential to get a
*  singularity right an exponential is not a singularity an exponential just keeps
*  growing forever a singularity is like one over X as you approach X from the
*  left it goes to infinity in a finite interval that's what you would need for
*  a singularity and and even if you had super exponential growth you can only
*  have that for a little time there's no guarantee whatsoever that you have it
*  forever there are plenty of examples in nature of you know yeast growth curves
*  which kind of look like bell curves where you exponentially grow but then
*  you peak and you go back down to zero that's a very plausible future scenario
*  you also have sigmoid curves where you grow for a while exponentially but then
*  you flatten off and are just flat for a long time in a new equilibrium you know
*  if you go back to one of my favorite mindscape episodes with Joe Walston
*  about the environment and urbanization and we talked about the fact that we
*  could be in the midst of a transition between two equilibria where one
*  equilibrium has no urbanization and no technology right and so you know people
*  were just animals just like everything else and the earth went along perfectly
*  fine but then we discovered technology and we began to exponentially change
*  our lives but it's possible that we're just approaching a new equilibrium where
*  most people live in cities most of the earth is not urbanized at all and
*  there's no people living there there's the rest of the ecosystem living there
*  and we live happily in our cities and we interact with the outside world but we
*  don't ruin it and despoil it as we so often do these days like you imply in
*  your question there are some areas in which we picked most of low-hanging
*  fruit I think that's absolutely true you know atoms are the smallest thing we
*  can make things out of I mean electrons okay electrons or nuclei etc but you
*  can't get smaller than that technologically so once you reach the
*  point where you are manipulating individual atoms and individual
*  particles all future progress is made from putting those basic pieces together
*  in more and more interesting ways not in getting smaller in the fundamental
*  pieces from which you're building your technology there's plenty of room for
*  improvement but still there are some particular what should I say particular
*  avenues of improvement that are no longer open to us and that won't be open
*  to us that doesn't mean that improvement stops but it just means that you need to
*  do it in other directions right that it's completely plausible to me that you
*  know we improve technology for a while then we stop improving it it's more not
*  almost there it's not like we're gonna happen the next ten years but if you're
*  thinking about the next ten thousand years that's completely plausible to me
*  Sam says are you pleased with what the Sixers did or didn't do with the trade
*  deadline and have you spoken to Darryl about it by which of course he means
*  Darryl Morey who's a recent Mindscape guest I'm pretty pleased with what they
*  did actually you know for those of you who have not been keeping track the
*  Sixers were rumored to be part of a blockbuster trade deal with the Toronto
*  Raptors to get Kyle Lowry but it turns out that they would have had to trade a
*  lot of their existing players and future draft picks and they didn't do it
*  they thought it wasn't worth it and I think that's the correct choice I did
*  not speak to Darryl about it you know the Sixers did pick up George Hill who
*  was a good you know second choice I think good shooting point guard who can
*  play defense you know and the reason why I'm asking these questions not because
*  I have anything especially insightful to say about the Sixers or that most of you
*  care about that but you know I do think there's something to be said about how
*  much you bug people and you know I take you know some people who I have on the
*  podcast or people who I know personally we hang out right we see at conferences
*  or we see at other you know social situations and other people I have on
*  the podcast when I have you know Wynton Marsalis or Cornell West or Darryl Morey
*  or Seth MacFarlane I'm not buddies with these people we got along really really
*  well for the podcast episode but I'm not gonna you know constantly pester them
*  with my opinions about their job I think that that is you know part of the
*  bargain is that you respect other people's time and space if the people
*  are especially really really busy you know working at a high level in some
*  particular profession you know if we happen to meet up and have a drink
*  together and you know chat then I might do that but I'm not gonna be DMing Darryl
*  Morey with my opinions about the Sixers trade deadline he deserves better than
*  that what do I know okay he has not DMed me about his favorite theories of
*  dark matter either just so you know Dragon-Sided D says could you briefly
*  compare and contrast the work with you and Alan Guth on a two-headed arrow of
*  time at the Big Bang with Neil Turok and collaborators CPT symmetrical theory it
*  looks like both posit basically two equal and opposite universes resulting
*  from the Big Bang are they compatible theories so the work so here's the the
*  bigger story here for those of you who don't know what this revering to as I
*  said in 2004 Jennifer Chen and I proposed this very specific model with
*  baby universes and the motivation for that model was to make realistic the
*  idea that there is an infinite number of things that can happen in the universe
*  and an infinite amount of time for them to happen okay so I mean you can do that
*  in a trivial way have a particle have a universe with three particles in it and
*  and space is infinitely big and the particles sort of you know come together
*  and they just zoom off to infinity forever so in some trivial sense that's
*  the universe where things are always changing because the particles are
*  always getting further and further away and what happens in a universe like that
*  is that there will always be a moment do you just have three particles again
*  they're not for even forget about gravity okay just three particles that
*  are moving on straight lines three particles moving on straight lines
*  through the universe always have the property that there was a moment when
*  they were closest there's a single moment when they're closest whatever
*  else you're gonna do no matter what their specific trajectories are and in
*  both the past and the future of that moment they're further apart so you can
*  kind of use this behavior as a metaphors an analogy for the behavior of entropy
*  when you have many many many more particles or more quantum degrees of
*  or whatever so the idea is that if time lasts forever and you have a universe
*  that can always be changing the generic behavior you expect is that there is a
*  moment of minimum entropy and entropy is increasing both to the past of that
*  moment and to the future of that moment so you're not tuning the fact that
*  entropy is increasing entropy is always increasing everywhere except for
*  literally one moment of time okay the question is can you make it realistic so
*  what Jenny Chen and I tried to do was make it realistic with baby universes
*  and big bangs and stuff like that this leaves more conceptual questions about
*  how you make predictions and how you tame the infinities in such a scenario
*  so that's what Alan Guth and I have been working on slowly and my apologies to
*  Alan and the unlikely case that he is listening to this both Alan and I you
*  know are very very interested in this problem but we're the worst people for
*  getting things done so we've been working on this for years and just not quite
*  finishing the project but it's very closely related to similar work that
*  Julian Barber did with his collaborators on the Janus point he wrote a whole book
*  about it in you know some classical gravitational theory having this
*  behavior where there's a moment of minimum entropy and it increases to the
*  future in the past so Alan and I are looking at the you know fundamental
*  conceptual questions here Julian and his collaborators had a specific scenario
*  which wasn't very realistic but at least they could solve all the equations
*  Jenny and I had a specific scenario where we don't have control over the
*  equation so we had to make guesses and cross our fingers that's why it's much
*  more speculative in contrast so Neil Turok and his collaborators I'm sorry I
*  forget the collaborators names I didn't look it up before doing this they had a
*  theory have a theory and by the way there's other people who followed up
*  Jenny and my ideas so Stephen Hawking with Jim Hardell and Thomas Hurtog
*  looked at bouncing or overall symmetric cosmologies within their wave function
*  the universe quantum cosmology program so there's there's other people who've
*  done this kind of thing and so Neil Turok and his friends did a specific
*  again a specific example of this where they had kind of a bounce at the at the
*  middle of the history of the universe and the universe expands and entropy
*  grows in both directions away from it and it's symmetric under this particle
*  physics symmetry called CPT charge parity time reversal symmetry and their idea
*  was you know not only are they explaining the Big Bang cosmology but
*  somehow the matter anti-matter asymmetry in the universe our universe has more
*  matter than anti-matter maybe on the other side of the Big Bang there's more
*  anti-matter than matter something like that so there's a huge difference
*  between these actually so the similarity is that if you go to the far past in the
*  far future you get very similar looking cosmologies where entropy is increasing
*  and you get an arrow of time pointing in opposite directions but the difference
*  is that they have a very very very very specific condition right there in the
*  middle okay so they're not saying this will happen for any old initial
*  conditions they're picking almost infinitely finely tuned initial
*  conditions to do that and again other people have done the same thing long ago
*  Anthony Aguirre who is a former mindscape guest he and Steven Grattan
*  wrote a paper about a completely symmetric decider space based cosmology
*  they didn't try to explain baryogenesis or the matter anti-matter asymmetry but
*  they did the general relativity and got that cosmological solution I think that
*  was before my paper with Jenny but the difference is they weren't trying to
*  explain the fine-tuning of the early entropy and neither is Neil Turok and
*  his friends like Jenny and I were specifically aimed at trying to give a
*  dynamical explanation for the observed low entropy of our early universe and by
*  the way you know I think it's still true even though the the scenario that Jenny
*  and I put forward is extremely speculative and involves a whole lot of
*  leap a lot of leaps of faith it works under those assumptions right so it's
*  not cheating it's not putting in it's not cooking in the answer it's not
*  fine-tuning anything and I don't know of any other theory that does that still
*  you know 15 years later so there's work to be done and either we're right or
*  someone else is right I would like to know one way or the other
*  George Sorobidze says as you know light has zero mass and since everything
*  divided by zero and multiplied by zero always gives zero gravity has to have a
*  very little or no effect on light however light never chooses the shortest
*  path route instead it always chooses the shortest time route would it be
*  reasonable to state that when light encounters dense galaxies it should take
*  less time for the light to go around the dense galaxies then through them so
*  there's a couple things I have to undo here everything divided by zero does not
*  always give zero so you're not allowed to divide by zero as blatant move you
*  can take a limit of dividing by a really tiny number and sending that
*  tiny number to zero and usually you just say what you get is not a number you get
*  a singularity right but there could be special cases where things work out well
*  and you get a finite number but there's absolutely no rule that says when you
*  divide by zero you get zero just so you know that it's also not true the gravity
*  has zero to no effect on light this is one of Einstein's discoveries right in
*  Newtonian gravity you think of the mass of a particle as both its resistance to
*  a force right as the amount of inertia it has F equals MA the more massive it
*  is the more force you have to give to accelerate the particle but you also in
*  Newtonian mechanics think of the mass as the source of gravity the more mass the
*  more gravitational field it has and the more it is affected by a gravitational
*  field but that's not what Einstein says okay Einstein says you have the
*  principle of equivalence Einstein says that space and time are curved and that
*  freely falling particles choose shortest space-time intervals along the paths on
*  which they travel so it is absolutely true that gravity affects light it
*  affects like quite a bit actually if you go near a black hole those pictures you
*  see from black holes or an interstellar you see photons zooming around black
*  holes multiple times before they escape having said all that the actual question
*  there is a feature of general relativity that in some sense the time it takes
*  light to travel near a gravitational field would be less than the time it
*  takes to sort of zoom around the outside and be deflected so that it is a way if
*  what you're asking is can we think about the actual motion of photons and curved
*  space-time by using something like the principle of least time the answer is
*  yes now I'm saying all that in very vague heavily footnoted language
*  because time measured by what etc yet like figure out what your clocks are but
*  roughly speaking that's true so for government work purposes yeah that's
*  fine Rasmus Kees-Nierbeck says are there any ways for amateurs to contribute to
*  physics in the sense of citizen science you know amateurs the point here being
*  there's a lot of citizen science that people can do to help contribute to
*  science and things like biology anthropology or whatever paleontology
*  botany physics is harder and so physics is harder it really is for a whole
*  number of reasons and it depends very much on the kind of physics you're
*  talking about you know if you're talking about theoretical physics you know
*  creating new theories of cosmology or fundamental particles then it's really
*  really hard for the basic reason that you need a lot of background right you
*  need to take years worth of courses to get the background necessary to do the
*  work now in this day and age you could do that right you could buy the books or
*  you could just take the online courses and you could educate yourself up
*  Gerard de Tuft the Nobel Prize winning physicist has a website where he goes
*  through the whole curriculum of what courses you would need to take he's a
*  little bit overly enthusiastic maybe he wants to train you up to be a Nobel
*  Prize winner but if you just want to make some contribution it's less than
*  that but honestly you know even if you did that which is really hard to do but
*  not being around the community of other physicists not being in graduate school
*  having friends you could talk with about problems and so forth makes it really
*  really hard to contribute to that kind of theoretical physics at a at a useful
*  level there are other areas of physics right there's more experimental areas
*  etc it is conceivable to me that citizens who are not professionals with
*  less training than a PhD could contribute to those areas but honestly I
*  don't know it's not my thing right so I'm not an expert once you move into
*  astrophysics it becomes more possible I mean there are citizen science projects
*  that you know monitor the sky for different things or do radio telescope
*  kind of science again I am NOT an expert sorry about that but it is possible in
*  principle I think the overall lesson is that citizen science is great and if
*  you're interested in that you should look into it but it would be a mistake
*  to be too devoted ahead of time to what kind of science you want to do I mean
*  after all if if if your interest is literally in doing citizen science rather
*  than simply learning science everyone is welcome to learn whatever science they
*  want but if you want to contribute to it then given that motivation you really
*  should take into account where can you make the most interesting contribution
*  and that might not be in physics so that would be my not very helpful but
*  hopefully correct advice Thierry Leroux-Paquet says when we do the double slit
*  experiment to show the wave particle property of an electron how can we
*  maintain the electron in the superposition state while its own gravity
*  should interact with the surroundings and then decohere I'm going to combine
*  this with the next question which is Martin Coomber saying something deeply
*  hidden is one of the few popular science books I was able to read and end however
*  I struggle with the concept of decoherence in particular why doesn't
*  everything become entangled by extension to everything else and with this
*  extended entanglement happen at the speed of light so both of these
*  questions are about the process of decoherence the idea being when you have
*  a quantum system that is in some kind of superposition when it interacts in a
*  particular way with the external world it becomes entangled with that external
*  world and that is going to lead to this phenomenon of decoherence decoherence
*  simply is a little quantum system in a superposition becoming entangled with
*  its environment so the important thing and I know this is hard to get across at
*  a popular level of discussion but the important thing to keep in mind here is
*  that decoherence happens because of interactions physical interactions you
*  know governed by the laws of physics nothing weird or spooky but not every
*  interaction leads to decoherence decoherence happens specifically with the
*  kinds of interactions that are affecting the quantum system differently
*  depending on which part of the quantum superposition it's in okay so let's say
*  that you have an electron or some other particle neutron electrically I keep I
*  keep saying electrons when I talk about measuring the spin of particles you
*  shouldn't actually talk about electrons because they're electrically charged and
*  it's hard to measure their spin directly neutral particles are easier
*  because they're not being affected by the stray electromagnetic fields anyway
*  let's say we have a neutron we're gonna measure its spin okay you can do that
*  put it through magnetic field spin up will be deflected one way spin down be
*  deflected the other way the point is that in the initial state that the
*  neutron starts in a superposition of spin up and spin down if I just take the
*  neutron you know in a box and I move it I'm interacting with it right I'm moving
*  the neutron from one place to another but I'm interacting with the spin up
*  part and the spin down part in exactly the same way the fact that I'm moving
*  the center of mass of the neutron is completely irrelevant to the different
*  spin parts of the wave function of the electron so that's not decoherence that
*  is not becoming entangled with the neutron it's just moving it it's
*  interacting with it but not becoming entangled that's why you have to do all
*  this work to measure the spin of the neutron by throwing it through a
*  distorted magnetic field and watching it be deflected one way or the other and
*  then detecting it on the other side you have to specifically interact with it in
*  a way that interacts differently with the spin up part and the spin down part
*  that's what the magnetic field will do likewise with the electron going through
*  the double slit it interacts with the slits but it does not become entangled
*  with them in different ways now you asked specifically Thierry about
*  gravity and this becomes a subtle question actually you know electrons or
*  whatever they're coupled to gravity they're couple to photons right
*  electromagnetism also so if the electron passes through the slits and bumps into
*  them with enough oomph it can shake off shake loose a few gravitons or a few
*  photons for that matter and that could lead to decoherence so it becomes a
*  quantitative question and in fact you know you don't need you need to shake it
*  pretty hard to decohere in that way so the numbers simply tell you that even
*  though the electron is dispersed by the slits it goes through diffracted it's
*  actually not becoming entangled with them in any substantial way Philip
*  Lakashius says after reading your latest latest preprint on mad dog of
*  a redianism I'm wondering what your philosophical motivation for pursuing
*  this paradigm is is it maybe some kinds of Occam's razor philosophy that the
*  most simple theory is the one that's most likely true or are there further
*  reasons one might feel that other approaches are epistemologically
*  less promising approaches so I think it's both so what is what Philip is
*  referring to is I wrote a paper a couple years ago with Ashmeet Singh called mad
*  dog ever ready and ism so ever it ever ready in quantum mechanics says the
*  world is it described by a wave function that evolves with time according to the
*  Schrodinger equation but usually when people do physics they not only say
*  there's a wave function but they tell you something about the wave function
*  it's a function of position or a momentum or of quantum fields or whatever
*  and that gives you an enormous amount of extra structure you can use to probe the
*  theory to describe it etc the mad dog ever ready in ism says that wave
*  function is just a vector in Hilbert space okay it's not a function of
*  anything the idea that the wave function that the state vector if you
*  want to call it that should be thought of as a wave function of something
*  should be an emergent phenomenon in some approximation at a coarse-grained
*  level that's the mad dog idea and so you so in other words you're removing even
*  some of the very minimal ingredients that ever ready in quantum mechanics
*  typically lets itself helps itself to when describing the world and you say
*  all you have is a vector evolving according to the Schrodinger equation
*  and everything else should be emergent that's the idea so it's the most minimal
*  approach you can have and so I recently wrote another paper reality as a vector
*  in Hilbert space you can find it and it is kind of a restatement of that idea
*  but this one is more aimed at philosophers that it was a an essay
*  that I wrote for an invited collection of essays on the fundamental ontology of
*  quantum mechanics and so I rather than going through the equations there were
*  some equations in there but mostly I sort of defended the approach because it
*  was for philosophers more than physicists and part of the motivation is
*  exactly like you say Occam's razor you know if you have multiple theories that
*  explain the same phenomena the simplest one is a good bet to put most of your
*  credence on until you know better but also I just I think it's the natural
*  implication of being ever ready and at all you know like I try to make the
*  point that there's a big difference between living in a Hilbert space that
*  is infinite dimensional and finite dimensional if you are in an infinite
*  dimensional there's subtleties here that I can't go into now between there's
*  different levels of infinity countable and uncountable etc okay but a typical
*  quantum field theory you need to be given more information than just the
*  wave function you need to be given what are the observables of your theory okay
*  but I think that because of gravity we don't have an infinite number of
*  dimensions in Hilbert space and then you're not given the observables the
*  observables are just all the observables they're they're automatic there's no
*  extra information being attached to your theory and in that case I think you have
*  no choice but to take this mad dog ever ready an approach so I think is both
*  simpler and inevitable if you're gonna be ever ready and at all in the real
*  would be my answer George Astin says could you take a guess at what might be
*  needed to be discovered to get us one step closer to inertia negation or
*  dampening technology as seen in Star Trek and could the mechanisms behind
*  inertia negation potentially offer an alternative idea to dark matter for why
*  spiral galaxies don't spin apart no I don't think there is any such thing as
*  inertia negation or dampening and I don't think there's any such technology out
*  there to be discovered you know in fact I did a Twitter poll the other day a
*  few months ago actually you know what when hundreds of years have passed and
*  humanity is you know flying in spaceships all the time and they had
*  nostalgia night and they're looking at old science fiction movies from the
*  20th and 21st centuries what will be the most annoying thing to them the answer is
*  clearly artificial gravity because there's no way to make artificial
*  gravity except by spinning something like that there is just no known physics
*  that would make that happen and furthermore things are much more interesting
*  when you take into account the reality of the fact that you'd be in freefall
*  most of the time in a spaceship or you'd be pushed around by the acceleration
*  okay those are the only two choices and that's kind of interesting and you know
*  it's it's narratively interesting it does cost more money maybe to do the
*  special effects but the idea that you know in Star Trek we're just sitting on
*  the bridge as if we're in earth regular gravity but we're moving forward is just
*  crazy it's just lazy it's just nothing to do with what future physics is going
*  to let us do they do it we all know why they do it it's both sort of easier for
*  the budget for the show but also it's familiar right it's easy because we're
*  actually sitting on chairs on the ground to imagine that in spaceships the same
*  thing will be happening right not because it's true and not because we
*  have any prospect for technology in those directions just because it's
*  familiar and you know if you have enough unfamiliar things like tribbles
*  and and Vulcans why make things even weirder that's the basic idea it's not
*  because there's any hope for such technologies to really exist I mean
*  there's other things you can do to sort of fake it you could put magnets on
*  yourself or something like that but it's not inertia negation there is no such
*  thing Eric King says I am struck by the influence one's native language has on
*  how they view and understand the world around them my question to you is how
*  much do you think the language we use to describe science might affect our
*  ability to really understand it do you ever feel that language we use to
*  describe for instance quantum mechanics is holding us back from truly
*  understanding it I want to say yes and no you know if you listen to the podcast
*  I just released with Dean Bonamano we talked about my half-baked idea that the
*  human thinking human cognition has undergone undergone some sort of phase
*  transition where we can manipulate symbols and reason symbolically and
*  algorithmically so we become kind of Turing machine capable and at that
*  point even though your natural language does hold you back it is a handicap that
*  we can overcome right we can think our way out of that I mean sure I think that
*  not not only language but just our intuition of the world is an enormous
*  barrier to understanding quantum mechanics and other parts of theoretical
*  physics at a deep level we're just not trained to think that way or to reason
*  that way or to conceptualize that way and language is absolutely a part of it
*  but I don't think it holds us back in any fundamental way I think it just
*  makes it harder for us to do right it's not like a speed of light barrier it's
*  just like a hill we got a climb and I think that you know some of us are
*  trying to climb it Jessica Wolin says I just read City by Clifford Simek have
*  you read it it was written in the late 1940s and he describes what sounds like
*  multiverses was that a concept was that concept a thing in physics by then so I
*  haven't read it but I thought be fun to answer the question because I want to
*  say I don't know whether that was a thing in physics by then the idea of the
*  multiverse physicists are very bad in general at understanding their own
*  history and the history of the ideas they talk about my paying attention to
*  physics didn't really start until I was a kid in the 1970s and then a student in
*  the 1980s and the idea of the multiverse in the 1980s was just becoming popular
*  in physics and it was a combination of things it was inflationary cosmology
*  gave us a mechanism for potentially creating a multiverse the anthropic
*  principle trying to understand the cosmological constant gave us a
*  motivation for wanting there to be a multiverse and the landscape in string
*  theory was the idea that there could be different laws of physics in different
*  parts of the multiverse so that sort of gave us a mechanism for solving the
*  cosmological constant problem coupled with inflation etc so this whole stew of
*  ideas really made people think much more carefully about the multiverse in the in
*  the 1980s and 90s but you notice that all of these are driven by other ideas
*  so it's not I've said this before I'll keep saying it again it was not that
*  physicists in the 80s or 90s said wow like the multiverse wouldn't that be
*  cool like no one ever said that you are forced into thinking about it by other
*  ideas and then you try to take it seriously so of course Everett and the
*  many worlds interpretation came in 1950s but he didn't even call it the many
*  worlds interpretation that wasn't a label that got put on the theory until
*  1970 by Bryce DeWitt so I have no idea what people are thinking about in the
*  1940s I really don't and I say this because I would like to like it'd be
*  very interesting for someone to do a careful historical analysis of the
*  concept of the idea of the multiverse or maybe someone has and I just don't know
*  about it you know sometimes I point to this paper written by Boltzmann Ludwig
*  Boltzmann back in 1895 Boltzmann was trying to answer the question why was the
*  entropy the early universe low just like we were talking about just like I'm
*  still trying to answer that question right but over a hundred years ago and
*  he was a smart guy you know he just to put it in context Boltzmann and his
*  friends came up with statistical mechanics and their definition of
*  entropy and other things and their formulation of the second law back in
*  the 1870s and in the 1890s for some reasons which are a little bit obscure to
*  me sort of controversy flared up about it again and Boltzmann was responding
*  to criticisms by Zermelo Zermelo later became famous as a pure mathematician set
*  theory axioms right but he was criticizing Boltzmann and Boltzmann sort
*  of offered these different reasons why entropy might have been low in the early
*  universe the problem that we now know as the past hypothesis and Boltzmann
*  invented what we might call the multiverse and what we might call the
*  anthropic principle he said well if the universe was infinitely big he didn't
*  know about general relativity the Big Bang or anything like that so a static
*  eternal infinitely big universe filled with gas and dust and particles just
*  running around bumping into each other most of the time in most of the places
*  it would be in thermal equilibrium but occasionally there would be fluctuations
*  and the fluctuations would as Boltzmann says sometimes because you have
*  infinitely long to wait sometimes the the fluctuation would be so big as to
*  create our universe or at least our galaxy he didn't know there were other
*  galaxies right he there's a lot of things he didn't know in 1895 and so
*  Boltzmann says look in most of this huge collection we're in thermal equilibrium
*  and therefore dead you can't have life in thermal equilibrium but in these
*  little pockets where you randomly fluctuate into low entropy states that's
*  where you can have life and maybe that's us maybe that's what we do and this would
*  happen many times in many places so it's both the multiverse and the anthropic
*  principle because he's saying we're not going to find ourselves in the dead
*  places that are in thermal equilibrium now number one I don't know whether even
*  that analysis is correct because he was kind of ignoring gravity so I don't know
*  that things would actually just keep bumping into each other over and over
*  again I suspect that what would happen in that scenario is gravitational
*  instability and lumpy regions would just absorb all the matter and it would sit
*  there and empty out in between on progressively larger scales as time went
*  on forever so it would not remain uniformly distributed gravity is a
*  tricky thing when it comes to entropy but the other thing was of course his
*  scenario is entirely 100% a target of the Boltzmann brain problem and this
*  was pointed out years later by Eddington Arthur Eddington in the 1930s who pointed
*  out look look if that's if that were the world randomly fluctuating then we would
*  expect to live in the smallest possible fluctuation and what Eddington said was
*  it would just be one mathematical physicist that's all you would need
*  because he was a mathematical physicist so I don't know you know I don't know
*  where whether he whether anyone back then used the word multiverse or anything
*  like that I don't know whether these speculations by Eddington and others had
*  any impact on Clippard-Symek I just don't know I mean certainly science
*  fiction over the course of the 20th century had a lot of fun with alternate
*  timelines and alternate histories and things like that but I don't know the
*  Andrew Vernon Smith says are there scientific studies ongoing concerning
*  where quantum physics and neurobiology or psychology merge where choice is
*  consciously made in a human brain and observations deliberately collected by
*  scientific instruments each collapse the wave function respectively at the choice
*  made and state observed I am not sure what exactly you have in mind by that
*  last part of the sentence you know it to my mind wave functions collapse when
*  quantum systems decohere when they become entangled with their environment
*  it could be so the question is how does that happen typically you know we talked
*  about the neutron going through the magnetic field but you still need the
*  neutron to interact with something and typically decoherence happens when you
*  take that quantum superposition and you amplify it to something macroscopic
*  right so people in quantum mechanics talk about pointer states of macroscopic
*  systems when you literally have a little dial with a pointer on it saying oh the
*  neutron went up or the neutron went down and then photons will interact with that
*  pointer differently photons in the environment and that causes decoherence
*  so a human choice you know as I've said in something deeply hidden and elsewhere
*  there's nothing about choices that collapse the wave function except when
*  a choice depends on some quantum event in your brain so you know some chemical
*  reaction happened or didn't happen because of quantum mechanics and
*  therefore in one branch of the wave function you had pizza and the other
*  had you had Chinese food right so that would count as decoherence but you don't
*  know you don't know when you make a decision whether or not it depended on
*  some quantum event in your brain and typically it doesn't typically it's
*  entirely classical so there's no usual strong connection between making
*  decisions and branching the wave function there is a question you can ask
*  about is there any way in which the brain is explicitly depending on the
*  rules of quantum mechanics that is to say not just obeying the rules of
*  classical mechanics very famously Roger Penrose and others have thought about
*  ways that could be true there's not a lot of support for those ideas in the
*  physics community but you never know there are experiments going on maybe
*  they'll find it someday there is an idea due to Matthew Fisher who is a condensed
*  matter physicist at UC Santa Barbara at the KITP the Cobb Lee Institute for
*  Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara his idea which actually I'm very very fond
*  of because I totally had this idea myself but I didn't know enough about
*  either quantum mechanics or condensed matter physics to make it real and
*  Matthew did so he made it real the idea is that you can have elements atoms in
*  your brain that are part of neurons whose energy can depend on whether the
*  nuclei of the atoms are entangled in different ways for some reason it's
*  phosphorus I think that Matthew Fisher pointed out is something that maybe
*  could be relevant so you need to shield it from a million other different
*  forces and that's exactly why I didn't have myself the knowledge to do this
*  well but he he's he suggests he hypothesizes that there are conditions
*  where neurons in the brain could have their energies dependent on quantum
*  entanglement now that has nothing to do with branching the wave function or
*  consciousness or anything like that but it is possible just as it's possible
*  that entanglement is useful in photosynthesis it's possible that quantum
*  effects are important in the brain I think that's something we're still
*  studying right now Adam C says I currently find the terms populism or
*  populist anti-democratic and elitist the Google definition is a politician who
*  strives to appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are
*  disregarded by established elite groups to me this sounds like a definition of
*  democracy shouldn't all political candidates in a democracy strive for
*  this ideal well yeah I mean words like populism and populist are contentious
*  different people will apply them in different ways and I think that you know
*  the Google definition you have there is fine but the but the important part of
*  it is not just doing what the people want it's specifically this contrast
*  being set up between ordinary people and elite groups right that's really where
*  most that's usually what is being implied by the label populist and that
*  sounds fair enough right ordinary people elite groups which side are you going to
*  be on but if you go back into the very early days of the podcast I interviewed
*  Yasha Monk about liberal democracy and populism and things like that and the
*  case he makes which I think is at least plausible is that in practice all the
*  effort is going into defining what you mean by the ordinary people right you
*  know if you think about the actual populists that have been either
*  They very very often get their oomph by defining the ordinary people in
*  contrast not with the elites but with some other outsiders right here's the
*  in-group here's the outside group it could be foreigners it could be
*  minority groups within the society or whatever so in practice the theory goes
*  populism is really about dividing people rather than uniting people and of course
*  I do actually think that there's a real problem in modern democracy with
*  responsiveness to people on the part of the elites I'm not quite sure how to
*  deal with that but there's but I also think there's an absolutely very very
*  real danger in demonizing the other whether it's foreigners or minority
*  members or whatever and that's the danger in my mind to populism very very
*  often it's a step towards right out authoritarianism right you claim to be
*  the voice of the people you repress other voices and then you abrogate
*  power to yourself that's that's something that happens over and over
*  again there's no doubt it's something we have to watch out for
*  Anders Hechter says in the big picture and in the interview with Neda Engelhardt
*  you describe conservation of information as the state of a system and what we
*  know about it but that is sort of a state of affairs of the system it's
*  aboutness of the state how about the state as such would you say the
*  information only exists in relation to thinking beings or does it have an
*  existence independent of any biology so you know as usual I can't exactly
*  remember what I say at every time so the information when we talk about
*  conservation of information we are not talking about what we know
*  about it in any sense whatsoever information is conserved whether or not
*  we know about it the information in the sense of conservation of information is
*  you can think of it if you want as a counterfactual idea all of the
*  information you would need to know to follow the dynamics of the system to
*  predict the dynamics of the system under the laws of physics so it's really
*  complete information that you would need complete information that is there in
*  the system whether you have it or not okay so Laplace's demon has access to
*  all the information but you don't that's okay the information is still there
*  that's the information that is conserved so it has nothing to do with
*  living beings biology anything like that in that sense of course the word
*  information like many other words is used in different senses by different
*  people at different times but that's what it means in that context Chris
*  Fotash says in the first mindscape episode I listened to a couple of years
*  ago you spoke about how the largest possible number allowed by some physics
*  law I think you referred to Hilbert space and it was something like 10 to the
*  power of a few hundreds if my memory is right the question would be is there a
*  hard physical value to infinity so to refresh your memory it's not the maximum
*  number it's not the biggest number that we're talking about here what we're
*  talking about is the size of Hilbert space so Hilbert space is David Hilbert
*  is the mathematician who it's named after Hilbert space is a particular kind
*  of vector space where you can take dot products but instead of being
*  two-dimensional or three-dimensional it's a vector space that is some number
*  of dimensions there's different numbers of Hilbert spaces you have a
*  two-dimensional Hilbert space three-dimensional four-dimensional etc
*  quantum mechanics says that the state of the universe is a vector in Hilbert
*  space I referred to my paper earlier called reality as a vector in Hilbert
*  space and the question is how many dimensions does Hilbert space have does
*  the Hilbert space describing the universe have and we think I think some
*  people think that our observable universe can be described as a vector
*  or a matrix in a finite dimensional Hilbert space but a big dimension the
*  dimensionality we throw around is something like 10 to the power 10 to
*  the power 120 that's the number that you're thinking of probably but that's
*  not a physical limit to infinity so it's the number of different possible things
*  that can happen in the world very very roughly speaking number of different
*  states the universe can be in number of different distinguishable states the
*  universe can be in in some sense but I can write down numbers much bigger than
*  that if you know I can write down the number 10 to the power 10 to the 10 to
*  the 10 to the 10 way bigger than the dimensionality of Hilbert space I could
*  never write down all the zeros in that numbers on of atoms in the universe to
*  do it but I can imagine those numbers so all of which is to say there is a very
*  interesting question about the foundations of mathematics whether or
*  not you need infinity there was a movement I think in the early 20th
*  century of finite ism maybe it was the late 19th century to really see whether
*  or not we could just get rid of like all of the difficulties in the philosophy of
*  math and the foundations of set theory and all these things deal with infinities
*  in some way infinity is really where you get into trouble and it's easy to
*  imagine infinity right you just say well I have one and two and three and four and
*  five and I keep going I never stop so there's an infinite number of whole
*  numbers but maybe you don't need to and maybe maybe maybe maybe there is a
*  relationship between that idea and physics there's no necessary
*  relationship but maybe the physical world doesn't require an infinite number
*  of numbers or a well-established notion of infinity to make sense of it honestly
*  I don't know that's beyond my pay grade even in Hilbert space there's even if
*  there's an infinite number of sorry even if there are an infinite number of
*  distinguishable states orthogonal states perpendicular states there's still an
*  infinite number of vectors they're just almost aligned with each other most of
*  them so it still there's an infinite number of states the universe could be
*  in so I really don't know what to make of that I'm not the person to ask sorry
*  about that Stephen Bernard says topics and questions at the bleeding edge of
*  physics invoke hypotheses that are either in principle or in any reasonable
*  foreseeable practice unobservable my philosophical question is what is your
*  opinion of the epistemological weight of such hypotheses and how much work can
*  they be expected to do are they to be taken as seriously as experimentally
*  falsifiable ones well if you want a slightly more detailed answer I did
*  write a paper called beyond falsifiability where I talked a little
*  bit about this issue you know I'm not especially an expert or interested in
*  the philosophy of the practice of science so I think these are interesting
*  important questions but it's not my kind of specialty my kind of expertise so I
*  can't I can't really offer you a definitive answer here but I think that
*  what you can observe is overrated when it comes to judging scientific theories
*  because you can have unobservable things whose existence or absence affects how
*  we think about observable things right so quarks are individually unobservable
*  what they affect how we think about observable things virtual particles are
*  even more unobservable but they play a role in explaining observable phenomena
*  so something like the multiverse the cosmological multiverse where you have
*  regions of space very very far away where conditions are very very different
*  does that does the existence or non-existence of those other parts of
*  the universe play a role in how we think about the observable universe well if
*  something like the cosmological constant the vacuum energy of empty space is not
*  determined by some as yet unknown but perfectly deterministic laws of physics
*  and is instead just different from place to place in the multiverse then our job
*  as scientists is very different depending on those two options right what
*  kind of ways you think about the cosmological constants does depend on
*  that issue therefore you need to take it epistemologically seriously right even
*  if you can't see them outside or not in the case of the many worlds
*  interpretation of quantum mechanics the formalism says there are other worlds
*  other branches of the wave function where different experimental results
*  happened we will never see them but they play a role in the formalism that we have
*  to explain what we do see so I think that's a much better criterion to use
*  then what you can directly see falsify etc remember you don't falsify predictions
*  there are plenty of predictions that are completely unfalsifiable but yet you
*  believe them you falsify theories once you can falsify a theory then it's a good
*  thing to think about it scientifically but that theory might have specific
*  predictions that are unfalsifiable I shouldn't bother you at all
*  Andrew Vickersdaff says what future discovery or observation would increase
*  or decrease the credence of many worlds compared to other foundational theories
*  of quantum mechanics right so speaking of which you know look many worlds says
*  there is a wave function or a state vector it evolves all the time under the
*  Schrodinger equation so all you need to do to falsify the many worlds
*  interpretation is to do an experiment where the wave function does not obey
*  the Schrodinger equation these experiments are ongoing Roger Penrose
*  makes predictions that we should see them right there's other theories of
*  objective collapses that says we should see them so that's just one way also you
*  could find evidence for dynamical variables other than the wave function
*  because those don't exist in many worlds so it's plenty of ways in which you
*  could experimentally do these things they're hard experiments to do and they
*  may never converge on anything but you know they're there in principle if you
*  care about the philosophy of it rather than the practice of it there's zero
*  question that many worlds is completely 100% super duper falsifiable Victor
*  Yakin says can you envision a set of conditions for a simplified Laplace's
*  demon experiment where many variables are controlled but with sufficient
*  computing power and knowledge of initial conditions so we can accurately
*  predict the actions of a human for a short period of time no I cannot humans
*  are very very complicated you know and not only of order a hundred billion
*  neurons in our head but of order what hundreds of trillions of connections
*  between those neurons and neurons are not individually simple neurons are kind
*  of complicated so no even measuring where all the different pieces are would
*  be impossible much less actually calculating what all those pieces within
*  do so no worries about that in my mind Carlos Nunes says what do you think
*  about the following moral realist argument morality concerns the well-being
*  of conscious creatures and if we want to maximize their well-being we have to
*  take into account the biological constraints of said creatures that is
*  to say that there are some moral facts about as humans and primates in general
*  which result from our evolutionary history so sorry Carlos but I don't
*  think that's a very good argument at all it is full of wild non sequiturs sorry
*  about that so morality concerns the well-being of conscious creatures sure
*  that's just a definition right I mean that's just what you mean by the word
*  like if there weren't any conscious creatures there wouldn't be any morality
*  that's fine but then you say and if we want to maximize their well-being well
*  wait hold on who says that we want to maximize their well-being that's not
*  implicit in the definition of well-being or morality or anything else that is one
*  particular possible moral axiom that you might want to defend other people don't
*  think that our job should be to maximize the well-being of conscious creatures
*  maybe maximizing the overall well-being is something that would hurt some people
*  really badly while it helps other people and so they don't want to do that I think
*  personally just the idea that there is something to maximize that there is
*  something called the aggregate well-being that we can measure and
*  quantify is wildly wrong personally so that's just a leap that is completely
*  impermissible and then you say we have to take into account the biological
*  constraints of said creatures sure no one ever has argued that science has no
*  impact on how we go about being moral like that would be a crazy argument
*  there's an argument that says that science doesn't determine morality that
*  morality is not part of science but science describes the real world if you
*  want to be moral in the real world you have to take science into account
*  obviously and then you say that is to say that there are some moral facts and
*  about humans which result from our evolutionary history so no that is not
*  sorry that is not to say that the idea that you have to take into account
*  biological constraints does not lead clearly to there are moral facts that
*  result from our evolutionary history that that again that there's just a huge
*  leap there you know there are constraints but they don't lead to
*  moral facts they don't tell you what is right and what's wrong they tell you
*  that if you know what is right and what is wrong from some other reasons then
*  you have to take into account biological constraints and achieving them right so
*  it's just way more you know let me back up a little bit this is not hard this is
*  not controversial like no sensible person thinks that you can derive moral
*  facts from pure logic that you drive it from somewhere maybe like I don't think
*  you can drive them from anywhere in any objective way but you need extra input
*  somewhere like I had Russ Schaefer Landau was one of the world's leading
*  moral realists on the podcast and he thinks that it's our intuitions that
*  give us some insight into what the moral facts are but you have to get them from
*  somewhere they don't just appear from nowhere in particular well I'm not
*  going to go into particular you've heard me talk about this before I read I wrote
*  a book called the big picture where I talk about this and I've written many
*  blog posts so those are my feelings personally Michael Edelman says several
*  episodes back you said half ingest something like maybe game theory is just
*  physics given all the mathematical patterns that pop up across all matter
*  of systems and structures do you think that tells us something interesting and
*  deep about the way the universe is structured well I don't I can't say that
*  I think that right now because I'm not sure or even especially confident that
*  game theory is just physics so what I meant by that statement was you know game
*  theory is a way of determining certain strategies for certain formal games
*  under certain conditions right like given certain payoff structures what
*  should individual actors in the game do that's what game theory tells you how to
*  do what I meant by saying maybe it's just physics is that kind of
*  optimization problem is something that we're familiar with from physics in
*  other contexts you know it's all the time happening the different physical
*  systems optimize something the principle of least action says that individual
*  particles minimize their action when you have statistical mechanics or
*  thermodynamics systems go to equilibrium where they maximize their
*  entropy things like that right so I'm just wondering out loud whether or not
*  there is some more formal connection between these physical systems that we
*  know optimize maximize minimize something and the search for strategies
*  in game theory but I don't know that it's true so I haven't done that yet I'm
*  thinking about it I don't know I would probably guess it's not true in a useful
*  way like maybe there's some very formal analogy there but I don't necessarily
*  see that there's going to be some useful analogy those are a different thing okay
*  bread Goldberg says you often stress that in quantum field theory fields
*  represent a deeper more complete concept than particles however standard first
*  quantized string theory looks more like a theory of fundamental particles zipping
*  around where subsystems are not arranged into a nearest neighbor structure by
*  analogy to quantum field theory and relativistic quantum mechanics do you
*  think that the string fields of string field theory are a relatively deeper
*  more comprehensive formalism of the theory than first quantize strings so
*  for those of you who are not experts the idea here is the following we know about
*  quantum field theory quantum field theory is the best current empirically
*  successful way we have of understanding the world around us experimentally and
*  physics and so forth you need quantum field theory to have
*  particles created and destroyed obey the rules of relativity all that stuff so
*  even though you might have thought back in the day I don't know the 1920s that
*  you could make a theory of particles actually Richard Feynman thought this in
*  the 40s so he but you know that's okay you make hypotheses didn't work out so
*  Feynman was hoping that his little Feynman diagrams would enable us to get
*  rid of quantum field theory we could just talk about particles right to sum
*  up the effective an infant number of particles that's better than doing a
*  field that's what he thought doesn't really work that way the truth is that
*  the particles and five and diagrams are vibrations of quantum fields okay the
*  fields are more fundamental now in string theory as Brad says the usual way
*  that string theory is formulated is more like particles than fields so you talk
*  about individual vibrating strings just like you would talk about individual
*  particles and you do Feynman diagrams with them and that is your theory okay
*  you might therefore by analogy say well what you really want is a string field
*  and maybe that would give you deeper insights into the dynamics or nature of
*  string theory and people have tried that Ed Witten has made important
*  contributions here Murray Gelman and Barton Svibach wrote papers about string
*  field theory but it's never really caught on in the same way that quantum
*  field theory replaced point particles in some way and honestly Brad I do not
*  know enough about it to say why not again people have tried and but it's
*  just not really operationally panned out to be that useful or that insightful or
*  whatever is that because it's not there is it because string theory really is a
*  theory of individual strings rather than fields that are collections of strings
*  or is it just we human beings haven't been smart enough to think about it in
*  the right way I really don't know I did do a little bit of thinking about it I
*  thought about what you might call classical string theory but I never
*  wrote any paper or anything like that about it it would certainly be
*  mathematically complicated so I you know one of the possible options is people
*  like me have like tried it and thought about it and go yeah that's too
*  complicated it's not like I think about anymore I have other things that I can
*  think about so I'm not a string theorist professionally so I'm not really the one
*  to ask but my impression is working string theorists don't really think that
*  much about string field theory and I'm not exactly sure what reason they would
*  give okay now I'm gonna combine two questions here Greg says special
*  relativity says that the speed of light is invariant for all observers in
*  inertial reference frames but I'm confused about whether this is an
*  assumption an experimental result a law of nature or a logical consequence of
*  other things we're sure of in physics and Brian Carbone says I understand that
*  the speed that photons travel in a vacuum arises from the magnetic and
*  electric constants which are fundamental parameters of the universe I also
*  understand the geometric argument from special relativity that there must be a
*  maximum speed at which things can travel my question is why is this maximum speed
*  for everything also the exact speed of which electromagnetic waves propagate and
*  not some other speed why is the speed of neutrinos etc seemingly limited by
*  electromagnetic constraints so both of these are about you know what is the
*  nature of the speed of light in modern physics and so to Greg's question is
*  it's actually kind of a nice framing of it he says I'm confused about whether
*  this is an assumption experimental result a law of nature or a logical
*  consequence of other things and the answer is it's all those so the thing I
*  think that the the hidden question that is being begged here is is physics as
*  we understand it or as we will understand it or should understand it
*  some kind of axiomatic system where we start with the most foundational
*  statements and then build everything on top of them or not and you know for
*  individual the answer is that for individual physical theories you can
*  very often write down a set of axioms and derive the theory from it for general
*  relativity or special relativity or quantum field theory or whatever but you
*  can also very often write down an entirely different looking set of
*  axioms and derive the same theory from it and if when that is possible to do
*  arguing over which are the right axioms or the right sort of foundational pieces
*  for whatever you're trying to do is not always a useful use of your time
*  productive use of your time in other words I think that the right way to
*  think about theories in physics is not as there's a foundational set of axioms
*  and we derive everything from them it's a little bit more holistic than that
*  right there's a set of statements that are true and they're all true and it's
*  not like some that are truer than others once you have a well-defined physical
*  theory and you can choose different ways that some of them can be derived from
*  others etc but the whole thing fits together it's more like a web than a
*  hierarchy where you start with the bottom level and build everything on
*  top of that bottom level so the fact that the speed of light is invariant for
*  all inertial for all inertial observers by the way it's not inertial observers
*  it's just invariant no matter what you don't need to be in an inertial
*  reference frame the laws of physics are invariant for all inertial observers is
*  maybe what you have in mind but the speed of light is constant for everybody
*  so is that an assumption or a logical consequence of other things either way
*  you can do it either way so it's it's I think it's a slight change of shift about
*  how you think about the role of these sorts of statements is it an
*  experimental result also yes it certainly is also an experimental
*  result and for Brian's question you know what about the other things right like
*  gravitons and things like that why are they limited by the speed of light I
*  mean you I think you're sort of I can see in the way that you phrase the
*  question you're almost there you're almost grasping it the point is there is
*  a speed limit right that's the point of special relativity there's a speed limit
*  there are light cones as we call them the fact that light electromagnetic
*  waves or photons or however you want to think about light the fact that light
*  happens to move at the speed limit is much much less important than the fact
*  that there is a speed limit after all light doesn't move at the speed limit if
*  it's like moving through water or air or something like that it's only moves at
*  the speed limit in vacuum so what you have is a system where there is a speed
*  limit a maximum speed a limiting velocity and then you say well what
*  kinds of things move at that velocity and which kinds of things move slower
*  and the answer is from a particle point of view massless particles move at that
*  speed massive particles move slower than that so really all you're asking is why
*  are photons massless just like gravitons are massless and the answer is because
*  of symmetries in the deep-down laws of physics that give them their mass or
*  actually symmetries to prevent them from getting mass it's a better way of saying
*  it and I can't give you an airtight argument for why massless particles
*  move at the speed of light but there's an intuitive argument for sort of why it
*  makes sense if you have a massive particle you can always consider that
*  particle in its rest frame right a particle moves slower than the speed of
*  light you can always change your own speed so you are at rest with respect
*  to that particle and then you can ask how much energy does it have and the
*  answer is equals MC squared that's the energy in a particle in its rest frame
*  if it's moving faster it's moving at a non-zero velocity then it has more
*  energy that's kinetic energy as well as rest energy right but a particle that is
*  at rest has a minimum energy that's its rest energy that's what the formula E
*  equals MC squared tells you and then the way to think about what mass is from
*  this point of view is how much energy does a particle have when it's at rest
*  okay so every particle that has a non-zero mass has to be able to be at
*  rest to define that and therefore the other way around every particle that can
*  be at rest has a mass and vice versa and so the particles that can be at rest or
*  the particles that have mass if you always move at the speed of light then
*  you can never be at rest by the definition by that's those are the rules
*  of special relativity particles that things move the speed of light always
*  move at the speed of light so things that move at the speed of light don't
*  have a rest mass therefore they are massless that's what we say they still
*  have energy but all their energy comes from their motion rather than from their
*  rest mass so hopefully that gives a little bit of intuition there
*  Alexander Freund says in discussing entanglement I've heard you refer to a
*  degree or extent of entanglement for example the two particles are very
*  entangled or slightly entangled what exactly does this refer to my basic
*  intuition is that two particles are either entangled or they are not nope
*  that's a bad intuition to have so think about you know two particles that might
*  be entangled let's say two particles that have a spin right so spin up spin
*  down there's two particles there's Alice's particle and Bob's particle and
*  if you think about how they're entangled usually you're given an example
*  something like you're in a superposition of both particles are spin up plus both
*  particles are spin down right that's an entangled superposition such that if you
*  measure the spin of one and it's up you instantly know the other spin is up also
*  sometimes by the way it's their opposite but it doesn't matter it could be
*  oppositely entangled or entangled the same way so long as they're entangled but
*  that is a particular superposition right there's another state that the particles
*  can be in where they're both just spin up right if both particles are just 100
*  that is not entangled even though they're related to each other you don't learn
*  anything about one particle by measuring the other one because you already knew
*  that the both particles were spin up so if you measure one and see it spin up
*  you don't learn anything about the other one okay so that other superposition up
*  up plus down down that's maximally entangled because secretly what we're
*  not telling you but what is true is that Pythagoras's theorem is that at work
*  here right this superposition has coefficients so it's a times both
*  particles up plus B times both particles are down with the rule a squared plus B
*  squared equals one because they have to their squares need to sum to one that's
*  Pythagoras's theorem so it's really if it's an equal superposition it's 1 over
*  the square root of 2 up up plus 1 over the square root of 2 down down that
*  gives you a unit vector whereas if you just have up up and nothing else then
*  it's 1 times up up and once you realize that once you put back the numbers in
*  that people like me usually hide from you in popular level discussions you
*  realize the numbers could be any two numbers that whose squares add to one so
*  the first the up up could have a coefficient the square root of 0.99 and
*  the down down could have a coefficient the square root of 0.01 okay that is a
*  superposition but it's almost the same as just having it all be up up so that
*  is a slightly entangled superposition if you went all the way so it's only up up
*  it's not entangled at all and it becomes more and more entangled as the two terms
*  up up and down down go from being 1 comma 0 to being 1 over square root of 2
*  1 over square root of 2 so you can have any amount of entanglement from 0 to
*  maximal. Lewis Sweru says are life forms entropy reducing systems so I have I'm
*  tempted to say have you ever met a life form most life forms I know are not
*  entropy reducing systems no in fact every life form I know is not an entropy
*  reducing systems it's the other way around life forms are necessarily
*  entropy increasing systems if we include the entropy of everything the entropy of
*  the universe as a whole what life forms do is they take in low entropy energy
*  from the universe whether it's sunlight for photosynthesis or food for animals
*  or something like that and they increase its entropy they extract energy from it
*  by degrading that energy by converting that energy into waste heat with higher
*  entropy and that is how these organisms maintain themselves repair themselves
*  metabolize and do all the things that they do so life is just another way to
*  increase the entropy of the universe from some point of view James Maddux
*  says the Planck length and Planck time are supposed to represent a scale where
*  quantum gravity becomes important I've also heard that they may represent the
*  quanta of space and time and the size of the smallest black hole but aren't they
*  just constructed by combining constants of nature until the units work out how
*  sure are we that these exact values have physical significance I think it's a
*  really good question because the answer is we're a little bit less sure that you
*  might think from what people say so on the one hand you're completely correct
*  that these units Planck length etc. are just constructed from other laws of
*  physics right it's numerology in some sense but on the other hand physicists
*  are trained to sort of have expectations about when different effects become
*  important when you travel near the speed of light you expect special
*  relativity to become important when the gravitational force the gravitational
*  constant is similar in magnitude to other things going on in your system you
*  might expect gravity to become important when the action of your system is close
*  to H bar thanks constant you might expect quantum mechanics become important
*  etc. and so on so the fact that when people say quantum gravity becomes
*  important at the Planck scale that is the expectation of physicists it's just
*  a rough back-of-the-envelope kind of expectation in fact in string theory
*  there is something called the string scale which is not the same as the
*  Planck scale but is close it is a dimensionless number times the Planck
*  scale and so in string theory stringy effects become important a little bit
*  earlier than the Planck scale that you might hit so the point is we don't think
*  we know the once-and-for-all theory of quantum gravity but when we do we expect
*  that intrinsically quantum gravitational effects will become important at around
*  the Planck scale the specific theory might tell us that the actual time or
*  regime or parameters for which they become important is a little bit
*  different if it were very different that would require some extra physical
*  mechanism right and indeed large extra dimensions of space-time would provide
*  such a mechanism gravity can become much important important way before what we
*  know as the Planck scale so we don't know if there are we haven't found any
*  large extra dimension so that's still the Planck scale is still our best bet
*  Ludwig Schubert says Wikipedia tells me that we are in the middle of the
*  stelliferous era a time period in the existence of the universe during which
*  new stars are still being formed does this mean the Sun burning out shouldn't
*  worry us too much because we can expect new stars to form for another one to a
*  hundred trillion years that would sound like really good news to me suggesting
*  most of the useful lifespan of the universe is still ahead of us well the
*  big I don't know why you're worried even if it were just the Sun it would still
*  be a few billion more years so I'm not quite sure what exactly your anxiety is
*  coming from certainly you and I will not be around to worry about these things
*  and now you might I get it I mean you might want life to exist for as long as
*  possible but you know let's be a little bit realistic here we don't know what
*  form life is going to be in or take or adopt even a million years from now much
*  less a billion or a trillion years from now so I mean to actually answer your
*  question yes stars are still forming in some galaxies star formation is more or
*  less over roughly speaking elliptical galaxies are done forming stars that's
*  not a hundred percent true because stars explode and and put out gas and dust
*  into the regime into the space around them and then more stars can form from
*  that but spiral galaxies are the ones that still have ambient interstellar gas
*  and dust and you can still form more stars whereas ellipticals are sort of
*  used up all their gas and dust but there's a cycle like you say stars
*  explode they expel gas and dust into the interstellar medium and you can form more
*  stars so yes there will be a long time we believe in front of us in the future
*  where more stars are still formed now there are details like even if you want
*  to say well forget about technology and civilizations and stuff like that will
*  the next generation of stars be appropriate for forming life around them
*  so will the next generation of stars have the same kind of solar systems and
*  planets the current stars have I don't know I mean probably but honestly I
*  don't know so I think that it's it's certainly plausible to me that stars
*  like the Sun solar systems like ours will form on into the future for a long
*  time but I actually don't know like maybe they're all much lower mass stars
*  maybe they burn a long time but don't burn very brightly I just don't know
*  there's a my point is only that there are a lot of details that go into these
*  kinds of questions they're not easy ones to answer Peter Bamber says from
*  the outside the United States looks like a strange country with an insane
*  attitudes to guns in many states and many other unique things baseball is
*  American exceptionalism as clear from within as it is from without and how do
*  you feel about it so I think the phrase American exceptionalism isn't the right
*  one to use here you mean something like American American particularity or
*  something like that strangeness uniqueness exceptionalism is a phrase
*  used by pro-American people to say that America is better than everywhere else
*  and that's that's one issue a different issue is is America forgetting about
*  better or worse is it just different from everywhere else you know and these
*  are always hard questions to answer because I think that almost every
*  quest every country is unique in its own ways right the United States did have
*  a unique position in the world for the last roughly century okay not maybe not
*  entirely a century of being the most powerful technologically advanced and
*  richest country okay a century is not that long historically speaking and
*  there's zero guarantee that that kind of condition extends into the future as we
*  all know so China is an obvious example of a country that very well could
*  the United States in technology wealth all those things but being in that
*  position does you know allow a country to start patting itself on the back and
*  treating itself as special I'm sure the countries throughout history have done
*  that I'm sure the Roman Empire did that back in the Roman Empire ruling the
*  world days I'm sure China did that in its Empire days etc so you know I don't
*  know I'm not that I'm not that surprised or struck by it the other thing is that
*  that is is worth mentioning is that America is big as a country you know we
*  are we literally have two borders one with Mexico one with Canada and many
*  many people in the United States don't live anywhere near one of those
*  borders and the Canadian border which is much longer is with one with the country
*  that also speaks English and came from sort of the same predecessors colonial
*  past as we did so unlike people in many other countries we're not constantly
*  visiting other countries constantly being exposed to cultures from other
*  countries constantly sharing resources and things like that you know there's no
*  European Union in North America like that kind of thing so it's a different
*  kind of expectation like you know there's plenty of Americans who have
*  never left America or don't really want to whereas there's not that many French
*  or German people at least that the fraction is smaller let's put it that
*  way so if you live in Europe then you know experiencing other countries and
*  getting to know them is just much more part of your everyday expectation than
*  if you live in America and you know none of this is right or wrong every country
*  has its good parts its bad parts etc it's just hard to judge other countries
*  or your own country objectively so I don't like to go too far in these
*  comparisons. Sandro Stucchi says my friend Max and I thoroughly enjoyed your
*  discussion with Justin Clark Doane as it sparked an interesting discussion among
*  us and our colleagues during the discussion Max raised the following
*  point if we can be pluralists about mathematical and moral theories and
*  truths can we be pluralists about realism itself or is there some
*  objectively unique and true meaning of the word real so I can only give you my
*  opinion here we don't know these are the kinds of questions where you know it
*  could be very very wrong at the at the deepest level but I don't think it's
*  analogous actually I am a reality realist I think that whatever there is
*  whatever the real world is there is something that it is right there's
*  something that it is uniquely the real world now we might eventually find out
*  that there are different ways of talking about the real world I mean there
*  clearly are different ways of talking about the real world at different levels
*  of approximation right there are emergent higher level descriptions there
*  might even be different ways of talking about the real world at the single
*  fundamental level you know as a as some kind of analogy in classical mechanics
*  those of you who are either physics educated or have taken my big pictures
*  in the universe videos you can think about just classical mechanics in a
*  Newtonian language where there are particles and they're being pushed
*  around by forces or you can think about it in a Hamiltonian language where
*  momentum is just as real and fundamental as position is it's not just arrived
*  it's a separate independent quantity or you can think about it from a Lagrangian
*  point of view where you have the action which is defined over the whole
*  trajectory of the particle and that is what gives you the motion of the
*  particle so ontologically these sound like very different choices for what is
*  real and what is fundamental but they describe exactly the same physical
*  theory so I'm very open to that I'm very open to the possibility that reality can
*  be described at the most fundamental level in very different ways but I don't
*  even know what it would mean to say that reality is different then what then you
*  know I think we all live in the same reality I think there is a unique world
*  in which we live I think we discover things about it in a very contingent
*  slow approximate fallible way but I think that there is a reality there I
*  know that not everyone agrees with that but I'm honestly not even clear what it
*  could mean for that not to be true we seem to share the same world in a very
*  real way so that's where I'm voting until there's good evidence otherwise
*  Daniela Cortese says could it be that libertarian free will appears to be
*  incompatible with the laws of physics because it cannot be captured by
*  mathematics I mean suppose that it is real how would we express it in the
*  equations of physics so I think there's something that you're getting your
*  finger on that I'm very sympathetic with here so the lack of libertarian free
*  will can be re-expressed as saying that human beings just obey the laws of
*  physics okay we have no way of being a law unto ourselves just being a person
*  and an agent does not give us in any sense the ability to override what the
*  rules of the core theory tell us that our atoms and particles should be doing
*  that's non libertarian free will so what is the alternative I mean we call it
*  libertarian free will but what does it mean really like what would it be does
*  it mean there are other equations that govern the choices people make but
*  they're not the laws of physics does it mean that there are no equations at all
*  and what would that mean like even if even if human behavior was
*  unpredictable presumably you could still come up with a probability measure and
*  say well there's a probability of certain things happen and a probability
*  they don't certain actions are taken by certain agents and conscious creatures
*  after all that's just what we do in quantum mechanics right we still call it
*  the law of physics so I'm a little concerned that there isn't any good
*  definition of what you would mean by libertarian free will but it doesn't
*  bother me that much because I don't believe in libertarian free will so I'm
*  kind of not worried about this it reminds me of when we had back in 2012
*  when I organized the moving naturalism forward workshop and so the idea was get
*  a bunch of naturalists in the same room and rather than debating with theists or
*  religious people try to work on the questions that we had amongst ourselves
*  which are multiple and people got stuck right at the beginning trying to define
*  what naturalism is and I was like you know don't don't spend our time doing
*  that because it is hard to define but it's only hard to define because you
*  don't know what supernaturalism is like naturalism makes perfect sense there are
*  laws of physics and there's there's stuff and it obeys the laws of physics
*  that's naturalism right supernaturalism is hard to define but who cares we're
*  naturalists we don't need to worry about that I feel the same way about
*  libertarian free will okay we have I think yeah we have a whole bunch of
*  questions that I'm grouping together so let me just read all these questions and
*  then riff on what the answers are deep the Amarasa Ria says how do
*  conservation laws fit into the many worlds interpretation Rob Greiber says
*  how does an ever many worlds interpretation reconcile with the
*  conservation of matter and energy do matter energy multiply to fill each new
*  world Douglas log says why is the creation of a new world not a violation
*  of information traveling faster than light Joseph Tungredi says it would seem
*  according to the many worlds interpretation that our world is not
*  just the splitter from which other worlds emerge but also a continuous
*  split II can our world simultaneously split from more than one trunk world
*  and can we deduce that there was an original trunk version of the universe
*  from which all the other worlds split sir Raj Rajan says can you clarify the
*  many worlds explanation for the double slit experiment I got a bit confused
*  after you mentioned the last AMA about both being in the same branch of the
*  wave function and Jeff B finally says the branching of the wave function makes
*  sense to me when talking about a simple two-state system like spin but there is
*  a conceptual challenge extending this to position measurements in order to make
*  things make sense like the double slit experiment we need to think of the wave
*  function as a superposition of each possible position of the particle but
*  is there a philosophical explanation for why the wave function chooses to
*  decompose itself in this way so specifically as a superposition of
*  position rather than different kinds of things okay so these are not all the
*  same question certainly but they're all in the world if you will of many worlds
*  and branching and what defines branches and how does that remain compatible
*  with things we know like conservation laws so let me let me just discuss a
*  little bit what is meant by the branching and then we can go into the
*  conservation laws so remember as we just discussed a little bit ago in many
*  worlds the fundamental way we describe the world is as a vector it's a vector
*  in some super duper high dimensional vector space called Hilbert space okay
*  and what is really happening when you branch the wave function is that you can
*  always write a vector as the sum of two other vectors right if I ever write to
*  just draw an arrow in some direction I can always decompose that arrow into the
*  sum of two arrows 45 degrees away from it right 45 degrees on either side and
*  each of the shorter arrows has one over the square root of 2 the length of a
*  longer one and I can add them together to get the longer one and in a much
*  higher dimensional vector space I can do that over and over and over again so I
*  can write any vector as the sum of a huge number of other vectors each one of
*  which is very tiny right so I can make a big vector by adding up little vectors
*  to get the big one so that's all just math that's all just formalism there's
*  no physical content there in many worlds the specific thing that is happening is
*  that some vectors are preferred over others and the reason why is because we
*  make this division of the physical stuff of the world into the systems we care
*  about and the environment the environment is everything we don't care
*  about okay and then the environment is constantly monitoring the system the
*  photons or the box of gas the gas in the box that we're dealing with are
*  constantly bumping into the system and in some sense becoming entangled with
*  it if the system is in a superposition if it's a macroscopic system in a
*  superposition it entangles with the environment very quickly that's
*  decoherence that's what we talked about okay so what we call branches of the
*  wave functions a long lead-up to saying well we call branches of the wave
*  function are those little vectors that we add together to make the big vector
*  which is the wave function of the universe where the little vectors are
*  ones that don't become entangled anymore with the environment so the classic
*  example here is Schrodinger's cat right if you have Schrodinger's cat you have a
*  cat that is in a superposition of awake and asleep I like to put it but what
*  really matters is not whether the cat is awake and asleep or alive and dead
*  what matters is the cat is in a superposition of two different macroscopic
*  configurations of the cat it could be Schrodinger's rock or Schrodinger's hat
*  or whatever as long as you put it macroscopically in a superposition of
*  two different positions because then what happens is those two parts of the
*  superposition interact differently with photons some photons will hit the cat if
*  it's in one place but not in the other place that's what causes decoherence
*  wave function branches you get two branches but then crucially super duper
*  crucially once that happens once you have just one branch once you once
*  you're considering what happens just on one branch you have a cat it's in some
*  location photons are still hitting it right but they're not entangling with it
*  because on that branch the cat is in one's particular configuration one
*  particular position that's what's called a pointer state and the photons
*  just keep hitting it and bouncing off or being absorbed or whatever but they're
*  not entangling it they're not interacting with it differently depending
*  on different parts of the quantum wave function of the cat okay so that's why
*  certain vectors certain quantum states are preferred because they remain robust
*  under being monitored by the environment okay I hope that is all useful
*  information now let's try to use it to answer some of these questions so as far
*  as conservation laws matter energy etc I did just write a paper on this and a
*  blog post explaining the paper so I encourage you to dig up on my blog I
*  have not been blogging very much so it's not hard to find go to the blog
*  preposterous universe comm slash blog and you'll find a blog post explaining
*  how energy conservation works in many worlds and the answer is it works pretty
*  well but not exactly and this is sort of an interesting subtle thing because when
*  it comes because this speaks to the other question about conservation laws
*  something like electric charge turns out to be different than energy in many
*  worlds and the reason why is because electric charge is something that the
*  universe can be an exact state of so in fact it probably is in the state of zero
*  electric charge if you're if you were gonna guess right that would be the
*  easiest guess zero total electric charge plenty of positive charges plenty of
*  negative charges but they come in equal amounts okay and that's fine nothing
*  wrong with that things go on but with energy energy is what tells us how the
*  universe evolves with time and the specific way quantum mechanics works the
*  specific way the Hamiltonian the sorry the specific way the Schrodinger
*  equation works in quantum mechanics is that if you put a quantum system in a
*  state of exact energy so you know precisely what the energy is and it's
*  not a combination of different energies it's one's precise value then the system
*  doesn't evolve at all nothing happens all of the time evolution in quantum
*  mechanics happens because real physical systems are super positions of systems
*  with slightly different energies and those slightly different energy
*  subsystems evolve at slightly different frequencies that beat against each other
*  to constructively interfere destructively interfere etc and all
*  motion and all time evolution in the world is that in quantum mechanics so
*  unlike electric charge energy is something where we can't be in an exact
*  value of the energy we have to be in a superposition and what that means as I
*  explained in the in the blog post which is based on a paper I wrote with Jackie
*  Laudman what that means is that the particular set of energies that go into
*  our universe can change with time they don't change from one set of energies to
*  a completely different set but you can narrow down right so you can have a
*  universe that is a superposition of many different energy states but then as
*  decoherence happens as the universe evolves you can sort of sample from
*  fewer and fewer different values of the energy so that the average energy for
*  your branch of the wave function changes over time so that's an interesting
*  feature of quantum mechanics now it's explicable and perfectly sensible
*  within many worlds it also happens within the Copenhagen interpretation but
*  it makes much less sense like many other things in the Copenhagen
*  interpretation okay now what does that have to say about the overall energy
*  conservation well when you do this branching you are literally taking a
*  pre-existing single branch and decomposing it into other branches that
*  are shorter right their amplitudes are smaller what matters is that number one
*  the total energy of all the branches is a hundred percent super duper conserved
*  all conserved quantities are a hundred percent conserved in all the different
*  branches and in the sum of all the branches all at once that's just
*  perfectly crystal clear but what's interesting and sort of understated when
*  you discuss quantum mechanics is from inside any one branch you don't see the
*  other branches and you don't know that the amplitude of your own branch has
*  shrunk you don't know that you are now part of a world described by a smaller
*  vector right that has absolutely zero effect on your life so therefore you
*  have to distinguish between the overall amount of stuff energy or charge or
*  whatever in the wave function of the universe versus the amount that you seem
*  to witness in your branch so what happens is your contribution to the
*  overall energy of the universe gets less and less as time goes on but you don't
*  notice because you're stuck within one branch and to you the energy is
*  approximately conserved and the same thing works with charge or anything like
*  that for the question about information traveling faster than light I'm not
*  exactly sure what you're aiming at I suspect that you're imagining putting
*  the other world at some distance that light would have to travel but different
*  branches of the wave function are not at any distance from each other there's no
*  space in between them so there's no need for information to travel faster than
*  the speed of light you might be aiming at something different but I wasn't
*  quite sure from the question so Joseph is asking about you know can a world
*  simultaneously split from more than one trunk which is to say can we start with
*  multiple smaller vectors and sort of add them together so multiple branches of
*  the wave function combining in some sense and you know I've talked about
*  this before but the practical answer is no that never ever happens but it's
*  practical in the exact same sense that you know entropy on large scales does
*  not spontaneously go down it's not that the probability is zero there's a
*  probability that could happen but the probability is so absurdly crazily tiny
*  that there's zero chance you need to worry about it okay so in the real world
*  branches increase in number toward the future not the past now the questions
*  about the double slit and and two-state systems versus continuous systems I'm
*  not sure I know what is going on here one thing that I did say maybe this is
*  answering the double slit question is the branching only happens when you have
*  decoherence and again this is something that I think is the right way to think
*  about ever it's not everyone does you might get different answers from
*  different people the answer is to not listen to anybody but me when it comes
*  to the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics in my way of thinking
*  about it worlds is the world is the word that we apply to branches of the wave
*  function that are entangled with different states of the environment not
*  just different little vectors we add together we only count it as worlds when
*  those little vectors represent different states of the environment so if you have
*  a single spin then a superposition of spin up and spin down that's not two
*  worlds right it couldn't be because there's another basis for the vector
*  space and which is only one direction in which it's spinning so the the question
*  how many directions is the superposition evolving is not even well
*  defined right likewise for the double slit experiment the electron going
*  through to through those two slits it is not decoherent if it were you would not
*  see an interference pattern on the other side then you would have measured
*  effectively where the electron is so they're not in two different branches
*  they're in the same branch of the wave function the two different parts of the
*  electron that go through the two different slits okay and finally Jeff's
*  question is one I understand the least so I'm not going to do a very good job
*  here maybe you're asking why is the wave function expressed as a superposition of
*  positions rather than momenta or something like that and that is entirely
*  a question of convenience I mean this is why going back earlier to the mad dog
*  ever ready and ism question this is why I don't want to privilege things like
*  position or momentum because there's multiple ways of expressing the wave
*  function and you're allowed to use whatever way you want you need to ask
*  yourself what is most useful what is most appropriate for the circumstances
*  that you're looking at but then you say it seems equally plausible that the
*  detector would measure four points or a single point or a circle shape or
*  something like that and now I'm not quite sure where you're going this is I
*  mean there's just a physics question you shoot an electron at a target oh maybe
*  this is what you mean okay so yeah let me read this question again because you
*  say the double slit experiment but maybe it maybe that's why I was getting
*  confused take a you can make an electron gun right you can take a gizmo that
*  makes electrons and shoots them at a screen indeed you have TV sets just like
*  that so the question might be when an electron hits a screen why does it make
*  a dot rather than some more complicated pattern and that has nothing to do the
*  double slit experiment double slit experiment is an example of that but is
*  usually used to illustrate other points so if the question is why does the
*  electron make a dot the answer is because physics is local because the way
*  that the electron interacts with the screen is local in space so in other
*  words this and that feeds into what you mean by decoherence remember I just said
*  that decoherence has this property that it puts it makes branches of the wave
*  function where systems are coherent in their macroscopic physical
*  configuration so the electron that's a wave will hit the screen everywhere but
*  it will interact individually with the different atoms on the screen or
*  molecules or whatever and they will all either light up or not but then when
*  they light up they emit light and that light is then part of the environment
*  right I mean we can see it and we can interact with it other light particles
*  go away so the wave function branches and the wave function branches separately
*  into worlds that represent which atom in the screen the electron could have hit
*  because it becomes decoherent because if they emit light in different directions
*  so I guess that is a it is a confusing point because it's a combination of the
*  underlying fundamental laws that say that the electron interacts locally
*  with different atoms that it could hit and the specific features of decoherence
*  that say that you branch into worlds that are sort of the same in their
*  environment and monitoring the same macroscopic configurations for the stuff
*  in them I hope that is some help okay Trevor Vilwalk says after you
*  hearing mentioned Emerson Lake and Palmer on a previous episode I'm curious
*  if you're into any other prog rock or other experimentally inclined music like
*  20 and 21st century classical music so part of why I chose this question is one
*  to be answered I know that very deep answers so yes I was especially like in
*  my college days very into progressive rock Emerson Lake and Palmer yes Genesis
*  Pink Floyd that kind of thing but you know I drifted away a little bit I still
*  love listening to them but I don't follow the modern versions of them and
*  they are related to like you say experimentally inclined music including
*  some classical music and the reason why I'm answering the question is just to
*  sort of lament that I don't follow music that much anymore you know like I said
*  when I was in college and grad school I was really into the progressive rock
*  thing when I was a young professor in Chicago you know Chicago is just a great
*  music town overall and I in particular got I was always into jazz also but I
*  really got to be able to go to see live jazz in Chicago in a way that was just
*  an embarrassment of riches there was so much good stuff going on Patricia
*  Barber von Freeman Ken Vandermark people like that and here in LA both you know
*  I'm older settled down married had cats but also you know the music scene is
*  different here in LA and you know there's lots of strivers trying to become
*  rock stars but there's not as many people playing every Tuesday night to
*  11 p.m. in a jazz club with with 20 people in the audience right that's just
*  not the scene around here at least so I don't know of that scene anyway I'm sure
*  there's wonderful music going on around here in LA but I'm sort of past that
*  part of my music loving career so I've become stead and predictable when it
*  comes to my music like many middle-aged people I like the music that I grew up
*  with right and and that's terrible and I feel bad about it but you know so be it
*  in my spare time to do new and interesting things trying to learn new
*  parts of science and philosophy and things like that I hate to say it that
*  makes me sound very boring but I mean obviously I do things purely for fun
*  also like that's why you've been subjected to podcasts about basketball
*  and poker and things like that but I'm not following the music scene as much as
*  I should sorry about that Aiman McGee says if the universe was in a more dense
*  state in its early stages would time have passed differently for atoms quarks
*  neutrons in the early universe than the present-day universe no it's the short
*  answer is no you know again it depends on what you mean what do you mean if
*  time had passed differently time always moves at one second per second go back
*  to the AMA last month I give a little pep talk about this in the beginning
*  it's just confusing and wrong for people to talk about time traveling at different
*  rates what you are allowed to talk about is the elapsed time being different for
*  two different trajectories in space-time that both begin at the same point and
*  end at the same point okay so if you somehow I don't know how you could do
*  this but if you could take a little clock and attach it to an atom in the
*  early universe it would the atom would see the clock moving completely normally
*  no matter what the two of them were doing together if you took did that to
*  two little atoms and they went on different paths and came back then they
*  might read slightly different times but that's nothing special about the early
*  universe that's just because atoms are moving near the speed of light atoms are
*  more generally particles right the rule of thumb is when the temperature of the
*  universe is larger than the mass of the particle in natural units then particles
*  are probably moving near the speed of light that's kind of what it means right
*  to have a temperature above the mass of a particle means that the energy is the
*  tip the average energy per particle is greater than the particles mass so most
*  of its energy is coming from kinetic energy coming from motion and that means
*  it's moving near the speed of light to get more kinetic energy than rest energy
*  you need to be moving close to the speed of light so anyway yeah like if you
*  think about individual particles moving near the speed of light they will
*  experience different amounts of time but maybe you mean you could take the
*  collection of all the particles right that's a plasma or a gas or whatever
*  depending on exactly what epoch you're thinking of and there is a rest frame
*  for the plasma which is different than the rest frame of any of the individual
*  particles just like the atoms in the air you're breathing they have individual
*  motions but there's still an average velocity of the air which hopefully is
*  small in the room where you're breathing it and so you could say well what about
*  that what about time as measured in that rest frame and you might ask so this is
*  why I wasn't sure what you were getting at you might ask well because the
*  universe was so dense gravity is more important and therefore is gravity
*  affecting the passage of time in the early universe right so again the
*  answer is no it's really not affecting it at all so and again this subtleties
*  here one subtlety is again even if there were a gravitational field like even
*  if you're near a black hole that's when there's a strong gravitational field
*  okay and that's where there is a strong time dilation effect but the way to
*  think about that effect is not times moving faster or slower it's how do you
*  compare the elapsed time if you go near the black hole to what you would have or
*  what your friend experiences when they're staying far away and it's much
*  like the twin paradox if you go near a black hole hang out there for a while and
*  come back you will have experienced less time than the people who just stayed
*  behind so you might think that since the early universe is very very dense and
*  gravity is strong it is kind of like that but it's not why because everyone
*  in the early universe is experiencing the same gravitational field there's no
*  analog of your friend far away the early universe is uniform right the early
*  universe is a plasma which is the same density everywhere this is one of the
*  features of cosmology that makes it very doable is that the universe is more or
*  less homogeneous and isotropic and was even more homogeneous at early times so
*  and that's not just a technicality literally all the clocks that were in
*  the rest frame of the plasma of the early universe ticked at one second per
*  second and when we say you know when we say the era one second after the Big Bang
*  that's what we mean we mean time as measured by clocks that are in the rest
*  frame of the plasma of the early universe so that really is one second
*  after the Big Bang there's not some other number of seconds that you really
*  should be using we're telling you the right answer there
*  okay Umberto Nani says for cosmologists from planets located in the remote
*  future those who live in galaxies getting away faster than light from all
*  the other galaxies are they condemned to think their galaxy is all of the
*  universe or is there something being printed in the fabric of space or in the
*  last scattering surface that can tell them how to know more well there is a
*  sort of what happens is is a good question you know our universe is
*  expanding and also accelerating so let's imagine that the acceleration
*  continues forever that's the easiest thing to imagine the most probable
*  thing is true it might not be true but let's imagine that's what true that's
*  what's true okay so galaxies that we see today if you did the dumbest thing if
*  you forgot that there's relativity and you just said well the galaxy the
*  universe is expanding and the galaxies are moving away from us and so at any
*  one moment in time there is a distance to the galaxy and there's a sort of
*  rate at which the universe is expanding so I can figure out an apparent velocity
*  and it will eventually become greater than the speed of light all that is true
*  but what is really relevant is the galaxy is emitting light toward us
*  right and the light is becoming more and more redshifted so just like
*  something falling into a black hole the light from that thing becomes more and
*  more redshifted and there is a moment that is the last moment in the history
*  of that object that we outside observers will ever see the same thing is true for
*  galaxies that are being accelerated away from us cosmologically they will get
*  redder and redder and we will get less and less information from them and there
*  is a point in their evolution locally from their point of view that we will
*  never see because the light just never gets to us so but it's more than that
*  because not only do the individual photons we see from those galaxies
*  become red we see fewer and fewer photons right if you're emitting a
*  certain number of photons per second in your rest frame there's more and more
*  time in between those photons from our rest frame so not only do the galaxies
*  get redder and redder they get dimmer and dimmer and there is less and less
*  information to be received from them the same thing is true for the cosmic
*  microwave background it continues to be redshifted right now the typical
*  wavelength is I don't know millimeters or centimeters for CMB radiation it's
*  going to grow longer and longer eventually it will be miles or kilometers
*  or parsecs or megaparsecs or billions of light years if you wait long enough so
*  if you really do wait long enough all the other stuff in the universe will
*  fade away and it'll become invisible and will those people be able to guess or
*  hypothesize that they came from a bright shiny universe like we live in today I
*  don't know I do think that there's a point in principle where it becomes
*  very very very hard to do but again I'm not very good at predicting future
*  technology so I'll be silent about that David de Kloet says do we only need many
*  worlds because our consciousness doesn't observe superposition or are there other
*  reasons unrelated to consciousness why we can't just assume there is a single
*  world which is forever in superposition and just more and more entangled so I
*  think that you make a slight hypothesis contrary to fact there where you say we
*  can't just assume there is a single world forever in superposition that is
*  exactly whatever it says there is a single wave function of the universe
*  which is forever in superposition and is more and more entangled but within that
*  wave function we are allowed to describe it as multiple non-interacting worlds
*  that has nothing to do with consciousness nothing nothing in quantum
*  mechanics has anything to do with consciousness the only time that words
*  like consciousness or awareness or agency should come into discussions of
*  quantum mechanics is when you are specifically trying to describe what
*  conscious agents see if you don't want to then you don't ever need to use those
*  words okay but you still would have branching of the wave function to the
*  extent that it would be possible and helpful to break up the wave function of
*  the universe into individual branches that evolve independently that's
*  something you're allowed to do it is precisely the same as saying that if you
*  were Laplace's demon you could discuss all of the molecules in a box of gas
*  individually you know their positions and momenta therefore you don't need to
*  use words like temperature or entropy that doesn't mean you're not allowed to
*  use words like temperature and entropy you can calculate them and likewise if
*  there were no conscious creatures in the universe you could still figure out what
*  the branches are and when they were happening but you wouldn't need to if
*  you had infinite information but none of us does that's the way the dynamic goes
*  Gordon Bamber says if gravity were a repulsive force instead of attractive
*  how would this affect the arrow of time so the zero-th order answer here is not
*  at all there's no direct connection there the reason why I bring it up is
*  just to mention an interesting paper that I don't think is right I don't agree
*  with it but it's I could be wrong and it's an interesting paper it was by
*  Brian Greene previous mindscape guest and Kurt Hinderbickler and some other
*  people back in the day a few years ago where they said look what we're trying
*  to explain when it comes to the arrow of time what we need to explain is why the
*  early universe had low entropy after that most of it follows roughly speaking
*  and if it weren't for gravity the state of the early universe famously looks
*  like it's high entropy right it looks like a thermal gas so that's like a
*  very hot dense collection of particles so we there's this song and dance when
*  it comes to gravity and entropy in the early universe where you say well the
*  early universe looks high entropy except for gravity but gravity is there so it's
*  really low entropy etc so what Brian and curtain friends said was what if you
*  turned off gravity in the early universe what if for some reason gravity were
*  zero at early times and then everything would equilibrate right you would
*  naturally in a box of gas you would go to a high entropy configuration but then
*  somehow gravity turns on okay and then the universe starts expanding and
*  becoming crumpled etc etc so in other words maybe the early universe was high
*  entropy given its conditions at the time so for reasons I'm not going to go into
*  now I don't think that quite works as a cosmological scenario but I do think
*  there's a relationship between gravity and the arrow of time very broadly
*  speaking it's not that it's repulsive versus attractive and that would change
*  things in any obvious way but they are potentially related somehow okay
*  Gregory Mendel I presume you're not the guy with the peapods who discovered
*  heredity but Gregory says what is what if in the Schrodinger's cat scenario we
*  replace nuclear decay with measuring the spin flip in nuclear magnetic resonance
*  so the probability of triggering the position oscillates between 0 and 1 if we
*  let a cycle go by so there was a time when it is a hundred percent likely the
*  poison was triggered but wait until the next 0% probability to open the box what
*  do we observe and I've edited out a little bit but I think Gregory you
*  figured out your own question here because of course the point is that you
*  can have a quantum system that evolves slowly smoothly you know from one state
*  to another that's fine and that's perfectly reversible but what the whole
*  point of the Schrodinger's cat scenario is to let that quantum system interact
*  with a big messy macroscopic world and once that happens your dynamics is
*  irreversible so even if it's in nuclear decay or sorry a nuclear magnetic
*  resonance or something like that if you're observing the phase of the
*  nucleus okay then what that means is you are coupling the phase of the nucleus to
*  something big and macroscopic like a detector and the detector once it clicks
*  or doesn't click that makes a macroscopic alteration of the environment
*  and that is not going to be undone by waiting around longer so the question
*  is not what is the dynamics of the system you're observing the question is
*  does that system become entangled with the wider world and once it does it's
*  done no going back once that decosherence happens it's irreversible an
*  anonymous questioner says would early universe physicists have had trouble
*  guessing any part of the standard model for example would they would have been
*  obvious that one day fermions would gain mass if the lab couldn't produce
*  temperatures cool enough to break electro weak age symmetry so the point
*  here is that the the the background is we have the Higgs boson the Higgs boson
*  at early times had a zero expectation value in the universe that is to say the
*  average value of the Higgs field at any one point in space was zero could
*  fluctuate a little bit around that but basically it was zero and then
*  eventually the universe cooled down to a point where we underwent what is called
*  the electroweak phase transition and now the Higgs flops down from zero to some
*  non-zero value and it's that non-zero value of the Higgs field in empty space
*  that gives mass to elementary particles to fermions and W bosons and things like
*  that so if you were a physicist if you somehow a very heat resistant physicist
*  in the very early universe could you have known that was going to happen in
*  principle yes you could have known that was going to happen so what you would
*  have to do in fact we kind of do something like this so what you would
*  have to do is measure all the parameters in your theory and then trust your
*  theory right so the parameters in your theory include all the different
*  couplings of the Higgs boson to itself as well as to other particles and then
*  you can ask yourself are there what are the dynamics of the field in very
*  different circumstances like you have the equations just a matter of your
*  ability to solve them and we do that now we ask whether or not there are other
*  values the Higgs boson could have that under different circumstances maybe even
*  in the future right maybe our Higgs boson value could spontaneously tunnel
*  to a different value we don't know so yes I think you know there's a lot of
*  thought experimenting going into imagining these early universe physicists
*  but in principle they could figure it out now your question technically was
*  would they have had trouble guessing it maybe yes that's very possible they
*  would have had trouble guessing that you know the the electroweak phase
*  transition is earlier it's at higher temperature than the QCD phase
*  transition so back then before you had the Higgs boson with this expectation
*  value you didn't have protons and neutrons either you just had free quarks
*  and gluons it would have been a very very different universe in very various
*  ways I would ask could they have figured out that quarks would eventually become
*  confined that's a good question again in principle they could have but it might
*  have been hard Andrew Vernon Smith says in an interview you had with Kip Thorne
*  Kip referred to certain parts of the movie interstellar as crossing the line
*  into impossible science fiction could you elaborate on what the evidence that
*  Kip was relying on that proves or tends to prove the impossibility of those
*  parts of the movie I'm pretty sure he was just referring to the end of the movie
*  you know I only vaguely remember it now but there's that thing where he goes in
*  the library and he's like poking and sending signals and there's time travel
*  and things like that and all of these were inspired by ideas from modern
*  physics but none of it none of that library stuff actually could be
*  happening in known laws of physics none of the interactions the poking of books
*  and things like that that's not physics okay that's just imagination that's just
*  fantasy so I think both Kip and for that matter Jonah Nolan who was technically
*  the screenwriter on the movie brother of Christopher Nolan are like we don't know
*  what's happening in that that was the mind of Christopher Nolan sort of
*  imagined this scenario again inspired by physics but not actually following it
*  that's what I think he had in mind all the stuff with the black hole in the
*  wormhole and stuff like that that stuff was pretty scientifically respectable
*  Scott says if something like the ADS CFD correspondence is shown to apply to our
*  universe would that you lead you to believe that all of our math and physics
*  are convenient descriptions that note don't necessarily have any fundamental
*  reality nope it would not so I have you know I think you have to be a little bit
*  careful about what it means to have fundamental reality right versus being a
*  convenient description convenient descriptions are only convenient if they
*  capture some fundamental reality right so I think the tables and chairs are
*  convenient descriptions they are nowhere to be found in the standard model of
*  higher level emergent phenomena but at the level of everyday life they're very
*  very convenient to describe what the world around us is likewise all of our
*  math and physics clearly captures something real about reality and that I
*  don't know whether you want to call it fundamental or not but it's real okay
*  it's both a convenient description and real I don't think that you should
*  distinguish between convenient descriptions and fundamental reality now
*  there are descriptions that are false right you know you could be wrong about
*  something when someone does a card trick and they're tricking you and they pull a
*  rabbit out of a hat they might lead you to believe something that was false now
*  that's not reality okay so it's not like everything you see is obviously truly
*  reality but the physics descriptions that really do capture some element of
*  what is happening around us even if they capture it in an indirect way are things
*  that I would still count as part of fundamental reality I'm going to group
*  two equations two questions together here Nate says in many
*  worlds we assume that the world we interact with is a branch of some
*  universal wave function do you know of any ways to describe what we think of as
*  causality or locality within the context of our branch on the scale of this
*  universal wave function and if so what are they and then Keith says in the
*  semi-classical gravity of Hawking radiation what is the classical part so
*  I'm grouping these together because they both get at a slightly thorny but not
*  completely incomprehensible issue which is how the classical limit arises in
*  quantum mechanics so Keith says what is the classical part and when we say
*  semi-classical gravity that's the easy one semi-classical gravity is just
*  classical gravity classical general relativity right classical space-time
*  but quantum fields on top of that classical space-time so the quantum
*  fields on top of the classical space-time can even include quantized
*  fluctuations in the gravitational field so gravitons and things like that that's
*  why it's semi classical gravity quantum mechanics on top of a classical
*  and to go back to Nate's question we have the story that we tell in many
*  worlds about branching decoherence all that stuff right and what I said earlier
*  was that these branches have the feature that they sort of pick out special
*  pointer states which are coherently arranged in physical space they have
*  macroscopic shapes and sizes and locations okay whereas if you have a
*  superposition of two things with different locations or shapes or
*  whatever they would decohere right away the things that persist as long-lived
*  robust states are those that sort of look classical right now that is a very
*  when you say that out loud you probably say oh okay that kind of makes sense
*  right but it actually requires a lot of work and thought to show that that is
*  what is going on I mean this paper I recently wrote with Ashmeet Singh
*  recently might be like last year yeah last year so it's still pretty recent
*  it's got published recently called quantum muriology so we asked the
*  question given this big Hilbert space how do you divide it up into subspaces
*  like an environment and a system for example and what we suggested was that
*  what we're doing is looking for classical behavior why are we looking
*  for classical behavior well you know maybe anthropic reasons or maybe sort of
*  non-anthropic reasons that have to do with algorithmic compressibility or
*  simplicity or robustness I don't know exactly but who cares what we said was
*  let's look for classical behavior let's ask how we divide up Hilbert space into
*  subsystems so as to get classical behavior and what we found is there's
*  actually two aspects to classical behavior one is the the thing that
*  you're looking at you know the baseball or whatever it follows a classical
*  trajectory and it doesn't spread out all over the place right if you launch a
*  rocket toward the moon you don't need quantum mechanics to get it there it
*  will more or less move on its classical Newtonian trajectory and the other one
*  is that you're in a pointer state in other words the state that is described
*  by the branch that you're on is one that doesn't keep getting entangled this
*  entanglement remains almost constant and these two different criteria of
*  remaining localized along a classical trajectory and remaining unentangled
*  with the environment they're different sounding but they play together there's
*  some relationship between them and it's subtle and we're still thinking about it
*  so we think that this underlies why there is a difference in the observed
*  world between positions and momenta for example but I think this is part of a
*  story that we don't actually have completely explicated yet but the short
*  answer to your actual question is the way that the universe branches in many
*  worlds is on two branches that individually act as classical as they
*  can sometimes they're not gonna act classical there's a Geiger counter
*  right we measure a spin or whatever but that's an incredibly tiny amount of
*  quantum behavior compared to what we do in our everyday lives and so that
*  feature is not just an accident that's kind of what defines the branches that
*  we're on this emergent classicality and once you get that you get causality and
*  locality and all that stuff coming just as much along for the ride as it would
*  in ordinary classical mechanics Robin Quinnell says is there any physics
*  evidence that we are in a simulation nope there is not in fact I would argue
*  that there's evidence that we're not in a simulation so what do you mean by
*  evidence in this case you got to be a good Bayesian you ask yourself what
*  would we expect the universe to look like were we in a simulation versus what
*  would we expect to look like if we were not in a simulation now that's a really
*  hard question to answer it's very analogous to asking the relevant the
*  analogous question about God right what would you expect the universe to look
*  like if God existed versus purely naturalism well it depends on your idea
*  about God it depends on your idea about the simulators and what they're trying
*  to do with the simulation but what we can tell about our universe is number
*  one that it's super wasteful of resources right like if what they care
*  about is us like if you thought that the simulators care about human beings in
*  any way that they've made an awfully big universe most of which we can never get
*  to and most of which has no effect on us so you would think again it's not a
*  necessary consequence but if you were to guess let's put it this way if you
*  did notice yeah this is a good way to put it right okay so you have two
*  scenarios on the table one is just reality naturalism it's universal based
*  laws of physics the other is we live in a simulation okay and there's two
*  options one and it's sort of two pictures of the universe which we get
*  on broad principles distinguish a big universe where there's us but then we're
*  very very tiny compared to the bigger picture and there's lots of galaxies and
*  so forth that seems very wasteful and resource intensive that we have nothing
*  to do with or there's a small universe right like that the universe as a whole
*  is more or less human scaled maybe it's you know a million times the size of a
*  human being rather than billions and billions of times the size of human
*  being what would you expect under these two scenarios of naturalism versus
*  simulation well here's what I would say if we did live in the tiny universe
*  then you might say aha that makes perfect sense to me because we probably
*  live in a simulation right that makes more sense to me if we live in a
*  simulation that the universe is human-sized that the universe is sort of
*  adapted to our existence here and if you're gonna say that if you would
*  believe that if you think that counterfactually were the universe tiny
*  we would take that as evidence for a simulation then it follows logically and
*  you cannot wriggle out of it that if the universe is large you must take that as
*  evidence against the idea that we live in a simulation of course you can wriggle
*  out of it you can say well they're very you know technologically advanced they
*  don't care about resources they're using very clever optimization algorithms
*  whatever but if you think that we would take it as evidence for simulation where
*  the universe to be small then we should take it as evidence against simulation
*  that the universe is large okay Maya Apple says would it be possible to be
*  fully certain in the finality of a theory of everything isn't it always
*  possible for there to be a different underlying explanatory system sure yeah
*  I don't think that certainty is ever your goal in science at all because even
*  if you had a theory of everything that fit all of the data perfectly you can
*  always do an experiment tomorrow that didn't fit the data and you have to
*  change it right so this is part of being a scientist we don't aim towards
*  certainty we aim towards higher and higher credences but it's always a
*  mistake to think that you know we're getting to 100% belief in our theories
*  because that would be bad that would mean we could never change our minds in
*  the future that's not how scientists should work okay the final question is
*  Jim Murphy says the universe is really big to me this is distressing I don't
*  know if this relates to the simulation argument whatsoever but he says to me
*  this is distressing not because I'm afraid of how small we are but because
*  of a kind of cosmic FOMO for those of us who are too old FOMO is the kids way of
*  saying fear of missing out FOMO the disappointment of knowing that there is
*  so much out there that we will never discover is sometimes too much to handle
*  do you ever get these feelings and how do you remind yourself that there is
*  plenty to explore here on earth so this is the final question so we can be a
*  little bit relaxed about it you know I don't get those feelings those are not
*  the feelings I get in fact the opposite like what if we were almost done what if
*  we'd almost discovered or did discover had discovered everything interesting to
*  be discovered about physics politics economics whatever chemistry biology
*  what if we basically knew everything I don't that would be terrible like that
*  would be I'm sure that we would think of ways to keep ourselves interested in
*  amused etc but the fact that we live in a universe where there are so many things
*  yet to be discovered makes me happy well especially because we have discovered a
*  bunch of things right like my perspective is obviously highly parochial
*  and limited because I don't know what things are going to be like a thousand
*  or a million years from now but in some way of thinking we live in a pretty good
*  part of intellectual history where we've learned a lot enough that you know
*  there's not a lot of child mortality etc we can go much farther getting rid of
*  poverty and disease and curing aging and things like that so I think that
*  probably unless we do something dumb a hundred or two hundred or a thousand
*  years from now will be better than now but over historical timescales comparing
*  us now to a hundred thousand years ago we're doing a lot better now but
*  there's still a lot to be discovered right right here on earth and so I do
*  not have any of this fear of missing out like I don't even in even in much more
*  down-to-earth circumstances fear of missing out is not something I have it's
*  not even something that makes sense to me because there's the question is not
*  what are you missing the question is what are you experiencing right as long
*  as you are experiencing all sorts of good stuff the fact that there's other
*  good stuff that you're not experiencing is just something I couldn't even
*  imagine caring too much about right if it's literally something that I could go
*  and experience and it would be even better then fine but then I'll be
*  missing out on the other thing that I'm that I'm getting now so sure you should
*  work to sort of have an interesting portfolio of experiences that sounds
*  like a very reasonable attainable goal but to experience everything to learn
*  everything to do everything like no and I have no interest in even trying to do
*  that it's about the journey right we are these little tiny bits of self
*  organization that feed off of the free energy around us for a finite period of
*  time in a very finite world of experience but that world of experience
*  is still way larger than we have the ability to experience so I'm not worried
*  about all the experiences I can't have I got enough to worry about with the
*  experiences I do have all right thanks for sticking with me I can feel the
*  voice beginning to go thanks for supporting mindscape as always it's
*  been tough times where I'm getting vaccinated tomorrow I get my second shot
*  as I'm recording this so I'm very happy about that hope everyone out there is
*  getting vaccinated if not already then very soon again I hope that the podcast
*  has been a little bit useful to folks in these weird times of hours and it's
*  certainly been extremely wonderful for me to have so much support from you out
