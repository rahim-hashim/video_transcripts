The germ theory of disease is a crowning achievement of science, up there with modern physics, continental drift, and evolution via natural selection. (Even if there will always be cranky skeptics.) But the road to widespread acceptance isn't always an easy one. Why did it take so long between Anton van Leeuwenhoek seeing "animalcules" in a microscope (1670s) to Louis Pasteur's work on pasteurization and vaccination (1860's)? Thomas Levenson is the author of a new book exploring this fascinating history: So Very Small: How Humans Discovered the Microcosmos, Defeated Germs--and May Still Lose the War Against Infectious Disease.

Thomas Levenson received a B.A. in East Asian Studies from Harvard University. He is currently Professor of Science Writing and director of the graduate program in science writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is the author of numerous books and has written and produced a number of science documentaries for television.

# Mindscape 312 | Thomas Levenson on the Mutual History of Humans and Germs
**Mindscape Podcast:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. One [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=0.0s)]
*  of the great things about the existence of podcasts as a medium, I guess it's not that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4.36s)]
*  different from just interview shows on radio or TV, but they're a little bit more ubiquitous [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=10.66s)]
*  now. So they provide a glimpse into things almost as they happen, right? I mean, obviously [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=16.16s)]
*  news events can happen very rapidly, but the increase in knowledge that we get through [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=23.18s)]
*  scholarship and research happens on a relatively more leisurely time scale. And by talking [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=29.68s)]
*  to the kinds of people that we get as guests here on Mindscape, you can see science and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=35.56s)]
*  research more broadly as it is being done. You get some interesting results, but you [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=40.84s)]
*  also get some insight into the messiness of we don't know the answer yet, we're still [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=45.84s)]
*  thinking about this, there's still some controversy, let's see where we go. And it becomes pretty [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  obvious that of course we're all human beings, we have our favorite ideas, favorite ways [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=56.24s)]
*  of thinking and so forth. It's a human endeavor, science and scholarship more broadly. So it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=61.32s)]
*  can be possible to forget that it has always been that way, because the science that was [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=67.56s)]
*  done in the past, we receive as students and readers and listeners in kind of a finished [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=76.36s)]
*  polished form, right? We're given Maxwell's equations or Newton's laws in notation that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=84.08s)]
*  is much easier to understand than what they actually used. And we're given the final result [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=90.24s)]
*  after they had to go back and forth and think about lots of different things. So things [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=94.52s)]
*  we take for granted now, the earth is round, species evolved from previous species due [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=99.02s)]
*  to natural selection, the germ theory of disease, for example, of course, diseases are carried [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=105.46s)]
*  by germs, that's very natural. Diseases can be contagious, one person talks to another [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=111.84s)]
*  one, they carry the disease now, it makes sense that some little agent was carrying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  the disease from person to person. But it took a long time, as it turns out, for the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=122.96s)]
*  germ theory of disease to catch on. And it's worth revisiting that history, both because [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=127.22s)]
*  the science is fascinating, but also the twists and turns in the human side of the story are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=132.4s)]
*  fascinating as well. So today's guest is Tom Levinson, a longtime friend of mine. He is a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=137.0s)]
*  professor of science writing at MIT and an active science writer, author of a number of books that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  I can highly recommend, The Hunt for Vulcan, about looking for that little planet that was [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=149.12s)]
*  hypothesized to exist between the sun and Mercury back in the day, Einstein in Berlin, about some [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=154.12s)]
*  of Einstein's formative years, and my favorite, which is Newton and the Counterfeiter, about [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=160.12s)]
*  Isaac Newton's life after doing science, when he became the boss of the Mint and hunted down [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=165.4s)]
*  counterfeiters in London. It was, these are human stories, what can I tell you? Newton was a pretty [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  bloodthirsty guy, to be perfectly honest. Anyway, Tom's most recent book is called So Very Small, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=178.0s)]
*  How Humans Discovered the Microcosmos, Defeated Germs, and May Still Lose the War Against Infectious [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=183.76s)]
*  Disease. It's a history book, a science book, a storytelling book about the various ways that we [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=190.56s)]
*  got from then Leuvenhuk looking through a little microscope and seeing that there were critters [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=196.72s)]
*  moving around to Pasteur saying, I can figure out how to defeat these guys, and not everyone [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=201.44s)]
*  agreeing with them along the way. In fact, some people fighting hard against them, and at some [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=208.26s)]
*  point you have to say a lot of lives could have been saved if people had just faced up to the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=213.66s)]
*  scientific reality. Lessons for contemporary issues left for you to decide. So with that, let's go. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=218.6s)]
*  Tom Levenson, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. Thank you for having me, Sean. This is great. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=225.6s)]
*  It is great, but nevertheless, the very first page of your new book kind of frightened me a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=246.6s)]
*  little bit. You start talking about the bubonic plague in Oregon in 2024. I mean, you rush to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=254.28s)]
*  say, don't worry, they tamped it down because we have modern medicine now, but it did raise [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=260.36s)]
*  the question, how many of these old-timey, terrible-sounding diseases are still lurking [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=266.12s)]
*  around out there? We'll be more systematic later in the podcast, but I just had to ask that one right away. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=271.68s)]
*  Oh, all of them are out there except smallpox. Smallpox is the only disease, and I love this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=277.2s)]
*  this factoid, the only human infectious disease that has been rendered extinct in the wild. There [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=286.5s)]
*  is no more virus out there except in a couple of freezer lockers, which is kind of nervous-making [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=295.72s)]
*  that they're there, but essentially there's no smallpox circulating, hasn't been since at least [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=302.44000000000005s)]
*  1980, and that's a remarkable thing because it used to be the leading killer and one in three of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=307.66s)]
*  people who caught it would die most often. Terrible disease, but the rest of them, tuberculosis, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=316.12s)]
*  consumption, the disease that took all those figures, the poet Keats and Henry David Thoreau [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  and everybody else, that's still causing a million deaths a year worldwide. It's not prevalent in the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=333.88s)]
*  developed world, but it's still very much out there, and it's actually becoming an increasingly [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  deadly threat. We can go into why later on. Cholera still pops up, and in fact, I saw a recent [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=347.68s)]
*  report that there's some cholera. Clearly, we know about measles. As we talk, there is a still [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=353.84s)]
*  uncontained outbreak in Texas, and I understand now in measles cases have been identified in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=360.96s)]
*  something, 20 or something additional states. Three people have died so far in that one, and you can [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=367.15999999999997s)]
*  keep going on down the list. Polio has been on the very teetering edge of eradication for decades [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=374.0s)]
*  now, but it's not quite extinct. There are cases that pop up, including in the United States, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=383.68s)]
*  as recently as 2022, 2023, and if we aren't careful, that could also break its current very [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=393.68s)]
*  narrow bounds and become a major problem again. So yeah, they're all still out there. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=400.64s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because your book is about the historical context. We have a lot of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=404.88s)]
*  fascinating stories about how we got to germ theory and vaccines and fighting it and so forth, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=410.88s)]
*  but constantly there's a refrain of, it wasn't easy. The scientists invented some stuff, and then [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=417.44s)]
*  there was politics and there was establishment pride on all those things, and you can't help [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=425.36s)]
*  but read it and go, yeah, I guess those things are still around a little bit. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  Very much so. The book, so very small, began as a question from an editor, like, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=436.2s)]
*  can you think of decisive moments in science? My UK editor came to me more than a decade ago [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=443.08s)]
*  and said, I'm doing this series on decisive moments. We're doing things like Picasso's [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=454.52s)]
*  Guernica or Handel's Messiah, the first performance, that kind of thing. He says, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  but we have no science. What would be good breakpoints in science? Or coffee, and I thought of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=463.0s)]
*  a couple, and I said, well, Einstein going up the mountain in Mount Wilson and seeing the evidence [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=469.88s)]
*  that the universe is not static is a breakpoint. The world is different or the cosmos is different [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  before and after that moment. I said, I could do that, but I don't do that because I've written [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=481.72s)]
*  about Einstein a lot. Enough. I said, I don't know anything about it, but germ theory strikes me as [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=487.32000000000005s)]
*  this really striking moment. Germ theory is this idea that was definitively established [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=495.48s)]
*  in the 1870s and 80s. It basically says that infectious disease is not caused by some [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=506.36s)]
*  derangement of the body or environmental disturbance, a miasma or what have you, bad air, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=514.92s)]
*  bad water, whatever, in a sort of general sense. It's caused by microbes and crucially, each [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=519.64s)]
*  different disease, cholera, typhoid, whatever it might be, battlefield infections, all these [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=528.2s)]
*  kinds of things. Each specific condition was caused by a single specific microbe. That was [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=535.64s)]
*  an essential element of the idea. I said, before that, you have a much looser and vaguer understanding [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=543.0s)]
*  of disease, and after it, you have this very precise definition of what's involved in infectious [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=554.52s)]
*  disease. It gets very precise. There are these things called Cox postulates, which are a list [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=560.28s)]
*  of rules about how to make sure that you have identified the correct sequence from pathogen [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=568.12s)]
*  to disease. It involves isolating the bacterium. As these were being worked out, viruses had not [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=574.36s)]
*  yet been observed. The first one was observed in the 1890s. You identify the bacterium [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=581.16s)]
*  in a diseased organism. You isolate it. You culture it. You give it to another healthy organism, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=595.88s)]
*  and you reproduce the same disease. There are these rules that sort of how you establish [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=602.52s)]
*  that this is in fact the pathogen. That all happens in this last quarter of the 19th century. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=608.12s)]
*  There's a before and after, and with that knowledge, there are all kinds of things you can do [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=619.64s)]
*  that are also part of the story I tell in the book. You have ideas about public health were [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=623.0s)]
*  already advancing in this period that I call germ theory without germs, when it's recognized [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=629.96s)]
*  that there are pathogens of some sort, but it's not understood what they are and how the dynamic [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=635.96s)]
*  happens. Even that lets you do some very important things. That's the cholera story with all that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=642.44s)]
*  Afterwards, you can do targeted public health. You understand why you're doing clean water systems [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=652.36s)]
*  and so forth, and making sure the sewage system doesn't interact with the water supply, all these [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=658.12s)]
*  basic really good things. You develop vaccines. There was one vaccine that existed, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=662.76s)]
*  generous cowpox vaccine to prevent smallpox, that was discovered essentially empirically or [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=669.64s)]
*  developed empirically in the late 18th century, 1790s. But there were no other vaccines. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=674.68s)]
*  Then with germ theory, particularly pushed by Louis Pasteur in that early period, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=681.72s)]
*  but as with anything in science, lots and lots of other people are involved. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=688.6800000000001s)]
*  That's when you start getting vaccines against a much wider range of diseases. Of course, finally, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=694.0400000000001s)]
*  third in the sequence, historically, you get chemical compounds that are discovered or developed [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=700.2s)]
*  that can attack an infection that's already lodged in the body. Vaccines are like the wall [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  around the castle, right? If something gets through the wall, whether it's your skin or [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=715.08s)]
*  vaccination or what have you, then you've got an infection and you do something about it. You want [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=721.4000000000001s)]
*  to do something about it. That's where antibiotics come in. We got all those things out of germ [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=726.2s)]
*  theory. But what really struck me as I first sort of I said, germ theory, there's a before and after [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=732.9200000000001s)]
*  and it's great and there's a decisive moment and everything's grand. That's all true, but you and [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=738.9200000000001s)]
*  I both know that science is not usually simply a case of a eureka moment that changes everything. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=744.76s)]
*  I started looking into it a little bit more. I told my editor that he should [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=754.4399999999999s)]
*  find somebody who actually knew about medicine and the history of microbiology and all that [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=758.84s)]
*  sort of stuff to write it. I wrote two other books while this idea was still bouncing between us. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=763.3199999999999s)]
*  Finally, he said, you better write it. I said, okay, I better write it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=770.36s)]
*  Along the way, I discovered something that turned it into a book that really [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=776.6s)]
*  sort of spoke to the way I think about the world. It should have been obvious at the time, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=783.0s)]
*  I guess, but it took me a while. I'm slow. It took me a while to get there. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=789.24s)]
*  The microbial world, there is actually a decisive singular moment when it was discovered. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=792.76s)]
*  Microbes are not visible with the naked eye. You needed to develop instruments. The instrument in [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=803.56s)]
*  question is the microscope. That comes about early in the 17th century. People look at all kinds of [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=807.4s)]
*  things with it, but they don't partly because the early microscopes weren't that powerful and partly [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=814.52s)]
*  because it takes a while to realize that with this instrument, it's not just that you can see [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=819.96s)]
*  more detail on things you already know are there. You look at a bee's wing and so forth. One of the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  very famous early books is reports on microscopy is this On the Life of Bees that was written by [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=833.4000000000001s)]
*  two Italians. There are these beautiful drawings of these magnified insects and it's really cool. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=843.0s)]
*  But that really took a step forward when Antony van Leeuwenhoek, and I hope I apologize to my [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=850.44s)]
*  Dutch friends for my butchering that, but he was a Dutch cloth merchant, a draper in Delft. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=858.76s)]
*  Cloth merchants at the time used lenses to inspect the fabric for flaws or whatever. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=871.88s)]
*  And he became interested in that magnified world and he almost certainly saw a copy of Robert [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=877.0799999999999s)]
*  Hooke's Micrographia, which was in some ways the first great popular science text, this book of [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=886.36s)]
*  magnificent microscopic microscope studies of both materials, points of needles and so forth, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=893.24s)]
*  but lots of living things. But again, he had pictures of a flea in the compound eye of insects [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=900.84s)]
*  and so forth. He saw in greater detail things that were again perceivable in some ways by human eyes [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=907.32s)]
*  and didn't penetrate deeper into the invisible realm, invisible to us. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=916.44s)]
*  And that seems to have inspired Leeuwenhoek. It turned out he was a meticulous craftsman. He made [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=921.72s)]
*  these great single lens microscopes, these little drops of glass that were incredibly powerful for [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=929.64s)]
*  the day. He was almost certainly making the most powerful instruments in Europe at the time. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=937.64s)]
*  This work of his started 1673 or so and by 1676 he was really sort of feeling his oats and pointing [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=943.5600000000001s)]
*  his instrument or using his instrument on a wider and wider range of subjects. And he looked at a [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=953.32s)]
*  drop of pond water and in that pond water he saw what he called animaculi, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=961.24s)]
*  animatules, little animals. I love the name. Yeah, that's great. And he saw some things that are [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=974.76s)]
*  probably planaria or other fairly large multicellular microscopic organisms. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=982.6800000000001s)]
*  But then he looked long enough and hard enough and his microscopes were good enough that he [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=990.36s)]
*  actually saw single celled bacteria. And we know he did, not just because he reported it and described [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=996.76s)]
*  it and you can see descriptions, but I think the earliest surviving of his drawings, he was a [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1002.84s)]
*  meticulous craftsman. He drew pictures of lots of stuff that he studied. It comes from 1682 and there [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1009.48s)]
*  are four or five bacteria drawings on it and they are present day identifiable as at least [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1016.2s)]
*  to families of bacteria, if not the specific strain. And those experiments have been replicated. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1025.8s)]
*  Historian of science made a single lens microscope and did it again and said, yes, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1032.6000000000001s)]
*  he could have seen what he said he saw. So yeah, he really saw bacteria. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1039.32s)]
*  And again, he saw them for the first time in 1676 and then he kept observing them. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1046.1200000000001s)]
*  And one of the really interesting things to me is within a very few years, he looked at it in pond [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1050.44s)]
*  water, he looked at it in other liquid sources, he infused peppercorns in water and they, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  because he was interested to see what would happen with the peppercorns, but he also saw microbes [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1063.24s)]
*  there. But at some point he took gunk between his own teeth and looked at that through the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1067.08s)]
*  microscope and saw more bacteria. And why is that significant? At least it's significant to me. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1073.8s)]
*  And the answer is because that's when, you know, that's the first recorded example of recognizing [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1079.32s)]
*  that microbes live inside us. Yeah. No, teeth, you know, gunk between teeth is not very far inside [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1086.76s)]
*  us, but still, you know, it's there and we can, you know, cohabit in the literal sense of the word [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1092.52s)]
*  with this whole microbial universe. That might've been a eureka moment, but it was certainly also a [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  very creepy moment, don't you think? Oh yeah. I mean, it's, but what's interesting is, so the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1106.92s)]
*  question for the book was, all right, that's 1676 and the Robert Koch's demonstration that anthrax [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1113.96s)]
*  is caused by a bacillus B anthracis, a single microbe, which was the first, you know, end to end [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1120.28s)]
*  account of, you know, demonstration that, you know, anthrax is caused by a pathogen. It's this [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1129.3999999999999s)]
*  pathogen and you can replicate it and it's a living, you know, microbial, you know, it's a [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1136.84s)]
*  bacteria. All that was set, you know, Koch did that from two or three days before Christmas in [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1141.64s)]
*  1876 to, you know, two or three, you know, two or three weeks into January, he'd created a chain [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1149.96s)]
*  of infection with these, you know, you take some B anthracis, give it to a rabbit. Then when that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1156.0400000000002s)]
*  rabbit got sick, he'd harvest blood and isolate the bacteria again and give it to the next rabbit and [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1162.3600000000001s)]
*  he created this chain of infection and he isolated the bug and did all those good and even also [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1167.88s)]
*  traced the life cycle of anthrax, which, you know, he caught them in their spore stage and he was [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1174.2s)]
*  able to activate, you know, motile bacteria from the spores. He nailed it in a space of three to [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1180.2s)]
*  four weeks. But that's 200 years after von Leeuwenhoek. And while it is, I think, formally [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1187.96s)]
*  impossible to say with certainty why something doesn't happen, that's still a long time. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1197.48s)]
*  And I wondered why it was so long. What were the impediments to figuring that out? And that's [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1206.1200000000001s)]
*  really where the book got started. And what became exciting as I wrote the book is it became clear to [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1211.8s)]
*  me at least, and I hope I persuade readers, is that the broad outlines of why it was difficult [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1217.56s)]
*  to go from the first observation of microbes to recognizing that they actually matter to us in [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1225.3999999999999s)]
*  really important ways helps that lens helps us understand why we're currently in trouble [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1230.2s)]
*  with infectious disease. Why many of the advances of the last century and a half are now at least [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1237.08s)]
*  at risk if not, you know, already really compromised. Maybe you can help us understand [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1243.32s)]
*  what would have been the mindset of the people in the pre-germ theory era. You've already mentioned [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1248.12s)]
*  miasma theory, but we knew that disease was infectious, or at least infectious diseases are [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1255.0s)]
*  infectious. I'm guessing that people had ideas about how diseases were spread either by touch [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1261.24s)]
*  or breathing or whatever. Was there some consensus as to what they thought happened [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1269.48s)]
*  before they said it was little microbes? Well, that's I mean, for the philosophy of science, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1276.04s)]
*  that's what's so interesting about this case, right? How does a theory get replaced? Well, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1283.48s)]
*  there's the big broad outlines and you can turn to Thomas Kuhn and turn to people who've argued [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  the Kuhn or whatever. But something that I've I really think is true in a bunch of different [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1294.76s)]
*  domains is that the easy conventional sort of high school version that that theories [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1303.56s)]
*  change when a fact comes along that the theory can't accommodate. You know, that's tricky on [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1311.32s)]
*  so many levels. We could talk a lot about that if you wanted. But the problem for [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1319.0s)]
*  make one of the problems for making the connection between microbes and disease [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1325.8000000000002s)]
*  is that there was already a pretty coherent theory of disease that didn't particularly predicts [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1329.72s)]
*  things but it accurately described what was observed. So when you have something like the [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1347.4s)]
*  plague, you know, there were two questions. What is a disease? You know, what's happening when you [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1353.96s)]
*  get sick? And how does a disease move from one person to the next? Those are obviously related [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1363.64s)]
*  questions, but there you can distinguish between them. And there were a variety of detailed [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1370.76s)]
*  accounts of disease and certainly the more people observed different conditions, people recognized [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1379.72s)]
*  the plague as something other than other fevers that you might encounter. And in part, they [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1384.28s)]
*  recognized it because the plague has some characteristic, you know, markers like the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1392.36s)]
*  buboes of the buboes of bubonic plague, these lesions that burst on your skin and so forth. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1398.36s)]
*  And even though they, you know, that's not a universal symptom of the plague, it's common [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1405.4799999999998s)]
*  enough that there are ways to recognize it as the plague and not as, you know, what we would now [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1409.6399999999999s)]
*  call typhoid or something else now recognized as typhoid. But, you know, so there was some, you know, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1416.12s)]
*  I mean, people in the past are not dumber than we are. They have less information or different [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1425.4s)]
*  information, but they're not, you know, stupid. And so there were detailed observations and people [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1431.48s)]
*  obviously wanted to know what was going on when you had a terrible event like the plague. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1437.48s)]
*  But the basic idea is that there is, you know, that healthy bodies are in a form of balance. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1443.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, there was humoral theory, the four humors that have to be in balance, but there are, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1450.04s)]
*  you know, sort of other broader, you know, you could sort of generalize that. You didn't have [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1453.0s)]
*  to be a Galenist and say, no, it's the humors. There were, you know, what were called chemical [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1457.16s)]
*  physicians, which were people who were looking at more detailed accounts of, you know, the [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1464.2s)]
*  substances that make us up. And people were beginning to be aware of bodily systems. I mean, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1471.56s)]
*  this was, you know, William Harvey working out the system of blood circulation is not just important [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1476.52s)]
*  for that one story. It sort of gives you a way to think about how the body works that was distinct [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1481.56s)]
*  from what went before. But overall, the idea is, you know, when your healthier body is in balance [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1489.1599999999999s)]
*  and ill health is some derangement of that balance. And if you think about it, you know, as a sort of [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1495.08s)]
*  broad statement, you know, that's, it's still true. It's a metaphorical way of talking about [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1501.08s)]
*  what's going on. Yeah. Look, you know, think about diabetes. It's a problem of insulin regulation. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1507.72s)]
*  Well, when your insulin regulatory system is working as it should, you know, you don't have [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1513.0800000000002s)]
*  diabetes. And when it isn't, you do. That's a form of imbalance. It's still, you know, it's not a [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1518.92s)]
*  crazy concept. It's a perfectly understandable one. And it adequately described what was observed [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1523.96s)]
*  with the naked eye. And similarly with the spread, the origins, you know, where does the first case [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1531.16s)]
*  come from? And then how does it spread? There were, you know, a range of possible sources. I mean, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1537.48s)]
*  ultimately, the source was God. God, you know, had was expressing judgment on individuals or societies. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1545.48s)]
*  And this judgment, you know, the, you know, the judgment was expressed through the events that [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1555.0800000000002s)]
*  happened to you in life, including illness. But, you know, it was well established that [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1559.96s)]
*  people live in the material world and divine judgments and the devil's blandishments, etc. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1568.8400000000001s)]
*  occur through natural means. There was a, a scientistic approach to understanding both, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1574.44s)]
*  you know, satanic and divine regulation of the world or interaction with the world. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1581.08s)]
*  And so you look for things like, and, you know, that's where miasmas come in. It's, you know, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1586.12s)]
*  literally bad air. It could come from an emanation from the earth. It could be, you know, the foulness [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1591.0s)]
*  of, you know, in a, you know, as you move forward in time, the idea is that the bad city conditions, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1598.28s)]
*  unhygienic conditions produce these miasmas that are deranging. You don't need to have some [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1608.04s)]
*  sort of supernatural or origin for these things. They can be perfectly straightforward. And again, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1613.48s)]
*  you know, when you think about it, and this is sort of skipping ahead in the book, this is where [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1619.32s)]
*  some of the critical ideas of the 19th century came in. You don't need to know about germs [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1623.32s)]
*  specifically to recognize the correlation between, you know, fetid odors and decaying flesh and so [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1628.04s)]
*  forth as not great things to, you know, raise your kids immersed in. So you have all this [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1637.08s)]
*  knowledge and you have a persuasive, and the great thing about miasmas is you don't have to invent [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1644.76s)]
*  a mechanism for carrying them from place to place because if it's in the air or if it's, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1651.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, somehow in the environment, it can move from person to person. And, you know, there was [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1655.7199999999998s)]
*  the idea of contagion, which, you know, comes from the root to touch, you know, so obviously [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1661.48s)]
*  handling somebody diseased was understood as a risk for the person doing the work. But also [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1667.96s)]
*  contagion as a concept sort of grew more indirect. I mean, I had the image in my head of the old 1950s [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1676.1200000000001s)]
*  early slush box automatic transmissions, you know, the hydromatic where the gear changes are carried [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1684.68s)]
*  through water. You know, you don't actually have a direct mechanical connection between bits of [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1690.12s)]
*  metal. You know, the idea of early disease contagion being kind of hydromatic contagion [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1694.1999999999998s)]
*  sorry, struck me as a sort of plausible metaphor. But all that, you know, you can look at the great [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1703.1599999999999s)]
*  plague of London, which is sort of where the book proper starts, and you've got a sufficient [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1712.6799999999998s)]
*  explanation. Now, you did have people who were looking both for specific treatments that might [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1718.6s)]
*  actually help with the plague, and they had, you know, no idea and the things that were proposed [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1726.12s)]
*  were ineffective, though, in some cases may have made people more comfortable when they were [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1731.08s)]
*  asked to drink more alcohol or something. But you also had, you know, some attempt to think about [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1735.56s)]
*  what kind of substance, what seeds of disease in the language of the time might be going from, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1744.52s)]
*  you know, what was in the miasma? What was the, you know, the active ingredient as it were? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1750.84s)]
*  And again, you know, all that is fully plausible, and you can squint just right and see in this [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1756.12s)]
*  concept of seeds of disease, seeds of disease, a precursor, something, an idea that could lead [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1763.56s)]
*  you to microbes. But there was nothing in the thinking of the time that required them. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1771.4s)]
*  And there was no indication that whatever these seeds might be, you know, they could be, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1777.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, inert, they could be, you know, they could be sort of gaseous, they could be almost [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1782.52s)]
*  anything, right? There's no pointer towards, you know, some specific identifiable, you know, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1788.44s)]
*  living element. Of course, during the Great Plague of London, this was, you know, 10 years [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1800.44s)]
*  before Leeuwenhoek first saw microbes. But, you know, there were diseases that went, you know, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1804.92s)]
*  diseases didn't stop in 1676, obviously. But this is something that's interesting that comes out in [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1810.1200000000001s)]
*  the book. It is quite a span of time in between Van Leeuwenhoek and then the acceptance of the [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1814.6000000000001s)]
*  germ theory of disease. But not only were people fighting disease at the time, they were doing so, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1820.04s)]
*  at least sometimes, in ways that in retrospect make perfect sense if you believe the germ theory [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1826.04s)]
*  of disease. So in the book, you talk about John Snow is a famous guy, Florence Nightingale, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1832.6s)]
*  as the nurse and a lot of modern methods of being clean and well behaved. But the one I have to ask [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1840.04s)]
*  about, since we don't have infinite time, is Cotton Mather, who is more famous for other reasons. But [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1847.72s)]
*  apparently he was quite the experimental medical doctor. Well, I wouldn't, he's more of an eager [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1853.64s)]
*  magpie than an actual rigorous experiment. I mean, he, so Cotton Mather, of course, is a Puritan [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1861.0s)]
*  minister. He's most famous for his role in the Salem witch trials in which he deeply believed in [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1870.2s)]
*  the truth of the testimony of those who are accusing people of being witches [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1880.1200000000001s)]
*  and believed in sort of dream evidence. I dreamed this happened and thought that that was how Satan [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1884.2s)]
*  would communicate and was thus directly implicated in the deaths of a lot of people [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1891.0s)]
*  who were clearly, you know, shouldn't have been killed. And at the same time, you know, and he [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1897.72s)]
*  was part of this, he was not just a Puritan, any Puritan minister, he was, you know, if there can [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1906.44s)]
*  be such a thing, he was part of the Puritan aristocracy. His father and uncles and I mean, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1910.52s)]
*  his whole family was basically in the business of being Puritan leaders. And, you know, he's a very [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1915.48s)]
*  funny character. He apparently, when he was a student at Harvard, back in the day, he apparently [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1925.24s)]
*  had some inclination to become a doctor, to study medicine. But of course, the pull of the family [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1933.64s)]
*  business was too strong. Family business being a minister. Yeah, exactly. He was, you know, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1939.96s)]
*  he was ordained in and gave his first sermon at his father's church, which was the leading church [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1947.16s)]
*  in Boston. When he was ordained, something like 20% of the population of Boston was in the audience. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1951.4s)]
*  I mean, he was like, you know, he was a big deal. His family was a big deal in that line of work. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1958.52s)]
*  But he was all he was clearly also both intellectually ambitious and interested in [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1964.6s)]
*  the natural world. And so, you know, 20, 30 years after the witch trials, he started writing to the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1973.4s)]
*  Royal Society in London with these sort of American curiosities. And some of these things were just [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1980.76s)]
*  bonkers. Remember, Royal Society early on was itself, you know, ranged from this incredibly [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1985.72s)]
*  serious important stuff to, you know, you look at it and you laugh. I mean, Robert Boyle, the great, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=1993.64s)]
*  you know, sort of patron saint of chemistry, very early on in the Royal Society's history, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2000.04s)]
*  read a paper to the assembled fellows about a monstrous calf. You know, I mean, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2005.64s)]
*  it ranged, you know, truly their interest ranged all over the map. And Mather presented these sort [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2012.9199999999998s)]
*  of American wonders, some of them very, you know, very real interesting bits of natural history, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2018.36s)]
*  some of them these sort of legends that he seems to have accepted credulously. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2023.8s)]
*  And the Royal Society loved him and published him and made him a fellow of the Royal Society. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2028.4399999999998s)]
*  And he was also really as part of his ministry as much as and his intellectual life, very interested [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2034.36s)]
*  in all things related to medicine and health. And he collected anecdotes, he collected recipes [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2041.48s)]
*  that people, you know, had for, you know, cures or nostrums. And he really, I think, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2046.76s)]
*  had a sense that it was sort of his duty as a minister and essentially a representative of God [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2061.72s)]
*  on Earth to do what he could for, you know, the health and well-being of both his community, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2068.76s)]
*  but sort of, you know, by communicating with the Royal Society or whatever the world at large. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2076.1200000000003s)]
*  And he was, in fact, genuinely one of the pioneers of vaccination, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2082.6800000000003s)]
*  being one of the earliest proponents of smallpox inoculation or variolation, as it's sometimes [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2090.2799999999997s)]
*  called, where you take smallpox material from somebody who's suffering from a hopefully mild [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2099.24s)]
*  case of the disease and you scratch, you know, scratch marks into a healthy person's arm or arms, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2104.12s)]
*  they often did it in multiple limbs, and you mix this stuff in. And the idea is to give the person [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2110.8399999999997s)]
*  a mild case, a very, hopefully very mild case of smallpox and thus confer on them what had already [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2117.48s)]
*  been observed to be the result of a smallpox infection if you survived, which was lifelong [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2124.04s)]
*  immunity to any further cases of the disease. And it's not literally vaccination. You've not, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2128.28s)]
*  you know, developed a vaccine, but inoculation is sort of the broader category of which vaccines [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2134.6s)]
*  are an example. Right. And it's, this is the earliest attempts in Western Europe and the Americas [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2139.7999999999997s)]
*  to engineer immunity to a naturally occurring disease. And that's, that to me is the distinction [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2148.2s)]
*  that's key because vaccines are a particular way to engineer that immunity. Mather learned about [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2154.2s)]
*  this technique first from his slave, an African man who had been gifted to him by members of his [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2161.8799999999997s)]
*  congregation who told him about undergoing this procedure in Africa. And then when in the mid-1710s, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2168.92s)]
*  the Royal Society published two papers from doctors working in the near East, in Turkey, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2179.32s)]
*  and one was from, definitely in Turkey, I'm trying to remember where the other one was working, I [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2188.6800000000003s)]
*  can't, can't off the top of my head. Anyway, that also described the use of this, you know, inoculation, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2192.92s)]
*  smallpox inoculation in Turkish medicine. Mather wrote to the secretary of the Royal Society, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2199.8s)]
*  having seen this paper and said, you know, I can attest that my servant, as he called him his slave, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2206.6800000000003s)]
*  had already told him about this and that he followed this up with conversations from other [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2215.0s)]
*  people with knowledge of Africa. And that this seemed to him such a promising, promising [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2220.2s)]
*  preventative for this, you know, really deadly, horrible scourge of a disease [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2229.0s)]
*  that should smallpox visit Boston again, he said, I will attempt to, you know, get this method used. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2235.64s)]
*  And sure enough, a few years later in 1721, smallpox comes back to Boston and Mather [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2243.16s)]
*  tries to persuade Boston's medical community to do inoculation. Only one member of that community [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2249.8s)]
*  agrees to do so. Others vehemently oppose him. A common theme in the book, like we said. Right. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2255.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, and the interesting thing is they oppose him for multiple reasons. One, there is, you know, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2263.8s)]
*  certainly there's risk and there are dangers involved. You're doing, you know, the human [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2267.08s)]
*  subjects committee might have had some words to say, right? But the other reason is, you know, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2270.92s)]
*  this was a proxy for a battle over power. You know, you know, sort of professional power who [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2276.84s)]
*  had the right to do medicine, you know, not Puritan ministers, God damn it. You know, there [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2282.44s)]
*  was one European trained MD in Boston at the time who bitterly resent, clearly bitterly resented [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2289.0s)]
*  the incursion into his prerogatives, but also was more broadly part of a broader power struggle [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2296.76s)]
*  in Boston where a number of people up to and including, you know, James Franklin, Ben Franklin's [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2303.4s)]
*  brother, who was the publisher of the first independent non-censored newspaper in the [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2310.2000000000003s)]
*  colony, were saying, you know, we've got to reduce the influence of Puritan ministers. And this is a [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2316.28s)]
*  club to beat, you know, Mather with and by extension, the Puritan establishment. And so there was this [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2321.56s)]
*  a significant resistance up to the point of a direct attack, you know, on Mather's life. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2331.24s)]
*  Somebody threw a bomb through his window, which fortunately didn't explode. But, you know, no joke. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2337.48s)]
*  Yeah. And so ultimately, they were able to inoculate a few hundred Bostonians with [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2343.48s)]
*  almost entirely good results, while several thousand Bostonians got sick and something like [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2355.2400000000002s)]
*  14% of them died. And, you know, the question was, those were lives that could have been saved. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2364.44s)]
*  Right. So the inoculated people essentially all survived. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2373.0s)]
*  Essentially, there's a bit of controversy because a few died. And the question was, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2377.6400000000003s)]
*  were they already ill or had they died of something else? And the person who was doing [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2382.52s)]
*  the inoculation said, yes, they were all, you know, it wasn't me. And, you know, it's hard to say [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2386.36s)]
*  exactly, but the proportion of people who suffered serious, yeah, a huge proportion of Boston got sick, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2392.84s)]
*  a substantial chunk of them. And it was a relatively mild strain of smallpox, clearly, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2400.36s)]
*  because a 14% death rate was below the average. But still, that's, you know, a lot of people. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2405.08s)]
*  Yeah. Boston was under 10,000 people. And I think, again, I'm pulling, I should look at the book [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2411.8799999999997s)]
*  right now, something like 900 people died. So it's, you know, that's a big chunk of Boston. Right. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2417.0s)]
*  And, you know, and the objections to this inoculation campaign were sort of the prototype [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2424.6s)]
*  for what would come after some legitimate medical concerns and a lot of other stuff [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2436.12s)]
*  going on at the same time, political issues, cultural reluctance to, you know, attempt whatever [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2441.16s)]
*  was going on, specific social enmity, right? You know, all those things mix in. And that's not what [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2446.7599999999998s)]
*  you think of usually as an explanation for why some scientific event doesn't happen. You do. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2454.7599999999998s)]
*  They all read some science. You do. If you know a little bit about the history, so that's not [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2458.8399999999997s)]
*  surprising to me. Speaking of personalities and conflicts and things like that, let's leap [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2462.92s)]
*  forward to the real germs. And Louis Pasteur, I guess, is the first person to talk about. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2469.16s)]
*  Obviously, from your book, I get the impression that on the one hand, he deserves as much credit [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2475.0s)]
*  as he gets. He really did do a lot of other things. On the other hand, just like the more [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2480.36s)]
*  familiar examples to me of Newton and Leibniz, there were rivalries and jealousies and bitter [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2486.28s)]
*  priority disputes going on. Absolutely. Just to put a mark on it, I hope we can cycle back to the [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2491.96s)]
*  story of childbed fever, because that's a really classic and important case in this, you know, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it sets up some of what we're seeing now. Oh, we can talk about childbed fever. Let's do it. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2506.44s)]
*  Yeah, we're not going to run out of electrons. Okay. So childbed fever, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2510.04s)]
*  puerpol fever is an infection. There are actually a number of different bacteria that can produce [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2515.2400000000002s)]
*  its symptoms. And it happens to women who have just given birth. And it can be devastating. I mean, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2522.76s)]
*  it's very frequently fatal. And what's interesting is there's a whole sort of social history dimension [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2533.5600000000004s)]
*  to it. Puerpol fever is described in ancient Pythagorean texts even. So people knew about it [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2543.8s)]
*  in antiquity. And it clearly is a disease that didn't just pop up in Europe in the 16th, 17th [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2554.52s)]
*  century. But there was a change that happened. Up until sometime in the 16th to 17th century, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2561.48s)]
*  childbirth had been largely the province of women. It was handled by midwives. And it's very local. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2573.16s)]
*  So if you wouldn't have in a village, 12 women giving birth in the same week, right? That's not [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2583.64s)]
*  usually how it worked. And reports of puerpol fever are sparse from that period. And partly [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2591.08s)]
*  they're sparse because that community was not a writing community. There weren't journals of [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2601.0s)]
*  midwives and so forth and so on. But as European cities grow and power centralizes and you have [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2606.36s)]
*  things like increasingly formal associations of medical experts, in some sense, doctors, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2618.84s)]
*  childbirth becomes increasingly sort of overtaken by male doctors. And at least in the cities, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2628.6s)]
*  happens in hospitals where you do get a lot of women in the room at the same time giving birth. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2636.68s)]
*  And that's when you start to see not just individual cases of puerpol fever popping up [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2645.7999999999997s)]
*  from time to time. Bad luck. The wrong bacteria happened to be in the lying in chamber. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2650.04s)]
*  That could happen. But when it happens in a lying in hospital, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2657.6400000000003s)]
*  you have the perfect conditions for the bacteria, the pathogens to move from patient to patient. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2666.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's what happened. Very early on in the history of the hospital, you have [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2673.4s)]
*  reports of essentially epidemic puerpol fever. The problem with hospitals is they're full of [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2682.2000000000003s)]
*  sick people. It's a terrible place to go. They're full of sick people. And if you have a person [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2686.6s)]
*  attending a delivery and then wiping their hands off and moving on to the next person, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2697.64s)]
*  you can see where the problem might arise. So over the course of the 17th and 18th century, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2703.56s)]
*  there are repeated reports of outbreaks of puerpol fever where dozens or more women will suffer [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2711.56s)]
*  and many die from this condition. And you start seeing conditions. You might have a two or three [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2719.96s)]
*  year run where there's just this ongoing transmission of puerpol fever. And again, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2730.44s)]
*  up there were a whole bunch of different theories adduced as to how this might happen. It didn't [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2736.04s)]
*  appear to be a contagious disease. Because if a woman in a hospital falls sick and then [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2741.48s)]
*  a woman in a home falls sick, unless you notice that the same person attended both births, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2750.92s)]
*  it doesn't appear that there's any connection. The two people don't touch each other, all that sort [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2760.04s)]
*  of stuff. So there was no urgent need to try and identify a course of causation. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2764.2s)]
*  But people did notice that the explanations for how some derangement of how the milk was being [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2776.52s)]
*  expressed or other issues that might attend a difficult childbirth, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2788.12s)]
*  that didn't really explain why you'd get clusters of cases in a place and time. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2796.12s)]
*  And so in 1795, well before the conventional story is this is all worked out in the 1840s [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2803.16s)]
*  in Austria. But no, in 1795, this doctor in that well known center of medical research, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2810.6s)]
*  Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1795, a local doctor started delivering babies and took notes on [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2819.64s)]
*  the midwives who were delivering babies. And there was this ongoing chain of infections [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2836.52s)]
*  and people suffering and dying of purple fever. And he tried a couple of different explanations. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2842.44s)]
*  He looked at weather reports to see if there was a correlation with weather conditions. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2850.52s)]
*  I mean, again, there was no base of knowledge or theoretical insight that drove this. Purely [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2854.36s)]
*  empirical, what's going on? So he looked for correlations. And eventually he started noticing [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2860.84s)]
*  that there was not, it didn't take him that long. He started noticing that there were [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2864.92s)]
*  sequences of infection. Both he and the midwives would go from patient to patient to patient. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2869.16s)]
*  And those patients would in sequence come down with this terrible, debilitating, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2874.36s)]
*  too often fatal condition. And he wrote it up and he said, basically, we're the cause. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2881.64s)]
*  He didn't say it basically, he said it explicitly. He said it shocked him to realize that he had been [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2888.36s)]
*  the source of his patient suffering. And he wrote this and published it in 1795. And nothing [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2893.4s)]
*  happened. He was basically driven out of town. The midwives were furious at him for suggesting [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2902.84s)]
*  that they might be killing their patients. He didn't get picked up in London. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2909.8s)]
*  So something happened, but not acceptance of his ideas. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2914.44s)]
*  Yeah. And a few years later, he died of, I think, tuberculosis and was basically lost to history. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2918.12s)]
*  And there's no, but the idea was there. And if you looked at that and you could say, okay, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2925.72s)]
*  there is something that is moving from patient to patient on the doctor's hands or on the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2933.48s)]
*  midwife's hands. And we need to interrupt that. That was not a difficult leap to make, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2938.44s)]
*  but it didn't get made. And science didn't know about microbes at that era. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2946.52s)]
*  They did not. They knew about microbes existing. They did not connect them with disease. I know [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2950.52s)]
*  we're sort of looping and looping. One of the most interesting things in the book, one of the things [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2957.48s)]
*  I found most surprising was that Cotton Mather in the 1720s, Cotton Mather, witch burner, actually [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2960.76s)]
*  wrote down a suggestion that Levin Hook's animacules might be the cause of diseases. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2970.76s)]
*  And he even got, says, different animacules could cause different diseases. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2980.1200000000003s)]
*  He wrote it down. The book he wrote it down in was a manuscript at his death and wasn't actually [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2986.36s)]
*  published until the 1970s. And he almost certainly derived the idea from somebody else, a doctor who [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2992.2000000000003s)]
*  wrote in this one brief mention in a British paper. And again, these ideas were thinkable. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=2998.92s)]
*  People could imagine it clearly. We have that absolute existence proof, right? But it struck [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3005.2400000000002s)]
*  no chord. And the idea essentially disappeared for well over a hundred years, which is still to me. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3012.36s)]
*  I try to explain it. I think I do explain it. But when you just stop and think about it for a [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3020.6800000000003s)]
*  minute, it's mystifying and incredibly saddening when you think about how much loss and pain and [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3025.32s)]
*  suffering derive from the fact that nobody picked up on that. Well, there's a lot of ideas in the [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3031.48s)]
*  history of science that nobody picks up on. But here's something where it's kind of obviously [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3036.76s)]
*  important to make progress on this. And you might hope that people are responsibly searching around [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3041.56s)]
*  for every possible hypothesis to go test. You would. And one of the things to, if people [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3050.68s)]
*  listening to this take one thing out of it, the truly remarkable thing that Levenhuk did is he [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3060.8399999999997s)]
*  revealed not just more information about something, but a whole new realm of material existence that [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3069.7999999999997s)]
*  no one had suspected existed before. Up until that moment, we didn't know about the microbial [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3080.28s)]
*  world, the microcosmos. And it's there. And we now know how incredibly rich and important it is and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3087.7200000000003s)]
*  how deeply embedded in the history of life on earth and all the different things we can now say [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3093.8s)]
*  about microbes. But it seems to me analogous to the impact that we would feel if we got definitive [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3098.28s)]
*  proof of life on another planet. It's that revelatory. And you would have thought that [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3113.48s)]
*  that would have led to more speculation. I mean, again, to sort of push the analogy, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3124.68s)]
*  think of all the writing from people in the 19th century and on about life on other planets. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3129.64s)]
*  That very early movie of the Lumiere brothers' journey to the moon. I mean, the idea of clearly [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3140.44s)]
*  the existence of other worlds beyond our own is enormously stimulating the imagination. Well, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3146.2s)]
*  here was a whole other world, wholly unsuspected, teeming with creatures that are unlike the [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3152.68s)]
*  creatures we see with our naked eye, that have different shapes and different means of locomotion, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3158.44s)]
*  that have apparently whole societies, ecosystems, interactions going on that have been there all [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3163.16s)]
*  along beyond the limits of our senses. And now they're there. I am a little perplexed why that [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3170.12s)]
*  wasn't crazier. Right? You know, why that didn't make people jump more. But just as, I mean, I know [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3178.04s)]
*  I rabid on too long about such stuff, but just to sort of round off the purple fever story, flash [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3185.48s)]
*  forward to Boston in the 1840s, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., mediocre poet, Boston Brahman, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3191.0s)]
*  and medical doctor, at that point a young medical doctor. And he, at a meeting of a local medical [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3198.92s)]
*  society, somebody raised the question about how you can explain a then ongoing purple fever [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3205.88s)]
*  outbreak. And Holmes took it on himself to try and study it. Unlike this doctor in Scotland, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3213.7200000000003s)]
*  Holmes was not, you know, he didn't have an OB practice. He wasn't delivering babies. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3224.92s)]
*  He was a young and relatively inexperienced doctor at that point. And he just did this from the [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3229.2400000000002s)]
*  records, you know, case records. And he tracked this, tracked the births, cases of purple fever, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3235.48s)]
*  deaths, and attendance. And he, you know, in a relatively short period of time, he reported [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3243.96s)]
*  back to the medical society that, yeah, in fact, there are patterns of infection and the common [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3250.84s)]
*  element is the doctor. And, you know, what needs to happen is the doctor has to make sure, [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3256.84s)]
*  or the midwife, I mean, the medical person attending the birth needs to make sure that they are, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3261.96s)]
*  you know, fully cleansed of, you know, whatever is going on between births. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3268.7599999999998s)]
*  And he published this, as well as giving it as a society talk. And again, not only did sort of [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3277.4s)]
*  nothing deeply change, he got a severe and, you know, actually contemptuous pushback from established, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3285.48s)]
*  you know, senior American OB-GYN practitioners. And the one that really stuck in mind was this, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3296.52s)]
*  you know, perhaps the top such doctor in the US at the time, a Philadelphia doctor named [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3304.04s)]
*  Meigs or Migs, M-E-I-G-S, again, I'm not sure how it was pronounced, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3309.16s)]
*  responded that it was, you know, that Holmes writing was the maunderings of a sophomore [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3315.08s)]
*  and that what he concluded couldn't be true because, and I quote, a gentleman's hands are clean. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3322.2799999999997s)]
*  There you go. Q-E-D. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3330.52s)]
*  Right. And then, you know, the story sort of concludes with the most well-known on which is [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3332.76s)]
*  Ignat Semmelweis working in the Vienna General Hospital with the two wards where there's one [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3338.6s)]
*  ward handled by midwives who do not do pathology, do not dissect the bodies of women who have died [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3344.44s)]
*  of portable fever. And the other ward run by doctors and male medical students who do, in fact, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3351.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, this is part of the great transformation of medicine into a science. You do pathology, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3357.24s)]
*  you study the diseases in the body by dissecting and analyzing the corpses. And, you know, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3362.04s)]
*  mostly this was this enormously rigorous and productive advance in the way you [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3368.2799999999997s)]
*  teach and think about medicine. It leads to all kinds of good stuff, but not here. So, you know, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3373.3999999999996s)]
*  you dissect somebody who dies of portable fever and guess what you have on your hands and body [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3380.2799999999997s)]
*  and clothes if you're not, if you don't sterilize yourself. And so lots of twists and turns in the [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3385.56s)]
*  story, but Semmelweis figures out that this is the meaningful distinction between the two outcomes. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3393.08s)]
*  The midwives ward has a very, very low rate of purple fever and as many as 10% of the patients [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3399.4s)]
*  in the other ward fall victim to it. So it's a, you know, it's a big deal. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3405.72s)]
*  And he says, okay, we're going to stop this. He puts a chlorine solution [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3410.44s)]
*  that, you know, next to the autopsy room and says, you can't go back to the ward until you [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3417.24s)]
*  wash your hands thoroughly until there's no smell left. You know, again, didn't know about germs. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3421.7999999999997s)]
*  He didn't know what it was. He just said, there's these, you know, cadaverous particles. And you got [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3426.04s)]
*  them, you know, they're associated with death. So you've got to wash the stink of death off you. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3431.48s)]
*  And that turned out to be enough, long enough, enough sterilization so that the, you know, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3436.04s)]
*  when that was done, the doctor's ward very rapidly approached the same levels of infection [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3441.56s)]
*  that the midwives had already achieved. So it was, you know, again, he had no idea what, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3452.92s)]
*  just cadaverous particles. He had no idea what was causing the disease, what the pathology of [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3458.6s)]
*  disease was, how it developed, what the, you know, chemical biochemical mechanism, none of that. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3462.36s)]
*  All he knew is that when medical students and doctors walked from cutting up a corpse [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3468.6800000000003s)]
*  to delivering a baby, bad things happened. Let's stop those bad things, right? Let's just pull a [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3475.7200000000003s)]
*  wall between them. And again, you know, the tragedy is he was not, though he got his ideas, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3480.6800000000003s)]
*  got some traction in some places. Broadly, his conclusions were rejected both within the German [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3487.08s)]
*  speaking world and beyond. And it took, you know, several more decades before the idea of proper [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3493.0s)]
*  sterile conditions really took hold. Well, and when Pasteur does eventually come along and sort of [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3503.08s)]
*  put things together and put the germ theory on a proper footing, his inspiration or his route into [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3512.92s)]
*  it was not through trying to cure diseases, right? That was a clear thing to try to do, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3520.28s)]
*  but he was just trying to make sure that you made wine correctly and reliably. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3524.52s)]
*  He did refer to it, it was sort of a term at the time, diseases of beer and wine. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3529.96s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3535.7200000000003s)]
*  Metaphor clearly in his mind. But yeah, his, you know, the first real demonstration of a, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3537.0s)]
*  you know, of a bad thing happening because of the metabolic work of a bacterium was Pasteur's study [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3544.76s)]
*  of making beet juice. So he had, this was in the 1860s, he had a, maybe it might have been late [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3556.68s)]
*  1850s, excuse me, I misspoke. He had a student, he was a young professor of chemistry, he was not [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3566.2s)]
*  a biologist, he was certainly not a physician. He was teaching chemistry at the University of Lille [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3573.56s)]
*  and one of his students was the son of a local manufacturer who made beet alcohol, among other [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3580.04s)]
*  products. And they were having a bad run at the time where, you know, instead of producing alcohol, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3586.84s)]
*  they produce this foul smelling useless substance. And, you know, they want to know why and Pasteur [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3592.2s)]
*  agreed to take a look and eventually identified a lactic acid bacterium. So instead of, you know, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3597.48s)]
*  yeast metabolizing sugar and water into alcohol, you had lactic acid bacteria metabolizing [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3604.68s)]
*  their inputs into this foul smelling, nasty, industrially useless lactic acid, hence the name, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3614.68s)]
*  within the beet juice. And he was able to say basically, you want to make sure your [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3623.24s)]
*  your vats of beet juice are free of these bacteria before you go in and, you know, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3630.2s)]
*  give them some insight into industrial processes. But that was the first insight where he saw [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3634.2s)]
*  that two things really, that bacteria free floating in the atmosphere, microbes free floating in the [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3641.3999999999996s)]
*  atmosphere could reach and, you know, affect substances like beer, wine, beet juice, soup, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3647.3199999999997s)]
*  whatever. So there's this notion that there is this, you know, potential pathogens that we are [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3656.6s)]
*  surrounded by all the time. And that these microbes actually do have meaningful large scale physical [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3664.12s)]
*  effects on, you know, the scale that human beings occupy. And there are a whole series, I mean, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3672.52s)]
*  he did, there was that insight took him in a bunch of different directions. It included, you know, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3679.16s)]
*  finally, his often regarded as the definitive and final destruction of the concept of the [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3686.2s)]
*  spontaneous generation of life. Right. And, but it also took him through into a bunch of different [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3695.64s)]
*  aspects of infection and this sort of just microbial role in biochemical processes more [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3702.8399999999997s)]
*  generally. Well, that's what I learned from that part of the book was that, you know, an important [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3710.7599999999998s)]
*  aspect of it, because it's always hard when we know or we think we know now what is going on, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3715.08s)]
*  like, why didn't they know? It's not that hard. But the existence of the microbes was known, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3719.24s)]
*  but the idea that they could have an effect was less clear, right? Like, you know, people thought [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3725.16s)]
*  that for the wine thing, there were chemical reactions. Sure. But the idea that these little [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3731.96s)]
*  beasties are contributing to those chemical reactions was apparently a little bit of a barrier. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3736.12s)]
*  It was, yeah, it took a long time. I mean, it took a long time even to associate yeast with [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3741.64s)]
*  with the fermentation. And then the idea that you have yeast that are doing fermentation, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3746.2s)]
*  but these bacteria, which are, you know, yet smaller and simpler organisms, can muck it up, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3751.8799999999997s)]
*  can produce different fermentations that lead to results we don't want. That was, you know, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3757.64s)]
*  another big step. But the, you know, I think this is where one of the theme, you know, this is where [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3763.16s)]
*  I argue something that I think is, I hope, one of the, you know, one of the bits in the book [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3770.04s)]
*  that people engage with. I mean, they feel free to disagree, but, you know, asking the question, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3779.24s)]
*  why did it take so long? You are ultimately asking for, you know, cultural and social reasons. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3784.36s)]
*  And the, you know, a gentleman's hands are clean is one example of essentially [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3789.8s)]
*  hierarchical thinking. There is a social order and people at the top of the order are not [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3794.68s)]
*  capable of and certainly not responsible for bad things happening lower down. Well, there's a broader [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3799.88s)]
*  sense of that. And I think it starts in religion, but certainly doesn't just stay there. This notion, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3806.12s)]
*  you know, the, the, the, uh, scali, naturi in Latin scale of nature, and often referred to as [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3812.04s)]
*  the great chain of being, um, which was the title of one of the classic books in cultural history, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3819.4s)]
*  Lovejoy's the great chain of, of being. Um, but you know, it's this notion and you see it in the [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3825.8s)]
*  first chapter of Genesis that, you know, there is God, there are heavenly creatures, and then [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3830.76s)]
*  there's humankind and all the rest of creation is given into our dominion explicitly in the text of [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3838.1200000000003s)]
*  the, you know, that first chapter of Genesis. And this gets elaborated in a bunch of different ways. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3845.8s)]
*  And you get, you know, by the middle ages and later, you get these, you know, beautiful, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3850.2000000000003s)]
*  elaborate drawings showing, you know, an old white haired gentleman, gentleman sitting on a throne at [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3853.72s)]
*  the top and angels with their wings and then people, and then all the way down to rocks and dirt, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3860.4399999999996s)]
*  you know, through all, through the ranges, you know, some hierarchically organized, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3865.3999999999996s)]
*  uh, view of, of the, the kingdom of life and so forth. Um, and one of the things that that [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3870.12s)]
*  structure, I think makes it easy to believe and hard to disbelieve is that, um, authority goes [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3878.6800000000003s)]
*  from the top down and not the authority and agency and not the other way. Right. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3888.04s)]
*  Effect. So, uh, I think, and again, you, you see those ideas, it doesn't have to be divine, you know, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3893.2400000000002s)]
*  or the divinity and the explicitly religious framing of it can become, can drift very far into [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3901.96s)]
*  the background. Um, the idea that, you know, humankind is superior to the animals is one that [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3908.52s)]
*  you can believe without needing to have, you know, the authority of Genesis. Uh, the idea of white [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3913.64s)]
*  people are, are entitled to rule, um, others is certainly one that was persuasive to an awful lot [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3920.04s)]
*  of people for a long, long time. And perhaps to some of our, some folks still, you know, the, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3926.76s)]
*  the higher, the, the idea that there is a hierarchy of agency and authority, right. Is one that [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3932.36s)]
*  persists in lots of different domains. And I think it mattered here. I think it was very, very hard [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3938.0400000000004s)]
*  to imagine that microbes, which were delightful to look at. And it's wonderful to do like be a [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3944.28s)]
*  tourist in the microcosmos. Um, the idea that they could turn around and have, you know, agency or, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3949.48s)]
*  or impact on, you know, us crowns of creation. It's a very hard, hard thought to think. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3957.64s)]
*  You need to, I think, and, and that's one of the things I think I chronicle in the book, you need [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3965.64s)]
*  to accumulate a lot of, um, you know, ideas and, um, and specific instances where you see [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3969.32s)]
*  something is going on in the disease process that needs explanation, um, to really kind of [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3980.1200000000003s)]
*  let go of the idea that, um, that in some sense, the bad things that happen to humans, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3987.56s)]
*  humans do to each other. Yeah. That's an easy idea, easy idea to master, you know, you, but, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=3995.8s)]
*  but to, to extend that and say, well, you know, despite our big brains and our, you know, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4001.48s)]
*  opposable thumbs and our tool using, um, these, you know, single celled, simple creatures can [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4006.1200000000003s)]
*  really mess us up. That takes some thinking. Okay. And do we properly give Pestor credit for [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4012.84s)]
*  finally saying that out loud clearly for everyone to see? I know there was some controversy. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4021.56s)]
*  Uh, I mean, yes, I think Pestor and Robert Koch are the two people who are, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4027.0s)]
*  who are most associated as the, the, the major founding figures in germ theory. Um, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4031.64s)]
*  and yes, they did, they were enormously, um, uh, you know, they had enormous impact. They made [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4038.44s)]
*  major discoveries. Um, they were rivals. Um, I, Pestor really did try to undermine, um, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4044.92s)]
*  Koch's, uh, sort of claim of unique discovery with, with the anthrax, uh, bacterium. Um, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4054.52s)]
*  probably, uh, you know, he, uh, Pestor did important stuff with anthrax, including coming [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4061.7200000000003s)]
*  up with an anthrax vaccine. Um, but, uh, but, uh, he certainly over overstated and, you know, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4067.48s)]
*  he, he, he, he did mess with Koch. Koch did not take that well and responded, you know, really [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4074.44s)]
*  in, in very hostile and even more belittle in terms to pasture. Most of that just doesn't matter. I [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4081.64s)]
*  mean, it didn't matter at the time. Both people, you know, went on and had, had the careers they [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4087.96s)]
*  had without really impediment. Um, it just clearly pissed them both off. And there was an [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4092.52s)]
*  enormous, at that point, I also remember there's an enormous Franco German rivalries. Exactly. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4099.56s)]
*  Yeah. Stomped France in the, in the, the war of 1870. Um, so there was that nationalistic animus [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4105.16s)]
*  as well. Um, but again, it's important to realize that, that, um, I think, you know, one of the [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4111.72s)]
*  pasture seeded some of the first major, uh, you know, derivatives of, of germ theory, uh, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4120.12s)]
*  news of his work on yeast and fermentation, uh, reached, um, just Lister, a doctor [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4129.32s)]
*  practicing in Scotland. And Lister realized that if these bacteria lurking in, in the air could [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4137.24s)]
*  contaminate beet juice or beer or what have you, um, then they could also perhaps explain the [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4146.280000000001s)]
*  terrible problem of surgical wound site infections, which were basically made, you know, much surgery [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4152.280000000001s)]
*  impossible to do and many surgeries, uh, very dangerous. And, you know, you would have a [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4159.64s)]
*  compound fat, a fracture of a, of a limb and more often than not surgeons would amputate rather than [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4165.08s)]
*  treat because the likelihood of infection was so high, that kind of thing. Uh, and Lister invented [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4171.96s)]
*  essentially sterile surgery, uh, and showed that you could, in fact, if you did, you know, originally [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4177.16s)]
*  very elaborate work to try and, you know, wall off the wound site from bacteria, you could in fact [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4184.2s)]
*  perform surgeries that had previously been fraught with danger or simply unthinkable. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4190.84s)]
*  I do want to go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I was just saying that happened in the 1860s. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4196.76s)]
*  Tragically, it happened just after the civil war. So you have this civil war was tough. Yeah. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4202.04s)]
*  And, and, you know, more hurt. Yeah. More people died of disease and wound infections than died of, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4208.92s)]
*  you know, immediate battlefield trauma by like two to one. Well, the chronology is definitely [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4217.88s)]
*  interesting. So I wanted to, you know, again, skip to the highlights here, but vaccination, uh, now [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4223.400000000001s)]
*  real vaccination becomes a real thing, but it did predate again, uh, Pasteur, but he, he had a famous [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4229.72s)]
*  experiment with the sheep that I really loved, even though, I mean, it's famous in some circles, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4237.8s)]
*  but let's pretend that not everyone listening has heard about it. Okay. So as I said, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4241.4800000000005s)]
*  Pasteur invented an anthrax vaccine. Um, again, there had, one of the reasons why it's always [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4246.280000000001s)]
*  fraught to say, well, Pasteur was this great giant colossus of stride, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4253.240000000001s)]
*  people had identified, uh, a bacterium with anthrax cases before that these, uh, you know, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4257.8s)]
*  these rod shaped bacteria were showing up. Um, and, you know, people actually explicitly wondered if [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4267.5599999999995s)]
*  they were simply a correlate, you know, you get sick with anthrax and that makes your body, your [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4274.76s)]
*  body less, you know, able to defend itself against, you know, the slings and arrows of outrageous [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4279.08s)]
*  fortune and these bacteria are opportunistically, you know, making their home in your bloodstream, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4283.96s)]
*  that kind of thing. Um, nobody actually sort of definitively established that these bacteria [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4288.76s)]
*  were the pathogen until Coke did it. Um, but there was, you know, there was this, uh, you know, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4294.92s)]
*  it was certainly known that this bacterium was present in essentially all cases of anthrax, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4301.24s)]
*  by, you know, a decade or more before Pasteur started working two or three decades before Coke, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4307.32s)]
*  got, got his, uh, got his interest going. So, um, Coke identifies and established and nobody, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4312.839999999999s)]
*  you know, it's, it's, it's now, you know, clearly the correct answer that this one particular [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4321.48s)]
*  bacterium, uh, is in fact the source of the symptoms of the disease, uh, when they infect, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4326.599999999999s)]
*  uh, an animal or a person. And, um, uh, Pasteur works to, um, his basic method was to try and, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4333.96s)]
*  you know, pass the bacteria through, uh, repeated animals until it was, um, attenuated, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4344.76s)]
*  keep, you know, recycling it. Um, and, you know, he tried different, aging them in cultures and [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4352.2s)]
*  there are lots of different ways that he worked to try and create less pathogenic versions. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4357.8s)]
*  Um, of, of the microbe, uh, and he eventually got it. Um, again, there's a little controversy. Did [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4363.320000000001s)]
*  he in fact have, um, a live attenuated, uh, uh, vaccine, uh, by the time he did this famous [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4370.76s)]
*  experiment or had somebody worked on, um, actually a killed version where they actually fixed the [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4378.92s)]
*  bacteria in some chemical. There's, you know, the notebooks are a little funky there. But, um, and [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4384.4400000000005s)]
*  he announced that he had a vaccine and some anti-germ theory, an anti-germ theory doctor said, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4391.5599999999995s)]
*  prove it. And challenged him to this test where he was going to take, um, uh, there would be two [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4398.36s)]
*  groups of sheep and there were, I think there were a couple of goats involved as well. Um, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4405.08s)]
*  and, uh, they're going to separate them up and half of them, all of them were going to get [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4411.32s)]
*  injected with anthrax. Um, so, you know, given the disease and then half would be, uh, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4415.0s)]
*  but half would have been previously injected with the vaccine and half would not. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4423.08s)]
*  And, um, Pasteur said, okay, and took his vaccine to this, uh, to this, you know, farm, not that far [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4427.96s)]
*  out of Paris and, uh, did the test. And, um, it was one of those, you know, like they draw it up [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4435.24s)]
*  kind of experiences, uh, where basically all the control group that went unvaccinated died and all [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4443.56s)]
*  the vaccinated animals were, you know, happily gambling around the fields. Um, and it was regarded [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4449.72s)]
*  and presented certainly in the popular press, which Pasteur was really good at representing himself in [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4456.04s)]
*  as this sort of clear triumph and clear demonstration of the truth of germ theory. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4462.360000000001s)]
*  You know, it's, it's one of the things we didn't, you wrote a long book, I'm sorry, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4467.080000000001s)]
*  Tom, but we didn't get to talk about all the cool stuff. People should buy the book. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4470.68s)]
*  But one of the themes that comes through, aside from the sort of establishment's always resisting [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4474.04s)]
*  you is the effectiveness of good science communication and in particular graphic design, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4479.240000000001s)]
*  you know, Florence Nightingale, John Snow, and certainly Pasteur was a, was a master of [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4486.12s)]
*  publicity. They, they, they got their points across not always by just having the better data [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4491.16s)]
*  or theory, but by being, you know, a little, uh, there's, there's some showmanship involved as well. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4497.16s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, and, and, you know, that's no surprise. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4503.96s)]
*  No surprise at all. When you say it that way. Yeah. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4508.599999999999s)]
*  It's just, I mean, I guess what's surprising to us with our present presentist bias is that they [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4511.639999999999s)]
*  figure that out, you know, back then, but, you know, again, Robert Hook, you know, that book [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4517.32s)]
*  Micrographia, he, you know, he, he wanted, he wrote that book to sell and it did. Um, uh, but yes, uh, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4521.32s)]
*  it is interesting to me that, um, as you say, Nightingale with her, essentially the invention [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4531.799999999999s)]
*  of polar diagrams, Nightingale was a formatively intelligent and gifted person. Um, she had, she [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4537.5599999999995s)]
*  had an unusual education for aristocratic young women or, you know, elite women of her time. Um, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4544.36s)]
*  she did have some training in mathematics. Um, and she really, uh, had a gift for data representation [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4551.799999999999s)]
*  that, um, you know, Tufty would have been proud of, I think. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4559.16s)]
*  You know, you don't think Florence Nightingale graphic designer, but very much that was in her [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4562.36s)]
*  real house. And she was able to, you know, these, these lovely circular, she called them coxcomb [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4567.16s)]
*  because they were supposed to supposedly vaguely like that, you know, thing on top of a rooster's [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4573.72s)]
*  head. Um, but, uh, you know, you could really see the change in death rates from before and after [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4577.8s)]
*  introducing, you know, proper hospital hygiene in the Crimea, Crimean war. Um, and similarly, um, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4584.68s)]
*  John Snow's, uh, sort of gift for, for graphical representation, you know, map, map based geographical, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4592.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, not graphic, geographical representation of data, uh, again, made his case that small, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4600.28s)]
*  not smallpox cholera was a disease of some specific contaminant in water. I mean, very, [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4607.5599999999995s)]
*  very difficult to, uh, to argue with when people did, but still it was a very persuasive case. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4613.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Just so people know, like these are maps of, you know, block by block, house by house in London. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4619.639999999999s)]
*  These people got it. These people didn't. Here's the water supply. Draw your own conclusions. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4624.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. It was, you know, it was even, you know, it even sort of accommodated the fact that London's [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4629.64s)]
*  streets are this ridiculous tangle. Exactly. Uh, because the, you know, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4637.4s)]
*  snow was able to show that even though some of the cases of cholera that were centered on this one bad, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4642.2s)]
*  you know, source of water, the broad street pump, um, that some of those seem to be, you know, quite [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4649.64s)]
*  far away and there were other, you know, houses nearer that weren't affected, but he was able to [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4655.4s)]
*  show that, that even though the crows, you know, the, the crows flight, uh, bird's flight distance [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4659.879999999999s)]
*  was greater to those places, the actual distance through the streets to the water supply, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4666.2s)]
*  all the cases were in, in, in houses where the closest water supply was that one pump on this, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4671.879999999999s)]
*  you know, street and so I mean, he was, he was good. And, and despite all of this human genius, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4680.76s)]
*  we can wind it up by coming to the present day. Uh, not everyone is convinced. I mean, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4687.56s)]
*  maybe before explaining that not everyone even in the present day is convinced of not just the [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4693.08s)]
*  efficacy of vaccines, but even I hesitate to say it, but some people are a little [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4698.68s)]
*  skeptical of the germ theory of disease right now. Um, but let's just remind ourselves how [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4703.5599999999995s)]
*  effective vaccines have been in making the world a better place. I mean, you paint a vivid picture, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4711.96s)]
*  not just you say you cure disease, that sounds good, but a wholesale change in life expectancy [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4716.84s)]
*  and demographics more generally that we kind of take for granted now. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4723.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the, the one message I'd like to leave with anyone listening to this is our release [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4726.76s)]
*  from the fear of infectious disease is in historical terms, incredibly recent. Um, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4737.0s)]
*  you know, people are familiar with the story of, of, of, you know, public health infrastructure. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4745.320000000001s)]
*  You know, you create clean water, you create, uh, you know, you, you get clean air, you reduce [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4751.24s)]
*  the incidences of all kinds of diseases enormously. If you just did that, it would be a huge change. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4756.84s)]
*  But the combination of vaccines and antibiotics means that for at least people in the developed [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4762.76s)]
*  world and increasingly in, in, in, in, um, the rest of the world, uh, diseases that were once [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4769.0s)]
*  inescapable are now, you know, uh, preventable or curable really readily. Um, and you know, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4776.12s)]
*  in London, you know, as late as 1900, there was still a significant rate of infant and child [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4786.599999999999s)]
*  mortality. And that basically is not a problem. The fact that the U S child mortality, infant [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4793.96s)]
*  mortality is worse than the rest of the developing world is a fact and a serious problem, uh, and has [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4801.16s)]
*  social and, um, and political roots, not medical ones. We know we can prevent these, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4808.2s)]
*  these maternal and child deaths. And the fact that we don't is in fact a, uh, a social choice, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4813.8s)]
*  even if we're not conscious of making it, but broadly speaking, you know, in 1952, there was [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4820.12s)]
*  a terrible polio outbreak in the United States and thousands died and more were, um, affected with, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4826.28s)]
*  you know, lifelong, um, consequences. Uh, and two or three years later, the first polio vaccine came [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4832.2s)]
*  out and that threat, you know, our parents or our grandparents were terrified to let their kids [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4840.44s)]
*  go to the swimming pool in the summertime in the forties and fifties. You know, that's no longer [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4848.2s)]
*  an issue. Yeah. Uh, the vaccines against common childhood illnesses, um, there were a few couple [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4853.72s)]
*  done before the war, uh, before the second world war, but most of them emerged between 1950 and [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4860.84s)]
*  the end of the 1960s. That's not very long ago. It's long. It's, it's, it's recent enough so that I [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4867.320000000001s)]
*  am though, I'm sure you wouldn't think to look at me old enough so that I was a kid before the [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4874.84s)]
*  rubella vaccine, which was the last in the list to show up, uh, was available and I caught a case, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4880.84s)]
*  German measles. It was also called, um, and, uh, it was really unpleasant and I was lucky because [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4887.24s)]
*  there are possible lifelong consequences for rubella and I didn't get them. So that's great. Um, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4893.88s)]
*  but, uh, you know, this is living memory. Uh, and now, however, uh, or up until very recently, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4900.2s)]
*  those things were, I mean, measles was declared eradicated in the U S, uh, around 2000. It's back. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4910.44s)]
*  Um, the, uh, you know, up until very recently, no one, no parent had to, had to seriously worry [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4916.919999999999s)]
*  that their child would be killed or damaged by diseases that for almost all of human history [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4926.919999999999s)]
*  were devastating companions, just things that you had to deal, live with. Um, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4933.5599999999995s)]
*  so, uh, and again, I think there, there are a lot of different reasons for this. There are [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4938.76s)]
*  explicit political reasons. There are, um, you know, just the fact that amnesia, you know, the sort of [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4944.68s)]
*  this, this, uh, lack of experience means it's very hard to credit that the threat exists. That's a [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4950.52s)]
*  human, um, you know, a perfectly normal human reaction to things. If, if you've never seen it, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4957.240000000001s)]
*  if you've never seen it, it's hard to believe it's real. Right. Um, but the anti-vaccine movement [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4963.72s)]
*  and more broadly, um, the sense that public health in general, not just vaccine regulations, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4970.84s)]
*  but the other things we might do like, you know, wear masks and, and physically separate during [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4979.64s)]
*  COVID. These are, are seen by, I think too many as, um, unwarranted intrusions into the individual [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4986.2s)]
*  liberties of, you know, of, of everyone. And that's not precisely the same as the kind of [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=4994.92s)]
*  hierarchical, you know, chain of being kind of stuff I associate with, with the difficulty of [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5003.0s)]
*  getting to germ theory, but it's clearly a kissing cousin. You know, there is a sense that there is a, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5008.599999999999s)]
*  you know, uh, still a hierarchy of agency. My choice is in violet. Right. And you know, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5015.160000000001s)]
*  you know, it's, uh, and you see that, you know, you see that happening in our politics right now. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5026.280000000001s)]
*  RFK junior is, is, um, his HHS is rewriting vaccine guidelines to emphasize that vaccines are an [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5032.92s)]
*  individual choice and that there are complications and all that sort of stuff. There are risks to [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5041.8s)]
*  vaccines, et cetera, et cetera. Um, and this is very much locating the, um, the choice and decision [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5045.320000000001s)]
*  making power over the, you know, sort of creation of these ecological niches for, uh, infectious [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5054.68s)]
*  disease. Uh, it's locating that in, in, um, you know, your choice and my choice and everybody else's [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5063.24s)]
*  choice. And, um, you know, if the consequences of those choices were confined to the individual, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5070.12s)]
*  that would be one thing. But one of the things about infectious disease is it is wait for it, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5079.48s)]
*  infectious, it moves from person to person. So those choices have impacts beyond the individual. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5085.48s)]
*  And that's something that we find in our society right now. And in our politics right now, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5092.44s)]
*  something that's very, very difficult to accommodate. And it's also a case where, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5098.04s)]
*  you know, you can believe whatever you want, but at some point as a scientist, I do believe there [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5103.24s)]
*  are objective facts out there about how the world operates, but there are crucial differences in [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5108.2s)]
*  the time scales and tangibility of those facts. You can think you can walk through a door, but [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5114.04s)]
*  if you try it, you will instantly figure out you don't. Uh, you can think that vaccines, um, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5120.04s)]
*  cause more harm than good and you can get away with it for a while, right? You know, for months, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5125.56s)]
*  years, whatever other people are being affected, I'm not being affected. And so it's just so much [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5131.56s)]
*  harder to, you know, overcome all of the human foibles in the equation when there's, there's [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5136.92s)]
*  that much wiggle room in something, a complex system like, uh, society, politics, medicine. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5145.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And, you know, I should emphasize, you know, the, one of the things that's happened, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5150.92s)]
*  you know, there was vaccine hesitancy from the very beginning. Uh, and in earlier times, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5157.88s)]
*  there was generally more reason behind it. There was, you know, the vaccine, like any other [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5163.0s)]
*  technology technology has, has advanced and improved over time. Um, but, you know, one thing [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5167.48s)]
*  that's really different in 2025 than was true in 1970 or 1920 or 1850, um, is, you know, an [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5175.64s)]
*  understanding of, um, sort of disease and immunity down to the molecule, you know, molecule or atomic [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5187.08s)]
*  level, right? Um, these are extremely well characterized. Uh, you know, it's not like, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5195.88s)]
*  you know, everything, there's lots and lots of stuff that is not known about specific mechanisms [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5202.68s)]
*  and pathways and all kinds of stuff, but an enormous amount is known and the, the mechanism [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5207.96s)]
*  by which vaccines have their impact. Um, the reasons why some vaccines are like confer [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5213.400000000001s)]
*  lifelong or, or extremely long lasting protection and others do not is part of the, you know, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5219.64s)]
*  interaction between, um, vaccine and pathogen, all these kinds of things. These are understood. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5224.84s)]
*  They've been well characterized and, um, and there's, you know, there's no room for doubt [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5230.2s)]
*  anymore about the fact that a vaccines work, be how they work and see what their limitations are [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5235.48s)]
*  and D what the consequences of rejecting all that can be. It can be, you know, one of the things that [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5244.2s)]
*  happens is, is, is, you know, if polio were to escape, uh, I've seen, I've seen model studies [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5250.44s)]
*  that show that it could very, very rapidly produce extremely large scale outbreaks because the, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5257.0s)]
*  you know, the, the global, um, the global state of, of polio vaccination has been waning since [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5263.4s)]
*  polio has been eradicated. Why do you need to be vaccinated? Yeah. Well, you know, it's, it's, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5269.0s)]
*  it's gone everywhere in Afghanistan or Pakistan. And the only reason you'd vaccinate now is if, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5273.88s)]
*  uh, is if, uh, you know, a case showed up. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so the, uh, you know, [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5277.88s)]
*  the risks are real and growing. And one of the things you'll see is as, as I suggested earlier [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5287.72s)]
*  in the book, that some of the issues in thinking about microbes were unrelated to anything to do [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5294.68s)]
*  with the science of microbes or the natural history of microbes at that time, but just to, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5300.36s)]
*  you know, well-established social and cultural, um, predispositions. Well, similarly right now, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5304.68s)]
*  a lot of the anti-vaccine stuff is now has sort of leapt the bounds of say the autism community, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5311.64s)]
*  where they were terribly mislead by that, you know, early paper that suggested, um, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5317.72s)]
*  falsely that there was a connection between autism vaccines and autism. Now it's left the bounds, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5324.200000000001s)]
*  but I think for an awful lot of people, um, being anti-vaccine is not actually a statement about [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5330.280000000001s)]
*  what you know or believe about how the immune system works. It's a, it's a, an infinity marker [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5337.24s)]
*  of I'm with this group and this group has included as part of its, you know, political catechism, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5343.88s)]
*  that vaccines are, are, are, are a bad thing. Yeah. And we just talked about that literally with, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5349.88s)]
*  um, uh, recently with a political scientist, Lilliana Mason. And I mean, you and I both know [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5355.32s)]
*  that 10 years ago, if you said, uh, it's so annoying that conservatives are denying science, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5360.76s)]
*  like climate change or whatever, you would get the response, but you know, the liberals deny [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5366.76s)]
*  vaccines or modern medicine and so forth. And it's, it's shifted quite a bit for obvious reasons. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5371.4800000000005s)]
*  It has. And, you know, I mean, and again, it's not surprising. Um, you know, all of us offload some [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5378.280000000001s)]
*  of our knowledge and judgments to, you know, we don't have time to become masters of many things, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5383.4800000000005s)]
*  much less everything. Right. So if people we admire and respect, say, you know, the sun rises [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5391.4s)]
*  in the East, we don't actually need to go out there with a compass and make sure of it ourselves. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5397.08s)]
*  And that's true for all kinds of things. Um, so when, you know, too many political leaders, um, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5401.719999999999s)]
*  you know, make, uh, make political hay out of, um, you know, opposing vaccines or what have you, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5409.799999999999s)]
*  uh, it's not surprising that large sections of their, you know, of their followers would say, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5417.72s)]
*  okay, well that, you know, I don't need to go study that myself. You know, Joe Rogan or whoever [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5423.4800000000005s)]
*  says this and, uh, and, you know, he wouldn't lie to me on the radio, whatever. Robert F. Kennedy [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5428.6s)]
*  says that, you know, he's the secretary of health, you know, health and human services. He's not going [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5434.52s)]
*  to lie to me, et cetera, et cetera. And you just go on about your business. Um, and again, it's not [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5438.84s)]
*  surprising. It's very human. We all do some variation of that, but in this case it has tragic [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5443.8s)]
*  and fatal consequences. So don't take it personally, Tom, but after the podcast is over, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5448.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm going to go wash my hands. You put the cleanliness into our heads, but Tom Levinson, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5453.16s)]
*  thanks very much for being on the mindscape podcast. Thank you so much for having me, Sean. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-achBLB9Xo&t=5459.16s)]
