Maxwell’s Demon is a famous thought experiment in which a mischievous imp uses knowledge of the velocities of gas molecules in a box to decrease the entropy of the gas, which could then be used to do useful work such as pushing a piston. This is a classic example of converting information (what the gas molecules are doing) into work. But of course that kind of phenomenon is much more widespread — it happens any time a company or organization hires someone in order to take advantage of their know-how. César Hidalgo has become an expert in this relationship between information and work, both at the level of physics and how it bubbles up into economies and societies. Looking at the world through the lens of information brings new insights into how we learn things, how economies are structured, and how novel uses of data will transform how we live.

César Hidalgo received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Notre Dame. He currently holds an ANITI Chair at the University of Toulouse, an Honorary Professorship at the University of Manchester, and a Visiting Professorship at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. From 2010 to 2019, he led MIT’s Collective Learning group. He is the author of Why Information Grows and co-author of The Atlas of Economic Complexity. He is a co-founder of Datawheel, a data visualization company whose products include the Observatory of Economic Complexity.

# Mindscape 72 | César Hidalgo on Information in Societies, Economies, and the Universe
**Mindscape Podcast:** [November 11, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiQWSZF9ktg)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host Sean
*  Carroll and by now in this society we live in everyone understands that
*  information is something very important whether it's the kind of information we
*  get over the internet in terms of news and what's happening, what the weather is
*  going to be like the next day, but also information in a more technical sense. If
*  you have a company needs information about what sales are going on, where the
*  customers are, what products are available, and what you should be selling.
*  If you're a scientist, information is the data that you have about the universe.
*  Information is another way of thinking about what we know about the world so
*  it's an extremely general concept but there is so much information around us
*  right now that it becomes a subject in its own right to understand what
*  information is and how best to harness it. And there's really no better person
*  to talk to than today's guest Cesar Hidalgo. Cesar was trained as a physicist but he
*  quickly got into the idea of statistical mechanics of information which led him
*  believe it or not into economics and he started studying not just economics in
*  its own right but how data flows through economic channels and how it becomes
*  actual physical products. So now after spending a long time as the lead of MIT's
*  collective learning group, Cesar is newly a chair at the University of Toulouse in
*  France but he's also the head of a startup company called Data Wheel. He's
*  been very involved in data visualization and how that can help us understand
*  what's happening in different places around the world. I can really recommend
*  his book called Why Information Grows that starts much like this conversation
*  you're about to listen to does from the basics of what we mean by information at
*  the level of physics or even philosophy into how information moves around
*  whether it's through a biological organism, through a society, through a
*  culture, through an economy. It's a different lens, it's a different way of
*  thinking about what's going on all around us and Cesar is a very charismatic
*  proponent of thinking about information in interesting ways. So I think you're
*  gonna like this. Let's go!
*  Cesar Hidalgo, welcome to the Linescape Podcast. Thank you. So you do you start
*  as a physicist is that right? That's right. And you moved through at any point
*  we were officially an economist? No I never got a degree in economics but I've
*  been working on topics related to economics I would say now for 14-15
*  years. Okay so you know the lingo you're pretty... Exactly and I have a lot of
*  colleagues and enemies. Colleagues and enemies, good way to put it. But now you're also
*  very interested in data visualization and things like that. So to people who
*  are not an expert in any of these areas what is the 30,000 foot view of all this?
*  Like how do you think of your project of putting these things together? So the way
*  that I define my work is I say that I focus on collective learning. So what I
*  try to do is to understand how teams, cities, nations and countries learn. How
*  do they acquire new knowledge and how they put that new knowledge to use? And
*  to do that I do a lot of things. I study the creation, diffusion and valuation of
*  knowledge and I've contributed a lot to that literature and economic geography
*  innovation. But I also have created lots of platforms to integrate and distribute
*  large volumes of public and private data as a way to improve the way that we see
*  our world. Okay and does the physics background help you here? I think so
*  because at the end of the day what you rescue from an education like that of
*  physics is that to understand the world you need to always have an interplay
*  between theories and experience. So that duality is useful in physics but
*  it's useful in economics and it's useful in most other fields. So I do
*  think that my work is still, it's always in the boundary between what the data is
*  telling us and how we interpret it. Okay but even more than that you have, so I
*  read your wonderful book, Why Information Grows? Yes. And the word
*  information is obviously playing a large role here right? And information has
*  different definitions in different contexts. It's closely related things
*  like entropy that physicists care about. So how do you think about information?
*  What is your idea as soon as you say that word? Yeah and of course it depends
*  with whom I'm talking to but in a more technical sense I like to think of
*  information as like the sort of like third thing that is very basic and
*  important to understand. So in the universe we have sort of things you know
*  that don't matter, things that we can you know we can touch or that that have
*  some sort of embodiment you know but we also have the movement of those things
*  we can think of in terms of energy and momentum and so forth but there's a
*  third you know quantity that we need to consider which is not things nor how
*  they're moving but how they're arranged or ordered. And to me that's the basic
*  idea of information you know it's like you know the sequence of things the way
*  in which you stack a deck of cards if you shuffle a deck of cards you don't
*  change the mass, you don't change the energy but you're changing something
*  that order is information. I guess probably people when you say the word
*  information they think that information is about something right that it
*  contains meaning not just not just data. So when you shuffle a deck of cards the
*  meaning doesn't really change or maybe it does I'm not quite sure how you think
*  about it. Yeah so maybe a better analogy than a deck of cards is to think of DNA.
*  So if I change the sequence of you know nucleic acids on DNA I can transform you
*  know one piece of DNA from encoding one protein to encoding a different protein
*  like that protein and what it does and you know in the context in which it's
*  being used you can think of that as the meaning but the little piece of DNA that
*  is a certain sequence doesn't know really about that meaning that meaning
*  is beyond it it's part of the environment and the way that that
*  sequence of order interacts with the rest of the environment. So I try to
*  think of information when I think about it in fundamental terms as those
*  sequences but of course when I'm talking with someone for example from the field
*  of communication or media studies understand that information there is
*  much more related to meaning and you can have concepts like misinformation which
*  in the DNA example you know would be a little bit you know harder to build.
*  I guess that's what that's what I'm trying to get at so for the DNA molecule or just
*  for a set of letters on a page is any arrangement equally contain the same
*  amount of information or do they contain more information if the context they're
*  in cares about what they say in some way? Well you know it depends on which
*  definition we're using again so so if we're thinking kind of from a pure
*  Shannon perspective you know basically a random sequence is gonna be the one that
*  contains more information because it's the hardest to predict you know.
*  It means nothing. Exactly but let's say now we're in the context of communication
*  you know and I'm trying to communicate something to you well the words that are
*  gonna contain more information are the ones that reduce your uncertainty more
*  about what I'm trying to say you know so maybe a more useful way to think about
*  information in that context is not simply how many bits do I need to encode
*  something but how much do I reduce your uncertainty with each bit that I provide
*  to you? Okay good this is sounding nice and physics-y and I like this. We're gonna
*  get to the role of information in economies and firms and networks and
*  things like that but let's stick with the physics angle here I mean how do you
*  think about the origin of information on you all the way back to sort of the
*  evolution of the universe or the evolution of life or something like that?
*  That's a good question because in some way information and order and complexity
*  is conspicuous in our planet you know so we were marveled at it every time we go
*  and see a landscape or you know like walk around the city but at the same
*  time you know if we were to take a spaceship and travel you know across our
*  solar system or beyond we would see a universe that is quite barren you know
*  complexity is not everywhere complexity actually concentrates in places like like
*  our planet and and it leads us to ask why why is our planet so rich in
*  complexity where other places you know are so barren? Like the moon is not
*  exactly the moon is not complex or even like if you go to the Takama desert here
*  on our planet you're gonna find you know places that actually you know don't have
*  too much structure beyond in the geological formations that you can find
*  there. And some telescopes these days by the way. Yeah indeed so to understand the
*  origin of of this complexity and disorder I think the the best solutions
*  that I found there is work like that of Ilya Prigozhin you know so Ilya you know
*  as you know very well he's a very famous you know statistical physicist and
*  chemist you know that he started to study physical systems that were out of
*  equilibrium you know near equilibrium but out of it and and he found that
*  those systems that were out of equilibrium tended to self-organize into
*  what he called dissipative structures you know so think of the little whirlpool
*  that forms when you take the plunger out of a bathtub you know that's a structure
*  that is not haphazard you know there are correlations there there are certain
*  order there are structure you know and that structure is something that emerges
*  you know when that system is going through a state in which it's flowing you
*  know in the system in which is like going from one energy state to another
*  so he says when the systems are out of equilibrium when they're moving from one
*  state to another they kind of organize and that is an important clue because if
*  we think about it a lot of the structure that we have serve in nature you know
*  it's in life and life is an out of equilibrium system that has to be
*  sustained by energy flows we have to eat many times a day you know we're breathing
*  and you know we do get energy also out of the oxygen that we breathe so there's
*  you know a lot of energy consumption that we need to stay out of equilibrium
*  because the only way to maintain our level of organization is to stay out of
*  that equilibrium so I think Prigozhin is the one that gives us a first good clue
*  of why there's structure in the universe yeah so in other words from the
*  perspective of someone like me if you just let the system go all by itself it
*  would go to a maximum entropy state right it'd be boring equilibrium it would
*  you know the the bathtub would just become flat right the water on top of it
*  but you're saying following Prigozhin that in the right circumstances if you
*  feed it some energy in fact some energy in a low entropy form then it obtains
*  this orderly configuration I guess exactly and that's conspicuous not only
*  in biology now our lives live around electronics that you know they become
*  useless the moment that the battery runs out you know so they're able to process
*  information they're able to you know show information on their screens you
*  know encoded as pixels or whatever you're using as a display type of
*  technology because they're consuming energy so that energy consumption you
*  know is essential to kind of like keep order because otherwise you know entropy
*  does what it does so what should we say that differentiates really the earth
*  from the moon in this case I mean we're the same distance from the Sun right
*  yeah but I think here there's a lot of things that have happened that allow us
*  to preserve information effectively you know and there's also like a chemical
*  complexity that maybe might be missing in places like the moon so on the one
*  hand we do have an atmosphere you know that makes a big difference you know and
*  we do have you know oceans you know which you know also make a big difference
*  and those structures together with others have been able to create path
*  dependencies you know for replicators like you know DNA and RNA you know to
*  create order sustain it and reproduce it so in some way the complexity that we've
*  served today is not the result of like an instantaneous event or a condition
*  that is present today on earth and not present in the moon but also of a long
*  path dependent process in which this complexity has grown over time because
*  we're able to generate more of it per unit of time than we lose you know right
*  yeah I mean I guess if I I haven't actually thought about this so I'm going
*  to say things that could be disastrously wrong but probably Venus even though it
*  has an interesting looking atmosphere the surface of it from the few pictures
*  that we have doesn't look that different from the moon right I mean it's kind of
*  like there are some rocks lying around and nothing more organized than that and
*  probably there are conditions specifically to earth related to the
*  existence of both solids and liquids and things like that that allow for these
*  channels to open up and complexity to develop is that the right way to think
*  about it I think so yeah and of course you know if this is a tough question if
*  we would have a succinct answer would have had you know like the sound bite
*  that solves the problem of the origins of life I know yeah no but I do think
*  that even though we might not have that we do have clues of some of the
*  conditions you know that that lead you know to the creation of complex
*  structures such as life and one of those is the need you know to have energy flows
*  but the need also of not losing them that quickly you know and to be able to
*  preserve the structure and and here on planet Earth we do that by you know
*  having certain solids and crystals that support that structure for instance you
*  know DNA it's a very stable molecule that is able to preserve a lot of
*  complexity and information over you know long periods of time and you know
*  with the ability to replicate it allows you know us to have the conditions that
*  we need not only to preserve information but then to make it grow and it's not
*  even perfectly stable right I mean if DNA were absolutely stable never
*  changed wouldn't do the job you need this kind of flexibility I guess exactly
*  you need to be able to explore you know those spaces of configurations so that
*  you can actually then you know growing complexity because complexity requires
*  diversity so there's some simple version of information which is just that you
*  know when entropy is low there's secret in some sense there's a lot of
*  information because you know a lot about the system but but you're making the
*  point that it's this complexity that gives us the ability to really make use
*  of that information is that the right way to say it yeah I do think that
*  complexity in many ways is kind of like a better term you know maybe because a
*  little bit more loosely defined for most people you know but I do think that you
*  know when you talk about the planet Earth as a planet that has a lot of
*  information maybe people you know think about like the media and the libraries
*  when you think about it as a place that is very complex maybe people get a
*  better idea that we're talking about like that that complexity that is
*  involved in ecosystems and our society that is absent from the moon and it's
*  also absent from libraries yeah yeah so there's this interplay I wish I
*  understood it better maybe because no one does between complexity and
*  information right in some sense you're making the point that complexity makes
*  use of information and information makes complexity possible so there I'm
*  not sure they're the same thing but they're at least symbiotic yeah I do I
*  do think that they're related another part of kind of like a you know a set of
*  symbiotic relationships the other aspect that I do think is important on that
*  relationship is what I call the capacity to compute you know so if we go back to
*  the DNA analogy you can think of the DNA and you can think of the cell and DNA by
*  itself it's quite useless it cannot reproduce by itself it requires all of
*  this machinery you know and the same is true for a lot of information that we
*  have is like a recipe without a kitchen you know and without a cook you know
*  cannot transform itself into a dish so we do have also that ability to then
*  grab a piece of encoded information as a set of instructions and transform it
*  into something that ability to transform information into new information or to
*  reproduce it or to recombine it you know is that computational capacity that we've
*  serving biology we have serving society and that I think is the true mystery so I call that like
*  knowledge and my separation between knowledge and information is information
*  is what is encoded and knowledge is this ability to make and you can make things
*  by you know making a car a car is information you know it's an organized
*  structure just like DNA you know or you know you can have knowledge when you are
*  making a new cell type you know as cells differentiate you know and that knowledge
*  that ability to make is ultimately what is hard to accumulate both at the
*  biological level and at the social level and you said the word before compute the
*  ability to compute now you're saying the ability to make are those the same thing
*  like in a lax language you know when we're talking relaxed exactly a
*  30,000 feet away from or more you know yes I would say you know you have this
*  order structures and you have the ability to make those order structures
*  you know that ability to make we can call it the ability to compute the
*  ability to transform a string of bits into another string of bits where those
*  bits are encoded on a magnetic tape or on a piece of DNA you know from this
*  perspective it would be relevant of course you know there are other
*  situations in which you want to make those distinctions right and and
*  presumably there's also phase transitions or at least transformations
*  along the way where the system becomes better and better at accumulating and
*  Yep yep.
*  So life would be one multicellular life I'm thinking of all these things I just
*  had a podcast a little while ago with Kate Jeffrey who is a neuroscientist and
*  you know I had given a talk saying how complexity can evolve and she wanted to
*  say yes but also it goes away sometimes because there are disastrous events and
*  it's not at all guaranteed that it comes and just grows monotonically.
*  Yeah indeed and I think that's true for you know economy societies and ecosystems
*  you know like we've seen the collapse of ecosystems we we might be risking you
*  know a big ecosystem collapse now with climate change you know and we do see it
*  in social process like like process of social unrest you know there are countries
*  that sometimes everybody thinks that they're going fine and you know things
*  you know turn very quickly you know like what is happening in Chile this week
*  what you know has happened in many places in the past.
*  Yeah no worldwide this is definitely going on so that so let's make that
*  transition so you know let's let's presume that in the last 15 minutes
*  everyone understands the origin of life and how it takes in low entropy energy
*  at what point does life become economics at what point do we talk about trading
*  information back and forth like that.
*  So what I try to communicate in why
*  information grows I don't know if I succeed but what I try to communicate is
*  at the end of the day you have these systems that have a finite ability to
*  accumulate knowledge to accumulate that capacity to make and the only way that
*  those systems can transcend that limited capacity is by developing you know
*  collective phenomena or collective systems that include multiple units so
*  you go from single cellular organisms to multicellular organisms because you
*  could never achieve the level of complexity of a multicellular organism
*  with a single celled organism but multicellular organisms you know they
*  peak at the human let's say you know so far as far as we know as far as we know
*  you know and humans are also of limited capacity the older you get the more that
*  you realize that you know very very very very little you know about everything
*  that could eventually be known so humans transcend that capacity by forming teams
*  teams transcend those capacities by forming organizations organizations
*  transcend those capacities by belonging to industries you know and also by
*  having cities and you have this different like Russian doll structure of
*  organizations that then grow all the way to our planet in which we are able to
*  accumulate more complexity and more knowledge more of an ability to make by
*  always renormalizing ourselves into you know groups of the units that bumped
*  into a ceiling so division of labor in some sense is exactly what's getting us
*  all the time but division of knowledge which I would say is different than
*  division of labor because like I can have a division of labor in which we're
*  all doing the same thing and we have more of us doing the same thing you know
*  but the division of knowledge is quite different because we're doing different
*  things and we're passing on you know those inputs to each other as a way to
*  create things that would be impossible for each one of us to do so when you're
*  making an aircraft is not that you have a hundred thousand people company in
*  which everybody's making an aircraft by themselves you know with a hammer and
*  you know and with some metal you know it's everybody's doing something
*  different and that allows them you know to create a few aircraft a year you know
*  that are the product now if you are in a lower complexity let's say activity like
*  the production of t-shirts in that case you might have more of a division of
*  labor and less of a division of knowledge you might have you know
*  warehouses full of seamstress that they're all doing the same task doing
*  the same shirt and in that case you have more of a division of labor you have
*  economies of scale but you don't have that division of knowledge that you
*  would have served in a complex industry like pharmaceuticals or aircraft
*  manufacturing I presume that for a complicated aircraft there's literally
*  nobody who has all the knowledge. Of course yeah that's the whole point and
*  that's the idea that you know basically you know you can think of the complexity
*  of an industry as the number of what I call person bites of knowledge. Person
*  bites. B-Y-T-E-S. Exactly. Of knowledge that you will need you know to be able to create a
*  product. Yeah okay but was that did we skip ahead when I think of economics in
*  general I mean I think of trade and barter and you know maybe currency and
*  value and those can precede this sort of division of knowledge or not I'm not
*  sure. Yeah so in some way you know my way to enter economics has been through a
*  gap in the literature you know that that was there in which products were very
*  much considered like some sort of epiphenomena that was not very
*  differentiated in the economics literature so you know economics is a
*  field that comes more from tradition of like bankers and merchants you know so
*  it's kind of more like about trade and interest rate and prices you know and
*  money and you know the cost of employment and those things but you know
*  whether you're producing ladders or you're producing you know apples or you
*  are producing cars or you know you are producing t-shirts you know are things
*  that are differentiated not you know too much you know in the models and the
*  empirical work that was traditional in the literature and I think I was
*  lucky to enter the field at a moment in which a more fine-grained data was
*  becoming available and that allowed us to start characterizing products and
*  industries you know in a more fine-grained matter you know not just by
*  talking about how much labor or capital they need but by actually looking at you
*  know the patterns of production to be able to infer you know how much
*  knowledge they need to be produced you know or you know other other properties
*  that differentiate them in ways that the traditional literature had not maybe
*  paid attention to. So do you think that kind of differentiation was there from
*  the start from the first primitive economies or is it something that
*  allowed economies to take off later in the game? No, the differentiation is
*  actually very hard to achieve so one thing that is quite conspicuous when you
*  look at international trade data or you look at data on the geography of
*  industrial economic or innovative activities you know in a country is that
*  as you move from the simpler economic units the towns to the more complex the
*  cities or you move from countries that you know are relatively down in the
*  development ladder to the ones that are at the top you have like this subset
*  structure in which diversity grows you know with the level of development and
*  complexity so that the places that do few things they not only do few things
*  they do things that are common to the places that do many things you know so
*  you have kind of like this world in which creating that diversity is
*  difficult and those that don't have it are stuck not only with a primitive
*  unlimited offer but one that is very redundant with everyone else so it's very
*  uncompetitive too so these are also mechanisms that would actually help us
*  explain you know part of the inequality because you know if what I can do is
*  something that everybody can do and it's a few set of things it's very hard
*  for me to be competitive and have a decent income if I can do a lot of
*  things that nobody else can do and people want I think I have it made I
*  want to pause to talk about Peloton home exercise bikes this is really one of my
*  favorite ways to work out mostly because it's just so flexible the idea of having
*  an exercise bike is a great one it's a really good workout cardiovascular
*  fitness is important we all know that but the idea that you can do it whenever
*  you want and still enjoy the features of a class with an instructor sort of
*  egging you on so I don't know how your schedule works I don't know when I'm
*  going to have time to work out and so forth and also my motivation comes and
*  goes so I like having someone there telling me what to do it's a virtual
*  person if you're on Peloton so you can either sign up for a live class or a
*  large library of pre-taped classes now Peloton has a new 30-day home trial so
*  you buy the service and try it out worry-free for 30 days if you decide it's
*  not for you you can return the bike for a full refund Peloton will even come and
*  pick it up at no cost so this holiday give the gift to Peloton use a promo
*  code mindscape at one Peloton dot com that's O N E Peloton P E L O T O N dot
*  com and get a hundred dollars off accessories when you purchase the
*  Peloton bike
*  but okay but so when when when I think about division of labor and maybe
*  division of knowledge goes the same way I think about you know the Industrial
*  Revolution I think about Henry Ford building the Model T and an assembly
*  line well there's too many questions to ask that's why I'm hesitating here how
*  did that get started who invented that was that was that a sort of a side
*  product of other technological information innovations like the
*  printing press or is there a story to tell about how information read upon
*  itself so now we have more of like a big history question yeah you know like
*  like the yeah so in in that big history perspective I do think that there's kind
*  of like a long you know line of events but there are also some transitions that
*  I think are very important you know the first one that someone like you will
*  have already like emphasizes quite a bit on sapiens is like the cognitive
*  revolution it's like the development of language and and there's some
*  particular properties of language you know that we have because human
*  languages are not like animal communication systems we have the ability
*  to talk about hypothetical things you know so an ape can have the ability to
*  maybe tell another ape that there's danger or that there's a lion or there's
*  a snake but they cannot tell them about their idea for their new blockbuster
*  film no that idea to talk about fiction was a big you know cognitive revolution
*  that happened you know 80,000 years ago 100,000 years ago you know and that is
*  expressed in in things like the development of you know like more
*  advanced tools and and an acceleration of our ability to you know accumulate
*  knowledge and so forth then we have the agricultural revolution you know which
*  people know about that's you know much more reason about like 10,000 years ago
*  you know with that we finally start accumulating slowly people into cities
*  you know that agglomeration is really important because at the end of the day
*  you know it just like a biology you know accumulates knowledge you know in in
*  DNA and that knowledge has to be preserved and passed on to the next
*  generation we humans accumulate cultural knowledge and and if we're all dispersed
*  in small groups the ability to accumulate knowledge and ideas through
*  generations you know is limited but once we start forming cities we start you
*  know living together we're gonna accumulate more knowledge we're gonna
*  have maybe also people that are gonna be dedicated you know to those aspects of
*  life in the beginning maybe religious leaders you know and political leaders
*  and so forth and the next revolution I would say in the sequence of events at
*  least the way that I understand them is the writing revolution you know and that
*  is very important in ancient Greece you know like even though writing is older
*  than ancient Greeks you know it was not that prevalent and it was not that
*  advanced you know it was like much more based on like you know accounting
*  systems or even in administration and religious events but in ancient Greece
*  you know writing kind of like explodes as a form of expression that is used to
*  communicate you know and document like complex ideas and they go through
*  something that could be considered similar to the Renaissance you know that
*  happened later you know they actually get close you know to maybe you know
*  like what could have been an industrial revolution maybe you know if if history
*  would have worked differently you know and that writing revolution produces a
*  lot of knowledge and then after the writing revolution which I would date
*  you know loosely around 700 BC to me the next big revolution and what is the
*  starting point of everything that is modern is the printing press you know
*  because when a Gutenberg you know adapts the printing press you know that that
*  existed in Asia and and develops this removable type printing press what what
*  happens are a lot of things first you know and this is all from Elisabeth
*  Einstein's work you know the printing presses an agent of change but a first
*  you know for the first time scientists and scholars can have access to multiple
*  books like before printing like only Kings had little libraries books were
*  transcribed by hand and everybody has written a book quickly realizes that no
*  matter how cool your life is you don't have enough stories you have to read to
*  and share other people's stories to fill up your books no second you know what
*  happens also is that printing is the first economic activity that is urban
*  and scalable think before printing what was the way in which you could make money
*  like that you could make it big you know well you know you had to have access to
*  resources where it is a lot of land a lot of serves you know that would like
*  farm that land we might have access to maybe mineral resources or you like
*  looted next door town or something like that but printing was something that you
*  could produce in a city you know with a relatively small people the team of
*  people it was kind of like you know sort of IP intensive very IP intensive but if
*  you have a book that sold and you could sell copies you could you know become
*  rich really quickly and evidence of that is that the number of printers per
*  capital in Europe is stabilized after only 50 years so it was a huge zero to
*  sixty very quickly yes yeah it was a huge economic boom like in 50 years you
*  know you stabilize that number because you have an activity that basically was
*  very profitable was very urban so it's the first time that kind of like
*  someone in the city you know can really start making it big by manufacturing
*  something at scale you know it's really the first type of like no mass
*  production is printing you know and then it was it was content as we would call
*  it today yes that was the point you got to monetize your content for the first
*  time ever yeah so that I think is huge and you know it gives rise to like a new
*  cognitive revolution you know that we we call the enlightenment you know
*  eventually you know that that involves a lot of the the most important
*  discoveries of you know science in the middle of the last millennia and and
*  after that you know as society chugs along and you know the 16th 17th century
*  comes along you know printing accelerates you know like it takes 200
*  years for people to discover that you could print short formats okay like
*  magazines and pamphlets and so forth eventually those lead to a change of
*  institutions you know so you know it's hard to understand the transition from
*  you know monarchies to democracy without printing and you know after those
*  changes of institutions you know and with the acceleration of science and
*  new forms of communication like you know film and radio then television now the
*  internet and I like to think of the history of our planet or of our last you
*  know thousands of years as a history of changes in communication technologies
*  that have reconfigured the way that we create and process information and that
*  we generate and produce knowledge and those are the errors that to me have
*  contributed to this big history yeah no that's very helpful because I guess we
*  glossed over a little bit but in your book you certainly emphasize the fact
*  that not only there's this thing called information but it's embodied it's
*  crystallized right it's there's some stuff that carries the information and
*  all of these changes in communication technology which sounds sort of mundane
*  when you put it that way there are new information flow technologies right and
*  if you make it cheaper for information to flow you enable a lot of new things
*  they're huge and they're always laughed upon when when they first merge you know
*  like nobody took Twitter seriously and probably now is the the first thing that
*  politicians take seriously because like it's still complaining about it but yeah
*  it's important it's it's it's quite like in for instance think of like a the
*  music industry you know a lot of people are sort of like surprised that
*  musicians cannot make money anymore but if you think about it from the
*  perspective of communication technologies what it's curious is that
*  there was a short period of time in which they could make money yeah because
*  there were musicians at the time of the ancient Greek their musicians is still
*  today but for most history musicians only could perform live and you know live
*  performance were hard to monetize they couldn't spread but as you know
*  technology evolved and you had radio and then more than radio you had then
*  records you know those records you know allowed to constrain the diffusion of
*  music in such a way that you could monetize it because music was trapped
*  on those you know discs it was trapped you know on those magnetic tapes and you
*  could make a killing because you know the marginal cost of producing a new
*  tape or a disc was very small you know you could sell them for ten fifteen
*  dollars you know and all of the musicians that that were big in the 60s
*  70s and 80s they're loaded you know nowadays you know it's impossible to make
*  money that way because music cannot be trapped in a physical media and and what
*  was curious is that musicians could make money for a while so that it that's
*  that's an interesting way to put it it had to be shareable but not too shareable
*  exactly yeah there's that sweet spot in it I wonder what lessons there are for
*  other things I wonder if it books it's same way I mean certainly as someone who
*  writes books you probably feel the same way the first thing that happens when
*  you write a book is pirated versions appear on the internet but they're not
*  that better than the physical book so I don't think it's doing a huge amount of
*  damage that's interesting okay so that that flow of information through
*  different media obviously affects what people can do but then how where do we
*  get to things like Henry Ford and you have this wonderful example in the book
*  of this giant plant I've never heard of it before but there was you know what
*  was it called the River Rouge River Rouge yeah I didn't know about this
*  before but to this day that was the largest you know integrated facility I
*  don't know because I've been to China a lot and like okay like they have amazing
*  stuff there but it didn't grow monotonically there was a peak at that moment
*  exactly so the River Rouge you know was this you know fantastic plant you know
*  that that that Ford created that that literally like took like soybeans and
*  metal you know on one end and produce cars out of the other because it was a
*  complete vertical integration yeah I would say today we don't manufacture
*  anything with that level of vertical integration like value chains are very
*  distributed and international you know that's for instance why like Trump
*  tariffs are kind of like stupid when it involves Mexico because you know the US
*  value chain in the automotive sector like you know which is the number one
*  country in the exports of beer it's also Mexico because you know a lot of like
*  the US beers manufacturing so like the value chains are integrated and
*  disaggregated between different countries you know and we don't have
*  those monolithic models but at the time you know of Henry Ford you know where
*  like transportation was not that good that's why you know those those those
*  slow cars were such a good business you know and you you needed maybe to produce
*  that level of vertical integration to be able to get the economies of scale that
*  he needed you know to produce affordable vehicles you know nowadays things are
*  different but it's impressive you know what they were able to do at some point
*  I mean again maybe it's a version of a sweet spot in that they had the
*  differentiation of knowledge enough to do the economy of scale but it was still
*  expensive to do things all over the place so bringing it together in the
*  same geographic location was a useful thing but I think in the book you have
*  this example I'm gonna mangle it but you know in Chile you can mine copper and
*  other raw materials and you would like to have a battery and you can in
*  principle make them but it's actually cheapest to just send your raw
*  materials to Korea have them make the batteries and then buy it back yes so
*  that's a good point because at the end of the day you know like for us to
*  produce things you need to combine you know like you know materials technology
*  and knowledge you know and the way that the world works is that the world is kind
*  of like lazy yeah like we like basically we try to minimize costs that's that's a
*  more economist way of putting it but because of that you have to ask yourself
*  the question what is easier to move is it easier to move the knowledge is it
*  easier to move the materials is easy to move the technology what are the factors
*  are easy to move on and the hardest factor to move is knowledge no so there
*  seems weird I mean knowledge is not very heavy but it's it's hard to move it from
*  brain to brain I suppose it's super heavy because and people tend to confuse
*  knowledge with kind of like encoded pieces of information you know so like
*  would you trust a brain surgeon that the only thing that has done is read
*  Wikipedia pages about brain surgery and has never been there so like knowledge
*  is very experiential or even have read a textbook exactly yeah yeah someone that
*  had just read a textbook on brain surgery I wouldn't allow them to operate
*  you know and they don't you know like that's why you have residencies and you
*  have all of this you know practice systems you know but when it comes to
*  like complex industries you know the knowledge is embedded on on large teams
*  and that makes it very hard to move so knowledge has these temporary monopolies
*  so for example when Ford figures out how to build a car and he's able to put all
*  of that together on the river Rouge and he's producing cars and there's other
*  people producing cars also not that far from him they're not producing cars in
*  San Diego they're producing cars you know like they're in the Midwest yeah
*  exactly and Detroit you know and it expands kind of like from there because
*  knowledge is hard to move so it's easier to bring the steel there is bracing to
*  build the you know the coal and all of the other materials and nowadays I think
*  it's kind of like the same you know like like Silicon Valley has monopolies over
*  markets that they discover China is now getting there because it's a country
*  that is very technologically advanced and sophisticated and the products are
*  easier to move that the knowledge that you needs to make them so if you figure
*  out something you know that people want you're gonna have that monopoly because
*  the product is gonna diffuse very quickly you know but the ability to make
*  it is gonna diffuse very slowly and until it does you know there's gonna be
*  only a few people that are gonna be able to supply that and therefore you know
*  they're gonna have their day and this is related to that distinction you draw
*  between knowledge and know-how or explicit knowledge I guess and know-how
*  I mean in some sense there are things you can put in a book but there are
*  things that are just in the human brain or just in the individual people and
*  that's why it's heavy because moving people is really hard exactly so in the
*  in the literature on knowledge that is used traditionally on business schools
*  and knowledge economics innovation economics people make a strong
*  distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge explicit knowledge is all of
*  the knowledge that I can communicate through an act of communication I can
*  codify that knowledge like the recipe that I can put on a cookbook is
*  something you know that I could communicate through a page and therefore
*  is explicit knowledge the experience of having cooked with you know the chefs
*  from el bully or any famous restaurant is something you know that is much
*  harder to communicate so it would be considered tacit knowledge so the best
*  examples of tacit knowledge are think of sports so imagine like Michael Jordan
*  he's extremely talented he really knows how to handle a ball on you know a
*  basketball court but imagine you have a seminar and he speaks and tells you
*  about basketball for like three days you know how much better of a player you're
*  gonna be after the third day epsilon yeah not that much you know because you
*  know that knowledge is tacit and it's acquired through practice and the world
*  is full of tacit knowledge and is the one that is hardest to see because it's
*  not as obvious as the knowledge that we can codify and closer to our experience
*  I don't know if you have a professional basketball in your career in your past
*  but graduate school is the same way right you know students come in they
*  know a lot of equations or whatever but they don't know what it means to be a
*  scientist they haven't seen it in action they haven't done it I agree yeah so I
*  came to the US for grad school and I had a very good advisor you know last
*  low but a bus is a very famous you know physicists that works on networks and so
*  forth and a I remember like soon I learned that I it was a waste of time to
*  go to him to like kind of like talk to him about like technical details solid
*  that you should figure out by yourself but what what I wanted to get out of him
*  is like to understand okay when a problem is relevant you know how should I
*  communicate to people you know how is different people gonna interpret this
*  all of those type of things you know how to think about you know like a career
*  and to connect the different things that you're doing and those are things that
*  are hard to learn if you don't have a model of someone that you know knows how
*  to do them and you're kind of like learning as an apprentice and and I
*  think a lot of people sometimes don't understand that I think the 20s you know
*  you better get someone you know that that is where you want to be and and be
*  a very humble apprentice of them so if we if we take this on board and we
*  appreciate the importance of tacit knowledge and know-how and how
*  difficult it is to move around what are the lessons that we get from that for
*  either building an organization or organizing economy or trade barriers and
*  things like that so there's a lot of lessons because there's a big literature
*  on this you know and so there's a literature that looks at the geographic
*  diffusion of knowledge you know and as you can imagine because knowledge is
*  sticky there's a lot of barriers to the diffusion so it's hard for knowledge to
*  travel long distances now the reason why it's hard for knowledge to travel long
*  distances is because it's socially embedded so like it's actually that
*  social networks are geographically circumscribed and that limits the
*  diffusion of knowledge so then the question is what are the things that
*  limit the ability of people to create links you know you have language
*  barriers you have cultural barriers all of those have been shown extensively to
*  limit knowledge diffusion to limit trade to limit other things no so the question
*  then is like now if you're a country or a city or a region that wants to develop
*  their economy you know what you're trying to do is to accumulate knowledge
*  and the question is how do you do it by following the laws of knowledge diffusion
*  okay and here are examples of people that did it wrong and examples of people
*  that did things better you know examples of doing it wrong I don't know if you
*  ever heard of the University of Yachay in Ecuador no so earlier this decade a
*  Rafael Correa who was the president of Ecuador decided to put a billion dollars
*  on the creation of a new city of science and technology that he hoped would
*  compete with knowledge production centers across the world very idealistic
*  you know plan you know a billion dollars in Ecuador is 1% of GDP okay so that's
*  that's a lot of cake you know and basically you know what they did is they
*  they grabbed a piece of agricultural land like two hours north of Quito and
*  they tried to start building kind of like this university and city and
*  industrial park and so forth but you if you walk around you know place like
*  Kendall Square or Manhattan you know that you don't build a lot for a billion
*  dollars you know and if you have to bring every brick and every person that
*  lay bricks to the place you build even less so quickly like the plan you know
*  like unraveled you know that university has gone through like six or seven you
*  know a university presidents by now they were able to attract a few scientists to
*  move there you know that didn't go well you know there was an article in science
*  you know talking about their experience and how they they some of them were
*  leaving some of them got fired they got a few students there like like like at
*  the beginning like I think it was just a thousand you know that became very
*  radicalized because they believed on the dream but you know a thousand dollars
*  you know sorry a thousand students at a billion dollars you know that's a
*  million dollars per student so you could have put all of these kids in
*  Stanford you know for like life you know you know so so they were like you
*  know and basically was this idea that if you have enough money you could create
*  knowledge anywhere yeah and that's not true because their process of diffusion
*  that constrained the creation of knowledge in the case of Ecuador they
*  had two chances one was called that one was called keto you know which are the
*  like two centers you know where they have accumulated knowledge and so what
*  are the channels that can promote knowledge diffusion so one of them which
*  is really important and it's also very well documented is migration and
*  migration is one channel that is also very biased towards the most talented
*  people in the world so there's a book by Bill Kerr which is a professor at HBS
*  that is called the gift of global talent and in that book you know you find a lot
*  of interesting facts one of them is like people you know without a college degree
*  about one percent of them migrate people with a college degree is about like five
*  percent inventors that have filed a patent about ten percent Nobel Prize
*  winners about thirty one percent Nobel Prize winners in the US since the 70s is
*  like sixty something percent we get them off now everywhere exactly you know so
*  you do have kind of like this thing that there is a tale of talent that is
*  extremely global and that is the one that helps create innovation the ones
*  that help create jobs you know it's similar you get similar numbers if you
*  focus not only on formal education and academic credentials if you look at
*  people that have formed you know fortune 500 companies or unicorns they're super
*  biased towards foreigns you know so then you know one of the lessons that you
*  need to do is you know well how do you attract that global talent you know
*  because at the end of the day it's a game of global talent because also this
*  talented famous individuals are the ones that are gonna help you attract other
*  ones the US for a long time has had a huge advantage in that space it receives
*  about 50% of all of the PhDs that migrate in the world come only to one
*  destination which is the US you know and now that falling percentage I presume
*  now they change yeah yeah well I that's a very believable story I had two
*  previous podcasts which made similar points one with Jeffrey West about how
*  things scale and you know the ingenuity and creativity certainly scales with
*  population density in some way and then another one with Will Wilkinson where we
*  talked about the political aspects of these and the openness to new ideas that
*  was associated with cities versus more conservative rural divide but then so
*  that raises the question that you brought up the word inequality earlier
*  you know it's great to attract the best talent and you know they want to be in
*  these concentrations of brilliance and productivity but then how do you spread
*  the rewards of all that productivity and brilliance widely to everyone so
*  that's tough but I do think that we have found out a few things you know quite
*  recently actually so in without going into the details we might go into this
*  later but there are ways of measuring you know the knowledge intensity of
*  economies you know like how much knowledge is there in New York vis-a-vis
*  San Diego Tokyo Moscow whatever you know and when you use those measures to look
*  at knowledge concentration in cities or in countries you do find relationships
*  with inequality as well so for instance economies that are more complex tend to
*  be less unequal economies that are more attractive and less complex sorry
*  economies that are more complex are less unequal more equal more equal and
*  economies that are less complex are more unequal okay you know so it's not obvious
*  to me it's not obvious but like it's really hard to have the level of
*  inequality of Switzerland with the industrial structure of Peru you know so
*  if your exports are based on like three four sectors mainly you know when those
*  sectors are about you know mineral resources structure that you know our
*  industries that are very regimented and hierarchical you know because they're
*  about like you know safety about production they're not about creativity
*  you don't want a minor to start digging anywhere and get creative you know exactly
*  so you have a productive structures that are not geared towards you know
*  innovation and that you know gears like towards structures are more hierarchical
*  and an equal so at the international scale you know as economies become more
*  complex they become more equal and as economies become less complex they
*  become more unequal so for countries like you know like Chile and you know
*  Peru and Angola all of these countries that depend a lot on mineral resource
*  destruction whether these are fossil fuels or other forms of minerals one
*  thing that they need to do to reduce their inequality is they need to
*  sophisticated practice structure so they can generate those middle-income jobs
*  because those middle-income jobs are not gonna happen you know just through the
*  redistributed policies you do need policies and social safety nets but you
*  do need to change the practice structure now if you look inside countries the
*  relationship flips which is kind of cool you know from a statistical perspective
*  why that might be our hypothesis right now is that because within countries you
*  do have more a spatial equilibrium okay so a lot of the effects that Jeffrey
*  West talks about you know are effects that are not just about the size of
*  cities but also about the migration into cities so Peter Hedstrom has a paper on
*  science advances that finds that a lot of those super linear scaling
*  relationships described by West and Berencourt and actually quite explained
*  by migrants coming to cities and those migrants being the most talented people
*  so the most talented people from the rural areas are the ones that migrate
*  and help provide that extra punch of productivity that cities have so a city
*  like New York is very unequal not because it's only based on New Yorkers
*  it's because a lot of like poor people migrate to those places similar to San
*  Francisco you know they're like big magnets and attractors of people and at
*  the country scale the more complex region or a city is the more unequal it
*  is the least complex the more equal it is so you have a Simpson's paradox you
*  know not from Homer Simpson yeah but the statistical Simpson paradox that the
*  correlation that you serve at one scale you know inverse when you disaggregate
*  that data into the next scale right okay well so then what's the is there an
*  immediate policy implication for this so what are we gonna do with this knowledge
*  yeah so I do think that there are a few things one thing that we found also
*  related to this is that in the more complex economic activities concentrate
*  in space much more than the least complex economic activities that paper
*  is coming out of nature human behavior in a few weeks and what this tells us is
*  that well if at the end of the day wealth is gonna be increasingly be
*  generated in cities we do need to have you know better ways of including more
*  people into cities because I think one of the pain points of the United States
*  right now is that the major cities of the US are failing to accommodate more
*  people because of problems is infrastructure you know problems in
*  the ability to build and so forth so like if you think about it like San
*  Francisco and the mayor is the worst obviously but that's it in China would be a 20 million
*  people city given you know like what is able to make but for that you know it
*  would have you know 27 lines of subway okay that would be like really fast and
*  modern and autonomous you know it would need to have another type of
*  infrastructure like I don't know if you've been to Shenzhen I've not been
*  there but I know about it yeah Shenzhen came into existence from nothing yeah
*  exactly 23 million people like so so the US haven't hasn't been able to produce
*  21st century megacities it produced 20th century megacities but nowadays you
*  know I think you're gonna need to include more people in the centers of
*  production and if you don't get together you know good infrastructure for
*  transportation you don't get to get good ways of like densifying neighborhoods
*  you know in a way that they make them livable but at the same time are able to
*  include maybe twice the number of people that they had before maybe three times
*  you know you are gonna start having more and more social pressure because it's
*  unsustainable to commute for three hours you know like people are getting
*  excluded because cities you know have the need to include more people than the
*  one that they're able to write yeah I mean just to play devil's advocate here
*  I'm probably mostly on your side but these are subtle questions we're we're
*  having this conversation in the middle of a charming neighborhood of Cambridge
*  Massachusetts with a lot of small individual sized houses or at least few
*  unit houses if the character of the place would utterly change if the
*  density were that of a large Chinese megalopolis right and is that entirely
*  good well you know in in some ways I live two blocks away from here yeah
*  that's a huge privilege yeah you know that's a huge privilege and I don't
*  want to give it up yeah many people in my company have to commute much longer
*  and that commute is part of kind of like their unhappiness and you think about it
*  a lot of the social unrest that is happening in many countries you know is
*  happening you know it's being triggered when the price of gas goes up when the
*  price of transportation goes up because commuters are unhappy you know commuters
*  are the ones that are kind of like excluded and they have to kind of like
*  make a journey every day to the places where people like me that have the
*  privilege to be able to afford a home here you know live so I do think that if
*  they could make Cambridge more you know affordable to more people you know I
*  think it probably would be healthier you know maybe we'll be able to hang out at
*  night more and get better ideas for our businesses and for creative activities
*  that we want to do so I do think that if you get along with your neighbors it's
*  good to have more of them it is I was impressed to learn not impressed but
*  interested to learn that the average commute time goes up and up the more
*  you're in a big city yes despite the fact that things are more dense and
*  nearby it takes longer to get there yes so we have all of that data you know we
*  have data USA we have the main tool to distribute and visualize US public data
*  that we launched in 2016 and there you can create maps of like commute times and
*  you immediately see that when you create the average travel time map boom all of
*  the cities light up when you create the commuting alone map then you know it's
*  the opposite you know so commuting alone you know it's people driving cars in
*  more rural areas you know average travel time you know goes up you know in places
*  like DC and you know a New York and so forth well that's another side of what
*  you do so if information flowing around in different forms and in different
*  media is driving the economy in various ways we're living in an era now where
*  there's so much information that just dealing with it all is a big issue so
*  you've been involved in data visualization and projects that try to
*  sort of make sense of all this information we're getting what drives
*  you to do that so it was a little bit of a let's say you know lucky path you know
*  so when I started doing this work on economic complexity and relatedness
*  there were like two big papers that we produce one in 2007 that came out in
*  science and another one on PNAS in 2009 and those papers became you know very
*  popular but one of the things that those papers had was that they had some
*  non-traditional techniques that we had invented that you could use to predict
*  the products that a country was going to export in the future you know that you
*  could use to predict the future economic growth potential you know of countries
*  based on their economic structures and I started to get a lot of demand you know
*  of people to generate you know reports on that type of topic you know and and
*  as a scientist you know like you always want to be working on the next thing you
*  know so like they say oh yeah we want to do like you know like relatedness and
*  complexity analysis for this region of Brazil or for you know these or that and
*  and that was kind of like boring repetitive work you've done that already
*  yeah you've done it so when I started my my lab at MIT the first grad student
*  that I hired was Alex Simoes and the the job that I gave him is we're gonna do
*  like a self-service tool for this demand I had done something similar before for
*  a paper in which we look at you know correlations between diseases using
*  hospitalization records and Alex started building you know this tool which became
*  the observatory of economic complexity is now the number one tool to
*  distribute international trade data in the world you know and then we found out
*  that you know maybe like what people were more interested was on the platform
*  and the tool rather than you know the analysis that the tool made and that was
*  redeployable so then we created a tool you know together with the government of
*  Minas Gerais in Brazil that you know integrated data for more than 50 million
*  workers all of the basically formal sector economy of Brazil data on trade
*  on industries you know and employment and also education for all of Brazil and
*  then you know together with a colleague from Deloitte we started working on the
*  creation of a similar platform for the US but one of the things that we did
*  there is that we realized that you know we needed to go beyond economic data you
*  know so it includes data on demographics and health and insurance on you know
*  commute times on you name it you know and that's DataUSA that was launched in 2016
*  that project became very popular and it became some sort of like the the dream
*  thing that people in statistics departments of many governments in the
*  world wanted to have and that started to generate a demand to create more projects
*  like that so you know there's Data Korea now there is Data Chile we're releasing
*  Data Mexico on January and we've been creating these tools that what they do
*  is something that is very simple but it's not easy to do you know it's easy to
*  use but it's hard to do is to integrate you know 15 20 30 different data sets
*  but not just provide files but integrate them into narratives so what we do is we
*  transform data into stories you know that's the main form of integration that
*  we provide that allows people to find the data on the web you know the stories
*  have you know text that is generated semi algorithmically using the data
*  visualizations also you know so imagine for the US the US has like 70,000
*  census designated places you know each one of them has you know a complete
*  profile you know with more than 70 visualizations and a lot of text and
*  information so even if you are a little town you have all of your census data
*  and your BA data and your BLS data in DataUSA and then we have more advanced
*  tools like ways to integrate data and download data you know but integrating
*  data from multiple sources ways of creating custom visualizations and that
*  has been you know something that that has done you know very well also we've
*  done similar solution for private sector companies in which we integrate the
*  data from their marketing departments and logistics and so forth to create
*  platforms that people can use in a strategic decision-making and are these
*  also useful for academics doing studies of yeah demography or whatever they use
*  it a lot so like just to give an idea right now on our online properties we
*  get over a million people a month okay so we run service you know to try to
*  figure out you know who they are and how we can serve them better and like a
*  platform like DataUSA you know 35 to 40 percent of the people that that visited
*  it's like academic of some form whether it is like a high school student doing a
*  homework what it is a university professor you know using it in some
*  report like if you if you go to Google Scholar and you search for the URL it
*  would be a relatively well cited paper like unfortunately you don't get crazy
*  for those ones you know maybe one day you know you're gonna be able to put
*  your websites on Google Scholar as well but that's another story and so we do
*  get people from academia we do get a lot of people from local governments
*  okay you know and people just go to the website and use it is it a no it's
*  totally free right now we're thinking maybe in the future to add some freemium
*  features you know for like you know people that are using this some people
*  use it for example to do market analysis you know and we could provide like
*  freemium features on that case but so far it's completely free open source you
*  know so it's a very open project and is that similar to you also mentioned
*  ultimately the urban perception the idea of using actual photographs of
*  different places in the city to sort of but but not just show them in a
*  slideshow but learn about them yeah so it's related because if you see what I'm
*  interested in I'm interested on kind of like these applications of science and
*  technology to society you know and one of the things that I tried to do over
*  the last decade is to find alternative ways to collect data and hopefully data
*  about aspects of society have been hard to quantify before so in 2010 and I got
*  the idea that and we could use Google Street View images to quantify
*  evaluative aspects of cities you know which place looks safe which place look
*  lively which place you know look depressing beautiful and so forth at
*  that time a lot of people were like oh this is crazy these are all subjective
*  things never gonna be able to do it is all meaningless but I discovered that on
*  the one hand there was a literature on urban planning of people that have
*  attended and had done that many times but with very very small sample sizes of
*  both images and you know a people so what I did is I did a crowd sourcing
*  study and that quickly became the largest data set ever you know of a
*  visual perception service that was called place pools and that allows us to
*  classify 4,000 images and we got over 100,000 people rating them and we
*  discovered a few things first that people's preference were very
*  transitive so okay yeah so it's not that you know that all over the place like if
*  I show you like a picture of a really nice you know like beautiful well-kempt
*  neighborhood and I show you like a picture of a you know like a very you
*  know a sketchy you know favela or industrial you know like people tend to
*  let's say answer that the first one is safer than the second one and that tends
*  to be quite a universal preference so so the difference between images is so
*  large that it overwhelms the differences between people okay and we could use
*  those those scores to like measure you know like the segregation you don't know
*  if it's actually safe all you know is everyone perceives it to be safe yeah and
*  we don't expect it to be because like what we wanted to measure was the
*  perception because perception can also have an effect that is independent of
*  whether that location is actually safe or not so they're different things they
*  don't have to be the same actually we've all been in cities in neighborhoods
*  where you had said oh this looks safe or oh this doesn't look safe and you know
*  with articulating why we're saying that might be difficult exactly so what we
*  discovered though is that crowdsourcing was very limited for them amount of data
*  that we needed to collect so a city like New York Manhattan alone has about
*  80,000 street segments so that's a lot of street segments so let's say you want to
*  get one image per street segment you know and you want to evaluate that image
*  and let's say that you you want to compare that image with only ten others
*  you know to be able to get a decent score you know it's it's imagine it's
*  like college football but with you know like 80,000 teams and 10 games you know
*  exactly you know so it's super under determined matrix you know it's still
*  you need a lot of traffic just to evaluate all of those images for one
*  city in one dimension so what we decided to do is to say let's grab the data that
*  we have and let's train computer vision algorithms to like do the clicking for
*  us okay and we find that actually those computer algorithms work very well and
*  they allowed us to scale to create you know urban perception maps with hundreds
*  of thousands of images and then we could use that to study how perception
*  affected behavior okay and what what did we find so we teamed up with with a
*  team of Italian colleagues that had mobile phone data and they could see the
*  activity of people in cities as a function of the time of the day you know
*  okay so then we could see if people tended to avoid and safe-looking places
*  you know a controlling for distance to the subway for distance to the central
*  business district for other things like the density of jobs the density of
*  population and so forth and we did find very interesting effects so we first we
*  find that like people tend to avoid unsafe looking places like after
*  controlling for all those things you find less people in those places than
*  you would expect and those effects are modulated by demographics so it's a
*  stronger for women and for the elderly but it's reversed for you know people
*  below 30 so like young people tend to like they hang out in those safe-looking
*  places you know young male specially you know but like elderly women tend to
*  avoid those places and and it kind of like makes sense but it helped formalize
*  something that I think we'll had an intuition for but now you know we
*  actually have like you know hardcore data to be able to show it I mean it's
*  another example of what we're talking about a different way of thinking about
*  conceptualizing different kind of information in some sense or at least a
*  different way of of sharing it and thinking about it and that's the other
*  last thing I wanted to ask you about was how this relates to your interest in
*  collective memory I did have one podcast guest Lynn Kelly who studies memory
*  palaces ancient memory palaces so the idea of remembering things by
*  associating them with you know physical geographical location she thinks that
*  Stonehenge for example was used as a way of remembering what you would call
*  know-how right as it knowledge that was because they didn't have writing they
*  couldn't pass it down that easily but nowadays we have the internet we have
*  books we have TV it's a very different kind of thing how is our collective
*  memory of who we are and what kinds of things we pay attention to been affected
*  by these technological changes yeah so I've studied how collective memory is
*  affected by by technology language and time so we need a paper you know with
*  Steve Pinker and other people in which we looked at the network of global
*  languages okay so that's a network in which each node is a language a language
*  are connected if they're likely to be translated or spoken by the same people
*  so let's say English might be connected to German if a lot of books get
*  translated from one language to another and a lot of people that speak German
*  also speaking and so forth and we map that network using three datasets a
*  data set with over two million book translations a Twitter so we detected
*  the language you know of tweets and then if you tweet in English and you tweet in
*  Spanish you know I can connect those two languages because you are expressing
*  knowledge of both and Wikipedia edits you know so it's not reading Wikipedia
*  but if you edited the page you know of Einstein in German and you edited the
*  page of Einstein in English you probably know how to write in German so
*  you probably know both languages and interestingly enough when we compare
*  that network you know with a data set that we created of globally famous
*  people we found that the centrality of a language in that network explained the
*  number of famous people produced by the language better than the population of
*  that language better than the wealth of that language you know so that tells us
*  hey you know like fame you know or global fame it's something that is very
*  much dependent on on like this network because if you think about it the
*  network of languages is like the most aggregate version of the global social
*  network that you can have you cannot have a social relationship if you don't
*  speak a language you know you cannot make a friend just by nodding you know
*  so in that context you know we learned that you know much of what the world
*  knows is gonna be modulated by by this network you know and there's a lot of
*  implications about that you know so just just be clear is the network take
*  the form of saying things like if you know English you're more likely to know
*  French than Chinese whereas if you know Chinese you're more likely to know
*  Korean than to know English things like that exactly so the network gathers all
*  those links it's it's you know their paths between every language and every
*  language but a language like English for instance is a global hub you know so
*  someone from Portugal and someone from Vietnam probably they're gonna speak
*  something the most likely things they're gonna speak English but there's
*  also like regional hubs you know so like for example French connects a lot with
*  African languages you know also you know Spanish connects with like you know
*  Kichwa and you know Mapu Dungun and other you know languages from you know
*  native South America then you have also Arabic as being a regional hub Chinese
*  you know and then you have language like Russian is a very important regional
*  have on all you know like Eastern Europe and in Northeast Asia you know and then
*  you have peripheral languages so it's a very hierarchical network with like
*  English in the center then a ring of you know regional hubs and then you know
*  like smaller languages that are kind of like on the periphery you know connected
*  to some of those regional hubs and I would love to see a picture of this is
*  there an image language.media.mit.edu
*  Very good thank you.
*  And then we also studied how a communication technologies affected our
*  collective memory and we use this data set that we've created of over 70,000
*  famous biographies to look at how changes in technology change the number
*  of globally famous people that were born each year and the occupations associated
*  to those people so for instance you know when you think of you know Einstein he
*  would be a physicist when you think of Michelangelo he would be you know a
*  painter you know and what you find is that when new communication technologies
*  were introduced the composition of our collective memory changed not only the
*  size so before printing you look at the matrix of our collective memory is
*  mostly political and religious leaders okay after printing bosses of hierarchies
*  Exactly you know after printing you get famous artists and famous scientists for
*  the first time you get a lot of painters you get composers you know you start
*  getting astronomers you know writers you know that also there but then there is
*  the second printing era which we talked before when people start doing like
*  shorter formats and so forth and there you have an explosion on the sciences
*  then now you start differentiating you know natural philosophy into more
*  sciences you know you get a lot of famous writers and so forth and
*  composers you know and then you have the invention of film and radio and that
*  generates a huge shift on the arts because before that it was the painter
*  and the composer then it's about the performer so it's the musician is the
*  singer composers disappear musicians and singers are the ones that now become
*  famous actors become famous not play writers anymore you know so there's kind
*  of like that shift and then you have the introduction of television with
*  television you create the fame of sportsmen no because sportsmen were not
*  that kind of performer yeah before television and and it's a live
*  performance you know like it has to be at the right time when you watch the
*  game and and visible in 3d and yeah exactly you can experience it there yeah
*  okay so so you do have kind of like that change in the composition of our
*  collective memory with introduction of communication technologies and it's
*  very clear so to me when now when I think about like the history I don't
*  think about like the modern times and the Renaissance and the things that I
*  learned in school I think of it in terms of like okay what was the dominant
*  communication technology at the time and that's the era that I set myself in and
*  what's gonna come next yeah so the next thing that I see Instagram influencers
*  ah next on that like well what what is do you know tick tock I know of it I've
*  never used it yeah oh dude far behind it's you don't need an account to watch
*  okay that already tells you something so yeah you know it's it's massive I
*  think in in different ways first is like the quality of the performers that you
*  observe that it's very good you know the amount of attention also that is on
*  tick tock it's amazing like there's you know like all of these views getting
*  like millions and millions and millions of likes so it's not you know like a
*  marginal traffic it's huge you know and is the first global social media because
*  it's a Chinese company so it's the only social media that is popular in both
*  China and the West you know which makes it quite interesting as a global
*  phenomena you know and it's not based on peer communication it's actually
*  broadcasting so okay in tick tock you have like two channels the for you which
*  is like a TV feed in which you just scroll and the following which is the
*  people that you're following you have a feed of who you follow and that's it you
*  know you can search the search is horrible it doesn't work it's like that
*  doesn't provide good results and and it's very passive like television so
*  they reinvented television for the phone era you know in a zapping world in which
*  like content is 15 30 seconds long and you know yeah it's those 15 or 30
*  seconds there's a lot of good quality content at that range of size I mean
*  Twitter and podcasts are as cutting-edge as I'm gonna get I think
*  technologically but yeah they they keep coming along very quickly so yeah and so
*  I guess the the point is that how we think about ourselves changes when these
*  media change right how we remember ourselves indeed what I want to say
*  about tick tock that I like which is interesting I do think that is more
*  social and more family so when I use Twitter I use it by myself when I use
*  Facebook is by myself when I watch tick tock I'm in the couch with my wife and
*  my daughter and the three of us are looking at the same screen at the same
*  time and talking about what we're watching and I do think that that's
*  important because we do have a lot of interactions right now in which people
*  are interacting with screens independently yeah and I grew up probably
*  you grew up you know with people sitting in front of a television and and having
*  that more of us a collective experience you know in which you have to negotiate
*  what you watch you have to talk about what you watch and and and I do find
*  that you know that's that's a good thing compared to like the social media that
*  has been more peer-to-peer but isolating well I like to end on optimistic notes
*  is that your optimistic note and what do you think about the future well what
*  should our optimism be where should be located I I'm an optimist you know and I
*  don't know that's a good thing or a bad thing and I think maybe genetics but I
*  tend to be optimistic even though you know like today you know Chile is going
*  through a very difficult moment with all of the the things that have happened
*  they are doing the last four or five days but I do think that at the end of
*  the day you know in the positive things in life tend to add up you know and
*  build on each other better than the negative things in life so going back to
*  the beginning we talked about where information order grows and that's
*  because our ability to create order and complexity is larger than the rate at
*  which is getting destroyed and I think that's also true for many of the
*  positive things you know so I am an optimist because I do think that at the
*  end of the day you know things add up you know better you know as we move along
*  all right Cesar Hidalgo thanks for some good information there thanks for being
*  on the podcast hey my pleasure
*  you
