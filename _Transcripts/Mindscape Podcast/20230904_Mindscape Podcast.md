Welcome to the September 2023 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape! These monthly excursions are funded by Patreon supporters (who are also the ones asking the questions). We take questions asked by Patreons, whittle them down to a more manageable number -- based primarily on whether I have anything interesting to say about them, not whether the questions themselves are good -- and sometimes group them together if they are about a similar topic.

Big news -- you can now pre-order The Biggest Ideas in the Universe vol. 2: Quanta and Fields!

# Mindscape Ask Me Anything, Sean Carroll | September 2023
**Mindscape Podcast:** [September 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as5zl3m_CyU)
*  Hello, everyone. Welcome to the September 2023 Ask Me Anything edition of the Mindscape
*  Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. We're approaching, it occurs to me, episode 250
*  of the Mindscape Podcast. I just published 248 last week, and I'm not going to do anything
*  special for the 250th episode. It doesn't seem quite glorious enough to do it, but we
*  have approximately 50 episodes per year. So it reminds me that we just passed our fifth
*  anniversary at the beginning of July, and I didn't do anything as far as I remember.
*  It was a hectic time, the beginning of July. I was trying to get my book done, traveling
*  a little bit, et cetera. So I wanted to at least spread some thanks, some gratitude for
*  everyone who's been listening, all the new listeners too, but everyone who has enjoyed
*  Mindscape over the last five years. That's a lot of episodes. It's not exactly 50 per
*  year because the AMAs don't get numbered, things like that. But it's pretty impressive.
*  I would not necessarily have bet five years ago that we'd still be doing this now, certainly
*  not every single week. But it's a lot of fun for me to do. It's a little bit of work. I
*  will not lie about that. But I think it's absolutely worthwhile so far. I'm learning
*  a lot, that's for sure. I'm hoping that other people are learning something too. It's absolutely
*  the case that part of my motivation for doing this is to counteract some of the misinformation,
*  some of the bad information that is out there. I know that Mindscape is not the most controversial
*  or action-packed or even gee whiz podcast out there, but there's a lot of cool ideas
*  to talk to. I mean, just the fact that I don't like to have the same guests on more than
*  once. There's a huge number of guests that I've had that would be great to have back,
*  but there's also an even huge number of people I've not yet had as guests. It would be easier
*  for me to have guests on over and over again, no doubt about that. But I never know when
*  I'm going to discover something new and interesting by just having someone who I've never talked
*  to. Most of the guests by now that I have on Mindscape are people who I've not really
*  interacted with very seriously before having them on the podcast. So that's what learning
*  and surprise is all about. Some episodes will resonate with some people and some won't,
*  but that's part of the excitement. So very proud of what we've done here. Very proud of having
*  the Mindscape Big Picture Scholarship, which you can donate to, that is helping people study the
*  big ideas at university. Very, very pleased that people sign up for Patreon. As you know,
*  if you're a listener, these Ask Me Anything episodes are funded by Patreon supporters,
*  and they're the ones who are asking the questions. You can become a Patreon supporter,
*  it's pretty easy to do, at patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll. And five years is a long time. Will
*  we still be doing it five years from now? I bet we are. I think so. I think it's still not run out
*  of things to do yet. At some point, if I think that it's just work, then I will quit. Then I
*  will easily say this isn't worth it anymore. But five years, I think that there's two Mindscape
*  guests who are deceased now, which is very sad to me. Herb Gintis, I think I mentioned before,
*  passed away earlier this year. He led along in a productive life. But also Mari Ruti has passed
*  away. She's exactly my age. We knew each other back in graduate school. But cancer does not care
*  how old you are. And she fought cancer for a couple of years. And then eventually, as often
*  happens, the continued very harsh treatments of the cancer were what ended up not being able to
*  be treated anymore. And so she passed away a couple months ago. Very sad, but you know,
*  life is going on, right? If you haven't listened to Mari's episode, it's a special one, because
*  it's a bit of a departure from what we did on Mindscape otherwise. But she was a uniquely good
*  person at making a different kind of thing palatable and exciting and interesting to other
*  audiences. In this case, Lacanian psychoanalysis, which is not our forte here, but I couldn't think
*  of a better person to talk about it than Mari. And you know, she's very, very missed by her friends.
*  And I hope that she recognized before she died how loved she was around the world. And it's,
*  you know, part of time passing. It's going to happen to all of us. So it's just a reminder
*  that we've been around for a while now doing the podcast. Again, tremendous thanks for everyone
*  listening, either if it's completely passively or supporting the podcast, leaving reviews on
*  iTunes or supporting on Patreon or leaving comments on the web page at Preposterous Universe. I
*  thank you all for participating in the journey. It's a great one. We're going to continue on
*  for a while. So with that, let's go. Dacian Ricciardi says, I've heard you mention that Twitter
*  is dying several times on Mindscape. And I was wondering why you feel that way. And what do you
*  think about it now that it's rebranding to X? Yeah, this is obviously a big important question.
*  I kind of simply say Twitter is dying and I go on with it. I don't want to dwell on it. But okay,
*  this is a perfectly good question. Let me give you my thoughts as of September 2023, subject to
*  change, of course, if things change. Yeah, I do think it's dying. It won't it won't completely die,
*  of course, that I think is an exaggeration. Twitter will exist, even though it's been branded X,
*  whatever it's going to be called, it will exist, I think, in the years to come, at least as long as
*  this podcast does would be my guess. But it's changing. And it's absolutely changing for the
*  worse in many noticeable ways. You know, the most obvious way is, it's much easier to be an asshole
*  on Twitter now than it used to be. It's easier to be racist or anti-semitic or just basically
*  combative. You can see in the people who were previously banned and invited back, it's not hard
*  to see the general trend of who has been invited back after having been gotten rid of Donald Trump,
*  one of the most obvious examples there. And more importantly to me, because you know,
*  the people there are people on Twitter who are harassed, right? For in various ways,
*  I'm generally not one of them. I'm not really a target of harassment, but I don't like it that
*  other people are harassed. It sort of lowers the tone, makes it less pleasant overall. And I feel
*  bad for the people who are harassed. And I'm not the only person who feels that way. And therefore,
*  a lot of the good people who I like on Twitter have left or are leaving or using it less. I'm
*  still there, but I use it a lot less. I basically, you know, post announcements for new podcasts,
*  and I occasionally retweet things, but I don't engage a lot like I used to. It's just a little
*  bit less pleasant. Many of the people like I follow, like I said, have literally closed their
*  accounts. There was recently an article, I think in Nature, about scientists leaving. Something like
*  40% of scientists polled said that they'd either left Twitter or were using it a lot less now. So,
*  you know, that just makes the platform less enjoyable, less fun, etc. So looking for
*  alternatives is the current mode that I'm in. There's another article, by the way, I think
*  Washington Post maybe, that mentioned there's a lot more disinformation on Twitter now than there
*  ever was before. And, you know, these are studies, these are people collecting data. This is not vibes,
*  this is not, you know, an anecdotal impression. We all have our own thing that we see, right? Our
*  own timeline on social media. So your experience might be great, but you can't extrapolate from
*  your experience to somebody else's, and many people have a much less great experience right
*  now. And that just means that the conversations are not as good. And obviously there is not just
*  an idea that many people have been welcomed that you don't want to be interacting with,
*  but the way that the algorithm arranges the conversations has been dramatically altered.
*  And there's been a lot of ink spilled or electrons destroyed about the blue check marks
*  system. For those of you who are not on Twitter, bless your hearts, there used to be this thing
*  called being a verified user, and you get a little blue check mark by you. And it was originally
*  because, you know, people like Shaquille O'Neal, who was a big celebrity user in the early days,
*  well, it's easy to start a Twitter account and claim to be Shaquille O'Neal, right? So they decided
*  to introduce this idea of verification that would make sure that you really were who you claimed to
*  be. And it spread not only to just celebrities and athletes, but to journalists and politicians
*  and academics and so forth. So that if you got that little blue check mark, you knew this person
*  was at least who they said they were, you didn't have to listen to them, but at least they were
*  somebody. And there was at least some preference given, and this is always where it gets contentious,
*  but there's an algorithm in Twitter that sorts the order of replies and shows you suggested posts,
*  even if you don't subscribe to people. And being a verified user was a little bit of a boost there.
*  So that has gone away now. There's still blue check marks, and they're still called verified users,
*  but they have nothing to do with being competent, with being an authority, with being who you say
*  you are. What they have to do with is you signing up and paying $8 a month. But those people are
*  still boosted in the conversations. And it used to be that there was at least a slight positive
*  correlation between being a verified user and being a constructive addition to the conversation,
*  because you could get verified by, for example, being an authority in some subject. When news
*  would break, when a country would get invaded or there was a disaster somewhere and you could go
*  to the trending topics and click on them, it was useful to do so because there was some journalist
*  who had spent 20 years in this country and was on the ground and could tell you what was going on,
*  and you had not heard of them before, but you could find them. Now when you do that, the people who
*  are shown to you are people who spend $8. And those are not only not positively correlated with
*  giving useful information, they are actively negatively correlated with giving useful information.
*  Some people who spend the $8 to be verified are, of course, perfectly reasonable, but many of them
*  are just people who want to mouth off, people who embody the Dunning-Kruger effect. And so it's
*  become way less useful. And it's not only less useful for people like me trying to find news and
*  new pieces of information, but there's been various degradations of what is called the API,
*  which lets people use Twitter automatically to post information and things like that.
*  So emergency services or informational services find it much harder to use Twitter. For me,
*  one of the fun aspects of Twitter was Kelly Trulove, who posted under True Sci-Fi,
*  had these lists of physicists and astronomers and writers and philosophers and so forth,
*  and would make on Twitter and would make graphs where who followed who and how you could find
*  people and things like that. Very, very useful. No longer exists on Twitter because you can't get
*  the information, you can't download it, not allowed to anymore. The company has been steadily,
*  but absolutely unmistakably, making it harder to use Twitter. The way that I read Twitter used to
*  be something called TweetDeck. Now that is removed. I can't use it anymore, right? So it's just a much
*  worse experience overall. The statement is that going forward, they're going to remove the ability
*  to block people on Twitter, which is just a disaster. I mean, it's a true disaster for people
*  who are harassed, but it's a disaster for people like me who have to sift through a lot of nonsense
*  to try to find something interesting. So for many, many reasons, I think that Twitter is seriously
*  declining. And again, it's not just, you know, the vibes are bad. It's very tangible degradation
*  of the experience. Like a vibes-based argument would be, well, I don't like that they renamed
*  it X versus Twitter. I couldn't care less that they renamed it X versus Twitter. I think that
*  it is a terrible business decision to give up a free connection to basically a word that had entered
*  the English vocabulary on the basis of your corporation, right? The idea of tweeting and
*  retweeting and quote tweeting are out there as words that people use and you give up those words.
*  That just makes no sense to me, but I don't claim to be a genius business person. So maybe there is
*  some logic behind there. I don't know. I also don't care. They can call it whatever they want. It's
*  just much less useful to me now than it was. I don't know what's going to happen next. I am
*  personally spending most of my time on Blue Sky to the extent that I'm doing anything at all,
*  but I can't really push Blue Sky very hard because it's not open yet. You need an invite to get there.
*  It's still in beta. Hopefully it will roll out to open enrollment very, very soon. But honestly,
*  the reason I like Blue Sky the best is it's not trying to be anything else. It's not trying to
*  improve things. It's basically just Twitter on a different platform. There's tiny marginal
*  differences that people make a big deal out of, but it's easy to use. You sign up and you use it
*  and it's kind of like Twitter and that's all I really want. I know there's other options,
*  Mastodon and threads and so forth. Lots of people love Mastodon. I just didn't like it that much.
*  Mastodon is Twitter for Linux users. I used to have a Linux box on my desk in my office and there's
*  a certain kind of person who loves Linux as an operating system rather than Mac OS or Windows
*  because they can really get in there and they can fiddle with it and they can make it exactly what
*  they want, which is great. It's also just much harder to use if you're not devoted to it.
*  Mastodon has that feeling for me. It's not friendly to the new users and so I don't see it being anywhere
*  near the scale that Twitter is. Again, I could be completely wrong. I have no special insight on
*  these things, but I think it's a loss, Twitter. I really do. I think that it was very important to
*  me. I've certainly connected with many of the Mindscape guests in the first time by reading
*  their Twitter accounts. I've made friends in real life from Twitter. I've learned things by talking
*  to people on Twitter, so it's not trivial to me. I think it's a true loss and I feel bad,
*  but like I said, life goes on, things change, we adapt and we move on. Next, I'm going to group two
*  questions together. Amy Ferguson says, your work often explores profound questions about the
*  universe. I'm curious about your personal reflections. In your downtime, do you often find
*  yourself contemplating deeper, bigger picture ideas as a matter of personal interest and has
*  the nature or frequency of these reflections changed from when you were younger? And then Mike
*  Johnson says, does the idea of eternity ever cause you to break out in a cold sweat? The idea of
*  eternity is one of the few things that will make me lie awake at night, staring at the ceiling,
*  trying to make it make sense. I have an overwhelming sense of dread and confusion when I think about
*  the idea there being no end. And even if there was an end, what does that even mean? I know when
*  I'm dead, I won't have a brain capable of these thoughts, so it doesn't really matter, but for now
*  the idea scares the bleep out of me. So I think you see the relationship between these two questions,
*  reflecting on giant, bigger picture ideas. Mike is a little bit specific about the idea of eternity.
*  Amy is more open-ended about different kinds of big picture questions. I've always loved thinking
*  about big picture questions. Do I do it more now that I'm either older or more educated or it's my
*  professional job or whatever? I don't think so. I do think that your reflections change. I hope that
*  they do. I certainly did for me. It's actually hard to remember, to be honest, how I thought about
*  these things when I was 16 years old or whatever, because one does become extremely different in
*  one's thought processes as you learn things, as you think about your own thoughts and realize,
*  you know, that thought really wasn't that smart. We're always, I hope, thinking about our thoughts,
*  thinking about where we're coming from, and hopefully we can re-interrogate some of the ways
*  in which different thoughts fit together and then change our minds. So certainly I have a much more
*  sophisticated, I think, I would like to say more sophisticated point of view on these things, but I
*  don't think that the fundamental nature or frequency of these reflections has changed. I want to know
*  what the universe is, what it's made of, how long it's going to last, where it came from,
*  our place in the universe. I think about all these things. I've long thought about exactly those
*  things. The idea of eternity in particular doesn't bother me, no. I mean, it's interesting because
*  some people are bothered by the idea that the universe will end, right? The idea that it's not
*  eternal bothers some people. I think that bothering or a cold sweat is just not quite the right way,
*  or the best way, to approach it in the sense that what it is is, what would be better would be an
*  acknowledgement that our everyday intuitions, trained as they are by evolution and our lives
*  and things like that, just aren't up to the task of thinking about eternity pro or con, right? So
*  why should we feel comfortable and happy thinking about these questions? So even though I like
*  thinking about these big deep questions, I don't expect that my instincts or intuition are going to
*  be very helpful or really going to tune me to think about them in the best way. You really have
*  to try to be open-minded, I think, and say like, well, I thought it should be this way, but it's
*  not that way. I think that it would be more satisfying to me or more rewarding if it were
*  this way, but it just isn't. That's the kind of attitude I want to take in my reflections on these
*  deepest questions. Ahmad Chaker says, I just watched your video on renormalization. This is referring
*  to, from a couple years ago, the biggest ideas in the universe videos that are leading into the books
*  that we're in the process of putting out. So Ahmad says, I think I understand why we can ignore
*  energies above a certain cutoff, but the loop diagrams still have an infinite amount of diagrams
*  between, let's say, 2EV and 3EV. What happens to these? Good. That's a great question, actually. I
*  never quite thought about it in that way. It's kind of an interesting version of a way that you can
*  think about it. I can say all the words that I'm saying, and they make perfect sense to me, but
*  someone hears them and reinterprets them in a slightly different but completely legitimate way
*  and reaches something else. So the idea here, just to back up, is in Feynman diagrams, when you're
*  calculating some process. So Feynman diagrams, remember, are little pictures of elementary
*  particles bumping into each other, but they're not just evocative little pictures. The physicists who
*  do this for a living use Feynman diagrams to do calculations. The diagrams correspond to a certain
*  equation, which you then typically an integral, which you then solve to figure out what exactly
*  is the probability of this process occurring. And when you have a loop in a Feynman diagram,
*  so you can imagine the topology of these little pictures you're drawing, you can draw tree diagrams
*  like an electron comes in and goes out, a positron goes in and comes out, and they exchange one little
*  photon between them. There are no loops. There's no closed curves in that diagram. But if they
*  exchanged two photons between them, now there's a loop that you can sort of draw when you go around,
*  and the rule in Feynman diagram land is you add up the contributions from every possible diagram.
*  When there is a loop in the diagram, there is a free parameter, because you can ask how much momentum
*  is going down any one leg of that loop, and it turns out it is not fixed by the external conditions,
*  by just momentum conservation, etc. So you integrate over all possible values of the momentum
*  going through the loop, and this integral will often be infinite if you do it in the sort of
*  straightforward, conventional, follow-your-nose way. This is what led to all the discussion in the
*  1940s and 50s about infinities and renormalization and quantum field theory, etc. And the reason why
*  it's infinite is the correct reason. Let me say it correctly first, then we'll back up.
*  The correct reason is because you, when it is infinite, some loop diagrams are not infinite,
*  but many are. The reason why they are is because you're integrating the momentum going through the
*  loop from zero to infinity, and some functions that you integrate from zero to infinity, like
*  one over x squared, forget zero, how about integrating one into infinity?
*  There are some functions you can integrate and get a finite answer, okay, but there's other functions,
*  I guess maybe e to the minus x would be a better example. You can integrate that from zero to
*  infinity perfectly well. There's other functions which, you know, the integral gets bigger and
*  bigger and bigger and just gets, you know, infinitely big. So the whole idea of what are called
*  effective field theories is to put a cutoff on that momentum, to not integrate from zero to infinity,
*  but from zero to some finite number, and then the integral becomes finite. And you can read about
*  that in my upcoming book, Quanta and Fields, which is the second volume in the Biggest Ideas in the
*  Universe series. So anyway, Ahmad's question is, but if you just look at a finite range of momenta
*  that you're including, so forget about the infinitely big momenta, I should have said that
*  the justification for ignoring the infinitely big momenta is we don't know what's going on at
*  infinitely big momenta. Momentum is inversely proportional to distance in quantum mechanics
*  and field theory. So you're effectively talking about infinitely short distances where space time
*  itself might not be a valid concept. So there's a justification for doing this. But technically,
*  an integral is a sum over an infinite number of things, right? So as Ahmad correctly says,
*  just between two electron volts and three electron volts, there are an infinite number of momenta
*  that you're adding up in some sense. The answer, which is sort of disappointingly mundane, is
*  that's just what calculus is for. Calculus is exactly about adding up an infinite number of
*  things and getting a finite answer. Because really, you're adding up zero times infinity,
*  okay? And that's ill-defined, as it is simply stated boldly that way. The zero that I'm talking
*  about is the contribution from a single number between, in this case, two electron volts and
*  three electron volts. It's the area under a curve of zero width, right? It's the curve that goes
*  from a certain number to the same number without moving at all. That's going to have zero area
*  under it. But there's an infinite number of them that we add up to get the whole area under the
*  curve between the starting value and an ending value. So it was Newton and Leibniz who taught
*  us how to do this, which is to discretize, to chunk up that curve into finite area rectangles,
*  add all them up, but then take the limit as the rectangles get skinnier and skinnier.
*  And by doing that, you get a well-defined limit, a finite answer for your infinite sum. It's
*  exactly the same thing in Feynman diagrams. There's nothing different than that. You get a
*  finite answer for the integral over this loop momentum of all the possible momenta between 2EV
*  and 3EV. That's just not a problem. That's just calculus. The only problem comes when you're
*  considering momenta that go infinitely big. And that's a whole other story. Cooper says,
*  has your thinking on complexity changed at all in light of your recent conversations with Sam Bowles
*  and David Kracauer? Both emphasize the teleological nature of complex systems. And my impression was
*  that you hadn't thought of that feature being a fundamental aspect of complexity. Well, yes and
*  no. On the one hand, I think that you're right that I, well, I guess the way that I would put it is,
*  I had not thought that anyone would use the feature of teleological behavior or
*  teleonomic matter, as David likes to say, as a fundamental characteristic of complex systems.
*  It is certainly a characteristic of some complex systems. And I'm very, very interested in
*  understanding how that can be the case in a world where the fundamental laws of physics are not
*  teleological at all. So this is a classic case asking about emergence, right? How do you get
*  purposes and goals emerging out of the mindless, purposeless interaction of microscopic subsystems?
*  I think that's a perfectly legitimate question to ask. I think it's perfectly legitimate to say
*  this is a fundamental problem that we should focus on. I don't think it's right to say
*  that that's a necessary central feature of complex systems. I do think that the galaxy is complex.
*  You know, our galaxy is pretty darn complex. It is not teleonomic in any useful sense. So I think
*  that, I mean, I get why you would want to do that because, as David would say, there is such a big
*  difference once matter becomes teleonomic, once a complex adaptive system has goals and, you know,
*  back in the day, you would, in Santa Fe Institute circles, hear a lot more talk about complex
*  adaptive systems than you do now. These days, we more often just talk about complex systems.
*  And I think that's an important difference. If you stick the word adaptive in there,
*  then I would absolutely get that teleology is playing a big role. The idea of a complex adaptive
*  system is that it has information about the external world, it processes that information,
*  and it uses that information to get something that in some well-defined sense it wants,
*  even if that thing is just to stay alive, to continue existing, right? I think that there
*  are precursors to that that count as complex. And so my argument would be that if you skip right to
*  teleonomic matter and complex adaptive systems that have goals and so forth, you're skipping over a lot
*  of interesting things, right? I mean, you're talking about the evolution of the species
*  without talking about the origin of life. And you're absolutely welcome to do that. That's a
*  fine thing to do, but you wouldn't want to argue the origin of life is uninteresting.
*  You wouldn't want to argue, I think, that the various kinds of systems that seem complex to me
*  but don't yet have purpose or teleology in them are somehow less interesting or don't count. So I'm
*  just, I don't think there's really any incompatibility here. I'm just pumping for a more expansive
*  notion of complexity that includes the thing that I care about, which is where these complex
*  systems came to be in the first place. Complexogenesis, right? That's something that
*  dovetails very nicely with my interest in entropy and thermodynamics in the arrow of time. So
*  I don't want it ruled out from this whole area of inquiry. Rob Ghebela says,
*  I have a question about your confidence in the claim that all physical laws relevant for
*  our everyday life are known. What about the possibility of a new force which is so weakly
*  coupled that we would not see it in current collider experiments but which becomes relevant
*  when very many particles are involved at mesoscopic or macroscopic scales? After all,
*  gravity is like that and we wouldn't have found it by only looking at collider experiments.
*  Yeah, sure, a weak new force is absolutely something that we can be interested in and look for and
*  are interested in and do look for. If you look up the various places, papers and books and so forth
*  where I've talked about this idea, I explicitly consider this possibility. The fact is that
*  ordinary matter is made of only three things at the end of the day, protons, neutrons, and electrons.
*  Maybe you could add in photons and gluons if you wanted to like look at a higher order of
*  perturbation but roughly speaking, the quantum numbers that are non-zero from the matter in you
*  and me are the numbers of electrons, the numbers of protons, the numbers of neutrons. So that
*  actually makes it very simple to look for new weak forces because all you have to do is measure the
*  force between electrons, protons, and neutrons and other electrons, protons, neutrons. So the
*  parameter space is kind of small. You can actually do everything and so all you have to do is look at
*  heavy collections of matter with different abundances of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
*  Right? People have done that. There are limits. There are quantitative numerical limits on how
*  big such a new force can be. Of course, it's not necessarily the same as gravity because gravity is
*  what we think of as an infinite range force. It stretches over astrophysical distances. You could
*  imagine a force that is stronger than gravity but shorter range so it's not as obvious in an
*  astrophysical setting. But we've looked for that too and the answer is if you go down to the scales
*  that are like, you know, neurological scales, right? The sizes of the separation between neurons in
*  your brain or something like that. The limits on the strength of any new force are comparable.
*  I forget the numbers but you know they're in the same ballpark as the strength of gravity.
*  And the thing about gravity is it's a super weak force. Like you say, we do notice it but only
*  because all of the earth is pulling us down. So if you care about the force exerted by a neuron
*  on another neuron or even by the earth on another neuron, there's just no room for that.
*  Those are ruled out. So yeah, that's an absolutely conceptually allowed thing to think about but the
*  data have spoken on that one. They're not there. There could be other forces there but they're too
*  weak to make any difference to our everyday lives including our biology. Chris V says,
*  what are your worries and hopes for the future? I don't want to say too much about this because
*  we have an upcoming podcast about worries and hopes for the future but I think that, you know,
*  some of the worries and hopes for the future are kind of predictable. Like there are trend lines,
*  you know, environmental ones especially when it comes to climate change or pollution or things
*  like that. There are trends and they might look bad and that's a worry and I think that's a
*  perfectly legitimate worry but then we can also work against them. My worries and hopes therefore
*  are actually more concentrated, I guess I'm talking about the worries right now. Let's talk about the
*  worries. The unpredictable things, you know, the things that might have a rate or a probability
*  of happening but we don't know what it is and it's small, okay? So the question when you have
*  something that would be a disaster but it's unlikely to happen is how do you balance a small
*  probability versus a giant impact if the thing does happen? You know, AI is an example that people
*  like to use and I'll just repeat my usual thing that I say about AI. I think there's plenty of
*  good reasons to worry about the impact of AI on our lives and I am absolutely in favor of worrying
*  about it and putting safeguards in place. I am not impressed by people who leap right to destroying
*  all life on earth. I think that that is not a very plausible scenario and if, you know, there's some
*  other scenario where a hundred million people die or even more likely a scenario where billions of
*  people are slightly worse off, that's really bad. You know, we can worry about that. That's much
*  more plausible than extinction level events and it's absolutely worth worrying about and if we do
*  worry about it, I think we will also ameliorate the probability of the extinction level events.
*  So I don't think, so AI is not high on my list there because I think that if we just take the
*  realistic worries about it, we at least can try to ameliorate them, whether we will or not, yeah,
*  that I don't know. I'm kind of more worried, to be honest, about things that just seem unlikely
*  but are not new and sexy, like new bio weapons, pandemics, good old-fashioned nuclear war, right?
*  I think these things are still quite possible. Again, we don't need to jump right to extinction
*  level events to imagine millions of people being adversely affected by them and the time scales,
*  the frequency with which these things happen are sufficiently rare that human beings are not good
*  at planning for them. It hasn't happened in the last five years, of course the pandemic thing did,
*  I get that, but otherwise in a few years we'll say, well, it's been a while since the last pandemic,
*  I'm not so concerned about that one anymore and human beings, bless their hearts, they're just not
*  good at planning for things like that. So it's those kind of not completely implausible disaster
*  scenarios that have time scales longer than 10 years between when they generally happen
*  that I think are very good to worry about. Sunspots and solar flares are another one that I've
*  talked about before. In terms of hopes, I don't know, I have mentioned recently the podcast
*  we did with John Danaher about our coming automated utopia. I think we're getting very good
*  as a society at creating wealth, creating food, creating power, creating knowledge,
*  power in the sense of like electricity and things like that, not political power.
*  We might even arguably be getting better at protecting the environment if we really put
*  our minds to it, we have the capability technologically, let's put it that way,
*  to protect the environment. I always go back to the podcast we did with Joe Walston talking about
*  how just moving people into cities is a tremendously beneficial thing to do for the
*  environment and it is happening, right? So I can imagine the following idea, this is probably
*  utopian, but that's okay, you said what are the hopes. I can imagine that technology has been
*  improving so quickly that there's a mismatch in the time scale between the rate of technological
*  improvement and humans' habits of mind that organize society and how quickly those get updated.
*  Maybe right now we're still in a medieval mindset where it comes to society even though we have a
*  much more abundant physical environment in which we live. So the idea that we should just take all
*  this wealth and make sure every person is fed and housed and has basic health care and education
*  I think is a feasible thing. We could do it as a certainly in the United States we could do it if
*  we wanted to in the world probably we could do it without too much extra effort. But we don't even
*  try to literally just feed and clothe everybody, that's considered, I don't know, something that
*  society isn't meant to do. I think that's an outdated conception. So the utopian in me wants
*  to think that we at least might contemplate dramatically shifting how we organize society
*  so that everyone is given some basic needs. We have the physical capacity to do that, it's our
*  choice not to be doing it right now. So my hope is that we catch on to the fact that we can do it
*  and the fact that everyone benefits if we do it. If we just make sure there are no homeless people,
*  there's nobody living in poverty, there's nobody who doesn't get an education, there's nobody who
*  dies as a child unnecessarily, etc. All those things we could do. Those are my hopes for the
*  future. Maybe this podcast increases the probability that it happens by 0.0001% or something like that.
*  That's my single biggest hope for what the Mindscape podcast can possibly do. David Maxwell says,
*  does tenure for university positions act as a break on society's intellectual advancement by
*  keeping those with old ideas around at the expense of those with fresh ideas? Is it still
*  an appropriate way to allocate the limited resource of funded academics or research positions?
*  I think I've talked about this before, so maybe I'll try to keep it brief, but I think yes,
*  I think so. Because you can't just change one aspect of a system like this and expect all the
*  other aspects to go ahead unchanged. If it weren't for tenure, why would most people even try to be
*  become professors? Most people who become professors spend a lot of time, a lot of years
*  of their lives training for it. They're generally hard workers, pretty effective at the work that
*  they do. They're generally smart cookies and they're talented and they could make a living
*  other ways. Even my literal set of graduate students who I work with and who I know,
*  they either, you know, quote unquote, succeed by becoming faculty members or they don't succeed
*  at becoming faculty members and get much higher paid jobs doing something else. But a lot of that
*  is a trade off. You know, we say, okay, we're not going to give you as much money or material
*  rewards as you might otherwise get, but we'll give you job security. And that's very attractive to
*  people. You know, the idea like I'm going to work and work and work and get tenure. That's the goal
*  a lot of these people have. And it would be completely wrong to discount the more high brow
*  fact that tenure gives you freedom. Tenure gives you the freedom to work on new things. Like if I
*  were hired to be a cosmologist, I decided I wanted to work on philosophy instead. If I had tenure,
*  which I don't by the way, but I have a different position, which is, which is good for other reasons,
*  I could do that. You can switch fields. You can let your creative juices flow. Many people have
*  zero desire to let their creative juices flow. That's fine. But in many ways, tenure is just a
*  simple set of compromises that keeps academia full of smart people working hard on their things.
*  Now, obviously, there's plenty of people who just kind of chill out after a while, don't work very
*  hard or not productive. You know, that's that is the price you pay. Very often, those people are
*  useful in other ways, whether it is teaching or administration or just being a voice of wisdom that
*  you can talk to in the seminar room and things like that. So I do, I do think that there should be more
*  more variety in how these things are organized. That is to say, I wish that different academic
*  institutions didn't all use the same system so that maybe some people who kind of liked it one
*  way could go to different universities or different research institutes. But guess what,
*  this has been tried. There have been universities and research institutes that have tried to not
*  have tenure. Nobody wants to go there. Or people go there and say, please, you know, let's institute
*  the idea of tenure. Okay, so it's an incentive for smart people to do their thing. I think it's a
*  fairly good system overall. Paul Cousin says, Is it common to contact an author to let them know that
*  you cited their work? Or do cited authors usually find out by a Google Scholar or something similar?
*  It is completely uncommon to contact an author to let them know you cited their work. It's fine.
*  You will, you know, sometimes get emails with a paper attached saying, Hey, I wrote this paper,
*  it's on something you're interested in. You know, maybe you'd like to read it, whatever that that's
*  completely okay. But it's not the norm. It's not common. When I write a paper, and I have, I don't
*  know, 2030, 4050 citations in it, I do not email all the people who are in my list of citations. In
*  fact, it's, it's more than that. Like I was reading, as I'm recording this, I'm preparing a week from
*  now, I'm going to have a public debate with Philip Goff. You remember Philip, he was on the podcast,
*  he is one of the champions of panpsychism out there in the world right now. And so we're having
*  a debate about panpsychism pro and con. And so I was reading a couple of papers about panpsychism,
*  and I read one and it was literally the whole paper was a response to me was a response to my
*  paper on consciousness and the laws of physics, and I never knew. I was like, Oh, this is kind
*  of flattering. I didn't really agree with anything that was in the paper. But you know, it's still
*  it's kind of nice to know that people are taking it seriously. So I don't know, maybe maybe the
*  issue more common to let people know. But maybe you don't want to let people know when the whole
*  point of your paper is to say the person is wrong. Okay, so I think that it raises an interesting
*  question of what is the future equilibrium way that academics and scholars will find out about
*  papers that are interesting to them, because there are too many papers, right? There's just too many
*  papers to read. If you are a successful ongoing researcher who has a research group with students
*  and postdocs in it, then those students and postdocs are your way of knowing what is interesting
*  in the research literature right now. They're the ones who are young and learning and energetic
*  and are reading everything and they will tell you if something interesting comes up. If you're all
*  by yourself, then you have to do a little bit more work. So Google Scholar, you know, Google Scholar,
*  by the way, not only is a place where you can go and find out who cited your paper, they will send
*  you a daily update. Here's how many people cited your paper, here's all the new papers that cited
*  you. So I do that and it's not, you know, ego surfing. I'm not like, oh, happy that someone cited
*  me. I want to know if someone is building on the work that we did in various interesting ways.
*  There's also Semantic Scholar, which does something like the same thing, but it's not quite tied to
*  citations. It's just here are papers we think you would be interested in given what papers you've
*  written about before. So again, I don't think that we're done yet. I don't think that we're in that
*  equilibrium state where we know the best way for people to find these things out, but hopefully
*  we're improving the state of affairs. Okay, I'm going to group two questions together. One is from
*  Fabian Roestallen. By the way, before I actually answer this, I should have said this in the intro,
*  but a couple things. Number one, we're getting a lot of questions and that call for questions in
*  the AMAs these days. So the fraction of them that I get to answer is smaller. Apologies for that.
*  I make a tiny bit of effort. If I don't recognize someone's name from previous AMAs,
*  I try to give them a little bit of preference. I'm not very good at that. It's not at all
*  systematic. I'm sorry if you've been asking questions and have never gotten one through.
*  My apologies for that, but I do try to spread the wealth a little bit. And the other is I will
*  reiterate the instructions. Number one, keep your questions short. Number two, only one question
*  per AMA. So there's some folks in there that seem to have not noticed those instructions,
*  but those instructions help you get a question answered. Anyway, neither one of these apply to
*  these questions. I don't know why it just came up into my brain right now, but Fabian says,
*  I recently thought of the fact that when I do something good for a future person like future me,
*  I'm actually doing something nice for an incredibly huge amount of future people on
*  different branches. Somehow it's made it even more enjoyable to do something nice,
*  like cleaning the house for my future selves. Have you had any philosophical realizations
*  or something similar from this way of trying to understand the self in the context of a
*  branching universe? And the other question is by Gauta Ainoval, who says,
*  are believers in the many world interpretation of quantum mechanics faced with different
*  ethical considerations than believers in one world interpretations? It seems to me that my
*  relationship to a future version of me on a different branch resembles my relationship
*  to a person living today that I will never meet. And if so, I would think the joy of dodging a
*  bullet that could be set up by having a lucky draw of a quantum process using the universe
*  splitter app should be diminished by the fact that another person on a different branch was
*  hit by the bullet. With a one world interpretation of quantum mechanics, this would not be so.
*  So both of these have to do with different levels of seriousness, thinking about the ethical
*  implications of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
*  For Fabian's question, I think this is the more straightforward answer here.
*  I do not, as a matter of sort of rigorous scientific understanding, think of the
*  impact of actions I take today on future generations any differently because I believe
*  in many worlds than I would in ordinary single world classical or quantum physics.
*  I think that to be consistent, if many worlds is your favorite theory, that is how you have to
*  behave. So we always talk about deriving the Born rule, deriving the probability rule in quantum
*  mechanics, the idea that the probability of seeing something is given by the amplitude squared of the
*  wave function. There are different arguments about the best way to do that. Chip Siemens and I had a
*  way to do it that I kind of like, but the implications go way further than just deriving
*  the probability rule. The implication is that the worlds count by a certain amount that is weighted
*  by their wave function squared. So to skip to the answer here, even though there are in some sense
*  more people in the future, each one of them counts less. I do not mean to disparage them,
*  but they count as much as a person times the wave function squared. And what that means is that the
*  total amount of counting is constant over time. It does not grow just because the universe splits
*  or subdivides. You start with a very thick branch at the beginning and it splinters and divides,
*  but the total weight on all the branches remains fixed. I think you have to think that way if you
*  want to accept many worlds and take it seriously and move forward with your life. Because otherwise,
*  I could do a Stern-Gerlach experiment. I could measure a spin of a particle that was in a 50-50
*  chance and suddenly it is now, there is a universe where it has spin up, a universe where it has spin
*  down. And I could do that or I could, it could be done without me knowing. Let us put it that way.
*  And if it is done without me knowing, then suddenly there are twice as many people
*  in the multiverse because there is a whole other universe, right? And in fact,
*  most quantum measurements are of exactly this form. I do not know that they are even going on.
*  But it should not affect my going through life, whether someone somewhere out there in the,
*  in the, in space is doing a measurement of a quantum system. And the only possible way that
*  it can't is if I think that the people post measurement count only as much as them times
*  their wave function squared. That is the consistent way to accept many worlds as a theory. And
*  therefore, I do not think it matters that there are more people, more copies of me in the future.
*  And likewise, for Gauta's question, this idea of, you know, how do you deal with the reinterpretation
*  of probability in a many world interpretation versus a single stochastic world? I think that any
*  prediction, any way that you have of dealing with the future world is, I gave examples in something
*  deeply hidden and so forth, that you could contrive rules that would make you act differently if many
*  worlds were true versus if it's not. But they're absolutely contrived. They're not very natural.
*  If you think that there's a probability that something is going to happen or not in a single
*  world versus saying both things will really happen, but they are weighted, they're weighted by numbers
*  that add up to one. I think there's no difference in how you act or think in those two situations.
*  And maybe you think that there should be, but then you shouldn't accept many worlds because it's not
*  going to work out for you in various ways. Lothian53 says, in the many worlds interpretation of
*  quantum mechanics, how do we know that the other worlds continue to exist past the point where we
*  lose contact with them? Well, we don't any more than we know that our world will exist tomorrow.
*  Right? Like, how would we know that? We have a prediction on the basis of a model. The prediction
*  of many worlds is that all the worlds are equally real. They just keep existing. The other world's
*  likelihood of existing from moment to moment is the same as ours. There's nothing special about it.
*  It may be that we live in a multiverse where there's a terrible genocidal evil demon who
*  lets those worlds come into existence and then wipes them out of existence. That would be weird
*  and bizarre, and we have no empirical reason to think that. But if you want to think that,
*  you are welcome to do so. StevieCpw says, how do you feel about data science being accepted as an
*  alternative to algebra and calculus and higher education admission requirements? Well, I have
*  mixed feelings about that. There's a positive side and a negative side. On the positive side,
*  for a long time, I've thought that statistical reasoning should be given much more weight in,
*  uh, this is actually not higher education. Typically, the people are talking about this.
*  It's usually the high school level that people most care about this question.
*  You know, we, there's only a finite number of years in high school and there's a lot of good
*  math to be taught, algebra, geometry, calculus. I think the statistics also deserves a place at the
*  table, and that means that something has to go. You know, whatever that is, that might be different
*  for different people, et cetera. But I think reasoning about probabilities and uncertainties
*  is very, very important and is also mathy. You know, it doesn't have to be just, you know,
*  here's a coin flip. You can get really deep into serious math and solving equations
*  if you study probability carefully. And I think that maybe data science more broadly, same kind
*  of thing. How do you fit a curve to some data? How do you deal with errors and uncertainties
*  and things like that? Central limit theorems, a whole bunch of very good things that you can
*  absolutely talk about as part of a respectable math education. That's the good part. The bad part is
*  that there has been a movement in certain places, California, for example, to simply water down the
*  high school math curriculum. And I think that's a disaster. I think that's terrible. Even when it's
*  done with the best of intentions. You know, some people are saying, well, some students are less
*  prepared than others and they struggle in math classes because they're less prepared. And guess
*  what? Unsurprisingly, that lack of preparation is often correlated with either socioeconomic status
*  or racial categories or things like that. And it seems like effectively, they would say,
*  it seems like we're discriminating against these students by making them take the same classes as
*  people with better preparation. And therefore, the conclusion that they would have that I think is
*  terrible would be everyone should have less math or easier math or something like that. It is
*  somehow discriminatory to offer calculus in high school or to demand that every student know algebra.
*  I think that's terrible. I think that the way out of discrimination is not to make everything easier
*  for people, but to give people the resources to do the hard work. You know, if people aren't learning
*  algebra and calculus as well as they should, dump money on the problem would be my solution. You know,
*  the education system is failing. Good. Make it stop failing. Don't say, well, it's failing and
*  therefore let's fail equally. That's not the way to do it. I think that you help people who have
*  lived through discrimination by offering them opportunities. And one of those opportunities is
*  learn math. That includes data science as well as algebra and calculus and geometry. But if what
*  you're secretly or not so secretly doing is data is using data science as a way to just make things
*  easier and less rigorous and less challenging and less mathy so that no one's feelings are hurt.
*  I think that's a huge mistake that people are making. Ken Wolf says in the visual arts,
*  entertainment or literature that you enjoy, is there something that you would regard as
*  comfort food, whether it is a specific work body of work or genre? Is there something you go back
*  to again and again, not out of respect or admiration or to gain a new insight, but just
*  because it puts you in your happy place? By way of full disclosure, some of mine are Star Trek,
*  anime, romantic comedy, romantic comedy, and the 1812 overture. I'm not sure from Ken's placement
*  of commas, whether anime and romantic comedies are two separate categories or one category of
*  anime romantic comedy. Both are perfectly plausible answers there. You know, absolutely. So this is a
*  perfectly good question. And I'm a huge believer in comfort food, by the way, both literal comfort
*  food and figurative comfort food. When it comes to eating, I'm a huge believer in comfort food.
*  Like when I've had a really long day or a really long week or whatever, it's going to be pizza and
*  buffalo wings for me. And in past, it also would have been ice cream. I'm not as young as I used
*  to be. I can't just wolf down the pint of ice cream without any ill effects like I could have
*  when I was in my youth and my salad days. But I know that the pizza and the wings are not good
*  for me, but they make me feel better. Those endorphins come rushing in. And I think that's
*  perfectly fine. Macaroni and cheese, whatever it is. And I say that as someone who is also very
*  willing to eat crazy, challenging food and be rewarded by that. But I think that the variety
*  is good. And I feel the same way about arts, entertainment, and literature. In fact, both
*  Jennifer and I, we have a routine where we work really, really hard during the day, and then we
*  kind of collapse. And we don't want to do anything challenging. We'll read, of course, but usually
*  once it's late at night, we're reading fun, simple things. The simplest things for me,
*  the most fun things that are still rewarding are just reading these science fiction stories or the
*  science fiction authors that I grew up with as a kid. So Heinlein and Zelazny and Le Guin and
*  the Dragon Riders of Pern or something like that. I can just read that stuff over and over again.
*  And I've discovered newer ones. Ian Banks is really difficult to read the first time.
*  But upon rereading, it's fun because you know what world building has already happened. So I
*  can just reread those. They're rich enough. I can reread them again and again. And we watch TV. We
*  watch a lot of TV because it's fun. Whether it's Poirot or Colombo, Murder Mysteries or recently,
*  I'll tell you a story. I was recently, as part of Johns Hopkins, let me back up even more. Sorry
*  about this, but look, it's my AMA. I can tell you whatever I want. So I was thinking about this the
*  other day. One of the super great things about my new job here at Johns Hopkins is that I'm really
*  you know, finally at this advanced age that I've reached, living the dream of being an
*  interdisciplinary academic scholar. So as you know, I am in practice, I should say, a member of the
*  physics department at Hopkins and also the philosophy department at Hopkins. But I'm also
*  with Jananne Ismael. We founded a natural philosophy forum. I'm also on the faculty
*  board for something called the Alexander Gross Humanities Institute. And I'm also a faculty
*  affiliate of the SNF Agora Institute for Democracy. So and I have friends and I and potential future
*  collaborators who are in the engineering school. So I'm not just doing physics and philosophy,
*  I'm engaging with people who are doing the humanities and literature and arts,
*  people who are doing the social sciences and democracy, people who are doing engineering.
*  And it's just, you know, like a kid in a candy store, as it were, I'm having an enormous time,
*  like finally, I feel like an undergraduate again, right? I get to think about all these things. And
*  it's not like that narrow minded, professionalized, hyper specialized academia that I can do fine in,
*  but it doesn't really make me super duper happy. Anyway, why am I telling you this?
*  Because at the Humanities Institute, I ran into and made friends with a woman Virginia Jewess,
*  who is an Italian scholar, you know, she translates Dante and things like that. But she's also a media
*  scholar. She works in the Italian TV industry, she helps Italian TV companies make things so
*  make shows and so forth. So here in the US at Hopkins, she taught a course, a first year seminar
*  course on the prestige TV era, right, like some of the best TV shows that we have now.
*  And so we were talking about it. And she said, yeah, she asked her students to become familiar
*  with five different TV shows. And she said it was The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, Breaking Bad,
*  and Jane the Virgin. And I like apparently every other person, you know, response was,
*  Jane the Virgin, huh? That doesn't fit in to the pattern that has been established with these other
*  shows. And she says yes. And I and when she was telling me this, I'd never seen an episode of Jane
*  the Virgin. And she said, yes, it's a very different kind of show. For those of you who don't know Jane
*  the Virgin was it was a fairly, fairly recently, I think it ended 2019 or something like that.
*  It was a slight parody adaptation of a Venezuelan telenovela. The Spanish-speaking world has this
*  tradition of telenovelas, which are like hypercharged soap operas, right? These,
*  you know, ridiculous plots, secret twins, dead people coming back to life, people being married,
*  people being brother and sister, you know, all these, you know, crazy tropes. And so Jane the
*  Virgin is kind of a not really a parody, like a loving parody of it. Let's put it that way in an
*  American context. So now it's set in Miami. It's called Jane the Virgin because Jane is mistakenly
*  artificially inseminated with someone else's sperm and has a baby even though she's still a virgin.
*  Okay, and it goes on. And Ginny explains to me that, you know, this show, even though it's
*  extremely lighthearted and fun, and it's basically a comedy,
*  dramedy maybe, whatever you want to call it, but it hits a huge number of really deep issues.
*  For one thing, it's a bunch of immigrants in the United States. So they're dealing with,
*  you know, it ran from what like 2015 and 2019. Guess who got elected president of the United
*  States in that era? And that was a, there was a serious set of issues that have not gone away
*  for people who might be undocumented or family members are undocumented, but also questions of
*  religion because Jane and her family are Catholic, questions of, you know, obviously
*  premarital sex, but then she has the baby raising a baby questions of abortion.
*  And it goes on to a whole bunch of like super serious issues are actually dealt with in this show,
*  but in a kind of lighthearted and fun way when they're not tugging on your heartstrings. Anyway,
*  the point is that we have been watching Jane, the version and just loving it. It's great.
*  It, but it's, but it illustrates what I wanted to say at the very beginning,
*  but I'm too wordy to get there, which is that even my comfort food, I like to be high quality
*  comfort food. It doesn't need to be challenging, right? But it needs to be good. Like I cannot
*  watch TV shows or eat food that is just bad. I remember having a discussion with a friend of mine
*  a little while ago where we reminisced about how much we love Kentucky fried chicken growing up.
*  And I said, yeah, I actually, you know, I did remember loving it so much. I recently went back
*  and had some Kentucky fried chicken and my friend said, Oh man, was it really good? I said, no,
*  it's awful. It was really bad. It's just, I don't know whether the quality of Kentucky fried chicken
*  has gone down or whether I have just changed as a person, but just because something is junky and
*  supposed to be comforting doesn't mean that it works. So even though I have pizza and wings,
*  I care a lot about the quality of the pizza and wings, even though I like to watch a silly
*  telenovela and TV show late at night when I'm not in a mood to be challenged, it still has to be
*  quality writing, you know, surprising, intelligent characters, et cetera. So lots of things like
*  that, whether it's music or, or reading or TV, but I will, I will close this. You clearly asked
*  a good question. I rambled on for a while there. Carlos Nunez says as an economist, I loved your
*  episode with Sam Bowles. Economics is famously known as the dismal science, given that its
*  intention of offering precise explanation explanations and making accurate forecasts
*  often fall short of their lofty goals. Do you think that economics will ever become a true science or
*  will economists always fail predictions? Meanwhile, arguing that things couldn't have been any different
*  after the fact. You know, I don't want to give it economists advice. It's a tough thing. Anything
*  when human beings are involved or other complex adaptive systems, it's way harder to make useful
*  predictions than it is in physics, where you can be spherical cow about it and ignore all those
*  complications. I think economics is a science. I think political science and sociology are also
*  sciences. They're just difficult sciences because they involve human beings. You can throw in
*  psychology and urban design and things like that. Other things that we've all talked about here on
*  Mindscape many times. I think that the standards have to be adjusted to be realistic. You know,
*  maybe it will never be the case that economists will predict when the next stock market crash
*  will happen. But maybe they will be able to ameliorate the effects of that crash. Maybe they
*  will be able to successfully say what the probability of a crash is and they will be able to
*  successfully do so as a function of the other measurable economic variables, right? So you can
*  become better and better at being a science and understanding what's going on and giving some
*  insight into the future without making a precise quantitative prediction. I don't think that's quite
*  fair. We shouldn't hold up physics or even chemistry as the model for you have to do this,
*  otherwise you're not a science. I do think that when things are complex, like they are in economics
*  and maybe arguably even more in psychology, sociology, et cetera, it's easy to be led astray.
*  It's easy to be led astray by what we want to be true, by our political commitments, by our personal
*  experience, rather than coldly and calmly looking at the evidence and judging it fairly, which is
*  what we're supposed to do, right? So there's a challenge there and maybe progress will be
*  slower because of that. But science to me is just looking at the world, the world that is out there
*  and trying our best to model it and understand it, right? That's what we're doing. So that's just as
*  true for economics as it is for physics or astronomy. Kevin O'Toole says, I loved your
*  Berkeley presentation on the arrow of time in causal networks, which by the way, AMA listeners,
*  you can find on the internet. If you just Google the arrow of time in causal networks, you can find
*  a talk I gave on that. And then Kevin continues, explaining in broad strokes why the direction of
*  perceived causality is the same as the direction of increasing entropy. However, it's always hard
*  to tell listening to something like that. Was your presentation teaching a well-established consensus
*  or advocating one possibility in a broad ongoing discussion? Good. This is actually a really good
*  question because you're right. When you hear a talk on the video or when you watch a talk on
*  YouTube, you can learn a lot from the talk. But what you don't get is what the audience is thinking,
*  right? I mean, maybe there's some Q&A afterward, but very often what the audience is thinking is
*  left unspoken in the Q&A and only talked about in mumbles afterward. So you don't know. So just
*  because someone says something in a talk doesn't mean the audience agreed with it, certainly.
*  In this case, well, you know, also maybe they're not telling me, but I always do try to figure out.
*  I try to ask people like what they actually thought, et cetera, especially when I'm giving talks
*  to audiences that are different than the ones I usually talk to. So in this case, in that context,
*  I'm trying to bring together two different sets of ideas. One from statistical mechanics,
*  where we talk about entropy and the arrow of time and things like that. And the other from
*  causal network research, which just assumes the directions in which the arrows are going from
*  causes to effects. It cares a lot about what arrows exist, but it presumes we know what
*  directions the arrows point in, especially they always point from past to future. So I'm trying
*  to join together these two things. And that audience was extremely expert in causal network
*  dynamics, causality, things like that. They were not expert in statistical mechanics,
*  except some of them were. There were a couple of stray physicists in the audience. So I think that
*  my impression is the following, that both groups were slightly annoyed at how easy it was to
*  understand the part they already knew, but they were happy to get the part they didn't know.
*  And they didn't have any objections to the way that things were brought together. Does that make
*  sense? So the physicists were like, why are you telling me about the second law of thermodynamics?
*  I know that. But when I explained to them, Judea, Pearl and causal networks, they're like, wow,
*  this is really cool. And the causal network people were just the opposite. So the question
*  about whether or not those two areas can be successfully brought together, no one seemed
*  to be dead set against that. And they thought that was an interesting kind of thing. I think
*  different people will care more or less about it. Some people are like, oh, yeah, that's really
*  foundationally important to understand why this comes before that. And others are like, come on,
*  I don't need to know that when I inject medicine into someone's arm, and then some physiological
*  effect happens, which is the cause and which is the effect, right? That's kind of trivial for them.
*  So some people may or may not care. But I did not hear anyone object to the fundamental idea or the
*  specific way in which I was trying to make it happen. Lineo Miziaris says, in the latest AMA,
*  you told us that Boltzmann brains were not possible because quantum mechanically,
*  temperature does not consist of atoms moving around. How can that be? Isn't the very concept
*  of temperature based on the movement of atoms? So by the way, it's not that Boltzmann brains are
*  not possible. It's that it is possible that they're not possible. In other words, we are expanding,
*  the universe is expanding and accelerating and emptying out. There's an open question about the
*  nature of the future quantum state of the universe, even putting aside the possibility that will
*  re-collapse or crunch or anything like that. The fact that the universe will be empty and will have
*  a non-zero vacuum energy, just assume all that is true. What is the nature of the quantum state in
*  that future accelerating universe empty space state? And there are two possibilities. One is
*  that it just quiets down. It just settles into a constant static thermal quantum state, what we
*  call a density matrix or a mixed state. But the other is that it seems to do that. But really,
*  there's only a finite dimensional Hilbert space that we live in, only a finite number of possible
*  quantum states that the future universe can evolve to. And eventually it will come back
*  to where it is today and it will recur over and over again. Or there's sort of in-between versions
*  where it will fluctuate even though not strictly recur because it's an open system. So that's an
*  open question. We don't know the answer to that. So it is in the case where the universe just settles
*  down once and for all, then there will be no Boltzmann brains. But there's absolutely this
*  other open possibility where there still will be. So I wanted to footnote that. But the interesting
*  question here is, isn't the very concept of temperature based on the movement of atoms?
*  And the answer is no. I mean, it was in the 1880s. You would have said that and everyone would have
*  agreed with you. What temperature was supposed to be is the thermal energy, the average thermal
*  energy of the atoms or the molecules or whatever in your gas or your material substance. That's
*  just not true anymore in quantum mechanics. And like physicists always do, we use the same word
*  for a rather different concept. So in quantum mechanics, of course, you can have a circumstance
*  where you literally have a bunch of atoms moving around with different velocities and then you
*  could attribute a temperature to it. You're just describing it quantum mechanically. That's fine.
*  But it's a special case of a more general thing that can happen. The more general thing that can
*  happen is that you have a, like I said, what we call a density matrix or a mixed state.
*  What does that mean? Ordinarily in quantum mechanics, when you hear a little bit about
*  quantum mechanics, you're taught about wave functions, right? The electron is not just a
*  point particle with a location. It's a wave function all spread out. Well, you also probably
*  have heard that in statistical mechanics, even though we know that there really are in, well,
*  we would have known if classical mechanics had been true, that there really were particles with
*  definite positions in momenta. In statistical mechanics, we recognize that we don't know
*  the exact position and momentum of everything and therefore we have a probability distribution
*  over all those things. So you might think that in quantum mechanics, you could have a probability
*  distribution over wave functions, right? Maybe the analogy is you don't know what the wave function
*  of the electrons is. And that's almost true, but there's a technical complication because wave
*  functions are vectors. You can add them and subtract them. You can't add and subtract positions
*  and momenta in classical mechanics. But in quantum mechanics, you can add and subtract. By the way,
*  sometimes people think that you should be able to add positions. You can add momenta of two particles
*  if they're at the same point. But when they're not at the same point, you can't add their locations
*  together. You might think, well, no, I have a vector telling me the location of one particle
*  and a vector telling me the location of another. What stops me from adding them? The answer is you
*  don't have a pre-existing preferred origin to your vector space. So it's not actually, positions of
*  particles are not actually vectors. We treat them that way sometimes, but they're not vectors that
*  you can sensibly add together because that sum would depend on your origin, which is not what
*  good vector space is supposed to do. Anyway, so that new feature in quantum mechanics that you can
*  add together quantum states means that you can have two quantum states that are different from
*  each other, but only a little bit different, only like rotated as a vector by a little bit.
*  So the way that you describe probability distributions over quantum wave functions
*  is a little bit different than the way you describe probability distributions over classical
*  configurations. In the classical configuration case, like we said, there's always an answer
*  to the question, what is really the particles, positions, and momenta. Quantum mechanically,
*  if you have a state that is entangled with the rest of the world, there may not be any answer
*  to that. And so in that case, we describe the system using a mixed state. This is the quantum
*  version of a statistical distribution over states. It's kind of like, but not exactly,
*  a probability distribution over quantum wave functions. And you can do statistical mechanics
*  in that kind of framework, also known as a density matrix, I should say. And so you can say,
*  just like in the box of gas at a certain temperature, what is the probability of
*  seeing an electron to move at a certain velocity? Well, it's possible, but if it's very high
*  velocity, it'll be exponentially suppressed, things like that. That translates into a certain
*  form for the mixed state in quantum mechanics that is dependent on a parameter, which we call the
*  temperature. So the new way we think about temperature in quantum mechanics is as a
*  parameter in a mixed state that tells you the relative abundance of states of different energies.
*  Okay. And you can show that the predictions from that way of talking map nicely onto the predictions
*  you would make in classical statistical mechanics for macroscopic things like, you know, the
*  equation of state and the PV equals nRT, things like that. But there's a huge important difference,
*  which is that quantum mixed state doesn't necessarily mean that under the hood, really,
*  deep down, there's a whole bunch of things moving around. There's a new thing that can happen in
*  quantum mechanics. And for whatever reason, plenty of people who are super experts in quantum mechanics
*  don't, I don't want to say they don't understand this. Maybe they understand it. They never admit
*  it. They never talk about this fact. Okay. The fact is you can have a temperature, you can have a
*  mixed state describing a thermal distribution with some temperature that is completely static,
*  that is completely not changing over time. You can't have that in classical mechanics.
*  In classical mechanics, whenever you talk about a temperature, just as you say in the question,
*  you're talking about a probability distribution over states that are moving,
*  that are individually dynamical, and their average is not moving, but it's an average that is a sum
*  over individually moving things. That is not true anymore in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics,
*  a thermal state is a sum over states that are not moving themselves. So that's a whole new thing.
*  And people never talk about it. It's very relevant for Boltzmann brains. It's actually not that
*  relevant for measurements, right? That's why people don't need to talk about it. Because when
*  you actually say, okay, what is the probability of getting a measurement outcome in this thermal
*  state, you still get very similar results in classical mechanics or quantum mechanics.
*  But for the Boltzmann brain problem, we're not thinking about measurements. We're thinking about
*  what happens intrinsically to the system. So suddenly that difference becomes very, very important.
*  Artem Vorishtov says, is it possible that during the Big Bang and its aftermath, the volume of our
*  universe is infinite, but only a finite volume is contained within our past light cone? How accurately
*  do we understand the function volume as a function of time after the Big Bang? It's 100% possible.
*  In fact, it's very, very, very possible. We don't know whether the volume of our universe is infinite.
*  If you're a stickler, there's no such thing as the volume of our universe, because volume applies to
*  space. And the universe is space time, right? So when you have in general relativity and expanding
*  universe, there are different ways to slice space time into three-dimensional space as a function of
*  time that could give you very different answers for the question, what is volume as a function of
*  time? For example, in a very simple universe like Desider space, Desider space is an example
*  of a cosmological space time with a positive vacuum energy and nothing else in it.
*  You can slice that space time in such a way that the volume as a function of time is finite,
*  because it's a three-dimensional sphere basically, but it increases toward the future and the past
*  without bound, so the finite volume gets infinite. But it's also possible to slice exactly the same
*  space time so that the volume of space is always infinite. So you can slice it one way so it is
*  finite, one way that it's infinite, that's because it's not a well-defined thing. But our
*  observable universe is certainly finite, okay? So our observable universe is finite, we just don't
*  know whether it is possible to slice the universe outside what we observe in a way that is infinite
*  or finite. Jeffrey Segal says, I really appreciated the conversation with Samuel Bowles. One point
*  that struck me when he mentioned that group selection could work if the genetics of the
*  groups was distinct enough. As he discussed this as a possible evolutionary mechanism for the
*  development of racism as a recognition of different group genetics. I don't know whether he has
*  discussed that or not, you would have to ask him. Of course, there are genetic factors that
*  help define different groups, right? Whether it's appearance or anything else. Presumably,
*  you've all heard various things about this. The similarities between different groups of human
*  beings are way greater than their differences. Differences are correlated or not correlated in
*  different ways. The categories that we usually think of as race do not map on straightforwardly
*  to any genetic differences. There are genetic differences, but they don't easily map on to
*  how we define things as a function of race. I think a better way of thinking about it is,
*  if you go back to the podcast we did with Nicholas Christakis, human beings as part of their basic
*  makeup, or at least it seems very, very common in human history, for groups of people to have a
*  slight in-group bias. We tend to define groups somehow, and we tend to like the people who are
*  in our group, and we don't like as much the people who are outside our group. When we invent races as
*  a social category, we don't know anything about genetics when we did that, right? We were not
*  very good at that. It's not surprising that the categories that we invent are not exactly
*  reflective of any underlying genetic truth. But there are differences, differences in appearance,
*  differences in other things like we said. It's a social fact that we choose to take some differences
*  as really, really important, like what our skin color is, and other differences, like what our hair
*  color or eye color is, less important, or the pitch of our voice, or whatever. There's a
*  million differences we could have chosen to focus on, but skin color is one that we do,
*  and that's a very social fact. There are genetic realities underlying the differences between
*  people, but social choices have a huge role to play here. Ryan Santos says,
*  priority question, I believe I've heard you affirm unity of knowledge in prior conversations,
*  which seems to me at a minimum that valid methods of discovery ought not to contradict each other,
*  and when they do, it's a mistake of process rather than a contradiction of reality.
*  My question is about confrontations of different methods in practice that lie somewhere outside
*  the family of natural sciences. For instance, religious historians will often claim that purely
*  academic historical methods validate their particular scripture, sometimes contradicting
*  the current consensus of physics or biology. Another example might be DNA evidence used to
*  overturn criminal convictions. Would you simply take such situations case by case, or is there
*  some kind of hierarchy by which you give one means of investigation more authority than another?
*  Well, so I certainly have never, I'm pretty sure, have never used the words, I affirm unity of
*  knowledge. I do think of knowledge as different ways of talking about the same underlying physical
*  reality. I do affirm the unity of underlying physical reality, and we have different mechanisms,
*  as you say, to get to it. So I think that there's actually, there should be more or less common
*  criteria for when those methods are trustworthy, when they are reliable, etc. Of course, within
*  a certain sphere, whether you're doing archaeology or literary textual analysis or particle physics,
*  the particular problems that you are faced with will be different compared to other areas,
*  and therefore, you can use different criteria as a matter of practice. Just for example,
*  in many sciences, certainly in social sciences and elsewhere, people talk about a three sigma
*  result, right? You know, if you can get a certain p value greater than 0.99, then you have a
*  statistically significant result. In particle physics, we say that you need a five sigma result,
*  which is a much higher level of statistical significance than in the social sciences.
*  That's not because of any fundamental difference in what the two areas are trying to do. It's a
*  difference in the amount of evidence that you can gather and the cleanliness of the evidence that
*  you get. In other words, in particle physics, you can get five sigma worth of evidence, and if you
*  don't have it yet, you can just keep doing the experiment, and hopefully, eventually, you will
*  get it if the effect you're looking for or the particle you're trying to detect is really there.
*  In the social sciences, that would mean there were no results if you asked for five sigma
*  statistical significance. So because you do want to get some results, you have a lower
*  threshold of significance, but you also realize that you're sort of less surprised when some of
*  those results are not replicated, okay? In particle physics, if we discovered that, you know, actually,
*  we haven't found the top quark. It's not there. That would be weird. That would be almost impossible
*  to make sense of because it's so firmly established, whereas there are almost no
*  results in sociology or psychology or economics that are like that. I think that, yeah, we should,
*  when there are overlaps, when there are questions that can be addressed using different
*  methodologies, probably you have to go to on a case-by-case basis in the real world as a
*  practical matter, but in principle, it's all just trying to figure out how the world works. I think
*  that it is common. I don't think that we should certainly throw out the results of some kinds of
*  analysis just because they disagree with a kind of analysis we like better. We should think carefully
*  about what is appropriate to the question we're trying to ask and which has been more reliable
*  and so forth. You have to take all of it into account at the end of the day. Steve Sheridan says,
*  In late July, a paper was published in the Astrophysical Journal by Kyuhyun Chae from
*  Sejong University in Seoul. The paper purports to provide strong evidence within greater than
*  five sigma significance, c, as we just talked about, for a modified Newtonian dynamics gravity
*  theory at low acceleration conditions of widely separated binary stars. The Sagan standard that
*  extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence would appear to apply here. Do you believe this
*  paper provides sufficient evidence to support a breakdown of standard gravity at weak accelerations
*  and if not, why? No, I do not. This has something to do with what you mean by extraordinary evidence.
*  A single paper is never extraordinary evidence. It's only one paper. You better have some backup
*  to that paper to get extraordinary evidence. When it comes to exactly this question, what's going
*  on here is, you know, in certain theories of modified gravity, the Newton's law of gravity
*  is effectively altered when the gravitational acceleration becomes very, very low. The difficulty,
*  the obvious difficulty with testing an idea like that is when the gravitational acceleration is
*  very, very low, there's other forces in the world that can get in the way, okay, and suddenly make
*  it look like your gravitational acceleration is something different than it really is. The
*  gravitational acceleration from other things than you're looking for. So people are looking at
*  binary stars that are very, very far apart and trying to measure their motion around each other,
*  but guess what? That's a very hard measurement to make because they're very far apart. They're
*  moving slowly. It's going to take them a long time to orbit or whatever it is they're going to do.
*  There was a paper, I haven't read the paper, but there was a paper that claimed that in some certain
*  subset of stars that people looked at, the fit to the data was better from modified Newtonian
*  dynamics than other things. But guess what? There are other papers that look at very, very similar
*  systems and claim that the fit is better for ordinary gravity. You don't hear about those
*  papers as much because they're a little bit less exciting. And that's why the fact that it is
*  nominally a five sigma detection does not make it extraordinary evidence because there are selection
*  effects here. Which stars did you look at? How did you make sure that you didn't have false positives
*  or misidentifying things? There's a whole bunch of work that needs to be done. So for huge results
*  like this, you would know. The world would tell you if the scientific community actually thought
*  that this had been established, we would not hide it from you. Okay. You would definitely hear. It's
*  not enough to get one paper by one set of people getting one result. In my career, I've seen results
*  appear on the front page of the New York Times that were completely bogus and I've even written
*  the paper that explained why they were bogus. So, you know, just be patient when it comes to
*  these extraordinary claims. It takes time to really go through them. Part of, I mean, a better quote
*  is extraordinary claims require careful examination of multiple results over time by different groups.
*  How about that? Professor Beautiful says, the Hubble tension. Why are measurement differences
*  from vastly different time epochs and inconsistency rather than just the Hubble constant changes over
*  time? After all, inflation came and went and dark energy is presumably changing the expansion rate.
*  A couple things going on here. Number one, there's something called the Hubble tension.
*  We did a whole episode about it with Adam Reese a while ago. He wasn't at that time my colleague,
*  but now he is. We're both at Johns Hopkins together. It's not that the Hubble constant was
*  different. That's not the tension. The tension is that there are different ways of measuring
*  the current Hubble constant. You can sort of do it directly, but you can also do it indirectly
*  by measuring features of the universe and then best fitting to what the Hubble constant needs
*  to be to explain those measurements. The problem with the Hubble tension is the different ways of
*  measuring the current Hubble constant disagree with each other or more broadly, different ways
*  of measuring cosmological parameters are incompatible with each other. Of course, yes,
*  the Hubble constant does change as a function of time. The Hubble tension is the fact that it
*  doesn't change in the right way according to our theoretical understanding. The one little extra
*  thing I wanted to say is because you say dark energy is presumably changing the expansion rate,
*  it's actually exactly the opposite. If you had a universe with nothing but dark energy in the
*  form of a cosmological constant, that is when what we call the expansion rate would be constant.
*  Because the expansion rate is not a speed. The expansion rate as measured by, for example,
*  the Hubble constant is basically a time scale. If you think about the Hubble constant, it's in units
*  of meters per second, kilometers per second per megaparsec. That's distance divided by time and
*  then that whole thing is divided by distance. The units are just one over time. We use units
*  of kilometers per second per megaparsec because that's convenient for our brains.
*  But the thing we're measuring has units of one over time. It's not a velocity. It's not even
*  an acceleration. It's basically the amount of time it would take for the universe to double in size
*  or slightly more carefully for the universe to exponentiate in size to increase by an e-fold,
*  one factor of Euler's constant, e, 2.7. Anyway, that's the point. If the universe is constantly
*  expanding at a fixed rate, then that is equivalent to saying the universe is growing
*  exponentially. That's what the acceleration of the universe refers to. If you find that confusing,
*  it's because we're using words that we know from our ordinary lives to discuss velocities and
*  accelerations when we're really discussing the expansion of the universe, which is a different
*  kind of thing. So anyway, the expansion rate as measured by the Hubble parameter is decreasing
*  with time. We all know that it is decreasing more slowly and approaching a constant value
*  because of dark energy. Bits plus atoms says, in one of your mystery of time lectures on the
*  great courses, you say that ABL, or Aronov Bergman and Leibovitz, argue that we perceive a time
*  asymmetry and wave function collapse because we are asking a time asymmetric question. If we pose
*  the question symmetrically, the time asymmetry disappears. I struggle to understand this in the
*  many worlds interpretation since the prepare again phase would seem to happen after decoherence.
*  Can you help me understand this better or at all? Probably not. This is a tricky one to understand,
*  but let me, I can do a little bit to help you get it, which is that this is not within the many
*  worlds interpretation really. ABL are really not advocates of the many worlds interpretation.
*  Now, every experiment or every thought experiment or real experiment that they propose
*  can be understood within the many worlds framework, but that's not what they are actually
*  trying to do. And the second thing is there's sort of a useful part and a less useful part in my mind
*  of the whole discourse around what I was talking about in that particular lecture. This is the idea
*  of pre-selection and post-selection. For those of you who have not, I don't know if there's anyone
*  out there who has not listened to my teaching company lectures on the mystery of time,
*  but it's a subtlety of quantum mechanics where the typical thing we do is we prepare a state,
*  right? So we start and we say, okay, this wave function is in the superposition of spin up and
*  spin down. And then subsequently we measure it. And if we measure it either spin up or spin down,
*  that's all you have. So Aron of Bergman and Leibovitz figured out a way formally, which is 100%
*  fine, to say, well, what if you post selected after the measurement on a quantum state,
*  then you could have a different formula and they have a formula for what the probabilities are of
*  getting different outcomes at the measurement in between. The question is how you in practice
*  post-select, you know, the universe doesn't give us a way to post-select in the way that we can
*  pre-select exactly because there's an arrow of time. So in practice, what you do is you just
*  measure again at the end of the experiment after you've already measured once, you measure again
*  to try to see whether or not the state is compatible with this post-selected state that
*  you want it to be in. And if it's not, you throw it away. You ignore that measurement outcome.
*  And then you do that many, many, many times and you can build up statistical information about
*  what happens in between. It's all 100% compatible with many worlds. If it were not experimentally,
*  then I would have told you that a while ago. It's driven by a desire to have a different way
*  of understanding things. I don't think the world needs a different way. So I'm not,
*  I don't follow it. I think that the idea of post-selection and related ideas of weak
*  measurement in quantum mechanics are very interesting. I don't think you need any of
*  them for understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics. Robert Parks says,
*  in your episode with Tim Wadlin, Tim spoke of what he considered to be an obviously erroneous
*  understanding of Newton's third law. An understanding that's often presented as an
*  objection to the wave function guiding, i.e. acting on particles without a reciprocal action.
*  Could you help me understand why in quantum mechanics the action of a wave function to
*  particle would not require an action of particle to wave function? Well, it depends what you mean by
*  in quantum mechanics. This is not supposed to be a claim about quantum mechanics in general. This
*  is supposed to be a claim about Bohmian quantum mechanics or pilot wave theories, where you have
*  the wave function and you also separately have particles. It is just a fact that if you want to
*  have a pilot wave theory, you're stuck with the real world problem that the Schrodinger equation
*  works really well without any modification. So the way that they have both the Schrodinger equation
*  for the wave function and some particles is to say the particles are pushed around by the wave
*  function, but the wave function is not pushed around by the particles. Now two things are
*  simultaneously true. One is that seems weird. It seems weird to our physical intuition to imagine
*  that the particles are being pushed around by the wave function, but not vice versa.
*  The second thing is, but there's no law against it. Okay, Bohmian mechanics is a proposal for a
*  different kind of fundamental laws of physics. So it seems weird. That's fine. You're 100% willing
*  to say it seems weird to me. I don't like it. You're not allowed to say therefore it's wrong.
*  Therefore, it can't be right. It's a theory. It's a proposal for a physical theory that
*  you can think about and you can decide whether or not it fits the data and so forth and so on,
*  but it's not supposed to be compatible with some very naive formulation of Newton's third law
*  to every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. Thies Janssen says,
*  WIMPs are a very probable candidate for dark matter where the M stands for massive. Massive
*  particles decay into lighter particles unless there's a conserved property and conserved
*  properties are linked to symmetries. So if a massive dark matter particle doesn't decay,
*  there should be at least a symmetry to discover, maybe even a new force. I don't hear anyone
*  talking about this in popular science media like magazines or YouTube, even though quantum mechanics
*  is a hot topic to discuss, or sorry, even though dark matter is a quantum is a hot topic to discuss
*  DM rather than QM. What am I missing here? You're not missing anything. They're just,
*  it's just not a popular topic to discuss. We don't know a lot about dark matter. We know a
*  lot about its phenomenological astrophysical properties, but we don't know a lot about its
*  astrophysical problem. It's darn it. We don't know a lot about its particle physics properties. So
*  you're right. WIMPs are a probable candidate in the sense that they are a popular candidate.
*  I should say there's probably a better way of saying it. WIMPs are supposed to be heavy,
*  heavier than a proton typically. So they could very easily decay. In fact, one context in which
*  WIMP models are often studied are supersymmetric models. And if you just wrote down a supersymmetric
*  model without trying too hard, you would get a WIMP-like particle, but it would decay away
*  pretty quickly, way too quickly to be the dark matter. So there's a subset of all the possible
*  supersymmetric models you can write down, which have a new symmetry called R symmetry or R parity,
*  capital R, the letter. And that's basically something that you just put on your theory and
*  it prevents the lightest superpartner, whatever that might be, from decaying because that is a
*  new symmetry. But it doesn't give rise to a force because actually in the simplest versions, it's
*  just a discrete symmetry. It's not a gauge symmetry that would give rise to a new force of nature. So
*  once you've said it's there, there's not a lot more to say about it. Of course, it's also possible
*  to imagine that the thing that stabilizes the dark matter is a gauge symmetry. And then there
*  would be a new force. In fact, I wrote a paper about that with Matt Buckley, Lotte Ackerman,
*  and Mark Himinkowski about dark electromagnetism. So U1 gauge symmetry that stabilizes the dark
*  matter particle. So you can talk about that, but it's one of those things where it's possible,
*  but it's really an extra complication on top of dark matter. And we haven't discovered it yet. So
*  even I, who wrote the paper, would not get too excited about it until we had more reason to
*  think it was on the right track. V. Shannon Clyde asks a priority question. I've already said this,
*  but we've already had a priority question. But remember that priority questions are those that
*  every Patreon supporter gets to ask once in their life, and I will make a good faith effort to
*  answer it. So we get too many questions overall for me to answer all of them, but priority questions
*  I will try to answer. I cannot guarantee a satisfactory answer or a satisfying one,
*  but I'll do my best. In your July 17 podcast discussion, you and Dr. Joe Silk agreed that
*  cosmic inflation has about a 50% chance of being right. Are there any alternative Big Bang
*  speculations that populate the other 50%, i.e. hot Big Bang theories without Alan Guth's cosmic
*  inflation? Oh, there are. There absolutely are. The most popular ones are bouncing or cyclic
*  cosmologies, but none of the others are anywhere near 50%. Let's put it that way. In my own personal
*  accounting, if inflation is 50%, something that we haven't yet thought of is probably 48%,
*  or comparable to inflation anyway. I don't think that any of the alternatives that I've seen
*  to inflation are themselves anywhere near as compelling as inflation is. So, but there's
*  plenty of phase space out there for theories we just haven't thought of yet, so you have to give
*  some credence to those as well. Sean Bentley says, my son Jack was wondering if you've heard of or
*  read the Three-Body Problem series by Sin Chin Lu. We both really enjoyed it, especially from a layman
*  physics perspective. Also curious if you have any thoughts on the book's namesake, the actual
*  three-body problem in physics. So I do know about the book. I'm very sad to say I've started to read
*  it, but I haven't finished it, not because I didn't like it, just because other things in life get in
*  the way sometimes, so I can't comment on the book itself. It's a great title, the Three-Body Problem,
*  because the Three-Body Problem refers to the question in Newtonian gravity of three objects
*  orbiting each other, and it's a fascinating problem because of course the two-body problem,
*  two bodies orbiting each other, that's perfectly solvable. Newton solved it back in the day,
*  and the three-body problem, which you would think might not be that much harder,
*  is completely unsolvable. At least you cannot solve it analytically in terms of a closed form
*  expression. You can put it on a computer and simulate it, but it turns out to be chaotic,
*  as we later realized. Probably Poincare was one of the first people to realize this.
*  So it's an example of, let's be very clear about what chaos theory here means. It's still
*  deterministic. It's still Laplace's demon has no trouble predicting it. If you know exactly what
*  the system is doing right now, you can predict exactly what it will do next. The difference is
*  what happens when you admit that you don't know exactly what the system is doing now.
*  In a non-chaotic system, a small amount of ignorance now leads to a small deviation in
*  your predictions about the future. In a chaotic system, a small amount of ignorance now leads to
*  potentially large deviations about your predictions in the future, essentially because we always do
*  in the real world have some small amount of ignorance, some small amount of uncertainty.
*  You cannot very carefully, very exactly, very precisely predict what's going to happen next.
*  And that's true in the three-body problem. Think about it this way. In some regime,
*  if you have three bodies and they're orbiting each other, the two bodies, there might be two
*  bodies that are very close and orbiting each other nearby, and a third body that is far away.
*  So for some intents and purposes, that third body just orbits the center of mass of the other two,
*  so it looks like you can figure it out. But there's little perturbations, and those
*  perturbations grow, and when the three bodies are zooming right next to each other, one of the three
*  is typically just kicked out of the system entirely, and predicting exactly when that might happen is
*  very, very hard. So it's a wonderful little metaphor for chaos theory in general, and a reminder how
*  easy it is for a very simple dynamical system to exhibit that kind of unpredictability.
*  Nikita Lozovoj says, while participating in my first meditation course recently,
*  a teacher hinted at a rather radical idea that could be shortly quoted as,
*  maybe we don't have a body at all. Accepting that our bodies are nothing than,
*  I'm sorry, I'm going to have trouble reading this, it's not your fault, Nikita, it's completely my
*  fault. Accepting that our bodies are nothing more than just an exquisitely arranged array of
*  particles and interactions between them, would you be willing to agree that the entire my body concept
*  is indeed an emergent phenomenon? It's 100% an emergent phenomenon, yes, that is true.
*  Everything is an emergent phenomenon that does not appear in the most fundamental laws of physics,
*  now we don't even know the most fundamental laws of physics, but our current version of the most
*  fundamental laws of physics is the core theory of the standard model particle physics plus
*  general relativity, and you can look at that all day long if you want, and you will never locate a
*  body in there. Everything macroscopic, everything collective, everything constituted from many
*  different little bits that are individually mentioned in the core theory would be an emergent
*  phenomenon and human bodies or other large systems absolutely qualifying. Now that doesn't mean you
*  don't have a body, it's a silly to say that you don't have a body in my personal opinion.
*  Just because something is emergent doesn't mean it's not real. If you had that attitude,
*  then you would literally not know anything that was real because like I said, you don't know the
*  fundamental laws of physics right now. Our best theory is the core theory, but it's possible that
*  things like electrons and quarks are also emergent higher level phenomena. We don't know.
*  So if you have this strict construal of reality where unless it's fundamental,
*  it's not real, then you don't think that anything is real as far as you know,
*  and that's no way to go through life in my opinion. Mark Smith asks, how did you pick the title and
*  ending music for Mindscape? That's a pretty easy question actually. I didn't want to bother getting
*  permission. I didn't want to pay for any music. So I have a friend, an informer collaborator from
*  my grad school days, Ted Pine. He and I wrote a couple of papers together on topological defects
*  and on microwave background and isotropies. And after graduate school, he formed a band called
*  Euphonic. I think you could probably find them on the internet if you dug around. And they had a few
*  CDs and I asked Ted if I could use some of their music for the intro and outgoing outro music for
*  Mindscape. And he said yes. So all this is more or less explained. There is, if you go to the
*  website, preposterousuniverse.com slash podcast, you can click on about Mindscape and it will
*  actually mention all of these things. Diana David-Rus says, always I've been puzzled by the concept of
*  inertia. In Newtonian mechanics, inertia is the tendency of an object to remain at rest if it's
*  at rest or to remain moving at a constant velocity if it's in motion, unless acted on by an external
*  force. From the perspective of Einstein's theory of relativity, objects with mass will prefer to
*  move along straight lines in the curved spacetime. When we try to divert an object from the straight
*  line path, we're effectively trying to make it deviate from its natural motion. However, still in
*  my mind, the question of why objects have inertial property, i.e. this tendency of following the
*  geodesics, remains. Is there something more fundamental that I don't understand? I don't think
*  there is something more fundamental that you don't understand other than when you are and are not
*  allowed to ask questions about why something is true, right? In a mathematical context, if you want
*  to say why are straight lines the shortest distance paths in Euclidean geometry or why are
*  geodesics shortest distance paths in non-Euclidean geometry, you can answer that in terms of other
*  mathematical concepts. But when you're asking about the physical behavior of things, sometimes
*  the answer is that's just the way it is. I could quote other laws of physics from which you can
*  derive the fact that test particles move on inertial paths in general relativity, but then
*  you could ask, well, why are those laws of physics true? So I'm not sure what use it is to quote those
*  other laws of physics. In my mind, it's a law of physics. That's how nature behaves. Our job is to
*  discover it. It might be there's some deeper theory from which it's derived and that would be great,
*  but right now when it comes to classical gravity, general relativity is the deepest theory that we
*  have, so we accept it until something better comes along. Walter E. Miller says, I really
*  enjoyed your conversation with Avi Loeb a while back and I found his speculations about Uma Muma
*  quite interesting. He has come under a lot of criticism lately in the scientific community,
*  but that has not dampened his enthusiasm for his opinions. What do you think about his recent
*  finds of spherical metallic particles scraped from the bottom of the ocean that might be of
*  extrasolar origin? You know, I thought when I did the conversation with Avi, who I've known for a
*  very long time, that we had a very good reasonable conversation. Uma Muma is this object that zoomed
*  into the solar system and zoomed away. By zoom, I mean just traveled and it wasn't under rocket
*  power or anything like that, but there was some anomalous acceleration of the object, which is
*  something that makes perfect sense because when objects pass close by the sun, pockets of ice and
*  things like that often outgas and push the object off of its trajectory, so that's not surprising,
*  but Avi made the case that we should at least contemplate the possibility this is an artificial
*  object, an interstellar spaceship, okay? I think that's extremely unlikely. I think that his case
*  was unconvincing, but I think it's perfectly reasonable thing to contemplate and you should
*  certainly take the possibility seriously. Just because it's kind of wacky and out there doesn't
*  mean we shouldn't think about it. The implications would be really big if it were important, so I was
*  happy to have the conversation. I do think that since then he has not been a careful scientist
*  about this question. He has, you know, written papers and continued to push the idea that we
*  should take very seriously the existence of artifacts pointing toward extraterrestrial
*  intelligent origin and a recent example are these little metallic particles scraped from the bottom
*  of the ocean. Nothing that I've seen from the perspective of other scientists who are experts
*  in this area think that he's on the right track about this and it's pretty universal dismissal
*  of these claims and he seemed to be rushing into print and just not being careful and things like
*  that, so you know he's still a good scientist. He's still writing papers and sending them to
*  referee journals, so we'll see how things go forward, but again as we said with the Mon stuff
*  previously what you want to take any of this seriously is multiple different sets of people
*  reaching the same conclusion, ideally from different perspectives, but at least
*  multiple people, you know, who might want to disagree with each other, ending up having to
*  agree with each other because the data forced them to. We're nowhere near that yet, so again I would
*  just not think that there's much reason to get excited about this. Nate Whatups says,
*  has the rise of generative language models like chat gpt led you to change the way you come up
*  with tests or homework or the way that you evaluate your students test results or homework results?
*  So, so far not yet, but maybe that has to do with how I do things or maybe it has to do with the
*  current state of AI. You know in the courses that I tend to teach I'm either teaching a seminar
*  kind of course where the grading is papers rather than homework or in-class exams. I actually kind
*  of hate in-class exams. I'm not sure if I've ever given an in-class exam in my many years of being
*  a professor. I give problem sets and take home finals in more mathy physicsy courses and I ask
*  students to write papers and grade on the on the performance on those papers and in-class
*  participation in the more seminar humanity kinds of classes. So I'm not right now teaching a physics
*  mathy based class, so I don't have to worry about students answering those questions using chat gpt.
*  I'm not sure if I would like if you're supposed to do a certain physics problem and you can do it
*  using AI. Maybe that's just fine as long as AI is going to be around for a long time. For the papers
*  that's an issue and I am confronting this issue and I you know it was interesting I
*  am teaching two classes this semester and I asked my students in both classes and you know they
*  maybe they're fibbing or not completely telling the truth but they were very against the idea
*  of using AI. They're like ah that's just cheating this is going to be BS. I don't think we should
*  believe that stuff so we're not going to do that. Now again maybe that they're um whistling Dixie
*  or whatever but they don't they didn't seem like oh no I'm sad that I don't get to use AI. What I
*  told them was they can use it but number one they certainly can't use it to literally write their
*  papers or even parts of their papers. I don't want any cut and pasting from AI into papers
*  and number two if they do use it they need to be explicit. It's a source that they're using so they
*  need to credit it. They need to say I use the chat GPT for this purpose you know to point to some
*  issues or to formulate a sentence or to find some references or whatever it is because I don't think
*  that you can just say don't use it when it's a tool that's out there in the real world. You're
*  not doing your students the best possible service from pretending that something is not possible
*  when it really is and of course I also think that the class participation is an important part of
*  the grade also. So so far the short answer is it hasn't greatly affected my grading or assignment
*  giving but we'll see it may be a will in the future. Astronobel says when I decide not to put
*  cream in my coffee do I postpone the thermal equilibrium death of the universe by a tiny bit?
*  The way that you stated the question I don't know what the answer is because you have the point is
*  that if you put cream in the coffee you increase the entropy of the universe a little bit. That's
*  true. It was a joke by John Wheeler that he felt guilty every time he put cream in a coffee because
*  he was increasing the entropy of the universe and there's no going back okay but that doesn't
*  strictly speaking mean that you are in making it faster the approach to equilibrium because
*  if the sun blows up or expands to a red giant and engulfs the earth then it doesn't matter
*  whether you put your cream in your coffee or not. It's going to be that event that increases the
*  entropy of everything on earth okay. Of course it's all just a joke because the amount by which you
*  arguably might be increasing entropy of the universe is completely negligible compared to
*  the whole entropy of the universe so I wouldn't sweat it in practical terms. Pablo Montilla says
*  we know black holes should evaporate due to Hawking radiation. That being the case is there
*  any point during evaporation when the mass of the black hole is low enough so that light can escape
*  thus ceasing to be a black hole? So no there is no such point the black hole just grows smaller.
*  Remember a black hole is a region of space a region of space time really it's a region of
*  space time from which light cannot escape okay. There is a tricky technical question
*  about how to think about that when there is such a thing as Hawking radiation because of the
*  following. If you imagine throwing something into the black hole let's imagine it's a
*  kind of abstract thing so it's not like a book or a rocket ship but it's a bit of information
*  given that the black hole eventually evaporates away that bit of information will eventually escape
*  to the outside world okay. So you could in some very strict construal kind of sense
*  argue that when there is Hawking radiation there aren't any black holes. Hawking himself said
*  something along these lines but the rest of the world is going to you know shrug and go come on
*  you know what we mean you can't escape right then you have to wait until the black hole evaporates
*  to escape that's not really what we have in mind. But anyway the black hole is a region of space time
*  from which light cannot escape and that region grows smaller as the black hole grows smaller loses
*  mass and eventually it will reach zero and there's no black hole left anymore but there's no point
*  in which the event horizon disappears it just shrinks to zero size. Paul Conti says in the
*  matter of AI and common sense would it at least help an AI to learn if there were a pair of
*  if they were given a pair of stereo cameras and stereo microphones and a pair of movable prosthetic
*  arms and sensitive articulated hands with such a peripheral attachment the AI could see here and
*  learn about different shape sizes and even about basic gravity although this would not actually
*  lead to common sense it would surely be a great improvement toward that goal. You know I'm not an
*  expert but my impression is that yes this is exactly true people who do robotics have found
*  that AIs this is old news so maybe it's different now in the large language model era but my
*  impression is that embodied AIs begin to act more human than AIs that just talk to you through the
*  computer screen. They you know have a set of gestures that can interact with other people
*  and they can see their gestures etc. So I would not be surprised if that were completely true.
*  There's another thing that is missing in modern large language models which I think is even more
*  important which is feelings in the sense that Antonio Demacio and I talked about on the podcast
*  so not in the sense of like oh you hurt my feelings but in the sense that we are our bodies
*  and our minds are constantly trying to maintain homeostasis right there's some form of equilibrium
*  in which we're happy and content and we are constantly departing from that form because
*  we're too hot or we're hungry or retired or whatever and we work to restore it and this
*  provides the motivation for us to do many things in life and none of this exists for current AI
*  models. So I do think that if you actually wanted an AI model that would approach something like
*  human intelligence or consciousness you would both have to embody or not maybe have to but it would
*  help your case greatly both to embody it and to give it some feelings to give it some desires
*  some goals that it could fall short of and it would try to fix itself. You know a current
*  language model doesn't get bored if you don't talk to it you need them to get bored before they will
*  become conscious. I'm going to group two questions together. Sheldon Silliman says I was wondering if
*  you ever had entertained the idea of writing science fiction the scientific accuracy of books
*  like The Martian seemed to help present scientists and engineers in a more positive light.
*  We could use more books with that attention to scientific detail and some random crackpot
*  that is their given name I did not invent that one some random crackpot says I enjoyed the Alice
*  and Robert chapter in something deeply hidden. I was wondering if you've ever enjoyed writing
*  fiction or if you'd think about enjoying doing so at some point a sci-fi story from you would
*  certainly rock. I've absolutely thought about writing fiction the specific idea of trying to
*  write a science fiction tale that would be distinguished by being especially accurate
*  or especially inspiring to a new generation of potential scientists is not actually my
*  biggest motivation here. If I did write a fiction the two kinds of things that intrigue me look I
*  have no time to do this right now so we're talking call me back 10 years from now to see if I've
*  done this is not something that is imminent in any way but I could imagine doing either
*  a mystery novel. I love mystery novels as we talked about in the comfort food discussion before
*  and that would just be as something to be completely different in my brain which would always be fun
*  or I could imagine you know writing a an intellectual book in the form of a kind of
*  dialogue in a sort of fictional scenario like the Alice and Bob chapter in something deeply hidden
*  where there were characters talking about ideas but they were doing so in kind of a narrative way.
*  I do I feel slightly bad that all of the trade books I've ever written are a little bit hard
*  are a little bit high level. I mean there's differences the biggest ideas in the universe
*  books are higher level than the previous ones but all my books are a little bit demanding you know
*  compared to other people's books. There's no books that I would that I would give that I've
*  written to someone who not only was not an expert in science but actively didn't like it for example
*  I would love to write a science book that would be enjoyed by people who actively don't like science
*  and maybe a narrative structure would be a good way to do that. Again no imminent plans along those
*  lines but you know who knows life is short got a lot of things I've got to do. Anonymous says I know
*  you said that human needs are changing over time however the human need for shelter has been pretty
*  stable for a while. Would it be possible to get the amount of time every individual needs to spend
*  to obtain shelter for themselves to go down exponentially? It actually seems to be going up
*  globally with all of our automation what is going wrong with automated utopia in this domain?
*  So I'm not sure what to say about this I debated whether to answer it because I don't think that
*  my answer is going to be very enlightening here. As I said earlier I do think that as a species we
*  have enough resources right now to give every human being shelter. We're making choices to have
*  a kind of society where some people are unsheltered and that's just something that we're all responsible
*  for right something that we all have to take that responsibility for making that choice when we could
*  make another one. I don't know the numbers I'm not at all sure that it's true that it takes more and
*  more time for each individual to obtain shelter or anything like that. These questions are very
*  very hard to answer because the human race is very heterogeneous right? People who are sort of of my
*  age in my income bracket are spending a lot more money on housing than they were when I was born
*  okay so housing prices have gone way up. There's an enormous number of complicated factors that go
*  into that that I'm not an expert on talking about so short answer is I don't know why this is true.
*  I do think that we could make it very different we're choosing not to. It is something we should
*  at least recognize as a fact about the world that could be a different way if we wanted it to be.
*  Robert Ruxin Dreskew asks we say that in the MWI the many worlds interpretation once
*  decoherence happens the branches can't communicate with each other or at least that the probability
*  is very very small but not zero. What would happen to a conscious experience if two separate branches
*  with two copies of the observer seeing an electron in position A and position B would unify back into
*  a single one? Would that person remember being in a superposition having experienced both the electron
*  in position A and the electron in position B? This is an interesting question but I think I'm going to
*  give a not completely satisfying answer to it because I think that it's not quite a well posed
*  question as it is. I mean I know what you mean we have the situation in many worlds where when
*  you make a measurement what does that mean to make a measurement? It really means that some quantum
*  mechanical system that was in a superposition by our lights has become entangled with its environment
*  that's decoherence and the whole point is that the environment is big right so entanglement with
*  the environment means not only does the particular thing that you've measured gone out of superposition
*  but it's affected by becoming entangled with many many other degrees of freedom in the environment.
*  So the idea of branches coming back together is by itself not a well defined one. What do you mean
*  by coming back together? Are you undoing all that entanglement with the environment? Are you
*  changing all of those impressions? If I measure the position of an electron and I see that it's
*  in position A not position B then that memory that fact distributes through my brain right it's not
*  just like one bit that I can access there's various parts of my brain that are aware that the electron
*  was in position A so I don't know what it means to sort of re-go back to a unified branch anymore
*  and this is reflecting reflective of the fact that it's one of those questions where it makes
*  perfect sense to form the question but there are assumptions underneath that don't quite hang
*  together. Things like having a memory of something only happen because of the arrow of time right
*  because of increasing entropy and the fact that there are facts about the current state of the
*  universe which in a world of increasing entropy imply something about the past. When you see a
*  footprint on a beach you imply the existence of a foot that was there not too long ago. In the
*  space of all possible ways that footprints can appear on beaches most of them have nothing to
*  do with feet but when you conditionalize on being in a very very low entropy past then it becomes
*  overwhelmingly likely that a foot caused that footprint. So if you are imagining the two branches
*  come back together that is a fluctuation that decreases the entropy of the universe. You have
*  temporarily ignored the arrow of time and pushed things back into alignment anyway. It's like
*  separating or mixing cream and coffee once again. So what that means is that the whole idea of having
*  a memory is no longer quite valid because you've undone some of the things that go into what it
*  means to make a memory. Anyway so I just don't think that I think that it is certainly possible
*  mathematically to take two branches of the wave function and to put them back into some kind of
*  superposition but you have to be much more specific. Well number one it's not going to happen as a
*  realistic fact but number two even as a thought experiment you have to just be a lot more explicit
*  about what some of the details are here. Chris K asks a priority question. I agree with you that
*  consciousness is emergent and deterministically bound to the physics of the brain but I struggle
*  to understand how it isn't simultaneously a thing that exists and also a thing that is non-physical.
*  Is it your belief that my thoughts and conscious experience are themselves made of waves particles
*  in the same way a rock is and that the thought in my mind has a location in the physical universe
*  that can be pinpointed? Well I do think that consciousness is emergent. Whether it's non-physical
*  is going to depend on exactly how you parse that so I'm not going to make too much of that. It is
*  similar to the way a rock is a physical thing. It's made of waves particles but when we have
*  these higher level vocabularies we use concepts that are much more flexible and abstract than
*  simply referring to a physical object right. If I say the Star Spangled Banner the National Anthem
*  of the United States does that exist? Yeah I'm pretty sure that exists. I've heard it, I've sung
*  it badly in the past. Does it have a physical location the Star Spangled Banner? No it's kind
*  of an idea right. It's manifested whenever you sing it or you know the beginning of the baseball
*  game or what have you. Likewise there's plenty of higher level concepts that play a useful role
*  in our understanding of the world that have causal powers that have implications when we talk
*  about them etc but aren't embodied in some physical location. Cause and effect relationships
*  are an obvious example. So you don't need to imagine that consciousness is located at a point
*  in order to imagine that it's a physical real thing that emerges at a higher level description.
*  Those are perfectly compatible things. Dave also asks an emergence question. The macro world
*  is emergent and the result of coarse graining. What do you think is the likelihood that there
*  exist multiple orthogonal coarse graining that are individually consistent, useful and result in
*  complex worlds that are undetected by each other? I would love to know the answer to this at a
*  detailed level but my guess, my belief is that the likelihood is very very small. I know what you
*  mean. So basically what we're doing here is saying let's just keep it very simple. Let's just keep it
*  classical and we're looking around and we have the world with a bunch of atoms and I'm coarse
*  graining it into things like tables and chairs and computers and stuff like that. So basically
*  what I'm doing is I'm grouping together whole bunches of atoms and calling them an object.
*  So the question is are there different groupings? You know rather than this table right in front of
*  me that has some physical coherent location in space, I can talk about this atom in the table
*  and that atom over in the other room as part of a different higher level coarse grained thing.
*  The problem with that is that that thing I invented, that coarse grained object that involves
*  some atoms in the table, some atoms in the atmosphere, in another room somewhere, that doesn't
*  help understand the world in any way. There's no simple pattern that is obeyed by that particular
*  coarse grained structure. It doesn't have any causal efficacy in the world. The table, if I just
*  say I have a table in front of me, if I tell you right now that I'm speaking into a microphone that
*  is on a table looking at a computer with various questions on them that is also sitting on the
*  table, you kind of know what's going on, right? I'm actually giving you useful information and
*  the reason why in the real actual world in which we live that certain things make more physical
*  sense to coarse grain than others is mostly due to spatial locality, right? I mean we've coarse
*  grained in a way that the table has a location. I can tell you where it is and that makes sense
*  to you in some immediate way and in fact it has solidity, right? If I touch the table on one end
*  then it's going to affect the table somewhere else. All of these down-to-earth physical properties
*  make this the right coarse graining to use. Is it possible there's some very different coarse graining?
*  Yes, I mean you might even guess that in quantum gravity ADS-CFT is an example of a weird different
*  coarse graining. ADS-CFT is this duality that you get in string theory between a let's say an n
*  dimensional quantum gravity theory with anti-desider boundary conditions and an n minus one dimensional
*  theory on the boundary with no gravity at all. But interestingly, people who have thought about ADS-CFT,
*  the two theories are supposed to be the same even though they're in different numbers of dimensions.
*  That's obviously going to be some wildly non-local map between them. But people don't really think
*  about coarse graining on either side. Does it make sense to coarse grain? Does it make sense to have
*  physical objects on both sides because there's like strong coupling on one side, weak coupling on the
*  other side? This is a great question that I think philosophers should think about more, philosophers
*  of physics, but they don't because I am not the boss of the world and I do not get to assign homework
*  problems to everyone within academia. But if I could, that's one that I would definitely assign.
*  Paul Hess says, in an answer during your August AMA, he described a photon with a spherical wave
*  function and you implied that it's pretty typical to be emitted that way. I previously conceptualized
*  a wave function to be much more directional, usually with a large moving peak where the
*  particle is most likely to be found. Can you clarify whether a spherical photon wave function
*  is a special case? If it's not spherical, is this concept specific to photons or many types of
*  particles? It's actually the generic case. You get some kind of spherical-ish wave function when you
*  emit a particle. If you have a particle that is trapped somewhere, a particle that is an electron
*  within an atom, then its wave function is going to have a definite shape. But we're thinking here of
*  particles that have been emitted, either in radioactive decay or a photon or whatever.
*  How do photons get emitted? You have an electron and it gets shaken somehow. You move the electron
*  around, up and down, very quickly, and that emits a photon. But that up and down moving doesn't,
*  because it's going both up and down, it doesn't pick out a direction in space. If you have a laser
*  or something like that, that's very different. Lasers will pick out directions in space. Even
*  if you have a flashlight, it's not intrinsically emitting light in a direction. You've got to sort
*  of focus it there with either mirrors or lenses or something like that. The generic thing for light
*  to do is to spread out in a spherical wave. That's true classically and it just remains true
*  quantum mechanically. Classically, you probably think you can visualize that pretty simply if
*  you just think about light waves. Quantum mechanically, you tend not to visualize that,
*  because eventually you're going to see the particle and you're not going to see the whole
*  wave. That's the difference between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. You can, for
*  example, as we did talk about in the August AMA, you can track, you can look at the track of a
*  particle at the detector, the LHC, or in a bubble chamber or whatever, and it looks like that
*  particle has a point-like trajectory. But that's because you're measuring it. Before you measured
*  it, that particle's wave function was spreading out in something like a spherical wave. Not exactly
*  spherical, the details will matter, but they will tend to spread out in other, in all directions,
*  until they are actually measured somewhere. George asks, my question concerns the heat death of the
*  universe. And I was recently speaking with a friend of mine who received his bachelor's in
*  physics a few years ago. He said he was talking with his professor, so already I'm skeptical,
*  because there's like many chains here in the communication, but the professor was talking
*  about how a new universe might be able to be created after the heat death of our universe.
*  It's possible. I've written papers about it. The paper I wrote with Jennifer Chen on the arrow of
*  time and spontaneous inflation is an example of baby universes being created in the far future.
*  But look, we don't know. Not only do we not know in a sort of strict sense that we haven't observed
*  it, but we have no very solid theories about this. We're not completely clueless. We have some ideas
*  that we push around. It's important to know when we talk about we don't understand quantum gravity.
*  That's true, but we understand a lot about quantum mechanics and we understand a lot about gravity.
*  So it's not like anything goes when it comes to quantum gravity. There's still some things that
*  are more reasonable, more likely than others. And it's absolutely possible to contemplate
*  scenarios in which something happens in the far future of the universe that brings the universe
*  back to life, either in some large region or in some tiny little baby universe type of region.
*  But honestly, we don't know. We don't understand the physics well enough to say one way or the
*  other. So it's fun to think about, interesting to think about, but don't rely on it for anything,
*  for any planning purposes. I don't know. Jeff B says, when we say that a region of space has a
*  finite number of degrees of freedom, is this equivalent to saying that reality is fundamentally
*  discrete or is there a more subtle relationship? It's a little bit more subtle relationship.
*  Again, this is quantum mechanics we're talking about. It's not classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics
*  in its basic formulation with the Schrodinger equation, et cetera, is not discrete. It is
*  just wrong to think that the fact that the world is quantum somehow implies some discreteness to it.
*  I ramble on about this in the upcoming book, the upcoming volume two of Biggest Ideas in the
*  Universe on Quanta and Fields, because in something like an atom where you have discrete energy levels
*  for the electron, that's not because the laws of physics are discrete. The laws of physics are
*  smooth. It's a wave equation, the Schrodinger equation. It's that the set of solutions to that
*  equation in that particular setup is discrete. So quantum mechanics itself, if you just do
*  regular quantum mechanics, nature is not discrete. Full stop. I recently wrote a paper,
*  very recently, pointing out that in certain special cases, if things line up just right,
*  you can take quantum mechanics and you can discretize it. You can discretize the evolution
*  of the wave function in Hilbert space so that it is truly discrete. There are some cosmological
*  issues that come up there, but otherwise it's fairly plausible that that could be the real
*  world. But we have no reason to think it's the real world. It was just sort of intellectual
*  exercise in pointing out this is a possibility that we can consider. But anyway, I think that's
*  not what you're getting at. When you ask about the fundamental degrees of freedom, the finite
*  number of degrees of freedom, usually in quantum mechanics, what we mean by that is the dimensionality
*  of Hilbert space. Hilbert space is the space of all quantum wave functions, right? For any point
*  particle moving in space or any quantum fields, the dimensionality of Hilbert space is infinite,
*  so it is not discrete. But if you have just a spin, a single qubit, that's just a two-dimensional
*  Hilbert space, that's finite. And there are good reasons from quantum gravity and black hole entropy
*  and the Bekenstein bound and words like that to think that the physical number of degrees of
*  freedom in the sense of the dimensionality of Hilbert space is finite within any finite-sized
*  region of space. But again, that doesn't mean that nature is discrete in the regular sense because
*  it is a vector. The thing that we're using to describe the universe is a vector in a finite
*  dimensional vector space, but the vector is still continuous. It still moves continuously through
*  that vector space, right? So in those senses, there is a more subtle relationship there.
*  Kyle Stevens says, with the continued proliferation of seemingly existential threats to humanity,
*  such as pandemics, unaligned AI, nuclear war, climate change, I can't help but feel that the
*  philosophical doomsday argument continues to gain more credence with each passing day.
*  Given these existential threats, should we lend any additional credence to the possibility,
*  the doomsday argument accurately accounts for why we find ourselves to exist so early in the
*  universe. So for those who don't know, the doomsday argument is one of these arguments that
*  is based on the assumption that we are somehow typical observers within some
*  class, some reference class of observers. So if that reference class of observers is all human
*  beings who ever live, okay, well then in that case, it is very, very unlikely that we are within
*  chronologically the first 1% of human beings who ever live, right? Because that would be only a 1%
*  chance. So therefore, you suddenly have a prediction for how many human beings could possibly live,
*  or at least probably live into the future, not so many, I mean, maybe a few more generations,
*  but pretty soon you're going to hit that 99% mark and it's going to become unlikely. So I think this
*  is just a mistake, like just obviously wrong, this argument, because we're not typical observers,
*  we're going to talk about this again later in the AMA. But I've mentioned this before, I talked
*  about it a little bit of length in the solo podcast from a while ago on the philosophy of cosmology,
*  someday I'm going to write a paper about this, because I think everyone gets this wrong, to be
*  honest. So I just have zero credence in the doomsday argument. Just to point out one obvious reason not
*  to believe it, why did you say all human beings ever existing rather than all life forms ever
*  existing, right? You get very different answers if you said that, but you have to pick a reference
*  class, you pick it arbitrarily, and your answer depends very, very sensitively on that choice.
*  When the answer to a purported objective question depends sensitively on a completely random and
*  arbitrary choice, you are probably making a mistake, I would say. And I think in the doomsday
*  argument, that's very clear. But you are correctly, Kyle, pointing out the fact that there is something
*  new about humanity in recent generations, namely that we in a way that we didn't 100 or 1000 years
*  ago have the capacity to really do disastrous things to life on earth, including all of human
*  beings, right? So in that sense, the chances that we do something terrible that destroys life on
*  earth or destroys all human life is much bigger now than it used to be. That's a perfectly reasonable
*  argument, but that didn't make any assumptions about typicality or anything like that. That just said,
*  through technology, we have a lot more leverage over ending lives here on earth than we ever did.
*  That's the route I would go down if I wanted to think about this kind of philosophical argument.
*  Jared Sage says, is it on the table that dark matter isn't a fundamental particle against the
*  standard model, but instead is some quasi particle that's an excitation in an abstract,
*  non-fundamental field? Sure, it's on the table. Many things are on the table. I don't think it's
*  on the table that it's a quasi particle in standard model fields. I do think that you need some degrees
*  of freedom beyond the standard model to do it, with the obvious exception that it could be tiny
*  black holes or medium-sized black holes for that matter. A black hole in some very real sense is a
*  quasi particle. It's an extended excitation of existing fields, like the gravitational
*  field and the matter fields and so forth. That's probably not what you have in mind.
*  I think that you would need other fields. I don't think the fields we know about in the standard
*  model are up to the task of giving you some unknown quasi particle excitations that could be the dark
*  matter, especially because standard model fields tend to interact, not be dark. Most ways I could
*  think of to make bound states of standard model particles would interact electromagnetically,
*  like hydrogen atoms interact electromagnetically even though they're themselves electrically neutral
*  because they're made of electrically charged constituents. I think that this kind of thing
*  is in the realm of you're welcome to think about it, but we have no great reason to suspect that
*  it's on the right track and it would be hard to constrain your own theorizing. Tomer Hakonen says,
*  Hakohen, sorry, Hakohen says, what is the relationship between the notion of time
*  and general relativity and the thermodynamic arrow of time? From my limited understanding of GR,
*  the main difference between time and the other coordinates of space time is that the sign of
*  the metric is negative for the zero zero index. Can one in principle start from the signature of
*  the metric is minus plus plus plus and derive the zeroth coordinate is the one along which entropy
*  grows? No. Well, because yes, in general relativity or in special relativity, or for that matter,
*  in Newtonian mechanics, there is a difference between space and time. And that difference is
*  reflected in the relativity versions in the fact that the metric has a different sign in the time
*  like direction than the space like directions. None of that has anything to do with entropy.
*  You can imagine a box of gas that is in thermal equilibrium and the entropy is neither growing
*  nor shrinking, but time is still passing because all the molecules in the gas are still moving.
*  The arrow of time is over and above the existence of time itself. That minus sign in the metric says
*  there is something called time. There's a coordinate that is different than space. It does not say that
*  there's any arrow pointing along that direction, which you know, because there's no arrow pointing
*  in the spatial directions, right? There can be in fact, there is here on earth, there's an arrow
*  pointing toward the center of the earth, called where gravity is pulling you toward. We don't make
*  a big deal about that arrow because its explanation is perfectly obvious. There's the earth beneath our
*  feet pulling us down. We know it's not there in the fundamental laws of physics, and we know it's not
*  out there in outer space, far away from the earth, right? The arrow of time is only different because
*  it's everywhere and it starts at the big bang. We don't know exactly why that happened, but it is
*  like the arrow of space here on earth. It is something that is not ingrained in the nature of
*  space time itself. It's a feature of our local environment. Moshe Fader says, what are your three
*  favorite cocktails and why would you consider developing a signature mindscape cocktail for
*  the drinking pleasure of your Patreon fans? Well, that's a good idea, although I'll have to confess
*  my ability to create new cocktails is pretty limited. I've tried, I've done it, sometimes
*  more successful than others, let's just put it that way. So I'll take suggestions within Patreon
*  for what could be the best mindscape cocktail or mindscape cocktail list for that matter.
*  You know, Jennifer did for a long time have a blog called Cocktail Party Physics where she collected
*  physics cocktails in the sidebar, but they were all pretty horrible. You wouldn't want to drink
*  these things. They were either just regular cocktails with physics-y names or terrible
*  concoctions that were meant to reflect some physical principles that would not ever be served
*  in a bar, let's put it that way. I'm much more standard. In fact, I'm kind of boring when it
*  comes to cocktails. You know, I like my cocktails not fruity or juicy or sweet. I like more spirit
*  forward, as they say. So, you know, I like martinis and manhattans and Negronis. In the slightly more
*  out there world, I like Sazeracx and Corpse Survivor number two and stuff like that. But, you know,
*  honestly, martinis, my favorite cocktail is very simple, very easy to make. You know, you can't
*  mess it up. People do mess it up. I think it's pretty easy to make the regular version of it.
*  I was just at a party with – not a party, a dinner at a friend's house and he made martinis and he
*  didn't use ice or make the martini cold in any way and I could not hide my disappointment. He felt
*  a little sad that I didn't like his martini that much because it was all room temperature. But,
*  you know, one of the requirements is it should be super duper cold. That's my advice out there to
*  martini makers. Simon Graf says, as a good Bayesian, what do you think of higher order
*  defeat problems? For example, how should we conditionalize on evidence that our ability
*  to conditionalize, i.e. take new evidence into account, is currently impaired? Or worse, evidence
*  that conditionalization is not the right rule for taking new evidence into account. Some people
*  argue that finding out you are drugged, tired or suffering from hypoxia puts us into situations
*  like this. I think this is a great question but I don't have a great answer. I haven't thought
*  deeply about these problems. My immediate guess is you do your best. If you were drugged but didn't
*  know it at all, then I can't think of a better strategy than just trying to do the same thing
*  that you thought you were trying to do. If you did know it, then that should be part of your
*  calculation of both your priors and your likelihood function, right? If you are seeing a pink elephant
*  and you're like, oh, that's very unlikely, but then you go, also you're completely intoxicated,
*  then it becomes more likely you change your likelihood function, right? Now, I am a good
*  Bayesian. I try to be a good Bayesian. But to be clear, to be a good Bayesian is to assign prior
*  probabilities to things and to try to update them when new information comes in. It is highly
*  impractical to actually do that in the real world on a comprehensive kind of basis. You can do that
*  explicitly for certain claims. Scientists do it. You know, when I was a graduate student, they
*  didn't. Astronomers and physicists were not Bayesians generally back in the 1980s and big data
*  came along and it became more clear we had to be better Bayesians. And so now when you read
*  papers that are looking for the Higgs boson or looking for using CMB data to constrain
*  cosmological parameters, everyone is Bayesian from the start. And that's very helpful. But as a
*  practical matter, no one really plugs in Bayes's theorem when they learn new information in everyday
*  situations. So just to be, I'm trying to say is that to be a good Bayesian is really about trying
*  your best to admit that you have priors and to update them when you get new information as best
*  you can. It's not literally plugging in the formula. And if you're in these situations where
*  conditionalization is not the right rule or something like that, if you're somehow cognitively
*  impaired, you're probably going to be an even worse Bayesian than a perfect calculator would be.
*  If you go back to the podcast we did with Carl Friston about the Bayesian brain and the free
*  energy principle, the Bayesian brain hypothesis is about minimizing surprise, like trying like a
*  brain is supposed to model the world in such a way that it's the least surprised that it can be when
*  it encounters new information. But even those people admit that that's calculationally implausible
*  for the brain to actually do it. That's why you invent the free energy principle. The free energy
*  principle is kind of a way to approximate being a good Bayesian. So I think that the real world is
*  a lot richer and a lot more complicated than the perfect Bayesian reasoner that we imagine.
*  These higher order defeat problems are examples of that. I do not know of a particular correct
*  strategy to take that covers all of them. Sorry about that. Henry Jacobs says,
*  I get the impression that unitary evolution in quantum mechanics is analogous to volume
*  conserving evolution in classical mechanics. Yes, that is true. Classically, when dissipation is
*  introduced, we get phase space contraction. However, dissipation is secretly a cheat. It's
*  really two subsystems interacting where one is large and called the environment and typically
*  sucks energy from the smaller subsystem. Is there an analogous conception of dissipation coupled
*  systems in quantum mechanics? And can it yield an explanation for the apparent collapse of wave
*  functions during observations? I would say yes, absolutely. And in some sense, okay, so yes,
*  absolutely. There's a conception of dissipation for coupled systems in quantum mechanics.
*  Quantum systems become entangled with each other. That's an example, okay, when you lose the purity
*  of your quantum state because you're becoming entangled with degrees of freedom elsewhere.
*  And there are equations to govern this. So if you aren't tracking the environment or whatever else
*  it is you're becoming entangled with, if you're only tracking the system of interest, it's an
*  open system. It is not going to obey the Schrodinger equation. So you do the same kind of thing morally
*  that you do in classical mechanics, which is you say, what is the best approximation? What is the
*  most realistic dynamical equation I could posit that would more or less track the evolution of
*  my open system in contact with environment that I am not tracking? And this is I'm sort of saying
*  this slowly and hesitatingly because hopefully it should be clear, you can't get a perfect equation
*  that would ever do this because the thing is you don't know what the environment is going to do.
*  By hypothesis, you're not tracking it, right? If you try to model the earth as an open system,
*  but you don't know that we're about to be hit by an asteroid, you're going to get your predictions
*  wrong. The same thing is true in quantum mechanics. So you have equations, you have master equations
*  or the Lindblad equation or various other things that try to do this kind of thing by making
*  assumptions about the environment. The environment is a thermal bath, it's weakly coupled, whatever
*  set of assumptions it is you need to make. And you can do that and that often works
*  correctly in certain situations, but you shouldn't be overly confident in its predictions. They're as
*  good as the assumptions, the conclusions are as good as the assumptions, let's put it that way.
*  Now, if you're asking whether it's an explanation for the apparent collapse of wave functions,
*  it's half of an explanation, right? All you're doing is saying here decoherence.
*  Decoherence is the phenomenon that is predicted by analyzing things in these ways.
*  Some people will say that decoherence provides a solution to the measurement problem of quantum
*  mechanics. Why? Because if you have an open system coupled to an environment, it can start in a
*  superposition of a pure state quantum mechanically, and it will evolve into a statistical mixture of
*  states. And that statistical mixture of states described by density matrix will be a sum of
*  states whose coefficients are non-negative numbers adding up to one. That is to say,
*  they look like probabilities. And in fact, they precisely are the probabilities that are predicted
*  by the Born Rule of quantum mechanics, okay? So people will say, look, all I need to do is have
*  decoherence happen and suddenly I have a probability distribution over different states. That is all
*  true, but what you don't have is a statement that says, and you will find yourself in one of those
*  states once the decoherence happens. The rules of quantum mechanics all by themselves say that you
*  would find yourself in a mixed state. You find yourself in a combination of all of these states
*  and you find yourself in a density matrix. In order to successfully address the measurement
*  problem and understand the apparent collapse of the wave function, you have to make a set of
*  additional substantive claims. Your substantive claim might be these different parts of the
*  density matrix now describe different branches of the wave function and I am on one of them and not
*  others. A different claim might be there are hidden variables that point to one of these
*  entries in the density matrix and that's the one where I live. Other modifications might be
*  the Schrodinger equation is violated and the other entries in the density matrix no longer exist,
*  whatever they are, but this is all why we need theories of the foundations of quantum mechanics.
*  You can't explain what we see just by saying that there is decoherence in the world.
*  Michael says, I am an atheist and certainly no expert on religion or Christianity. However,
*  it does strike me that Jesus seems to have been a really good person, feminist even perhaps,
*  and no toxic masculinity that I am aware of. I'm wondering what your thoughts are regarding Jesus
*  as a good person and as a corrective to oppressive text found in the Old Testament and if Jesus
*  holds up today as a model of non-oppressive, non-masculine, toxic figures, etc. You know,
*  yes and no in some senses. I've often said I'm 100% open to the idea that we can find wisdom
*  and examples and inspiration in texts, whether they are religious texts or secular texts or
*  whatever. If you want to read the New Testament and find that Jesus seems to you to be kind of
*  like a role model, then go ahead. I have no objections to that whatsoever. It's only kind
*  of partial because number one, it's very, very hazy what the connection is between the description
*  of Jesus in the New Testament and any actual human person, right? There probably was a person named
*  Jesus, etc. but the New Testament texts were written decades after that person died by people
*  who are not eyewitnesses to it. So what are you going to believe? You know, this is a set of
*  stories that were told within a community and passed down orally for a while before they ever
*  got written down. So it's not clear that you're actually looking up to a person rather than a
*  fictional character in terms of what we are actually told about them. And the other thing is,
*  you know, some of the things that Jesus said were really admirable and some were not, like most
*  people, you know? This is why I don't like hero worship in any sense for Jesus or for anybody else.
*  It's true that he said a lot of good things about turning the cheek and helping the poor,
*  etc. He also said a lot of things about going to hell if you didn't follow him. And, you know,
*  maybe he was not as misogynist as some of his contemporaries, but he certainly didn't say,
*  women and men have equal status in my church. I don't remember that one anywhere in the
*  New Testament. Certainly wasn't followed by his followers when they actually set up the church. So,
*  you know, go ahead. I would say, you know, find inspiration in Jesus and Buddha or Zhuangzi or
*  whoever you want to be inspired by. That's fine. But, you know, there's plenty of people out there
*  to be inspired by, not just that one. Sid Huff says, many people have been taught that atoms are
*  mostly empty space. This notion was stated eloquently by none other than Carl Sagan.
*  However, many physicists debunked this statement as a misconception. So what exactly is empty space?
*  Does such a thing actually exist whether inside atoms or elsewhere? Well, you know, you have to
*  define what you mean by empty space and then you can decide whether it exists. I would not say that
*  atoms are empty space, mostly because I think that atoms are wave functions, right? And the
*  wave function has a size. You can literally plot it when you look at all those orbital diagrams
*  in chemistry class. That's the size and shape of an atom in my way of looking at it. I don't see how
*  anyone can both really understand quantum mechanics and claim that atoms are mostly empty space
*  because you have to, in order to say that atoms are mostly empty space, you have to think of
*  an electron as a little dot, which we just know it isn't. I know people are clinging to this way
*  of talking. I don't blame Carl Sagan at all because he was not a quantum physicist. That was not his
*  area of expertise. But there's, you know, modern grown-up quantum mechanics people who still talk
*  that way, even though they really should know better, then I really just don't know. There's
*  other layers here because of course we know these days that quantum field theory is a better way of
*  thinking of things than point particle quantum mechanics. And there the notion of empty space
*  becomes even more fraught, let's put it that way. The closest you have in quantum field theory to
*  empty space is the vacuum state. So a state of your quantum field theory where there are no
*  particles, no excitations, no energy of any sort, anything like that. And you can have that,
*  that's a pretty good approximation to empty space, to the vacuum in between the planets and the stars.
*  It's not exact because there's light and so forth, right? And you know, that means it's not completely
*  empty, but it's a good approximation. I'm not sure what else we want other than that. Keith says,
*  say Laplace's dark demon is like Laplace's demon except only knows the exact state of dark matter.
*  The dark demon also knows general relativity and thus presumably would be able to infer the
*  presence of the clumped up ordinary matter similar to how we ordinary beings infer dark matter.
*  However, the dark demon is not aware directly of the laws of physics governing the other
*  interactions of ordinary matter, e.g. electromagnetism. My question is, given these
*  properties of Laplace's dark demon, should we expect the dark demon to still be able to
*  infer the state of the ordinary matter and hidden laws just based on this perfect dark and
*  gravitational knowledge? Well, it would be hard. So to rephrase the question here, if you knew,
*  if you were perfectly knowledgeable about what all the dark matter was doing and Laplace's demon is
*  supposed to be really smart, okay, so perfect calculational abilities, the ordinary matter in
*  the universe would have an effect on the motion of the dark matter. So could you infer the physics
*  of ordinary matter from just what the dark matter is doing? In some sense, of course, this is just
*  what we're trying to do right now with the dark matter. We know about what the ordinary matter is
*  doing. We're trying to figure out what the dark matter is and we know there that there are things
*  we can learn, how much dark matter there is, how it's distributed through the universe, but there
*  are also things that elude us right now. Is the dark matter heavy or light? Is it axions or wimps
*  or black holes or neutrinos or who knows? So of course, Laplace's demon knows a lot more than we
*  do. So I think it could go pretty far. It would certainly know that ordinary matter has dissipation,
*  right? So it has some way of shaking off energy by giving off photons and therefore clumping and
*  coming to the bottom of a gravitational potential well. That might naturally lead it to understanding
*  electromagnetism, maybe even atomic structure, but then there's other things it would not know.
*  Like it would never learn about the top quark because top quarks just decay away. Heavy particles
*  don't really stick there in the set of particles that we have existing in the universe right now.
*  So that would be very, very difficult for Laplace's dark demon to figure out. It would probably even
*  have difficulty with something like the Higgs boson or the Higgs mechanism because I'm not sure
*  that the dark demon would ever be able to figure out that there was parity violation in the standard
*  in what we call the ordinary matter sector. And without parity violation, you don't really need
*  the Higgs mechanism, right? You can just have masses for particles, just like Dirac did when
*  he first wrote down the Dirac equation. So my guess is the dark demon would be able to learn a lot,
*  but certainly not everything, about our known laws of physics. Nikola Ivanov says,
*  if the second law of thermodynamics is applicable only to isolated systems,
*  how can we think it is applicable also to the observable universe as a whole if we don't know
*  whether the observable universe is an isolated system? Well, there's two things. For one thing,
*  there absolutely are versions of the second law that are applicable to non-isolated systems.
*  If you have a system that is in contact with a heat bath, okay, that is not isolated, it's in
*  contact with a heat bath, but it's a very simple kind of non-isolation. It's just sort of being
*  lured into thermal equilibrium. So in those cases, you absolutely have a version of the second law
*  that says that the sum of the entropy increase plus the heat flow into the environment is greater
*  than zero. So something like that might still apply to the universe. But also, more importantly,
*  the second law is not posited as an axiom of anything. It is derived from the behavior of
*  physical systems. We know about coarse graining and about the microscopic structure and things
*  like that. And so if the universe is not an open system, it's not an open system. If our observable
*  universe is thought of as not an open system, it's thought of as not an open system because
*  things can escape from it, right? There's a horizon around us and things can leave the horizon.
*  It's not because things are coming in to our universe and influencing us. So again, that's a
*  very simple kind of non-openness and one that can pretty easily be accommodated by what we understand
*  about the dynamics of the universe. So we have every reason to think that within our observable
*  universe, entropy is going up. Russell Wolf says, it feels to me like more often than not your response
*  to priority questions is something along the lines of, I don't think this question makes sense
*  or I don't have much to say about this. When I'm listening to an AMA and hear a priority question
*  come up, my first reaction is to expect a less interesting discussion because usually you have
*  more to say about the questions you select freely. How well do you feel the system of priority
*  questions is working? Well, I'd be happy to get feedback from Patreon supporters about the priority
*  question system, but I think it's working okay. It is true that a priority question by its nature
*  is one that I'm going to answer whether or not I think I have anything interesting to say about it.
*  My first criterion for picking questions to answer is whether or not I have anything interesting to
*  say. So if you remove that criterion from consideration, there's going to be a negative
*  correlation with me having negative interesting things to say. But that's not the only thing that
*  matters. I want the AMAs to be useful both for listeners who are not the question askers
*  and for the question askers. Both of those criteria count. So when I'm trying to choose
*  questions to answer, mostly I'm thinking about the listeners. I'm thinking about whether or not
*  they will want to hear my answer to this question, possibly. I don't know why they want to hear some
*  of these answers, but you know, I give it a shot. Whereas when I'm thinking about the priority
*  questions, I'm thinking about the person asking the question. In the early days of the Patreon,
*  when it was smaller, I could answer all of the questions and I felt like I was giving back
*  a very definite tangible benefit to Patreon supporters. I can't do that anymore, so the
*  priority question system was invented as a compromise where if you have one burning question
*  that you want to ask, even though I seem to not be willing to answer it, I'll give you that chance.
*  You absolutely have that chance. And probably you will learn that I wasn't answering it because I
*  have nothing interesting to say, but that's okay. You know, maybe I'll be able to point in some
*  direction or something like that. So again, I'm open to people suggesting changes in the priority
*  question system, but I think so far it's working more or less as I had hoped. Brent Meeker says,
*  What do you think of various systems of voting such as rank choice or distributed points?
*  Have there been simulations or empirical tasks of how they work?
*  Arrows Theorem says that all voting systems can be gained. I don't think Arrows Theorem exactly says
*  that. Arrows Theorem says that certain kinds of voting systems, which are a lot of them,
*  but not all of them. In particular, it applies to rank choice voting, but not to sort of voting
*  systems where you have a continuum of preferences, right? There are voting systems where you don't
*  just rank your choices, but you assign a number to them. You grade them basically, range voting.
*  So you say, well, this option, I give a 10 to this, I give a 7.3, this I give a two and so forth.
*  Arrows Theorem doesn't technically apply in those cases. And furthermore, what Arrows Theorem says
*  is not that all voting systems can be gained. It says that there are various things you would like
*  to be true about a voting system, such as no dictator. There's not just one person who makes
*  all the decisions. And if two people both rank A greater than B, then their combined ranking is A
*  greater than B. Things like that can't all be simultaneously satisfied. What I think you're
*  probably thinking of is strategic voting, which is a related but slightly different concept.
*  Strategic voting is when you have a set of preferences, but the most likely way to get
*  your favorite outcome is not to vote honestly about what your preferences are, right? So you
*  might vote for a third party, you might not vote, I should say, for a third party candidate,
*  not because you don't like them, but because you don't think they're going to win. If 45% of the
*  people like one candidate and 50%—I'm not going to get this true in real time—if 40%, 45%, and 15%
*  are the voting things, then you might worry that if you give your money to the third party candidate,
*  you're throwing it away because they're not going to win. So instead, you strategically vote
*  for somebody else. So that's a true but slightly different thing than Arrows Theorem.
*  Anyway, I have mixed feelings about different voting systems. I do think that our current voting
*  system, pluralistic voting or first past the post, is the worst. I think that's the consensus of
*  people who thought about this. And I do think that ranked choice voting is better. I think that range
*  voting, like I just described, is even better, although it's still subject to strategic voting
*  considerations. There was a study. You asked about a study, does anything work the best? Well,
*  what does it mean to work the best? This is why I'm interested in these questions because
*  it's not at all obvious how to define what it means to work the best. But if you Google
*  range voting, there was a study. Someone tried to do a simulation of many, many different voting
*  systems and invented an idea called Bayesian regret. How sad is the individual voter that their
*  preferred candidate didn't win and then you sum over all the voters. And range voting came out
*  the best in that particular set of simulations. So there is at least an attempt to be a little
*  empirical about this. Well, it's a numerical experiment. It's a thought experiment. Let's
*  put it that way. It's not an actual empirical investigation based on real voters. And that's
*  why I'm a little bit skeptical because there is a trade off that voting theorists don't want to
*  face up to, which is that complicated systems are bad. Complicated systems might help you
*  achieve some ideal solution in a thought experiment, but real people don't like them,
*  right? Real people know what it means to vote for a candidate. They might even understand what
*  it means to rank candidates, but you can quickly get elections. Like I was in California where we
*  had elections with over 200 people on the ballot. You think you're going to rank all them? You have
*  to do something, right? You have to have some simplification. So I don't know how much work
*  has been done about people just not voting or voting badly when you have these more
*  elaborate systems in place. That's what I would worry about. It goes back up to Linux versus
*  Macintosh users, right? People want a simple user interface and the voting system is an example of
*  where that is an important consideration. I'm going to group two questions together.
*  Schlier says, Elon Musk is famously a fan of the simulation hypothesis. It seems to me
*  that if I were a billionaire, I too would question the nature of my perceived reality due
*  to the sheer unlikelyhood of having that experience. It's not surprising that there is a richest person,
*  but it would seem surprising for me to be that person. Is this bad reasoning or can the
*  atypicality of one's own role in the system serve as useful information about the nature of the
*  system? And Casey Mahone says, I often hear physicists reworking their ideas in order to avoid
*  Boltzmann brain situations, but this seems to clash with another idea I've heard you express,
*  namely that we can't think of ourselves as being uniformly selected among all observers.
*  Can't we just imagine that there are Boltzmann brains having their own experiences near the end
*  of time while we're here now? Why would we change a theory just because it suggests the possibility
*  of Boltzmann brains somewhere else in space-time? So the common thread here is something we already
*  mentioned earlier this episode, the idea that we are somehow typical observers within some group
*  of people. I kind of am sympathetic with Schleyer's suggestion that if you were a truly non-typical
*  person and you thought that you should be typical, then that might suggest to you that something was
*  going on, right? But guess what? Forget about billionaires. Typical people are not physics
*  professors, so I should have that same kind of belief. And this is exactly why I don't think
*  that we should think that we're typical people because by the time we're grown up and trained
*  well enough to have such thoughts, we're already not typical people. We're certainly not typical
*  arrangements of atoms just by being people at all. This whole thought experiment is a weird thing
*  where you say, okay, here I am as a real person with real facts and characteristics about my life.
*  I'm going to pretend to forget all of them. I'm going to pretend to forget that I know who I am
*  in the world, pretend that I'm a typical person, and then wake up and look around and notice that
*  I'm not typical and be surprised. This just seems weird to me. Why are you doing this? Why not just
*  admit that you're not typical? Okay, so that's my reasoning there. Now, I'll confess very, very quickly.
*  I don't have a perfectly well-formed alternative, so I'm working on that. I'm trying to figure it
*  out. One of the aspects of what I think is a much better alternative is that if you have a
*  set of observers who have the same information about their situation, so if you literally have
*  observers that if you asked them everything about who they were would give you precisely the same
*  answer, then you should imagine that you are typical among that ensemble of people.
*  If you think about a duplication experiment where you step into a box and then you're
*  turning into two identical people and you don't know, neither one of those two people know which
*  ones they are, then you should give 50-50 chance to being either one. What else are you going to do
*  because they're in epistemically indistinguishable situations? That's why the Boltzmann brain
*  problem is a big problem because it's not because there are random fluctuations into brains. I know
*  everyone says that. It's evocative and picturesque and people talk about that, but again, this whole
*  line of reasoning that says if there were lots of Boltzmann brains, I would be a Boltzmann brain.
*  I'm not one, therefore it is ruled out by the data. I don't think that that makes any sense at all.
*  The problem in the Boltzmann brain situation is that when there are fluctuations into Boltzmann
*  brains, there are also fluctuations into people with exactly your experiences, but people with
*  exactly your experiences in much different actual circumstances. The most obvious case is imagine a
*  fluctuation into exactly our universe that we see around us right now, but no more. If you want to
*  fluctuate into our universe as we see it, you don't literally need to make other galaxies and stuff
*  like that. You need to make the photons that you and I and astronomers observe from those galaxies
*  and use them to infer the existence of galaxies. It's much easier to fluctuate into a few photons
*  than to fluctuate a whole galaxy. The overwhelming majority of observers in that kind of fluctuating
*  universe who see pictures of galaxies far away, tomorrow will not see those pictures anymore.
*  Those galaxies will disappear because there were no galaxies there. There were just some
*  photons that randomly fluctuated into existence. That's the problem with this scenario is that you
*  make a strong prediction that you don't really believe. Now you notice I didn't say a strong
*  prediction that comes out false. That's a slightly different thing. It's that you don't really
*  believe that prediction because of the cognitive instability aspects of your situation. You have to
*  believe in that situation that all of your purported information about the universe is just
*  randomly fluctuated and therefore is completely unreliable. Therefore you can't actually make any
*  predictions about anything and that's no way to go through life. So the belief that we are not Boltzmann
*  brains does not rely on the idea that we are typical observers chosen among all observers in
*  the universe. I do think it is absolutely fair and indeed the only thing to do to assume that
*  we are typical observers from the set of people with exactly our information. It's completely
*  cheating to say that there are some observers in a nice well-posed universe like we think we live in
*  or or portion of the universe and there are many more observers in the future or in the past with
*  exactly the same epistemic situation but we're not them because how do you know you're not them?
*  What's so great about you? Why don't they have feelings too? So I do think that random
*  fluctuation scenarios should be excluded from our consideration but not because of literal Boltzmann
*  brains. Redmond says after extraterrestrial contact requesting a meeting the president,
*  a mindscape subscriber, asks you to lead the human team. The aliens who can speak English but not other
*  languages and are far advanced in the art of meetings limit human participation to five people.
*  Who do you take? Whom do you take? Sorry. So I'm not going to answer this question literally
*  but I want to say two things about it. The first thing is that the reason why I'm not going to
*  answer it literally is because I'm just not into these kinds of questions and you know I
*  know that many people are. I'm not trying to denigrate these kinds of questions but like
*  pick your five favorite people with characteristics x. Those are just never my favorite questions. I'm
*  just not into them. It kind of smacks a little bit of hero worship. I know it's not, I'm not trying
*  to say that, but you know who are the five best people, the five coolest people. I'm not about
*  people in that way. You know I like my friends, my personal acquaintances. I'm about those people
*  but people out there in the world you know who do great things, for them I'm about their great
*  things. I don't know them personally enough to say you know who are the five people in history you'd
*  want to have dinner with or whatever. You know I just don't think that way and I apologize for it
*  because it makes me weird and it makes me sound like I'm being rude to people who ask that question
*  because that kind of question is very common here in the AMAs. Okay so I'm not going to give you
*  literal answers to it. I feel like I'd be insulting all the people I didn't pick you know but
*  I do think that the question of what kinds of people you would send to talk to intelligent
*  aliens is a really good question. You know forget about individuals and their names. What kind of
*  team would you assemble? That's a great question. That's very interesting and you know the short
*  answer is I don't know because you know one of the rules of the AMAs here is I don't do any work
*  for them other than literally you know editing them and then reading and recording them. So
*  that's a question that demands a lot of thought you know and I haven't thought about it. That's
*  why I like that aspect of the question. You know you would it's smart that you put in there in the
*  question that the aliens somehow speak English but not other languages. Okay I don't know what
*  that happened but I guess I do recognize that it makes the question much simpler. So we don't need
*  to send a linguist right? I mean clearly you would want to send at least a very good physical
*  scientist and a very good biological scientist right? You'd want to talk to them about science
*  and I think that you would separately want to send someone who was really good at technology.
*  You know being good at technology is different than being good at science. So you know someone
*  who can learn about from the aliens about the fundamental laws of physics, someone who can learn
*  from them about their biology, and someone who can learn about them from them about their technology.
*  Just saying those words out loud you know makes it very clear that even five people is not going to
*  be enough. Like what do you mean someone who can learn about technology? Like there's lots of
*  different kinds of technologies. People who are good at superconductors are not good at you know
*  pharmaceutical advances or something like that. So it's going to be a tough call. And then I
*  think you want some more socially oriented people you know maybe a social scientist and an artist.
*  Artist in the broadest sense you know literature, movies, or whatever but you know someone who
*  has a more poetic narrative sensibility would be a good person to talk to the aliens and also someone
*  who knows something about social dynamics to figure out you know what the society is like of
*  the aliens and something like that. So that seems like to me to be a pretty good first attempt at
*  five different kinds of people. But you know it's leaving out people who are interested in
*  diseases, people are interested in astronomy, people who know about complex systems in general,
*  people who are politically smart, people who could negotiate very well. You know there's a whole bunch
*  of skill sets not in that team. So I'm just going to cross my fingers and hope that we get 10 people
*  on our team when we finally meet the aliens. Adam Small says priority question. This has to do with
*  black holes. From what I understand the effect of gravity move at the speed of light. So if the sun
*  if the sun suddenly took off and jetted out of the solar system the earth would still revolve for a
*  while until the information arrived. This relates to black holes because since the signal of gravity
*  moves and starts inside the event horizon where the source of gravity is how does the information
*  of gravity escape the event horizon since gravity does move and reach an orbiting star. I've thought
*  no information can escape other than Hawking radiation. So there's a whole bunch of things
*  going on here that I'll try to talk about a little bit. You know first thing it's not really relevant
*  to the question but it's useful information. These kind of thought experiments where you say if the sun
*  suddenly took off and jetted out of the solar system. This already doesn't make sense because
*  it violates energy conservation. Like what do you mean suddenly took off? The whole mass of the sun
*  suddenly has a different momentum. So you're already violating the laws of physics and then
*  you're saying well what would the laws of physics have to say about this. That's an inconsistent
*  question. You need a better and you can fix it up right. You say like what if the sun exploded
*  but if it exploded in a you know in two blobs moving off in opposite directions like the sun
*  decayed into too many suns going in opposite directions. So that's a fixable kind of thing
*  but just so you know that kind of thing would have to be fixed in order to ask a sensible question.
*  But the other thing the more important thing about the question is this idea that gravity
*  is kind of a substance that moves at a speed. That's just not what gravity is. For that matter
*  it's not what electromagnetism is right. Both gravity and electromagnetism are fields that
*  pervade space time and solve some equations. And so the right question to ask is what is the solution
*  of the equations with certain boundary conditions. In the case of a black hole or the sun the boundary
*  conditions are there's some mass or some effective curvature of space time located at some part of
*  the universe and with that boundary condition you solve the equations around it and you find that
*  there is a inverse square law for both gravity and for electromagnetism. It's not because there's some
*  flux of stuff. When you have a charged particle with an electric field around it it's not because
*  electromagnetism forces are moving away from the particle and reaching out and grabbing other
*  things. It's because at every point in space there is an electromagnetic field and it settles down to
*  a certain configuration given that boundary condition that there's a charged particle at that
*  point. Likewise for gravity there's nothing moving faster than the speed of light in a static
*  gravitational field. There isn't anything moving at all. It's static. So it is true that if the sun
*  changed its configuration dramatically for example by splitting into and moving off then the boundary
*  condition for the gravitational field would change and that change would not be noticeable to us
*  in some reference frame because it's relativity until what is it eight minutes later because we're
*  eight light minutes away from the sun. But that's completely compatible right that's just the
*  equation for the gravitational field now has a different boundary condition and those changes
*  ripple out at the speed of light. So it all does make sense but you have to like make sure that
*  your intuitive model of what gravity is is actually matching up with the what the equations are telling
*  you. Anonymous says clocks that I care about are usually a flow meter for entropy. When I sit to
*  think for a minute I'm waiting for a minute's worth of entropy increase to happen in my brain
*  regardless of how light would travel in that time. But some clocks aren't entropic like the t you
*  take derivatives with respect to in Hamiltonians. Can you say something smart and at the limits of
*  my comprehension about these two kinds of clocks? I think I can try to say something useful anyway
*  whether or not it's smart and at your limits but I think that you're probably not right to think
*  about clocks as flow meters for entropy. It is true that in some certain physical circumstances
*  clocks do in participate in the overall increase of the entropy of the universe
*  but the thing about entropy increasing is it doesn't increase at a constant rate.
*  Entropy can stay constant in some system for a long time and then start going up or whatever
*  right. There's no law of physics that says entropy goes up at a certain rate. The second law just says
*  the entropy doesn't go down. Sometimes it'll stay constant sometimes it'll go up and so forth
*  and for precisely that reason most clocks they work very very hard to isolate them from entropy.
*  The simplest clocks in the world are the rotation of the earth and so you see the sun going up and
*  down right and that does not increase entropy at all. It's in the you know in the limit where you
*  can ignore some very very tiny effects which is a very good approximation. It's completely reversible
*  right. We know where the sun and the earth were millions or billions of years ago.
*  So clocks are usually not flow meters for entropy. They're usually periodic things that do the same
*  thing over and over again in a way that is completely constant in entropy. So that's the
*  actual time that you measure with clocks. If you think about what are the best clocks they're the
*  things that are like a pendulum where you have no air resistance or a little tiny quartz crystal or
*  an atomic vibration. All things that are not actually spewing entropy out there into the universe.
*  Robbie P says you said that the question why is there something rather than nothing is not a
*  sensible one but in some sense isn't nothing all around us or right around the corner in any
*  possible regime. Why aren't we forced to choose between necessary and contingent whatever the
*  universe? Well sure you know when you say why is there something rather than nothing it would be
*  nice if you told us what you meant by the words something and nothing. I think that the most
*  traditional interpretation of that question is why is there anything at all and things like empty space
*  are not nothing at all. They're full of quantum fields and you know that they have a metric and
*  they have a dimensionality and all these characteristics. It's not like there's an
*  absence of anything okay. So I do not think that it is true that nothing is all around us or right
*  around the corner. Of course you're also welcome to ask that why is space not empty. That's a
*  perfectly good question. You know there's this saying that goes around in certain circles that
*  the reason why there's something rather than nothing is because nothing is unstable.
*  This is an extraordinarily annoying saying because generally the people who say it don't know what it
*  means or what they're talking about. That was a little motto invented by Frank Wilczek, former
*  mindscape guest, where he was specifically referring to the question of why there is more
*  matter than anti-matter in the universe. Why there's a baryon asymmetry. So it was kind of like a little
*  joke you know. Why is there more matter than anti-matter? Because in his particular model,
*  which we don't know is true by the way, he had a system where an equal amount of matter and anti-matter
*  was an unstable circumstance, an unstable configuration of stuff. So it's a conjectural
*  model but it's also not at all what most of us have in mind when we ask why is there something
*  rather than nothing. So like many big sounding questions, the very first thing you should do
*  when you ask it if you actually care about what the answer is, is to carefully define exactly what
*  you mean by those terms. Christopher Matthews says, I've noticed that occasionally you'll get
*  groups of questions concerning topics or conclusions that you dismiss as misguided or even woo-woo,
*  and in these cases I further notice that the questions often appear to have been inspired
*  by a recent video from pop science YouTube series like PBS Space Time. What is your feeling generally
*  about these sort of video series? Do you think they do a good job communicating physics concepts
*  to a general audience even if they apparently cause a rash of misguided speculation from time
*  to time? I think that's a perfectly reasonable question. I don't have a lot of data on the basis
*  of which to answer it. I personally don't spend a lot of time watching pop science YouTube videos
*  and I say that slowly and carefully because I don't want to disparage pop science YouTube videos and
*  certainly not disparage the people who watch them. I love it that there are pop science YouTube videos
*  just like pop science TV documentaries or pop science books etc. It's not my thing because I'm
*  a professional scientist and therefore if I'm reading science it's probably going to be a little
*  bit more technical than those things and if I'm reading popular fun things it's probably not going
*  to have anything to do with science. That's just who I am particularly. So I don't have an educated
*  view on which science videos are the good ones and which ones are not. Like I said, I like the idea
*  that there are science videos and I'm glad that they're trying. I do think there's one possible
*  criticism or potential criticism that or potential pitfall let's put it that way that people should
*  should worry about because different science questions have different levels of straightforwardness
*  to their answers, right? Like let's think about are atoms empty space like we were just talking
*  about. That's not a trivial question. It's not like how big is a black hole of a certain mass.
*  There you just go to the equation, you plug it in, you get the answer. So you can have a mind-blowing
*  popular science video about the journey into a black hole. How long it would take, when you
*  would get spaghettified, when you could reach a point of no return, what you would see as you
*  were looking outside. All those are interesting questions but the answers to them are ultimately
*  perfectly straightforward. There are other kinds of questions that sound similar, right? Are atoms
*  mostly empty space? How hard can that be? But in fact they involve very deep potentially controversial
*  issues about the foundations of quantum mechanics or things like that. And I do think that sometimes
*  in these pop science videos it's not that they get them wrong. It's that at least not they get
*  them wrong because they're being sloppy. It's because they're addressing questions which are
*  legitimately tricky and a lot of professional scientists get them wrong. Scientists are sloppy
*  all the time when they're talking about science. Scientists will say things that they know what
*  the footnotes and the caveats are but are not immediately conveyed when they say those things.
*  Scientists will say you know the universe on large scales is either flat or positively curved or
*  negatively curved. If you really sat down and interrogated them they would know that's not
*  right. They would know that's a set of assumptions that you're making and they're only approximately
*  true. Like there's a whole bunch of caveats that they have in mind that they're not sharing with
*  you and so they're not lying to you. They're just not telling you the whole story and then someone
*  goes and makes a video about it and someone else thinks it's just true and all the footnotes and
*  caveats and careful wordings have gone away. And so that is a danger in making these kinds of
*  videos. And I say to someone I've not made a lot of science videos on YouTube myself but I've been
*  on I've been in science documentaries all the time and you know the people in Hollywood where
*  they make these little one-hour shows for the science channel or the history channel or the
*  discovery channel. The people who are making these shows are on the one hand entirely well-meaning
*  and on the other hand know nothing about science. And I say that you know without any disparagement
*  their job is making TV shows. There are not people in general there's always exceptions but for the
*  most part the director of a TV science show is not his job is not or her job not director of TV
*  science shows right it's director of TV shows and science just happens to be what their job is this
*  day. That's even true for the writers and the producers and so forth. So you get a lot of
*  situations where you know they saw something on Wikipedia or whatever they don't really understand
*  it perfectly they're trying their best to turn it into something visual and they do understand
*  visual things so they'll try to make a nice fun visual demonstration of something and not really
*  have a very good idea what the thing is that they're demonstrating. So like anything else in the
*  world you should be skeptical you should keep your wits about you when you watch these things you
*  should really think about okay this is being said to me on the internet does that necessarily mean
*  that it's true. Jake Zielsdorf says do you have opinions about Oppenheimer as a physicist was he
*  a great one. Well I think that you know he has contributions in physics he was not you know in
*  the top tier in terms of contributions you will hear again and again that people who knew him and
*  met him claim that he was in the top tier in terms of just being brilliant but that's a different
*  thing right there's plenty of brilliant people who don't do anything at all. I would say that
*  Oppenheimer did some pretty good things but not you know earth shattering things as far as physics
*  is concerned he did do an earth shattering thing in leading the Manhattan project you know for
*  better or for worse that was an enormous accomplishment personally so you know that in that sense he
*  he succeeded at doing something other than writing theoretical physics papers and I think you know
*  that's fine there are ways to have an impact on the world other than writing physics papers.
*  Tim Converse says an acquaintance of mine once looked at my bookshelves and declared that my
*  interest looked a mile wide and an inch deep which was mean but fair. As a person with an unusually
*  large volume of interest how do you think about the trade-off between breadth and depth of your
*  interests and your intellectual work or do you not think of it that way? Well I think there is a
*  trade-off you know I think there's a finite number of days in the week years in your lifetime cycles
*  of activity in your brain etc so if you are going to educate yourself and think very very broadly
*  about many different topics then you will not be able to focus on any one of those topics as
*  deeply as you would if you only focused on that one topic I think you just can't deny that for
*  any one person saying that by itself certainly doesn't tell us whether it is better to hyper
*  specialize and focus on one topic or to cast your net more broadly for obvious reasons you know
*  there's an obvious benefit to hyper specializing which is you can just always be thinking about a
*  certain kind of thing dig very deeply into it you can understand its nuances really really well
*  and there's an underappreciated aspect which is that thing is what you're thinking about in your
*  spare time you know as you're brushing your teeth as you're walking to work you're just thinking
*  about that one thing and that constant concentration on something is very valuable to really making
*  breakthroughs there's just no doubt about that there is also value in not falling into a rut
*  in being constantly exposed to different ways of thinking and different ways of conceptualizing
*  things and putting things together and so even if your ultimate goal is to understand questions in
*  a certain particular field one can make the argument for also thinking about other fields
*  and learning about them even if it cuts down on the time that you get to put in the in the
*  particular field that you're most interested in you know all of that is all true and I just said
*  it you know it's all true but honestly I just like what I do I kind of don't care whether other people
*  think that I am a mile wide and an inch deep or anything like that am I that's for other people
*  to judge what matters to me is that I have a job that you know lets me do what I want to do
*  if I didn't you know then I would feel bad but now I do so I'm happy there you go that's what I care
*  about now what is the broad scale best way to deploy our intellectual resources I don't know
*  I think that it's not that different from what we do which is that we have some people who are super
*  duper specialized and we have other people who like to be a little bit more broad and
*  interdisciplinary and they talk to each other I do think that probably if I were again you know the
*  god emperor of academia I would tilt the scales a little bit more toward broad people interdisciplinary
*  people because it's just kind of easier and cheaper to stick to a field and just do the same thing
*  over and over again I think that there's low hanging fruit that gets missed by not rewarding
*  people who try to make connections across fields but it's a small effect it's not like throwing I
*  don't want to stop all those people who are specializing I don't want to denigrate their
*  work in any way I think you know everyone should like being I always say this being a professor
*  being an academic being an intellectual you got to do it because you love it there's no that's
*  really the only reason you know like if you have other motivations in your life there's better ways
*  to have them fulfilled than being a professor in various ways of course being a professor also
*  involves teaching and things like that which is also important I'm just thinking about the research
*  intellectual project aspect of them and if you love it you'll love it in different ways different
*  people will the love for knowledge and research and learning new things will manifest itself in
*  different ways in different people and I think that's good I'm not really about ranking all the
*  different ways and figuring out what is the right one some dude says priority question I've
*  sometimes tried to explain quantum field theory to friends with the image with the analogy of a tv
*  or computer screen the pixels on a monitor may be turned on or off but they're always there
*  basically pixels having the potential to be on off is analogous to discrete pockets of individual
*  field having the potential to be excited or not do you think this is an apt analogy yeah actually
*  I think it's a very good analogy I think that people because we're used to in the classical
*  limit thinking about particles and objects do tend to think of the world as stuff in the forms of
*  object with objects with empty space in between them and quantum field theory or for that matter
*  even classical field theory the quantum really doesn't have that much to do with it field theory
*  says the opposite field theory says that even in the emptiest of spaces there still are fields
*  they might have their lowest possible value zero or whatever that is but they're still there so
*  this kind of analogy with a tv screen where some pixels are just off but the pixels are still there
*  that's perfectly good I like it Sean Miller says evolutionary principles taken in their broadest
*  sense to mean change over time and selective pressures that favor certain kinds of change
*  arguably are as fundamental as the second law in this sense one can think of the second law as a
*  demon favoring patterns of matter that favor increased entropy do you think there's any
*  utility in thinking of the evolution of the universe with this lens or does fundamental
*  physics and the principle of least action essentially render any notion of selective
*  pressure at this level nonsensical you know this is a complicated set of questions here
*  you're you're a little worried in the phrasing of the question because you leap from
*  entropy and evolutionary pressures to fundamental physics and the principle of least action and you
*  know all of these are good ideas but they're ideas in different contexts you know if you have
*  fundamental physics and the principle of least action you don't talk about entropy or evolution
*  or selection you just follow the laws of physics and you just do what they do the idea of entropy
*  and selection and evolution only comes about when you've coarse grained and you have an arrow of
*  time etc i don't like as i sort of implicitly said earlier i don't like to think about the second law
*  favoring patterns of matter that favor increased entropy the second law is just an inequality
*  it's very very weak it says that along the trajectory entropy could either go up or go
*  down and it goes up doesn't say that it tries to go up as fast as it can doesn't say what way it
*  goes up it doesn't say how rapidly it goes up it just says it doesn't spontaneously go down
*  that's a very very weak requirement okay what we would like to do and maybe what you're gesturing
*  at is we would like to go beyond the second law of thermodynamics to really understand the ways in
*  which physical large-scale configurations of matter evolve to both increase entropy but also have other
*  finer scale things going on complex systems interacting with each other biological systems
*  and things like that that's something i'm very very interested in but you can't just appeal to
*  the second law of thermodynamics the second law is just like the dumbest simplest thing in this
*  context you need to think beyond that and it's not clear what the rules beyond that are so these are
*  open research problems i would say nalita s says as a theoretical physicist is there a roadmap as
*  to how you creatively come up with new theories that is being followed by all theoretical physicists
*  or does every theoretical physicist build their own roadmap into new territory like individualized
*  how does that mind-blowing creative process take off i think it's closer to everyone as an
*  individual i mean in fact if you think about the training of a theoretical physicist right you know
*  you go to undergraduate you take some classes you do a bunch of problem sets you go to graduate
*  school you have an advisor you take some more classes but mostly now you're trying to do
*  research and get papers written and so forth but there's no class you take about how to be creative
*  how to come up with new theories i always think back to zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance
*  which among other things it's a long book but there's a lot in there about the philosophy of
*  science and one point in there about the philosophy of science is the bacconian scientific method
*  francis bacon back in the day trying to explain how science works he says you know formulate a
*  hypothesis use the hypothesis to make predictions test the predictions right and persig robber
*  persig in zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance points out other people have also pointed out but
*  he did it very vividly step one is a doozy formulate a hypothesis what do you mean formulate a hypothesis
*  how many how do you do that who says the rules are formulating hypotheses there's potentially
*  an infinite number of them out there how do you choose which ones to formulate that's the creative
*  process and i don't think there's anything mystical or woo-woo about it but it's also not
*  axiomatized or algorithmatized we don't have a uniform agreed-upon way to formulate hypotheses
*  in fact it's not even a single step you know formulating hypotheses is a process it takes time you
*  sort of get a vague idea and you think about it you know what does it mean how can i write down
*  equations that would represent this how do i change it now maybe i have different equations maybe it
*  refers to something different all before you get to the point of saying okay let's make predictions
*  with it test them things like that and i think consistent with things i just said that different
*  people do it differently and that's good i think you need a bunch of very different kinds of
*  approaches you know it's probably overly simplistic but think of einstein he had a certain style
*  right and at the moment when his when his contributions were called for in the years
*  you know from 1900 to 1920 his style was perfect it was exactly what the moment called for but
*  then after that even though i will defend his understanding of quantum mechanics and physics
*  more generally he was einstein after all but his productivity waned and partly that's because he
*  was busy doing other things being a celebrity but partly because the the techniques he had used
*  before were no longer that useful for the moment of time that he was in i think this is very often
*  true in theoretical physics that it's a match between your personal style and what is out there
*  to be discovered and formulated right and the the latter you have no control over so all you can do
*  is the best you can do given your personal style and your strengths and your individual toolbox
*  and hopefully the world is ready for what you have to offer to it anonymous asks a priority question
*  starting i need to know if this makes any sense let's say we have an energy density that can be
*  described by the equation y equals one between zero and one so if we integrate y equals one from
*  zero to one presumably zero and one go from x equals zero to x equals one so we have two variables
*  we get the sum of x from zero to one which equals one it's just the area under the curve y equals one
*  between x equals zero and x equals one i agree with that that's all true now the question continues
*  let's change the energy density such that it follows the equation y equals sine x plus cosine x
*  the volume of the original total energy still equals one just how it is described has changed
*  so i'm pausing here there's a lot more i'm editing the question out you're welcome to go read it on
*  the patreon page but there's a lot of details here but sadly this there's a flub right there
*  there's a kind of an issue we have to confront y equals sine x plus cosine x does not have an
*  integral between zero and one that equals one maybe if it were sine squared x plus cosine squared x
*  it would equal one because sine squared x plus cosine squared x equals one at every point so it's
*  just the same curve that you've decomposed in some way but sine x plus cosine x does not have an
*  integral that equals one so mathematically that's a boo-boo and then there's some extra steps that
*  i'm skipping but it's along these lines of having some functions and integrating them and so forth
*  and then the question concludes by saying a proton can be defined as containing three quarks
*  specifically two up and two and one down properties of quark include up quark equals
*  charge of minus one third spin of one half etc so i will you know the priority question is you know
*  does this make any sense and my answer is no it does not make any sense i think but this i can do
*  more than that i hope i can i can be a little bit more constructive here when you're trying to think
*  about things like how quarks work how energy works things like that this is i mean maybe this
*  is not what you want to hear but a lot of people have thought about this already right and they're
*  not all dummies they've said really important things like the whole existence of up quarks and
*  down quarks etc and they have a way of thinking about them and i and i understand i don't really
*  know specifically about the author the anonymous author of this question but i know lots of
*  examples of people with similar ideas and almost never do they understand the basic mainstream view
*  of how quarks and gluons and things like that work the idea based on quantum field theory and
*  quantum chromodynamics etc and there's a desire or an aspiration maybe just to skip ahead
*  to some deep insight about particle physics and and quarks and leptons and things like that my
*  personal view which always could be wrong but my personal view is you're not ever going to skip the
*  hard part and get an interesting surprising truthful insight into how these things work
*  that's not because the conventional way of looking at it using quantum field theory and qcd etc
*  Feynman diagrams is necessarily right maybe there's a better way of doing it or a different way of
*  doing it i'm very open to that but i strongly believe the chances of finding a better way of
*  doing it without first completely understanding and conceptualizing the usual way of doing it
*  are negligible are close to zero because the knowledge that we have and it's not just you know
*  favoring the mainstream view it's that the knowledge we have is very very detailed and specific
*  you know when we talk about quarks and gluons to people who are not physicists it doesn't sound
*  that complicated you know how many there's few quarks and they're bound together etc etc
*  and you might get the impression that you can sort of think this through yourself and come up
*  with something new but the physicists are hiding stuff from you they're hiding entire books worth
*  of knowledge about fermions and propagators and Feynman integrals and fadai of pop-off ghosts and
*  dimensional regularization and effective and it goes on and on and on scaling behavior and things
*  like that asymptotic freedom you need to understand that stuff and so if you really want to
*  make a contribution if you really want to push our knowledge forward in some direction then
*  do the work do the work of understanding quantum field theory buy a book buy the textbook it's hard
*  i know that it's hard but you can do it anyone can do it any person who is you know more or less has
*  their average scale mental faculties around them if they really really wanted to they could learn
*  quantum field theory and qcd it's a big project it will take you a long time it'll be very frustrating
*  but you could do it i encourage you to do it if that's what you want to do and if it that's not
*  what you want to do then again i will repeat my personal opinion which is that the chances of
*  hitting on some new useful way to think about the physics of those systems of quarks and gluons
*  is very very small because we know a lot and you're starting at an enormous disadvantage
*  by not figuring out what it is we already know shameless maxwell says this question is inspired
*  by your advice to physics consultants on science fiction movies to treat the script as data if you
*  woke up tomorrow in a fantasy world peopled by orcs elves and dragons and everything seemed as
*  real to you as the world you currently inhabit would what would be your best guesses as to what
*  was happening would there be any room in your credence spread for something other than dream
*  slash hallucination and if so what might it be sure i think that the initial credence would be
*  very highly peaked on dream slash hallucination or you know being fooled right by being given some
*  drugs or something like that or whatever but of course what happens in these situations is that
*  it's not an all-or-nothing call in terms of what your credences are the credences that you should
*  have as as i say about being part of being a good bayesian is essentially no propositions should get
*  zero credence from the start it might be a sufficiently small credence that you don't sweat
*  it that you don't really worry about it in your everyday life but waking up tomorrow and being
*  surrounded by orcs and elves is not my everyday life so i would have to start thinking about the
*  wilder regions of proposition space and yeah you know the possibility that there's a multiverse
*  and somehow my conscious perceptions got moved from a world of people and cats and dogs to a
*  world of dragons and elves would be non-zero right or maybe that's the true world all along and i've
*  been dreaming about this mundane world of podcasts and social media and what have you so i don't know
*  what my actual credences would be but i absolutely would be increasing over time my credence in
*  something that i would now consider to be incredibly dramatic and unlikely philip malinowski says i
*  don't want to get you in hot water sorry i don't want to get you in hot water but i'm curious
*  where do you stand on letting your cats roam free outdoors on the one hand it's good to let the cats
*  be cats but on the other there are they are incredible killing machines and may kill a few
*  hundred animals a year i think that's true but i think that's not the reason why i don't do it so
*  we do not let our cats roam free outdoors i think that's a very highly context specific question if
*  i lived on a farm in the middle of nowhere or just in a cabin in the woods then maybe i would let the
*  outdoors but even then i would have some concerns about it because domestic cats are as the name
*  says domesticated you know they're not attuned they're not selected for a successful life outdoors
*  so yes they will kill a lot of birds and squirrels and mice and things like that and they will also
*  be very vulnerable to being killed by coyotes or wolves or or dogs for that matter or or just
*  having an accident so all that is part of the cycle of life like i don't mind that i don't mind
*  that cats kill animals i don't mind that cats are killed by other animals we're all going to die
*  someday that is not the thing to mind the thing that i mind is that i have a personal connection
*  to certain cats my cats and i want them to remain safe so i personally would like my cats to just
*  stay indoors especially because i do not live in the country i live literally in the city of
*  baltimore not too far away from highways and certainly right next to all sorts of streets
*  and and what have you that we actually you know i live in a part of baltimore that it's right next
*  to the johns hopkins campus but it's kind of leafy it's kind of there's a lot of trees and things
*  like that and the kind of wild and a kind of a lot of wildlife we've certainly seen both foxes and deer
*  in you know walking by our house okay so there's a little bit of a wild life out there certainly
*  squirrels and birds all over the place so the cats would be happy out there when they notice
*  the squirrels and birds may be less happy when they notice the foxes and falcons also we have a
*  couple of falcons nearby so it's kind of weird to live in a city and have all this nature around you
*  but but so be it i grew up in the suburbs and we had cats and they were all outdoor cats and and
*  guess what their life expectancy is much shorter i never had a cat die of natural causes when i was
*  growing up but you know well one got leukemia i guess but i guess that i guess that's a natural
*  cause but usually you know being hit by a car is how the cats die so it just makes sense to me that
*  if you are entering into this particular relationship where you take care of the cat and
*  have responsibility for it keeping it indoors is a much more sensible thing
*  oh a or however one pronounces owe says when eternalists say that every moment of time is
*  equally real how does that intersect with relativity where there is no such thing as
*  simultaneity and the moments of time for one observer are not consistent with other observers
*  on different paths that's perfectly fair question typically relativity and eternalism go very
*  comfortably together in fact one argument against presentism presentism is the leading alternative
*  to eternalism so a presentist rather than saying that every moment of time is equally real would
*  say that only the now is real right now is real in the past and future are just predictions and
*  memories that is what is very hard to reconcile with relativity because people don't agree on what
*  now means once you extend yourself from one point in space to other points in space so presentism
*  and relativity are not happy with each other certain people manage to nevertheless you know
*  figure out ways to believe both at the same time but eternalism and relativity are generally taken
*  to be 100 compatible except that the way that we say what eternalism means needs to be just a little
*  bit more carefully said so it's true that eternalism is often explained as every moment of time is
*  equally real really what you should say is every event in space time is equally real it's not that
*  there is some preferred way of slicing space time into moments of time that is a perfectly
*  legitimate critique of the way that we talk about eternalism benjamin barbrell says i learned
*  listening to your podcasts and videos that a black hole has a very large entropy if entropy still
*  means in this context the number of microstates corresponding to a different a given macrostate
*  i don't understand the nature of these microstates in the case of a black hole it sounds incompatible
*  with the statement that a black hole has no hair i feel like if a black hole had many microstates
*  it would lead to a resolution of the information paradox since the state of another system thrown
*  in the black hole would just end up encoded in those degrees of freedom good is a very good
*  question it does entropy still does in this context mean the number of microstates corresponding
*  to a given macrostate but you know let's think carefully about what that means and it's subtle
*  and we also have to remember something we said much earlier in the ama that in quantum mechanics
*  the way that we talk about mixtures of states is a little bit different okay so think about a box
*  of gas that has a lot of entropy it has a lot of microstates that look that way there are a lot of
*  ways of arranging the atoms and molecules in positions and in velocities that have the same
*  general you know density and pressure and temperature and things like that but also a
*  box of gas has no hair right macroscopically the box of gas is going to look exactly the same
*  as a different box of gas with the same temperature and pressure even in a different microstate
*  so quantum mechanically that becomes even more vivid the fact that you can have no hair and yet
*  you have a lot of microstates because you have a certain combination of those microstates that is
*  the thermal equilibrium combination that is a combination of many many states and therefore it
*  has high entropy but it's a particular exact combination of those many many states so it's
*  not like a classical statistical combination of things where there's literally different
*  kinds of microstates and you there sorry i should say where there literally is a microstate that is
*  the real one and you just don't know it right in the quantum case it truly is a mixture of many
*  different microstates in a definite combination and that's what the black hole would be like so a black
*  hole purportedly is a thermal mixture of a large number of very specific quantum states in a very
*  specific arrangement now you are right to wonder what those microstates are because nobody knows
*  that's a big part of the puzzle of quantum gravity the cosmic no hair theorem is exactly
*  the thing that made people kind of wonder about this how can a black hole have so much entropy
*  if all black holes are the same if they have the same mass and charge and spin but that's
*  that's mixing up a classical way of talking the cosmic no hair theorem with a quantum way of
*  talking the entropy we hope the resolution is that quantum mechanically there is a large set of
*  microstates we don't know what they are we did have andy strominger on the podcast a while back
*  and andy and kumran bafa looked at this for a very very simple kind of black hole a highly
*  supersymmetric black hole in very special circumstances and in string theory with d brains
*  they could actually identify the microstates that is much harder to do in the general real world
*  situation so the short answer is we don't know but i can say that even if there are that many
*  microstates it does not by itself resolve the information paradox because there is the extra
*  question of where the information is the information paradox is not just we don't have enough room to
*  put the information in the black hole the information paradox is we need to get it out
*  in the hawking radiation so if i have a book and i throw it into the black hole if it goes into the
*  middle of the black hole and then in the future it will hit the singularity how do i get that
*  information out into the radiation even though the event horizon might be very far away from where
*  the book is right that's an important part of the black hole information puzzle pete faulkner says
*  i've heard you and others state that microscopic black holes are a possible contender is the dark
*  matter doesn't hawking radiation suggest that any such black holes would have radiated away
*  quickly or is the suggestion that they are somehow being constantly created
*  no the suggestion is just that you have to run the numbers you know like for many questions like this
*  you can't just use words you gotta kind of think about the numbers it is true that a sufficiently
*  small black hole will evaporate away in a time scale less than the age of the universe but a
*  larger black hole would take longer than that to radiate away so you gotta sit down and ask yourself
*  how massive does the black hole need to be for its lifetime to be longer than the current age of the
*  universe and i actually don't know what the answer is but the answer is big but not that big it doesn't
*  need to be like the mass of the sun if you have a black hole the mass of the sun its lifespan is
*  going to be way way longer than the than the age of the universe today so you can have black holes
*  that are quite a bit smaller than the sun that are truly microscopic in some sense and yet
*  have not yet evaporated away in the age of the universe from hawking radiation
*  rad Antonov says if the tension between the measured magnetic dipole moment of the muon
*  and its theoretical value is a sign of new physics should we expect to see deviations in other
*  precision measurements of electromagnetic properties for example would there be hints of it
*  in electric dipole moment studies of neutrons or electrons absolutely yes there should be but again
*  you got to run the numbers you know you can't just say well it's a different thing go measure it right
*  some things are easier to measure than others the thing about the muon is it's heavier than the
*  electron so that means that it's coupling to other particles especially the higgs and so forth is a
*  little bit stronger and therefore and you know just heavier particles more generally therefore
*  new physics effects might very naturally show up more readily in a muon than in an electron electron
*  is kind of shielded from effects of heavier particles just because its mass is lower
*  neutrons on the other hand they are heavier but they're a mess because there's you know lots of
*  quarks going on inside it's harder to make the predictions for what they should be so a muon is
*  sort of at a sweet spot where it's heavy enough that maybe there's new physics there it is simple
*  enough that you can actually calculate what you expect to observe even given that by the way it's
*  not easy to make that calculation because part of that calculation is that there are strongly
*  interacting particles that are virtual particles that will contribute to things like the magnetic
*  dipole moment of the muon that's why you know there's different theoretical calculations that
*  don't agree with each other which is probably the reason why that's probably the reconciliation of
*  the modern muon electric dipole moment issue it's probably not that there's really new physics it's
*  probably just that the calculations are hard and we haven't done them correctly i say that's probably
*  true it might not be true and hopefully it's not fingers crossed that it's really new physics but
*  there's a simple non-new physics explanation on the table here namely that the calculations are not
*  good yet eric wonlick says you've been tasked with coming up with a video game idea that heavily
*  utilizes a concept from physics that is normally difficult for people to visualize because it is
*  not part of our everyday life for example four-dimensional space what concept do you choose
*  this is going to be a very boring answer but i choose four-dimensional space i think that's
*  a great thing this is like i've mentioned this before that either in video games or even even
*  more obviously in some truly immersive vr experience i'm very curious as to whether you
*  could train people to think in terms of four-dimensional space to sort of visualize
*  it to move around there's nothing in the laws of physics that say i can't visualize being in
*  four-dimensional space but there is a lot in biology and and evolution that has trained me
*  not to do that so can video games get around it i think that's a very interesting question
*  sandro stuckey says what would you say is the most important difference between
*  david wallace's explanation of the borne rule in many worlds and your own i don't think there's
*  any important difference i mean they're stylistically very different but just for those
*  who don't know i wrote a paper with charles siebins on deriving the borne rule in many worlds
*  a few years ago david wallace and before him david deutsch proposed a different way of deriving
*  the borne rule in many worlds there are there have been other options i do think that you know the
*  the two davids david deutsch and david wallace their derivation is sort of what is now the standard
*  one in foundations of physics circles and i'd like to think i believe it is true but one's personal
*  vantage point is always biased i think that chip siebins and my way of thinking about it is in
*  second place in terms of how much attention that it gets and the reason why we're in second place
*  even though there's been many other options put on the table is it's always really hard
*  at the boundaries of physics and philosophy to correctly construct an argument for a conclusion
*  that you already know right you know that what you want is the probability of measuring something
*  in quantum mechanics is the wave function squared so it's really easy to get the right answer for
*  the wrong reasons to make some simple assumption that you know seems natural to you but really
*  isn't that helps you get the right answer so in the field there's a lot of feeling that
*  purported derivations of the bourne rule are cheating because they assume something that
*  gives them the answer rather than actually adding it and i don't think that our solution actually
*  does that although opinions might differ the language that is used in the david wallace david
*  deutsch approach is completely different than the language that chip and i use which is also our
*  ideas based on suggestions by lev videman and others in the deutsch wallace argument you think
*  about what rational observers would do you use decision theory and use basic features of quantum
*  mechanics to argue that rational observers trying to you know maximize their utility or whatever
*  should act as if they are going to observe bourne rule probabilities in the many worlds
*  interpretation whereas what chip and i say is there are conditions of self-locating uncertainty
*  like so we don't use words about decision theory etc we say when the wave function branches you
*  don't know which branch you're on therefore you need to assign credences to being on one branch
*  or another and then we argue that the only sensible way to do that is to use the bourne rule so they
*  sound very different but precisely as there are many wrong ways to get the right answer there might
*  also very well be equivalent right ways of getting the right answer right when you have a
*  mathematical theorem and you want to prove it it's not like there's one correct proof and all the
*  others are incorrect we're very happy we said this in the original paper we're very happy to be
*  compatible with other ways of deriving the bourne rule we're not trying to displace them or supplant
*  them we're just trying to offer a different angle on it what i like about our way of doing it is
*  that to me it truly addresses in more or less incontrovertible ways the basic question of why
*  there are probabilities at all so the deutsch wallace approach says you know given that there
*  are probabilities of some sort i might not know what they are but i'm going to try to be rational
*  and assign them in a certain way it doesn't quite tell you why there are probabilities in the first
*  place but we are crystal clear about why there are probabilities there will be a moment in time
*  when you don't know what branch of the wave function you're on and as a good basian there's
*  an epistemic credence that you should be attaching to being on one branch or the other if you don't
*  like our way of deriving the bourne rule then that's the the part you have to attack and people
*  have attacked it people you know like david albert will say no i don't need to apply credences in
*  that situation i can just feign ignorance i can just say i don't know what branch i'm on full stop
*  i think that's not a good way to do science i don't think we do that in any other areas of science
*  so i don't think that's that quite works that's quite valid but anyway i don't think that there's
*  an incompatibility between the two ways of doing it you know the the deutsch wallace approach can
*  be criticized on precisely the grounds that they're making assumptions that might not apply in
*  particular there are questions about how you value things that are going on elsewhere in particular
*  other branches of the wave function that's there's some version of saying that what matters to you is
*  what matters is what happens on your branch not what happens on other branches and if you if you
*  don't buy that assumption then you can undermine the whole game i think that you know chip in my
*  self-locating uncertainty derivation also has assumptions that you can call into question so
*  you know at some point i i do think that having sat through many discussions about this
*  the question is not why is it the wave function squared right that's not the question anyone is
*  debating so when we say debate or derive the born rule that's a little bit misleading in terms of
*  what's actually going on what really is going on is why is a deterministic theory having probabilities
*  show up at all once you have probabilities in there and you admit that you should try your best
*  to assign probabilities in some sensible rational way it's obviously the born rule the born rule is
*  just obviously what works that's not where the controversy lies the controversy is i would argue
*  a mostly entirely philosophical one about where the probabilities come from where the idea of
*  probability comes from at all matt grinder says i'm hoping you can clarify an issue i have with the
*  arrow of time and the increase of entropy suppose the universe ends in a heat death and the
*  hypothetical observer would not now perceive an arrow of time because of the way particles now
*  interact do physicists mean to imply that this would mean that time has stopped doing what it
*  has been doing for billions of years namely going forward so there's a couple things i got to like
*  undo the question here there are no observers in the heat depth of the universe to be an observer
*  requires a departure from equilibrium so you can't say i'm in the heat death situation and
*  a hypothetical observer sees this or that there literally are no hypothetical observers by
*  construction okay but we can take the god's eye view and say like what would the world be like
*  and in that case i would again undo the question about time going forward that's not what time does
*  time does not go forward any more than on the real number line the numbers go forward there's
*  just an infinite number of numbers there's the number minus one there's the number plus square
*  root of two all these numbers exist on the real number line in this way of thinking about time
*  the same thing is true with time it's not that time goes forward it's that individual people
*  in the part of the universe's history where there is disequilibrium in a strong arrow of time
*  perceive time in a certain way they perceive a passage of time because they have a memory of
*  the past and predictions about the future so the physics of time is completely unchanged once you
*  enter the heat death part of the history of the universe but the physics of observers is changed
*  quite dramatically namely there are no observers and there's no impression that time is going
*  forward two more questions left here in the ama herbert berkowitz says how do fundamental particles
*  get rather odd names like strange and charm do the naming rights go to the discoverer have there been
*  fights over who gets the naming rights and who in the end makes the name official yeah it's a mess
*  in astronomy things are actually much more systematic there are committees of the international
*  astronomical union the iau that lay down rules for naming astronomical objects and things like that
*  similar like to the committees that decided that pluto wasn't a planet anymore there's a lot of
*  committees in astronomy but there's also a lot more celestial objects than there are elementary
*  particles so for elementary particles they just kind of grow organically in particular for both
*  strange and charm they had kind of long interesting histories the idea of strangeness
*  as a conserved quantity came about before the idea that there was a quark called the strange quark
*  it came about before we knew about quarks likewise for charm that was a hypothetical idea put forward
*  by bjorkane and clashow i believe there was also the gym mechanism so that's clashow eliopolis and
*  mayani maybe they said it first i forget who said it first but there was a bunch of theorists
*  basically saying look we can explain some things if you give us a fourth quark called the charm
*  we're going to call it the charm quark because you know they were having fun and that turned out to
*  be right so since they turned out to be right people you know went along with it other cases
*  it's not so clear for quarks they were independently suggested by gelman and swig george swig and gelman
*  suggested calling them quarks swig suggested calling them aces and gelman one he was more
*  famous and it was kind of a good name other cases still not adjudicated there's the famous j slash
*  psi particle which was i'm going to get the names wrong of who did it i believe that it was sam ting
*  who was one of the leaders of the collaboration who found that particle and it's a composite
*  particle it's a meson and maybe burton richter was the other one at slack who also discovered it
*  at the spear experiment and so richter and the slack people named it the psi particle psi psi
*  is supposed to be like close to spear which was the name of the experiment that they were doing
*  and the j was sam ting's way of trying to name it after himself because he wanted to call it t
*  for ting but you're not allowed to do that so a j is very close orthographically to a t so he named
*  it that and they more or less did it at the same time and they were both equally famous and so
*  nobody won so to this day it is called the j slash psi particle what can you do there you go there's
*  no systematic way of figuring it out final question simon carter says after picking einstein's
*  equation as the main subject to present from your first book have you decided what you'll be
*  presenting for the second book so there's two different ways to interpret this question i
*  think i know the right way but just so everyone is on the same track the books in question here are
*  the biggest ideas in the universe series volume one was space time and motion and did all classical
*  physics volume two is quanta and fields and does quantum mechanics and quantum field theory
*  in both books i do many topics right there is no one main topic so just so that is perfectly clear
*  that would be a misunderstanding of the question i think what simon is getting at is when you write
*  a book you go around giving talks right you go on a book tour the book tour thing is overrated or
*  overblown it's not like there's literally a tour it's just that you know you you arrange some
*  public talks to give and so i did that for the first book i will do that for the second book
*  the talk that i gave to advertise the first book was einstein's equation the secrets of einstein's
*  equation so what that meant is over the course of an hour i go through the math i don't assume that
*  you know any calculus or anything like that but i give you the basics of differential geometry and
*  gravity and tensors and lead you up to einstein's equation in all of its glory and then show you
*  the short shield solution etc and you can find versions of it online i just recently did a version
*  at the royal institute in london royal institution so i don't know if that's up yet but it should be
*  soon and there's other versions floating around so yes when book two comes out when quantum field
*  comes out when which will be sometime in the spring i will need to have a talk to give about it and i'm
*  not sure what i will give it's not going to be about quantum mechanics specifically i've done that
*  right plenty of talks i've given about that i really want to concentrate on the quantum field
*  theory side of things but i don't know whether i want to like how technical i want to make it it's
*  a popular talk so in terms of what the audience is it's a popular audience and that's what i want
*  to aim at but one way to do it would be to talk about feinman diagrams and renormalization and
*  effective field theory i think effective field theory is probably the most important idea that
*  physicists have that we don't tell non-physicists about so that would be a very exciting thing to
*  talk about another angle to take would be to talk about phases and gauge theories right the coulomb
*  phase the higgs phase the confinement phase how one underlying idea of gauge symmetry can lead to
*  very different behavior in very different circumstances that would be fun to talk about
*  i kind of did talk about things related to that back when i was talking about the higgs boson in
*  the big in the particle of the end of the universe book so even though it's an important set of
*  topics maybe it's not the obvious one or i could you know give the audience a break at the end of
*  the book i take all that we've learned about feinman diagrams and decays and so forth and i
*  explain why the ingredients of the universe are what they are why we are made of protons and
*  neutrons and electrons held together by electromagnetism and gravity it's a very simple
*  set of ingredients right three kinds of particles protons neutrons electrons two forces electromagnetism
*  and gravity that explains an enormous amount of stuff it's not quite everything even our everyday
*  life it doesn't explain nuclear fusion and things like that how why stars shine but still you know
*  you and me and our chemistry and our biology are completely explained by that why are those the
*  particles that survive once heavier particles decay away why do you still have neutrons hanging
*  around even though neutrons do decay by themselves so i mean that's kind of like a fun thing why
*  what is it where does the scale of things come from why are atoms the size that they are you know
*  there's a whole bunch of things that are a little bit less conceptually abstract than talking about
*  ultraviolet cutoffs in the renormalization group right so that's another possibility i don't know
*  put your suggestions in in the comment section here all you patreon listeners and i will take
*  them into consideration we'll see one way or the other it'll be fun i hope everyone buys the book
*  i hope everyone has enjoyed this ama thanks as always for your support for mindscape i
*  really appreciate it see you next month bye bye
