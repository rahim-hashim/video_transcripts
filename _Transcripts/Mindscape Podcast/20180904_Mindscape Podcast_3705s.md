Jazz occupies a special place in the American cultural landscape. It's played in elegant concert halls and run-down bars, and can feature esoteric harmonic experimentation or good old-fashioned foot-stomping swing. Nobody embodies the scope of modern jazz better than Wynton Marsalis. As a trumpet player, bandleader, composer, educator, and ambassador for the music, he has worked tirelessly to keep jazz vibrant and alive. In this bouncy conversation, we talk about various kinds of music, how they might relate to physics, and some of the greater challenges facing the United States today.

 (This and the next few podcasts were recorded on the road with headset microphones, and the sound quality isn't quite as good, sorry about that.)

 Hailing from an accomplished New Orleans family, Wynton Marsalis was marked as a prodigy from a young age. He played locally before moving to New York and attend Julliard, and played and recorded with artists such as Art Blakey and Herbie Hancock. He has recorded numerous albums as a leader of small ensembles, big bands, and as a soloist with symphony orchestras. He is a multiple-time Grammy winner and the first to win in both jazz and classical categories in the same year, and in 1997 his oratorio Blood on the Fields was the first non-classical work to win the Pulitzer Prize for music. Marsalis founded and continues to lead Jazz at Lincoln Center, which is in residence at Lincoln Center along with such organizations as the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera, and the New York City Ballet. He has won the National Medal of the Arts and the National Humanities Medal, along with numerous other awards and honorary degrees.

# Episode 12: Wynton Marsalis on Jazz, Time, and America
**Mindscape Podcast:** [September 04, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDNmfj21yzI)
*  Hello everybody and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. And
*  I don't want to waste your time with banter today because we have a very special guest.
*  We're very happy to have Wynton Marsalis join us on the podcast. If you are in any sense
*  a jazz fan, Wynton Marsalis is the proverbial guy who needs no introduction. He's been
*  acclaimed as a trumpet player, of course, but also as a composer, a bandleader, and
*  also an educator and an ambassador for jazz music worldwide. He's the winner of multiple
*  Grammy Awards. He was the first jazz musician, indeed the first non-classical musician, to
*  win a Pulitzer Prize, countless honorary degrees, national awards, etc. He's recorded
*  a huge number of albums as a leader of small ensembles, big bands, and in collaboration
*  with a diverse group of people from Willie Nelson to Eric Clapton to traditional musicians
*  around the world. He's also the founder and leader of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which joins
*  things like the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic in residence at Lincoln
*  Center. Not only that, but he is a classical musician who both composes and plays trumpet
*  with symphony orchestras. He won a Grammy for that too. So you get the point. Wynton
*  Marsalis is arguably the most important figure alive in jazz today and certainly enormously
*  influential in how we think about music. He and I got to meet at a nice event called
*  Kent Presents. This is an ideas festival in Connecticut sponsored by Ben and Donna Rosen.
*  And we hit it off immediately. He's a very curious guy. He wanted to know about physics
*  and things like that. I wanted to know about jazz. So we have a wide ranging bouncy conversation.
*  And if you don't like jazz, if you've never heard of Wynton Marsalis, no problem. I would
*  still recommend listening to this episode. This is not one of those conversations where
*  we just sort of name drop our favorite musicians or artists from the past or from the present.
*  Wynton Marsalis is an opinionated guy. He always has been. That's one of his trademarks
*  all along. And he gives us some of his opinions, not just about music, but about the state
*  of the world, the state of the country, the state of education in the United States. We
*  talk about physics. We talk about time and quantum mechanics. This is your chance to
*  spend an hour with a brilliant creative person with an open, fertile mind. We had a great
*  time and I hope you will too. So let's go.
*  Wynton Marsalis, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  All right. It's such a pleasure, Sean. Thank you.
*  So I understand that your first paying gig was as a funk musician. Is that right?
*  That's right. That's right.
*  This is in the 1970s. This is the bell bottoms, the big hair, the whole bit.
*  That's right. Early in that year we played an elementary school dance.
*  An elementary school dance. All right. You recompense for this? You get paid?
*  We got paid $100. It was five of us. It was $20 a person.
*  And what were you playing?
*  We played just stuff that was on the radio at that time. But we had learned maybe 15
*  songs or 20 songs or 20 songs, three minutes. It was a dance, three hours. So after we played
*  the 20 songs we were like, okay, that's it. And everybody was like, hey, we still have
*  two more hours to go. So we just played those songs in a loop.
*  Playing the dance.
*  We played in a loop over and over again. So we always laugh about that job.
*  But there is something special about jazz, right? I mean, what in your mind is what makes
*  jazz special?
*  I think that the three fundamentals of the music. Improvisation to some type of grid.
*  You can improvise, but you have some restraint.
*  Right.
*  The swing, which means you're improvising with other people. And there are things that
*  govern how you all will interact with each other. But those things, you also choose them.
*  So if you're a heavy swinger, you choose to be in the groove. And you choose to give some
*  points over to people. If you're not, you don't.
*  And then the blues, which is an optimism in spite of all evidence to the contrary.
*  Aha. So explain that.
*  It's like in the words of a blues. I went down to the railroad, put my head on the track.
*  I went down to the railroad, put my head on the track. When that train came along, I snatched
*  my fool head back.
*  So there's something in there. So the blues is sort of about living through life, right?
*  Not giving up.
*  Living is about an optimism that's not naive.
*  Right. And to say more about swing in particular, because I've had talks with musician friends.
*  I'm not a musician myself. I appreciate the music very much. But swing is, there's other
*  genres of music that improvise. The blues is a genre all by itself. But swing is something
*  that is uniquely jazz.
*  It's relational. And it's quantifiable. It's the reconciliation of opposites. So if you
*  look at swing as a concept, whatever it takes for you to get from the I consciousness to
*  the we consciousness is swinging. Now when you embrace that in such a way that you're
*  in a groove and you make all these little adjustments that are required to make, to
*  not just endure another person or to tolerate them, but you embrace them, then you're swinging.
*  So when you look at it as a concept, it is a six rhythm, one, two, three, four, five,
*  six, against a four rhythm. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Now on the micro
*  level where it shows up is if you start to play fast, so if you go, and you go, you can't
*  go, you're shuffling. So that's a two and a three also. So instead of it being, it's
*  difficult to kind of negotiate the feeling of that odd and even at the same time. The
*  swing is the bass, which is the lowest pitch played in four on every beat matched with
*  the drums. This in six, which the cymbal is the highest pitch and the pitch that you can
*  hear the most. So you have all these extremes.
*  It sounds like the drummer has a tough job.
*  The drummer has a tough job. He's the president. He can just choose to just bowl everybody
*  over, but great drummers, they'll say a great drummer is kind. They use their power very
*  intelligently and sparingly.
*  It sounds like it's about, I mean so much music is about tension in some sense, right?
*  I mean it's a competition between what you expect, the sort of natural easy rhythm pattern
*  versus a little bit of what doesn't quite belong that drives you forward, right?
*  Right. I'm interested in how you would see that in relation to some concepts that you
*  work on where you have opposite things that come together and you say, man, these two
*  things are together. I never would have thought these things come together.
*  Yeah, it's all over the place. I mean physics, science, right, is driven by what we don't
*  understand. We try to leap into the places that we don't yet understand. Professional
*  scientists don't spend their time doing homework problems that the college students do. So
*  what is the way to make progress? It's to pinpoint two things that you both think are
*  true but they don't agree with each other, right? That's where all progress comes from.
*  So the big one right now in physics is we have quantum mechanics and we have gravity
*  and they don't play well together and their intention, right? We're trying to figure out
*  is one of them better, is one of them more fundamental or is it we've got to start all
*  over again? It's sort of the source of creativity a little bit, right? And in jazz it seems
*  to be much about creativity.
*  Yes, about creativity at the point of impact. I was also interested in your comments about
*  time because in jazz you live in the future. You progress from the future to the past.
*  That's like life. You're in the future but you're going into the past. You're moving
*  forward into the past. You're not moving forward into the future.
*  Now you're going to have to break that down for me a little bit.
*  Okay, you are in the future. Now the future is past. So we're all in the future. We're
*  in that. Then we pass through the present into our cognizance of that present which
*  is then past. So jazz is a mastery of a moment of presentness. So the future becomes what
*  you think may perhaps happen with the form in a given space and time. And the challenge
*  of jazz when you're actually playing it is how can I deal with it with all of the entropic
*  moments of this present and give it organization and logic and give it organization and logic
*  and form with a group of other people who have no idea what they're going to play until
*  they play it.
*  Well, I wanted to ask you about this. So there's the individual improvising and there's the
*  group. Let's just do the individual first. I think that's probably easier to wrap our
*  brains around, right? I mean, do you go into an improvisation to a solo with a plan or
*  is it literally right there what you're feeling?
*  I never do that. Every person is different. I like to be present so I don't have a plan.
*  My one plan is to take thematic material and develop it in some type of interesting way.
*  To me.
*  And is that the chords or the melody?
*  The chords are the playing field. It's like a football field.
*  The arena.
*  That's the arena. So you know what a football field is. The sidelines, the harmonies progress
*  in a certain way and there's some alterations but they are the harmonies. And they're laid
*  out in time. So like you look at a clock, it uses 12 numbers and you know where you
*  are. When you look at those hands, you know that's how harmonic form is. You know where
*  you are by the progression of harmonies.
*  Where you have to get back to.
*  You know when you get back to the top. But the top may be different but the harmony is
*  basically the same. But it's because chords have different root notes and there's also
*  a way to substitute chords. It's kind of like the directions to your home. You give me 50
*  sets of directions that incorporate different streets. And the general direction will be
*  all the different ways you can express an equation with different numbers. We're playing
*  on that playing field. So now we know that. Then we have to be in time. And the concept
*  of time in jazz is probably the most physics related. Because you're not in time like 1,
*  2, 3, 4 time. You know what we call swing time. And it's not being on time. It's being
*  in time. And that time is like a wave. Because everybody is tugging and pulling at it.
*  Right. Yeah. When you mentioned how important it is in physics, that's exactly right. Like
*  so much of physics is about waves and the resonance, the beating together and the interference
*  when they're going in different directions. Right. I'm more interested in what does the
*  degree of interference determine something about the wave or does the wave just continue
*  the way it is? Yeah. It can be either way. Right. So I think that physicists love to
*  start with the simplest thing first. Right. So the simplest thing is yeah the waves, if
*  you have two different waves and they're coming into the same place, they do their
*  own individual thing and then they keep going. And at that moment they might interfere or
*  constructively interfere, which is a sort of contradiction in terms, but it means they
*  add up together. Right. So we teach our students that first. And then the next thing we teach
*  is well what if these waves are talking to each other? Right. What if they interact with
*  each other? And these days we think our best theories of the world are quantum field theories
*  where the world is this collection of fields pervading all of space. And what we think
*  of as particles are vibrations in these fields. Right. And if you make a new particle that's
*  because you, in fact the analogy I use is if someone's playing a piano and there's another
*  piano in the room, the other piano starts humming a little bit. Right. That's how you
*  create new particles in particle physics. Kind of sympathetic vibration. Exactly that.
*  That's right. Yeah. That's exactly what jazz is like. A lot of times you can anticipate
*  what somebody is going to play. You can feel them a certain way. And sometimes they do
*  the opposite and that's okay too. Yeah. It's really like super conversation. No wrong notes,
*  right? Well, yeah. You know there are actually no wrong notes. They're only awkward moments
*  and non-resolutions and lack of confidence. You have to hear your way out of problems.
*  It's kind of like you're having a conversation and somebody is dealing with an awkward kind
*  of, yeah. But it's fascinating when you get a lot of people improvising who really can
*  play how they all hear and interpret the moments because it's successive moments of crisis.
*  There's always a crisis. Every moment is a crisis. And when the band stops, it's a break
*  and only you play, then it's really a crisis for you because you have to maintain the momentum
*  and the identity. Can't lean on everybody else. No, they're gone. Then they come back
*  in. So our thing is really about mastery of time. And the mastery of time is an individual
*  thing on one level, but in the jazz sense and in the swing sense, it's mastery of the
*  fluctuations of time with other people. Right. Yeah. And that's where swing comes in. You're
*  pushing up and against the obvious regular beat. You have the obvious regular beat is
*  a constant that you all know. But the swing is all of you all's interpretation of that
*  constant and how you can negotiate that constant and make it feel good. And sometimes these
*  solos can get pretty long. You can go on for a long time. How much of it is conscious,
*  would you say? Could you even remember the solo that you played? No. You can't remember,
*  but it's conscious like when you speak, it's conscious. You weren't using notes when you
*  talked in your lecture the other day, but you knew what you were talking about. I knew
*  the general outline of what I was going to say, but I had a plan going in, right? Well,
*  the form gives us a plan. So when I say I don't have a plan, the form gives you some
*  type of plan. And then I tend to take things from the musicians I'm playing with. When
*  they play stuff, I play things. I think that in my solos, I try to really think about construction.
*  Okay. What do you mean by that? I mean, how am I going to get from this point by turning
*  phrases around or how am I going to make a cohesive and coherent statement? You're telling
*  a story. How am I going to tell that story? Beginning, middle, and end. So that you can
*  follow it. Right. And how can I get all these little subplots and interesting things and
*  change the emotions of different moments and add things? And it is usually in this group
*  context, right? And as impressed and overwhelmed as I am with a master improviser, I'm even
*  more impressed that people can do it together, right? And how much of it is, you know, I
*  see on the bandstand people looking at each other, like the players, and how much communication
*  is it? Is it planned out? Is it really just you sense it? No, there's so much communication.
*  And that's what I love the most about playing is playing with other people. There's so much
*  communication, like shifting beads, or you're ready to end your solo. Is that really the
*  chord you want to play? Where are we? Oh, okay. Are you going to play a riff there?
*  There's so much of it. It's like, it's so, and it's very intense. Right. It's like an
*  intense, an intense emotional and mind game with other people. And it's all benevolent.
*  Like none of it is, because the swing is a reference. And it makes you, if you want to
*  swing, it makes you have a constant that you all agree on. Yeah, okay. It's like kind of
*  what the Constitution is supposed to be. You have to agree on something. Something has to
*  have meaning in order for us to have a meaningful dialogue. And there has to be some arbiter,
*  something that we both are okay with. Otherwise it's just noise, right? Let's not sell this
*  to our kids. That's right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And I mean, jazz is, you mentioned in the,
*  we just, for the podcast listeners out there, we just got finished with some remarks that
*  Wynton made here on stage. And you also mentioned the, the Americanness of it, right? I mean,
*  there's something and for better, for worse, right? Mostly for better. But jazz is part of
*  America and America is part of jazz. Well, I don't, I don't think for worse, the worse is a part
*  of better. Yeah. Okay. You know, you can't, it's like what you were saying when you gave us the
*  examples of entropy. One, one is nothing, then there's some things, then it's, you don't have
*  one of all one thing. Right. If everything is too simple, nothing interesting has happened.
*  Right. And that's, that's the famous Shakespeare to be or not to be. Yes. Right. It's going to be
*  one of those or maybe. Right. Like, you know, and all the kind of greatest artists have that kind
*  of dichotomous unity. They understand. That's why Shakespearean villain is so great. Oh, yeah.
*  He understands there's something, there's something noble in this villain. There's a humanity in the
*  villain. And a kind of simplistic way of looking at the world does not work well for democracy.
*  And jazz is, it came from the most maligned group people that had been slaves, but they didn't play
*  jazz when they were in slavery. They played jazz when they became free. And freedom is something
*  that has not been guaranteed to people in the world throughout time. If you go throughout time,
*  most groups of people have been dominated or they have been beaten. It's not to be subjugated to
*  the will of a person or group of people is not something that's only about the United States of
*  America. Most of the greatest heroes that we celebrate are military heroes that defeated people
*  and engaged in absolute murder, concubinage and slavery. That's why they like to talk about it.
*  That's why they were conquering people. And America is a hope that we have to change. It's difficult
*  and it's challenging. And we at this moment appear to not be up to that challenge. But when we
*  actually understand what's going on in the world and that democracy and even the thought that there
*  is equality is not something that's guaranteed. Your side is not guaranteed to win. There's a lot of
*  power. And by that I don't mean the fear of another nation. I mean the fear of an ideology which says
*  to hell with these people, which is what has dominated the world most of the time and has even been
*  dominant in our country's leadership, if not its people.
*  But a democracy is a place where you can lose an election and give up power willingly, right?
*  You're supposed to. You're supposed to, yes. You're also supposed to agree on a set of principles.
*  Would you say that jazz is in some sense a democratic form of music compared to others?
*  Absolutely no question about it in every way. I could take you down the Constitution and the separation
*  of the powers and all of the things that are the foundation of what we do, the ability to amend the Constitution.
*  The Constitution being a very simple framed document that's shorter than every other state Constitution.
*  And the repetitiveness of the Constitution from the federal government to the state government to the
*  local government. But when you don't have an agreement on the humanity of other people, then you subvert the Constitution.
*  Yeah, and in some sense, I mean this is what liberal democracy is all about. I had a podcast about liberal
*  democracy, the idea, you don't have to agree with your fellow citizens about values necessarily.
*  You can disagree about fundamental things. But there has to be something shared, right?
*  There has to be something shared that you agree with and you base everything on that.
*  And a bunch of players up there improvising together have to be the same way, right?
*  And many times we are not. What has happened with our music, one person was solo all night.
*  Five people were solo forever. Monitors on the bandstand that are louder than the people who were playing, all with them in it.
*  The strongest on the bandstand dominating, the bass turns the amp up to 15.
*  And then it's very difficult to play the music. And then another thing that happens after that is slavery.
*  And the slavery becomes this system has too much freedom in it. Let me figure out how to repeat things over and over again
*  so that we do away with some of this freedom. And that's the direction we will go in.
*  If we check out the way systems are slowly beginning to dominate everything.
*  And our systems macro thinkers are very powerful.
*  We don't realize that when you play a system, a very intelligently designed system out to the furthest extreme of its efficiency,
*  many of these systems don't include people. It has to be something else.
*  Just the machine.
*  It's just the machine. We don't need you. Then after we don't need you, we don't want to see you.
*  And so you're saying we can think of jazz as a little bit of protest against this tendency.
*  What it's at its best, even in jazz, right? In any form of art, you can always denigrate into something where it's a great man with an ego.
*  A lot of it though. A lot of the tenants and the best of it, the recorded history of it.
*  And jazz is also not anti the machine. It's not we're against the machine. We're against the abuse of tools.
*  And we are for the basic principles of our way of government. And our music has a history that demonstrates that.
*  Duke Ellington's orchestra demonstrated that. Penny Goodman's orchestra demonstrated that.
*  Dave Brubeck's ensemble. John Coltrane. Art Blakey and the Jazz Mess. People after people. Charles Minkus.
*  And they were also able to express that and did express it. So it's not something we're speculating on.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And so what I mean, jazz has an interesting position in history in the United States and right now, right?
*  I mean, there's not a lot of radio stations out there that play primarily jazz.
*  I mean, you've been as influential as anybody in not just keeping jazz alive, but keeping it vibrant and making sure that people are educated about it.
*  I mean, how important is that to you?
*  It's very important for us to be educated about our country. We've stopped civics.
*  You know, we have to understand that for a democracy to work, we have to be rabid about education.
*  Right.
*  Rabid, not about propaganda, because I'm not a kind of left right person.
*  I laugh at all of that because for me, it's like it's like subterfuge.
*  It's like you and your friend start a fight in a store and another one of your friends is going for the cash register.
*  Now, all you do is get a black and white friend, call each other a name.
*  Everybody's looking at it. Yeah. That's all fake.
*  Like it's not people. People are making money and they're exploiting the one of the biggest problems we have.
*  And it happens in jazz is the greatest players have to sacrifice for lesser players like the great Art Blakey allowed me to learn on his bandstand.
*  I wasn't bringing that anything to him. He had to be willing to sacrifice for me to learn.
*  When you get the most educated class waging war on the uneducated class, man, you have a hard time.
*  You're not going to get the same thing that you get with the Ku Klux Klan or somebody shouting and calling people names.
*  You're going to get contracts. You get the subprime loan scandal.
*  You can get all the things that you see that are systems that play out on people who can't assess their position, their position in space.
*  I mean, were you I probably know the answer to this, but how much of this was in your brain when you were 12 years old and first learning to play the trumpet?
*  You know, a lot of it. Yeah, I didn't know it was about playing the trumpet.
*  But my mom and my daddy were very conscious because they're my father's jazz musician.
*  And just so everyone knows, you're from New Orleans.
*  From New Orleans.
*  You're a New Orleans guy.
*  And my mother was very conscious about reading and staying on top of stuff, being engaged.
*  My father was very conscious. So I would always just be around listening to all of them talk.
*  And I didn't understand, of course, what I understand now.
*  But I knew that you needed to know about the country. You needed to follow things.
*  You needed to be. And that was in a time of consciousness.
*  You know, I was a kid through the 60s. So people were conscious.
*  Yeah, it was something that was talked about.
*  Talked that the pop music was conscious.
*  Even it was just Stevie Wonder's music, Marvin Gaye's music, what's going on for just average kind of a citizen that's out there that doesn't have artists, father or mother.
*  They were still engaged in making things better and being a part of a larger thing.
*  We lost that momentum, of course, over time, because it's difficult to maintain that level of engagement with each other without being predatory.
*  We celebrate predators.
*  Well, it's natural to sort of devolve into conflict, right?
*  Like we try to talk to each other. We try to disagree.
*  Again, this is something that I hope the podcast helps to spread the idea we can disagree, still be friends, go out for the beer afterward.
*  But it becomes harder and harder, especially in a very shouty age that we live in.
*  A shouty ideological age that is not respectful of any fact.
*  It's also true. That is right.
*  There has to be some fact that we agree on.
*  We're in Louisiana. Okay, that's a fact. Let's just start with that.
*  And that's why I try to explain things in a human context.
*  Like the musicians I knew, whether I argued with them or not, when we talked to each other, we were talking about human things, not my philosophy about their style of music.
*  It was my mama is dying or, you know, my son told me the other day.
*  Can you believe that I always I had dyslexia and I was always ashamed?
*  You know, I mean, it's absolutely I mean, when you try to be a communicator of science, even though science is based on facts and you should all agree them.
*  If you really want to get things across, you have to be likable.
*  You have to relate it to people's interests, right?
*  You know, people care about what matters for their lives. That's not surprising at all.
*  But that's what you're wonderful at. Like I when I first talked to you, you're very approachable.
*  I started asking you about entanglement and will the universe just continue to expand?
*  Yeah. And you started to give me very concrete kind of breakdowns of what something was and the way that I can understand it.
*  And you're friendly. I think it matters, you know, and honestly, to give credit where credit is due.
*  My wife gets a lot of credit for this. I'm a scientist by training.
*  She's a writer by training, so she's helped me in the communication skills.
*  But so you went from this kid in a sort of household where all these ideas were talked about in a very musical household, obviously, playing all sorts of things.
*  Now you're the director of jazz at Lincoln Center. And that's a responsibility, right?
*  That's not I mean, how do you think of that role?
*  I mean, you're a musician. You play the trumpet. You're a composer. But then you're also an ambassador, right?
*  Yeah, I'm honored to be in that role.
*  You know, I mean, I love people. I like to talk about the music and to be a part of people's lives and to to recognize other people.
*  Jazz Lincoln Center is our our our basic tenets of what we do. We entertain, we educate and we advocate for jazz through performance, through education and through advocacy.
*  We try to bring people together around the music.
*  We have a very simple kind of down home type of welcome vibration. We have no generation gap.
*  Oh, is that true? OK, I was going to ask about that. Yeah.
*  We stress no generation gap, no segregation. And all of our music is modern. We're all separated in the kind of time periods.
*  We believe the music does have fundamentals. We don't believe everything that's a horn is jazz.
*  Yeah. But we're not against things that are not jazz. We just are in favor of jazz.
*  And we've been blessed to work with.
*  I mean, we've collaborated with so many musicians in different cultures and played with some of your favorites.
*  Man, you know, I could just tell you a couple of stories.
*  One is a great master drummer from Ghana, Yakub Adi. He passed away.
*  I did a piece called Congo Square with him.
*  Took me 10 years to write this piece. I used to play in rhythm.
*  I couldn't figure out because his style of music, they play in two times at once.
*  So I'm counting and doing all Western.
*  And then a kid who I taught when he was younger grew old enough. He started playing with an orchestra.
*  His name is Carlos Henriquez, and he's from the Afro Latin tradition. So he grew up playing on claves.
*  So we're close enough like he's really like my little brother. So he was always in my house.
*  I said, man, why is this sad? If we put it on, he started to interpret like kind of what the claves you're doing this.
*  This is where one is. This is what we need to do.
*  He could translate for me. So he translated for me.
*  And Yakub wants funny stories. He was playing a rhythm. He said, brother, this is a royal rhythm, a royal rhythm.
*  I said, it don't sound royal to me. I'm American. We don't have royalty.
*  And he said, that is why you will never play it correctly.
*  Well, he led you up to that. You jumped right in.
*  And Kurt Masur was the conductor of the New York Philharmonic.
*  He had grown up in Germany during the period of the Nazis.
*  And he asked me to write a piece for the Philharmonic.
*  And he said he wanted the piece to celebrate humanity and people coming together.
*  And he told me, I never forget, he said, you have no idea of how thin the veneer is and how it can be pulled off.
*  And people will cheerly the very opposite.
*  He said, and you be mindful of how fragile all of this is.
*  And when you write this music, be cognizant of the fragility and be strong in an indictment of those things that are against human beings.
*  Well, music speaks directly to our emotions, right? And that's for better or for worse.
*  It can excite us for the good things and it can be used as propaganda for the less good things.
*  I mean, what do you think about the state of jazz today, if that's not too grandiose a question?
*  Well, I think most of the young musicians are demoralized, mainly commercial music.
*  They're interested. It's like the state of our country.
*  We are consumed with a rampant commercialism and a materialism that is destroying our human connections.
*  It's out front. It's embarrassing. It's just kind of open corruption.
*  And we have to get on track. And we're a long way away.
*  It's not because of the president. He's of course a shining symbol of it, but it's not because of him.
*  It predates long before that.
*  And I don't like when it's reduced to him because it keeps us from addressing the issue.
*  There's deeper things going on. Much deeper. Much deeper. Much deeper.
*  And we have taught it to our kids. We've used them as a market.
*  They're now being sold to and exploited from a very young age. They can't defend themselves.
*  We're not defending them. And music is a large part of their exploitation.
*  Now, pornography is a fact of kids' lives. It leads them into their rituals of courtship and their development.
*  Of course, I'm from an older generation, so I don't understand all of the nuances of it.
*  The Tinder and everything.
*  But I mean, it's not even so much a specific thing. It's just how many acts you can see.
*  Right. Every generation lives in a different world.
*  Yeah, everybody says that, but it's like you're working on a heart attack till you have it.
*  And you tell somebody, man, you're going to have a heart attack. They say, I haven't had one.
*  You haven't had one. But there's going to come a point where the kind of descent you're going to reach,
*  there's a thought that because there's always misinformation and the conflation of fact,
*  and there's always a kind of alarmist, the past is better. You touched on that too.
*  I love one thing you said. I took my notes. I can get on my phone.
*  But you said there are more, the gist of it is that there are fewer plausible pasts than there are possible futures.
*  Exactly right. That's right.
*  That's what you said. So I love that.
*  That's right. Yeah.
*  So the tendency is to always think the past was so glorious. And I'm not coming from there at all.
*  Yeah. That'd be forward thinking.
*  Yeah, I'm just saying that we, kids are not a market.
*  Right.
*  And our celebration of the market and of money has damaged our sense of the primacy of humanity.
*  And that that should be first. It should be first in our education, left or right.
*  It's not from the right and it's not from the left. It's from all of it.
*  And it's starting to rot. And we got to wake up.
*  But it's tough. You got to earn a living if you want to be a professional musician.
*  Being a jazz musician is hard, right?
*  You know, let it be hard.
*  Yeah. You told the story about your father. Could you tell us that?
*  I grew up watching my father just struggle and not make money.
*  He was always playing for three and four people, five, eight people in a room.
*  And I just wondered over all these years, man, why do you keep doing this?
*  And he said, somebody's got to do this. Why?
*  You know, people need to be nobody's here. The people don't want this.
*  Like, why? Why? Is music has meaning? But to who? Nobody is in here.
*  It means something to me.
*  And sometimes you have to be the one to say the Constitution has meaning.
*  I am going to be civil and I'm not going to just let the fact that somebody's paying me some money affect my ideology.
*  The fact that we're our our somebody was given a tax break means that we should have policies that put people unjustly in jail.
*  And it's not just a problem of those people. We're all those people.
*  That kind of super consciousness. We don't have that type of leadership, not because of the president.
*  No, I get it. Yeah.
*  And in no way am I supporter of the president's agenda, social agenda. In no way.
*  You can't come from my background and support using people, Mexican people and, you know, Arabs and black people.
*  You can't support that coming from where I come from.
*  But once again, I don't want to pin that pin a national problem on a figure that is actually doing the bidding of a large part of the nation.
*  Yeah. And one of the ways I think about this is how hard it is to be generous, right?
*  To be generous to someone who we don't agree with, how easy it is to declare someone bad or evil because they're not on our side and how hard it is to work together with people who are against us in some ways.
*  Oh, yeah. To get in there like you were saying, to get in there with someone who has a different point of view, who can help you.
*  Sometimes you have a figure that you cannot work with, which may be the case in this instance.
*  But for our nation, the divisiveness that attacks all of us, regardless of who the president is, on an atomic level, we're responsible.
*  And you've written, you know, you've composed many things and you obviously have quite a discography and sometimes instrumentals, sometimes there's words in there and your words are pretty unsparing.
*  You don't mess around, right?
*  No, I don't. I'm very direct and I try to be as honest as I can be.
*  You know, as honest as I can be at the time with the information I have.
*  And everything is not right, but it's as right as I can feel when I write a piece.
*  I think it's serious and I don't care who doesn't like it.
*  And I don't mind them expressing that they don't like it.
*  That's one of the strengths of our way of life.
*  We should all strive for that attitude. I would love to be able to do that.
*  It's what I try to do. Yeah.
*  Yeah, we can't stop them.
*  Yeah. And do you see the younger people today?
*  Are they is there a jazz following out there?
*  I don't I don't see that much of a following with the younger people because the young people are marketing.
*  We're trying to sell things to them and they are largely their sexuality has been co-opted by visual images and jazz is about music and its quality.
*  You have to take the time and we are not we are not interested in teaching our younger people how to take time and to be a part of our way of life.
*  I do think there's room for optimism in the sense that technology, etc.
*  has given people more room to be creators, to be, you know, innovators themselves.
*  Is that too optimistic? Am I I think Dixie?
*  No, no, I think I think there's always a younger I teach a lot of students and I always tell them what they're going to do.
*  I cannot I cannot see that.
*  I give them some information that they can use and what they're going to do, but they have to do what they are going to do.
*  And I try to the biggest thing I see in my students is the ones who are really creative suffer the greatest failure of optimism and of belief.
*  It's easy for them to become cynical and just say, man, I'm just going to make some money.
*  I'm just going to dump my music down. I just I need to get a public like I can't just be out here.
*  I don't it's hard to keep their belief strengthened so that they can be innovative as musicians.
*  Because the music they're hearing a lot of it is like wallpaper, like it's being made by a person on a computer.
*  And it's it's not like a democratic music is not the people are not even in this room at the same time.
*  They're making an artifact. Right. Which is a can be very creative human beings are creative in anything we do.
*  It doesn't doesn't matter for jazz musicians.
*  It's not optimal for us because our music is very much human.
*  You're sneaking looks over the bass player and the drummer. Right.
*  You know what changes are you going to do next is about it's about human beings and how we interact not about our tools that we have developed.
*  I mean, you play obviously a lot of Lincoln Center.
*  You played large concerts. But there is something romantic about being in with one or two other people up there in a tiny stage. Right.
*  Yeah, I love it. But I love in any context.
*  OK. Just you know, it is of course when you're in a small place.
*  I guess also for me is how I grew up. So a small place with no people in it.
*  I'm at home. I get down to that two thirty in the morning.
*  That's what I that's what I do. That's jazz time.
*  That's what I do. And but it's not all you do.
*  You also been very successful in the classical music world.
*  How do you mentally sort of make that leap or do you even see a difference between jazz and classical music?
*  It is a difference in procedure and training in the style of music.
*  But classical music is one of the foundations of jazz.
*  So I also love that music. I don't play as much, but I do write pieces for orchestras and I use the experience I have playing for many years.
*  I love playing an orchestra playing all the great orchestral pieces.
*  And I do feel that that that is that's a library that is so phenomenal that we we we sell that library short.
*  I always wonder what never forget about the power of this library.
*  So what are some of your favorite classical pieces?
*  Man, you know, I can't I could start with any symphony of Haydn, any all Beethoven symphonies, Beethoven string quartets, all the Bach's music is great.
*  Doesn't even matter what you listen to.
*  I like the name, but it's an unbelievable piece.
*  Bartok, concerto for orchestra Stravinsky, any way you take your pick.
*  You know, they get to it.
*  It doesn't make I mean, you can just go on and on and on.
*  It's a fantastic Brahms, fantastic library.
*  Mahler Strauss.
*  I just I'm very thankful that I was able to develop the ability to hear that library in high school.
*  Because when I started, I couldn't hear that kind of music at all.
*  And I thought it was only for white people.
*  But to be able to overcome that ignorance and that prejudice and actually listen to the music is akin to a person who doesn't know what jazz is.
*  If you can get to where you can hear John Coltrane's music, Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and you know, it's a struggle.
*  You have to work on it.
*  But if you get to where you can hear it, it's so many unbelievable riches.
*  And classical music is man, just Shostakovich, Shostakovich 7th Symphony.
*  If you can get to where you can hear that, I strongly encourage you to develop a taste for it because these were very, very serious people who sacrificed a great deal for music and had extreme insight into the nature of many things.
*  And there's also sort of a I mean, especially if you're a kid, there's just a coolness barrier, right?
*  Like when I first started listening to jazz, sure, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker.
*  And it was years later that I started listening to Duke Ellington.
*  I was like, where have I been? What was I doing, man?
*  Okay, you know what's happening.
*  Yeah, I was like that too.
*  I didn't like Duke.
*  Big band music, man, like Jerry Tomlinson.
*  Exactly, right.
*  That's like your grandparents listen to that stuff.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  So we have the same experience with it.
*  And with that kind of quality music, I feel of any tradition, it could be tango music.
*  I was listening to it, my man.
*  I always forget people's names.
*  I was checking out my tango orchestras from the 1950s and 60s and I was like, man, listen to this.
*  And Brazilian music of Mor Cessantos.
*  They're these figures in every culture that were deeply engaged with the music of their culture.
*  Yeah.
*  And they created things that when we touch them, Horatio Salgan is the person I was looking for in tango music.
*  And when you include them into your listening, they lift you.
*  Yeah.
*  And do you incorporate classical elements into your jazz, composing and vice versa?
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, it's only natural you would use contrapuntal elements that come from classical music, harmonic devices, orchestrational techniques.
*  Why not?
*  What you're talking about, the physical universe.
*  No, I know it's all the waves.
*  But would there be the kind of improvisation that you do in jazz that would sneak its way?
*  Sometimes pianists, right?
*  Yeah, when you write for classical musicians and orchestra, no.
*  But I had an idea for one other day of how could you get everybody to improvise, not in a vocabulary, this jazz, like in a rhythmic vocabulary and in a non-harmonic vocabulary.
*  I figured out how I want to write a symphony that's all with a lot of improvisation in it.
*  You have to figure out the improvisation, not in the jazz context.
*  You can use the same forms, but you have to give the different sections because you have 70 people.
*  Well, like you said, improvising multiple people at once.
*  Actually, you said something earlier today that was fascinating about just two trumpet players up on stage.
*  And the phrase you used over and over again was sharing space.
*  And that's the trick, right?
*  Yeah, to share space is complicated.
*  You and your wife, you and your brothers, your sister, you and yourself.
*  How can you make space for yourself?
*  Now, it's two of us, so there's less and there's more at the same time.
*  There's less for us to eat, but there's more.
*  Right, yeah.
*  There's more variety, there's more inspiration, there's more tension, creative tension.
*  There's growth.
*  But that's why so much improvisation is done in the soloing context, right?
*  I mean, how often do we get five, six, seven people literally improvising?
*  Well, very difficult, but if you give five or six different functions, you can get it.
*  But if five or six of them are playing in the same functional space, it's very hard for that to sound good unless that's the point of it.
*  Then it can sound great.
*  It can just be, this is a texture of five or six people soloing.
*  And you've also played with country artists, with rock and roll artists.
*  I only found out last night when I was anticipating this interview that you did a whole album with Eric Clapton.
*  Right, and we were playing blues.
*  Yeah, well, there's a common language.
*  There's a common language.
*  Our language is so much more common than the language we spoke with Yaqub.
*  I mean, with somebody like Eric who loves blues and has studied it and played it, he said we were going to do King Oliver's band,
*  orchestration with blues songs.
*  So the basis of rock and roll is blues.
*  Rock and roll started as shuffles.
*  The Count Basie's Orchestra would play, which became played by Louis Jordan's band.
*  And then it went on to be that.
*  Later it became segregated in America and it stood for white, but that had nothing to do with the music.
*  I remember, you know, so I was growing up 70s and 80s just a little bit after you and you know Living Color?
*  Of course.
*  And I was a huge fan and I was like shocked to learn that here was a rock and roll hard rock band.
*  They were all African American and people objected to that.
*  They're like, what are these African Americans doing playing rock and roll?
*  I was like, what? Where did you come from? Isn't that where it all originated?
*  Yeah, you know, I mean, I don't even, I don't even mean so many different kind of people.
*  I used to have a friend who would say people say this. He said there's a lot of people.
*  People say things. Yeah, they do.
*  Yeah, I remember Vernon Reed, I think.
*  Yeah, Vernon Reed was the guitarist for Living Color. Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I remember. Yeah.
*  In New York in the 80s.
*  That's right. Exactly. Yeah.
*  And now you waded into hot water recently, right? Talking about hip hop.
*  It's not hot water to me.
*  It's good to like the hot water.
*  But so what are your feelings about hip hop for those?
*  I was not speaking of hip hop as a field.
*  I was talking about specifically the use of certain words that I don't like.
*  Right. To be mainstream words.
*  Yeah. I first started saying that in 1987.
*  Now it's 2018. So the public has made this decision.
*  They like that. They want that.
*  Let's not forget the minstrel show lasted for 100 years.
*  If you count 1840 to the end of Amos and Andy, there is a taste in our country for that.
*  I don't share that taste. Right.
*  So if it gets me in hot water because I say I don't share it,
*  and they want to truncate what I'm saying to be a blanket indictment of hip hop and make it seem irrational,
*  there's nothing you can do about that.
*  I'm grown.
*  You got to say what you think.
*  I'm a grown man.
*  Right.
*  And I believe that those words are destructive.
*  And they have been destructive because they've been out here for 30 years.
*  They didn't just get out here.
*  The nation has chosen. They like that. Okay.
*  I have to live with that. But I don't have to like it.
*  So you think it's a coarsening?
*  I think what you think.
*  Yeah.
*  We all think something.
*  What we want to do is look at it.
*  We don't want it to be attacked. But we all think something.
*  So there is socially conscious hip hop. There's poetry in hip hop.
*  I'm not talking about that kind.
*  Right?
*  Yeah. I'm not talking about that kind.
*  Yeah. Exactly.
*  And I'm not talking about it itself in any type of blanket kind of crazy, unintelligent way.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever it is that's unintelligent, it does not account for the fact that there are many different kinds of a thing.
*  I'm not talking about that.
*  I'm talking about what is in the mainstream from a linguistic standpoint.
*  And I'm not even commenting on it musically, which I'm qualified to, but I'm not.
*  That's not what I speak about.
*  You're not going to comment right now?
*  I'm not going to comment about it. No. Because it doesn't matter.
*  That's the direction that all of our music is going in.
*  Of a kind of way of being produced and a way of being treated as a product.
*  And to segregate hip hop from everything else is unfair.
*  That's a very good point.
*  Hip hop doesn't create the universe around it.
*  It's the other way around.
*  No. But what I speak about is very specifically about certain languages that I did not like when it was first around.
*  Sure.
*  Then I was young.
*  Sometimes I see young people say, well, you're just an old guy who was like, I was saying this before you were born.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  And once again, the nation has clearly spoken. It likes that.
*  Yeah.
*  But I knew it liked it when my mama told me something when she realized when it stumbled into all of that, talking about the words I say I don't like, call people bitches and all that.
*  My mother said, it's going to get unlimited resources now.
*  Yeah. I mean, I feel I like hip hop when it's good.
*  And of course, whether it's good is up to me. Right?
*  As it is for anybody.
*  Right.
*  As it is for everybody.
*  But some of the classic albums from some of the early ones, I can't listen to.
*  It's harsh. Right.
*  And it's kind of a shame.
*  It's up to each person.
*  And once again, what we think about it has no impact on who likes it.
*  Right. We're not judges.
*  Like we don't we don't have the opportunity or the ability to pass a sentence on it and keep people from making their records.
*  This is a democracy.
*  Well, we can make them think.
*  Maybe. Yeah.
*  But I've been talking about it for years.
*  I don't think anybody thought about people are making money with it.
*  And it's a national pastime.
*  It's not just something to do with black people.
*  Oh, yeah. No, not at all.
*  There's like a tremendous national taste for this type of imagery.
*  Yeah. And not just in hip hop.
*  Right. Not just in hip hop.
*  I'm not a fan of that.
*  Right. Right.
*  Not saying I don't think it should exist.
*  I don't think it should be a mainstream.
*  Right. So I'm even qualifying and more.
*  If you want to go somewhere and get stuff, we always had stuff that was like that.
*  Kendrick Lamar just won the Pulitzer Prize in music.
*  You were the first. Is that right?
*  You were the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize in music.
*  Jazz.
*  Which is not classical at all.
*  I think so, yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That was a great thing.
*  And I don't know a lot about that world.
*  To me, it's probably similar to the Nobel Prize in the sense that there's a lot of bad things about people chasing prizes and things like that.
*  The prize doesn't always go to the best person, but maybe it can help bring some attention to some good work.
*  Yeah. I don't know the prizes.
*  Prizes are as serious as the rigor in which people who hand out the prizes have about them.
*  Right.
*  I think it's good for people to win prizes and to celebrate other people and to show up at shows with tuxedos on because it's fun.
*  I totally agree.
*  And it doesn't mean anything larger than that.
*  I don't really look at it.
*  I remember when I won two Grammys, my father and mother came out to Los Angeles and there were many other people who should have won, could play better than me.
*  So after the Grammys, I was in the room with my father.
*  My father looked at me and said, wow, the Grammys.
*  He's not a guy who's Hollywood kind of pop central.
*  He doesn't care about any of that.
*  Yeah.
*  So he looked at me before I went out in the street to party.
*  He said, yeah, you won two Grammys, man.
*  I'm glad you won.
*  You know, it's been a win and it's been a losing.
*  He seriously looked at me and said, I hope you don't think that this means you can play.
*  Okay.
*  I was 21.
*  I understood exactly what he meant.
*  But I think the whole point of winning a Grammy is to impress your parents.
*  But he was.
*  I mean, I knew my father would not be impressed.
*  He also was not dousing me.
*  He wasn't trying to.
*  He was just saying, man, you know, this stuff is not really about.
*  It's fun, but it's not about nothing.
*  Like, you need to learn how to play, son.
*  You play okay.
*  But you're not the best anything.
*  And in his way, you'd have to know him.
*  In no way was it like a negative dousing.
*  I laughed.
*  I said, man, I know better than this.
*  We go out and party and have a good time.
*  Somebody's got to win these awards.
*  So I think I congratulate people when they win awards.
*  And we keep it moving.
*  There's going to be another award next year.
*  And it's not I don't look at them one way or not look at them.
*  I'm not critical or non-critical.
*  What are your goals for the next year?
*  I'm not critical.
*  What are your goals for your own music in the future?
*  To become better, a better musician, write better music,
*  become better at dealing with the orchestra,
*  combine more forms and do more things that are interesting
*  and innovative with jazz music and putting it to become a better soloist,
*  be more sophisticated in my understanding of different forms around the world,
*  and just be more dedicated and humbler about my development.
*  These are good goals for everybody.
*  But I'll say also, we're here at this conference with people talking about politics and science and everything.
*  And you were one of the people up there on stage.
*  But you were also one of the people in the audience.
*  You were listening.
*  So your mind is growing as well as your technique.
*  I loved it.
*  Man, I loved your presentation.
*  I loved a lot of presentations.
*  I took a lot of notes.
*  I go back and study, read books, people said.
*  It's a luxury to be able to sit up and hear unbelievably brilliant people talk.
*  Everybody's dedicated.
*  Think of all the dedication you've had and your journey.
*  And another thing you learned as a jazz musician is that creativity is all over the world.
*  My father used to always say, man,
*  it's of many creative, great people who don't wear signs saying, I'm creative, I'm great, I'm smart.
*  And learn how to put your radar up.
*  You can find it.
*  And listen.
*  And believe me, I'm on it.
*  I'm on this podcast.
*  We're on.
*  I'm putting it on in the morning.
*  I'm checking you out.
*  And I'm not just saying it because I'm on it.
*  I mean that.
*  I'm going to love being educated about the things that you're talking about, what the guests you have on.
*  And I've thoroughly enjoyed myself.
*  Everything from new developing cities to autism to the Me Too movement to what you were talking about,
*  what Julie was talking about.
*  I mean, you know, it's all interesting, 3D copying.
*  Did you have any or have you had any special interest in science in general?
*  Or is this just a...
*  Yeah, I always loved science when I was growing up.
*  I loved all of the sciences.
*  I loved biology.
*  I always did pretty good as a student.
*  And chemistry.
*  And yeah, I loved the sciences.
*  I told you, I read the Dancing Wu Li Masters years ago.
*  And I am interested.
*  I need to be educated.
*  There's an infinite number of things that we all need to learn, right?
*  We're not going to run out of interesting things to learn about.
*  But we were having this interesting conversation the other night about entanglement,
*  quantum mechanics, right?
*  And maybe there's a connection with jazz.
*  Well, in fact, I mean, it's almost a cliché.
*  I don't know if you know Stephen Alexander.
*  Do you know that name?
*  He's a physics professor at Dartmouth who wrote a book called The Jazz of Physics.
*  Yeah, yeah, right.
*  The Jazz of Physics.
*  I haven't read that book yet, but yeah, I know him.
*  He's a saxophone player.
*  Yeah, I know him.
*  Yeah.
*  And I mean, part of me, like, you know, we're trained.
*  It doesn't like you're trained to be a critic of music.
*  We're trained in science to be skeptical, right?
*  And someone makes some grandiose claims.
*  So the claim would be that, you know, there is at least an analogy between how we already talk about waves and waves bumping into each other.
*  Clearly, that's part of music, rhythm and so forth, tone and pitch.
*  But there's also randomness, right?
*  There's probability.
*  And but it's not a mess, right?
*  There's probability in quantum mechanics.
*  Things don't exist until you observe them, bring them into existence.
*  And maybe there is an analogy that's useful there between that unconscious solo that you're doing that until you played the note, it wasn't there.
*  Like you didn't write it out ahead of time.
*  Well, all that or the the the I think that repetition is a way that we can we control entropy.
*  We have to repeat things.
*  I was talking with an artist and he was making me laugh.
*  He said, I see the world new every day and I create new things every day.
*  I said, well, I equate that with being on the run.
*  Because you stop and spell the roses.
*  You know, we all we all have things we're going to do that we touch those like we're going to that.
*  That's part of of of of being in a kind of system.
*  But if you're running, you're not doing a lot of things that are the same.
*  It's true. It's true.
*  And I think that we even mentioned before the balance between something different and something that fits in.
*  That's right.
*  Sort of what you're looking for.
*  And that goes into what I said about entropy in the sense that we start with a universe that's simple.
*  We end with a universe that's simple.
*  Entropy is going up along the way.
*  But it's in the middle where entropy is middle and complex structures are there and you don't know what's going to happen.
*  It's not so simple.
*  That's what's fun.
*  Right. And you're saying you're trying to order them in a way that you can order them to understand whatever you can understand.
*  Yeah, we try to understand bit by bit.
*  Right. And but jazz gives you the opportunity to understand slices of reality, not just from your perspective.
*  Now, you understand it so much.
*  I call it at the speed of instinct.
*  Like how fast is instinct? Man, it's fast.
*  That's fair. That's speed.
*  And you're playing in that on the on the edge, always of instinct, because it's always a present moment, present moment, present moment, present moment.
*  And you're trying to command that press like riding a wave.
*  Right. And you're just going on that wave.
*  And there's other people.
*  The presence of other people make make you all have it's like a multi.
*  It's like a hydra.
*  It's like it's and you're perceiving them and you're perceiving the form and you're perceiving and you're perceiving the audience and they're perceiving you.
*  And it's all going on, going on, going on, going on, going on.
*  The boom then is over.
*  Then you can listen to it and assess it when you're playing it.
*  You can't write.
*  I mean, do you ever just trance out?
*  You're just like playing.
*  You don't even notice what's going on.
*  I'm always like that.
*  I'm only listening like I'm listening so intensely and trying to understand.
*  It's like you're just looking at something in the space.
*  But this is this is let's be told me he has Louis Armstrong called me once at four o'clock in the morning in Los Angeles.
*  He said, are you up?
*  I said, of course, man.
*  Of course, I'm up.
*  He said, man, you know, I remember I went to the ophthalmologist and he said, when you want to play low, look low.
*  When you play middle register playing, when you want to play high, look up high.
*  And he told me, he said, man, I started doing I said, wow, I asked Louis Armstrong one time, I said, pops, why are you always looking up high?
*  What are you looking for?
*  He said, pops told him, I don't know, brother, but I always find it.
*  He's looking for some high notes.
*  He's looking into the hey, he's looking up there where his stuff is.
*  Sometimes I tease a musician on the bandstand and I see them looking at it and I know what they're looking at.
*  And I'll say, look at it.
*  You know, look at it.
*  Focus on that.
*  Because they look at you.
*  You look at you looking at a point in space.
*  You don't look at anything, but you're trying to just hear and perceive everything that's going on and order it and figure out where do I fit into this?
*  And what is such an unbelievably exciting thing when it's when it's done well.
*  And it's you know, I wrote a book about time and the nature of time and how clocks tell time and everything.
*  And our bodies are full of clocks.
*  Right. Our bodies are full of things that do the same thing in a rhythm over and over again, whether it's our heartbeat or our breathing or our nerves bouncing back and forth.
*  And I think that really good music, whether it's jazz or classical or whatever, it sort of it feeds into that and draws from it.
*  Right. It's like the rhythms inside us come out in some interesting way.
*  I would love to see all the I would love to get in the out.
*  I'm gonna get the book.
*  But is it do you talk about all the different clocks that are in the body?
*  I mean, if I looked at it, would it give me an understanding of what they are?
*  No, but I have friends who know that stuff.
*  Yeah, I'm just a physicist.
*  But, you know, the body is too far too complicated for me.
*  But it goes into, you know, some things can be taught and some things are just kind of India.
*  I don't I don't want to say they're, you know, inherited, but they come from places we don't understand.
*  It's instinctual.
*  Yeah, it's instinctual.
*  It's a thing. Like, when we do jazz, we call it a thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you got that thing.
*  Did anyone ever did any I sometimes for the podcast interview neuroscientists?
*  Did anyone ever try to like put you in a brain scanner while you're playing?
*  No, somebody was talking about doing it with a band.
*  Yeah.
*  But we didn't do it.
*  I would love to do it.
*  Well, David Popple, who's a I'll hook you up if you want to do it.
*  I would love to do so because his thing is there's different ways of looking inside the head to see what your brain is doing.
*  Now, I mean, this is stuff that we've developed over the last couple of decades.
*  Right. So you don't need to do surgery to peek into the brain.
*  You can do an MRI, which will show you where in the brain things are happening, but it's very slow.
*  So if you're even if you're just talking, forget about improvising, forget about playing fast.
*  You don't know when it's happening.
*  But what you can also do what's happening in the brain, right?
*  Are these chemicals zooming around and they make little magnetic fields that pop outside your head and they can measure those right away.
*  And I would love to see that what it would be like for a band really playing and improv.
*  I would love my students to to to do it.
*  And I told you I want you to talk to my students.
*  They would love that. Great students at Juilliard would love to do that.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And, you know, I think it's coming because brain computer interfaces.
*  I think this is a common theme for me.
*  But I think that, you know, one of the things that's going to change the future is our ability to forget about our fingers.
*  Just go right from the brain to the machine telepathic and go back and forth.
*  And it might be very, very slow and might be 100 years from now.
*  So that's OK. I'm a physicist. If it's 100 years, nothing. Right.
*  But I think that, yeah, well, it'll be interesting to see how we learn about music, about what it means.
*  Some people less musical like I can't sing a note, but I love listening to other people.
*  It's great. So, Wynton Marsalis, thank you so much for this fantastic conversation.
*  Man, it's such a pleasure. I have so much respect and it's an honor and pleasure.
*  And keep the journey going. Yes, sir. That's what we both doing.
*  All right. Thanks, man. Yes, sir. Thank you.
*  Thank you.
