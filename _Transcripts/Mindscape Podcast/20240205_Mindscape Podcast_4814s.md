Universities and their students are constantly being encouraged to produce more graduates majoring in STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. That's the kind of training that will get you a rewarding job, students are told, while at the policy level it is emphasized how STEM workers are needed to drive innovation and growth. In his new book Wasted Education, sociologist John Skrentny points out that the post-graduation trajectories of STEM graduates are more likely to involve being chewed up and spit out by the tech economy than to end up with stable long-term careers. We talk about why that's the case and what might be done about it.

John Skrentny received his Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard University. He is currently Professor of Sociology at UC San Diego, and has previously served as the Co-Director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies and Director of the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research.

# Mindscape 265 | John Skrentny on How the Economy Mistreats STEM Workers
**Mindscape Podcast:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6kWTl8zYbI)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. Here's a classic question.
*  What is the use of education? What is the value of being educated?
*  I'm thinking particularly here of post-secondary, post-high school education, college, university,
*  even graduate school and so on. Why do this? Why get that much schooling into you?
*  There are lofty answers to this question about becoming a more well-rounded human being,
*  understanding the human condition, picking up reasoning skills and learning skills.
*  There's also socialization issues, right? Meeting people, getting to know the world in a certain way.
*  That's absolutely an important function of going to college. But there's also a lot of down-to-earth practical issues, right?
*  You're being trained, perhaps, for a trade, for a job, to become employable.
*  That's an absolutely valid reason to get an education. In the modern world, especially, we point toward
*  science and technology as skills or fields for which we would like it if people had good training in these fields, right?
*  We invent the acronym of STEM, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
*  This is government speak or education speak for the kinds of science-y, tech-y areas that
*  both governments and also employers place a lot of emphasis on.
*  So if you're not within academia right now, you might not know that there's a lot of hand-wringing and angst about the decline of the humanities
*  and the more classic parts of the broad-based humanistic education that we purport to care about.
*  Too much emphasis, maybe, is being put on science degrees and related areas.
*  But there are good reasons, economic reasons. You want people to get a good job that's able to pay them.
*  You give them a fulfilling life after college, so maybe it's fine to have a bunch of people specializing in STEM areas.
*  Today's guest is John Screntini. He's a sociologist at UC San Diego and actually someone I've known for a long time.
*  We went to graduate school at the same time together and used to play basketball together, as you'll find out if you hang out for the very end here.
*  But he's written an interesting book called Wasted Education, How We Fail Our Graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.
*  The idea behind John's book is, sure, employers and governments want a healthy and rapidly growing, scientifically and technologically educated workforce.
*  But does that mean that once created, that workforce is actually fulfilled? Are they happy?
*  Do you get a science degree and are you therefore able to get a good job that keeps you having a good kind of life?
*  And the answer, not always, certainly, but in a growing number of cases, the answer is no.
*  So it's a very interesting argument. I mean, we have to say over and over again, and John will say very explicitly in the podcast,
*  of course, certain individuals get very rewarding careers out of science education.
*  But we also have to take into account those that don't. And we're not primarily talking here about people who go into academia or even want to go into academia.
*  We're talking about tech workers, which is a huge fraction of the people who go from STEM degrees into the workforce.
*  They work for computing, technology, software, engineering kind of corporations.
*  And it can be a tough road to hoe, as a matter of fact. For one thing, novelty and innovation is, of course, valued.
*  It turns out, for various reasons that we'll discuss, that it can be easier to just get rid of your workers and hire newer, younger ones,
*  rather than retraining the existing workers. The new workers already have the skills, right?
*  They just learn them. They're fresh in their minds. They're cheaper. And then a decade or two later, they can be fired and they can be replaced.
*  It might not actually be a sustainable way to think about our workforce or what it means to be a scientist or what it means for colleges and universities
*  to do their students a good service by providing them with an education.
*  Harder to come up with solutions to this issue than to diagnose it.
*  Certainly, very deep features of capitalism and our economic and political system are involved here.
*  But it's an important issue to highlight one way or the other. We need to know what we're doing when we're training people in these different areas that I personally value very much.
*  But we have to be explicit. We have to be conscious of what's happening. We can't just say, oh, science is good, therefore do it.
*  We have to look into what happens when we try to do that.
*  So I think it's not exactly what we usually talk about here on Mindscape, but sociology is an important part of the liberal arts spectrum.
*  So let's go.
*  Don Scrantoni, welcome to the Mindscape podcast.
*  Happy to be here. I'm excited to talk to you, Sean.
*  You know, since we're old friends, I thought I would start you off with a couple of softballs to get the ball rolling here, as it were.
*  So what is this STEM acronym and why is it a terrible acronym?
*  Actually, compared to the alternatives, it's pretty awesome.
*  So do you prefer STEM over SMET?
*  I prefer not using an acronym.
*  Oh, OK. Well, I got to tell you, the government has been searching for an acronym for quite a while.
*  And that's because they've been trying to count people in these fields for quite a while, really since the Cold War.
*  In the book, I include a New York Times story in which there's this panicky headline in the New York Times about how the United States is falling behind the Soviet Union in the number of technicians.
*  Would you prefer that? Probably not. Probably not.
*  They were talking about scientists and engineers.
*  The National Science Foundation has scientists and engineers or S&E, S&E.
*  So not exactly that euphonious, one might say.
*  But it appears so often in the educational context. And like, no one majors in technology. That's not a thing, right?
*  Right.
*  You can major in science, engineering or math. They're very different from each other. So I don't like lumping them together.
*  So I kind of like using words rather than acronyms.
*  Yeah. So the technology, I saw a government report that used the acronym SET, science, engineering and technology.
*  So people really like technology. Sorry.
*  They like that.
*  And then there was some use of SMET, science, math, engineering and technology.
*  And that had a rationale to it where science and math are the foundations of engineering and technology.
*  So by putting them first, it's sort of kind of a temporal ordering of what comes first.
*  You do the basic science, you understand the math and then you develop the technology.
*  But SMET sounds like an onomatopoeia of something unpleasant.
*  Right. It's not bad.
*  Yeah. Oh my God, a SMET. So it didn't really catch on.
*  And then Judith Romilly is her name.
*  She was one of the higher ups at the National Science Foundation.
*  She apparently is the one who coined the STEM acronym, just changing the order a little bit, making it sound a little bit better.
*  And then it just took off. I had a graduate student kind of look who's doing research assistance for me.
*  And she looked at the rise of the STEM acronym and it just started to appear in bills in Congress.
*  And it just took off. And so you may not like STEM, but a lot of other people like it.
*  That is a much more detailed and serious answer than I was hoping for. So good start.
*  So we're kind of stuck with it. And what exactly it means, that's a different question.
*  But STEM seems to have taken off internationally. People use that acronym.
*  They seem to understand when I talk to them about STEM.
*  So STEM seems to be here to stay. Does it include the social sciences?
*  That's a good question. The National Science Foundation officially includes social scientists in its understandings of S&E, science and engineering.
*  And then they also talk about STEM. We could go down a very tedious rabbit hole about some of this.
*  But they idiosyncratically, I would say, include social scientists because when most of the government policymakers are talking about STEM, they're not thinking about me.
*  They're thinking about you. They're thinking about a lot of other folks. And I can explain why that is.
*  And people might protest that sociologists, economists, demographers can be highly quantitative, political scientists as well, and really use advanced statistical computational methods.
*  So why aren't they included in STEM? And I think that that has a lot to do with what the government wants with its investments in STEM education.
*  And they don't really want more of me. I arguably don't be offended. They probably don't want more cosmologists.
*  Experts on general relativity. They're not saying we need more of those. Give us more of those.
*  They are looking for people to, first of all, fulfill employers' demands. And these employers have been crying shortages for quite a while.
*  They want people to innovate. They want people. You know, that technology, that tea that you were so skeptical of, that's really what they kind of want.
*  That's what they care about. Oh, I know. They're riding on my coattails, honestly.
*  They are. They are. And they have this hope that by cranking out more experts in STEM fields, they will innovate.
*  And they will create new technologies that will boost American competitiveness and boost American national security and grow the economy and provide jobs for everybody.
*  I wrote this book chapter a few years ago in which I kind of traced the history of American policymakers and what they wanted.
*  I'm using the acronym anachronistically now. What they wanted STEM workers to do.
*  Obviously, they weren't talking. They weren't using the STEM acronym during the progressive era.
*  But during the progressive era is really when you saw the government trying to think about, hey, we've got these experts in these science and engineering fields.
*  We should deploy their expertise. And so the interesting thing about the progressive era was that they wanted to deploy the existing expertise, if we can use existing in relation to expertise, what people already knew.
*  And so like Pure Food, the Pure Food Act. Wow, we know why food spoils now. We know how to prevent food from spoiling. We know how to keep meat safe.
*  Let's keep those. Let's use. Let's deploy that expertise and make sure that we can make food better.
*  Progressives were real excited about all the new knowledge being generated. And they wanted to just deploy it as strategically as possible.
*  Then you had a sort of a change that happened during World War II, which I'm sure you're familiar with, with the Manhattan Project and developing the nuclear bomb, developing radar.
*  And that was a little bit different in the sense that the government really wanted to deploy scientific and engineering expertise to create specific technologies that they really wanted.
*  So they brought together a lot of experts and said, hey, we want you to develop a system that can detect enemy aircraft or hey, we want you to come and develop a system that can produce a weapon that could potentially end this war, the nuclear bomb.
*  So it was very targeted use of expertise, even though they didn't yet have the expertise. So you can see we're one step away from the progressive era.
*  But by the Cold War, we started to get into a phrase that I kind of called it alchemy because it suggested this sort of this hope that by putting stuff together, something amazing would happen.
*  It wasn't as rational. And they didn't the government really didn't even have an idea of which fields were going to create the most innovations or the most innovations that would create the most jobs or the innovations that would boost national competitiveness, the most economic competitiveness I'm talking about here.
*  It was just this sense that by creating more people with STEM educations, amazing things were going to happen. And we don't know what, but amazing things are going to happen.
*  Just get them together, kind of like Bell Labs, maybe it was a little bit like that. Bring them together and amazing things are going to happen.
*  And this kind of understanding of STEM education and STEM expertise, there was a lot of hope and faith, kind of a faith. And I like that use of the word faith.
*  We normally connect that with religion, but it was almost like that. It was like, wow, these people are going to save us and let's invest in them and let's make them go.
*  So techno-optimism at an early era.
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a phrase that's bounced around a lot in this.
*  So you've already implicitly answered this question a little bit, but I'm wondering since we're going to be talking about STEM education and what happens to people who get STEM degrees, in what sense is this a job for sociologists to think about?
*  We haven't had that many sociologists on the show. We had a great talk with Brooke Harrington about offshore wealth management, but we haven't really gone into enough for the listeners who I assume listen to nothing but the Mindscape podcast to really get an idea about what sociologists do.
*  So are you doing mainstream sociology? Are you kind of branching out a little bit with this topic?
*  That's a great question. One of the reasons I went into sociology was that I see it as the big picture social science.
*  I think that economists produce a lot of great knowledge. I think political scientists produce a lot of great knowledge, but I tend to think of the knowledge they produce, especially economists, as kind of looking through the world through a rolled up piece of paper.
*  I'm creating that right now with my hands here. And you can see something, you can focus on something really clearly, but you don't necessarily see all the different things that might be connected to that thing that you're really, really focusing on.
*  So economists can lead us astray sometimes in ways that I think if sociologists were more inclined to study some of the issues that economists focus on, they might have provided a little bit of a corrective.
*  So for example, the world is filled right now with a lot of folks who are upset about free trade and how free trade produced a lot of economic dislocation, people losing their jobs, people who used to work in manufacturing, not having those jobs anymore.
*  Those jobs have gone abroad. This should have been obvious. And I think that the economists tend toward, and sorry for any in the audience, I think they tend toward a kind of really basic sort of utilitarianism.
*  And so, you know, they might think, well, we might lose some manufacturing jobs, but overall, we're going to be happier because you can produce televisions more cheaply in Mexico or China.
*  Now these are going to be cheaper for us to buy. And these workers can move like water, they'll just flow around to the places where the economic opportunities are, and everyone's going to be better off.
*  But what they don't understand is that people have identities, their identities are often linked to their jobs. And so they struggle with economic dislocation.
*  So sociologists, I think, can look at this big picture, see all these things going on. And that's kind of what I love to do.
*  I often think of the knowledge that I do compared to the knowledge that you do or that you generate. I think of the kind of science that you do, Sean, is vertically integrated.
*  It's really, really deep. And if you are focused on a problem of general relativity, I just keep bringing that up because I know you wrote the textbook on it.
*  And someone knocks on the door and like, Sean, we got to talk to you. You lose your concentration, the whole thing falls down.
*  Very annoying.
*  And then you got to get back into it. Whereas the stuff that I do and why it's hard to do this podcast, just to give you a heads up, is horizontally integrated knowledge.
*  It's a lot of stuff at a more superficial level, but really broad. So I'm trying to understand investments and education and what employers in software and oil and gas and chemicals and biopharmaceuticals, like all this stuff.
*  It's just, it's kind of at a superficial level, but there's a lot of it. And I love that though. And I think it fits more with my undiagnosed ADD, you know, that it's easier for me to get back into it if someone knocks on the door because there's a lot of different footholds I can grab onto rather than that really narrow one.
*  Does that make sense to you and I'm talking about?
*  We did have Herb Gintis on the podcast. I don't know if you know his work.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much about him. I don't know much
*  about him. I don't know much, but I don't know much about him because at least
*  because at least at least at least now I think I know him. Now I think I know him. Now
*  now when I look to a different level of how I think about it, think and understand
*  think and understand whole lot of questions that I think question that
*  the my question is is, how do you厲害 yourself excited about more of a social
*  reality as an actor and more less thanunden to take courses that
*  teachers do before researching that in print?
*  So let's for people who are not professional sociologists or hanging out there with let's set the stage
*  You know we have people who get degrees in the stem and I guess the two questions
*  I want to ask you can address them in whatever order is
*  one
*  What kinds of jobs do they go into right like you know within academia?
*  We love it when people go into academic jobs, and we imagine getting a PhD becoming a professor
*  But you and I also know
*  That's a small fraction of all the people who get degrees in these fields and the other is you know
*  How does that compare to all the other jobs like what is the fraction of people when they go in the jobs?
*  They say oh, this is a stem job versus
*  What management factory jobs? I don't even know what the categories are
*  Right so that's a good question the government talks about the policymakers in the US government
*  I know your audience is international talks about
*  Stem and non-stem as a as a binary okay, it's one or the other and
*  There's a few people who go beyond that but in general they talk about stem and non-stem jobs
*  And they do that because of what I talked about before this this hope that by putting people into these stem occupations
*  the sort of traditional stem occupations
*  software developer chemist
*  Psychologist you know things that you knew in high school as as science and
*  engineering electrical engineering mechanical engineering
*  That by by getting people into those occupations these amazing things are going to happen in
*  Reality as I'm sure a lot of your listeners know
*  Stem and non-stem is more of a continuum sure I
*  Spent a lot of time thinking about that it ended up getting cut from the book for various reasons
*  But it's definitely the case that there's a lot of there are a lot of jobs that in which stem expertise
*  College level stem expertise is very very helpful
*  So if you're any of your listeners or so in listeners or software developers
*  they would almost certainly prefer a manager who understands software development and
*  So there's a lot of people who get stem degrees do go into management
*  A lot of people who get stem degrees go into practicing medicine now the government does not
*  Consider practicing medicine to be a stem job and really people might think yeah, they might think why is that what's going on?
*  It's because of this thing about trying to create innovation okay, and practicing medicine
*  Is does a lot of great things for people as obvious obvious for anyone who's ever been to a competent physician
*  But they typically do not innovate and create patents and jobs and things like that
*  We've got stem we got MD PhDs who might do that for the most part practicing medicine is about deploying existing expertise
*  and
*  Another area where where stem people with stem degrees will go that are not the traditional stem occupations is finance of various kinds
*  very much
*  Yeah, no we're we're we are I know you're aware of
*  People in physics who went into quantitative finance and do some very high-powered things there
*  The National Science Foundation data the National Science Foundation runs this great survey called the National Survey of college graduates
*  And I relied on it a lot for this book it shows that people go into this category of
*  You know accountants
*  Auditors financial specialists it tends to group them together. We don't know exactly what those folks are doing
*  It's probably not a lot of black Scholes equations and some of the stuff that our friends in on Wall Street do
*  But but so that's another area where folks go and then a lot of folks go into jobs that don't use stem expertise at all
*  And there's just too many to mention. It's hard to make generalizations
*  That it's a it's a very wide variety of potential occupations for people with stem expertise
*  But I want to emphasize and I do in the book that when the government invests in stem occup in stem education
*  They want people to go into
*  stem
*  occupations and I should say at the outset right here that
*  about 50% of all stem workers in the United States are
*  in computers in some way
*  Like that that's like that's like the 800 pound gorilla of stem. Yeah
*  And we're talking software developers, that's one of the most in-demand in-demand jobs
*  You know computer engineers of various types people web developers
*  There's just a whole range of occupations that involve computers and one of the things that's really unique about that particular stem
*  Sector is that?
*  Whereas
*  Chemical firms like DuPont hires chemists
*  Trucking companies or shipping companies probably don't hire chemists
*  but
*  computer experts of various types
*  They're their own
*  Silo where tech companies will hire these folks, but then they're also yeah like a band across the economy
*  Where just about everybody hires some computer experts to you know, do things run their payroll do their logistics?
*  I always think of trucking because we don't think of trucking as being very high-tech
*  But actually they hire a lot of data people and to manage this whole complicated system
*  so
*  That computer related fields information technology is a band across the whole economy retail
*  You know all kinds of occupations or all kinds of sectors will use that
*  Life sciences that'll be used in bio pharma, you know all that, you know life science kinds of sectors. So
*  Computer is really the 800 pound gorilla and and so when we talk about stem workers
*  People have commented on the book a little bit like they're saying hey, man
*  This book seems to be really about tech and really about computer workers and there's two reasons for that
*  One is what I just told you that so many workers go into that field and the other reason is that those are the employers who?
*  argue and
*  Complain the loudest about shortages
*  They're the ones who are saying hey man, we need more workers. Where are these workers?
*  Where what's wrong with your universities?
*  What's wrong with you society for not giving us more more stem grads so that we can hire them?
*  Well, that's good because that's exactly where I wanted to go next because I is the feeling that we get within academia that the
*  Humanities are on the decline
*  And stem majors are kind of taking over is that the feeling that we get?
*  And stem majors are kind of taking over is that accurate and nevertheless, there's a lot of companies that are complaining
*  We don't produce enough stem majors
*  Yeah, so I should say at the outset
*  That you know, the book is really about this puzzle. We we haven't we i've been talking for quite a while here already
*  And I haven't even gotten to the puzzle. We'll get there my apologies the puzzle the puzzle is that
*  there's all these claims of the shortage of stem grads and
*  Only according to some measures and this is the census bureau only 28 percent of stem grads work in stem jobs
*  There's different ways of counting and different data sets. My counting is about 40 percent of stem grads work in stem jobs
*  So it's a little bit higher, but still a minority. So the puzzle is there's all these complaints about shortages
*  What's going on? You know, why aren't you producing enough and yet it's the data looks like we're producing a surplus
*  So that's that's kind of the puzzle there and is that for that that figure those figures that you quote one way or the other are they sort of
*  Lifetime like sometime 20 years ago 50 years ago. I got a stem degree and now I am or i'm not or is it right out of college
*  So basically what they do
*  Is the national survey of college graduates comes it comes out every couple years and they ask a sample of college graduates
*  What did you get your degree in? What are you doing now?
*  So it's a slice of people so it includes people right out of college and people
*  Who have been out for a while, but that's a great question because I was really interested in whether people kind of
*  Go in massive numbers into stem early on and then move on to something else
*  But there's there's a lot of data that suggests even in high demand fields like electrical engineering that
*  Some data suggests upwards is 50 percent
*  Right out of college say nah, i'm not gonna i'm not gonna go this stem route. I'm gonna go do something else
*  So really it's a it's a leaky pipeline. That's a metaphor that's often used. You've probably heard that metaphor
*  It's a leaky pipeline that leaks at all stages
*  If if we think about stem as something important
*  In elementary school people lose interest there high school college and then right out of college and then right out of college
*  Elementary school people lose interest there high school college and then right out of college and then throughout their work lives people can
*  Exit this the stem pipeline. That's one of the things I really wanted to emphasize in this book is that too many people studying this
*  focus on the stem pipeline is just about
*  education from k through 16 k through college
*  but really
*  People have to keep and we can talk about this later people have to keep their stem skills up to date
*  and
*  And stem education if if you want to be successful in stem
*  You got to keep your skills up to date your education doesn't end at college doesn't end at a phd. You got to constantly
*  Re-up you got to constantly
*  I I call it the stem skills treadmill. I apologize for the transparent attempt to create jargon
*  Um, but I really wanted to capture something here, which is the idea of moving while standing in place
*  Right stem workers really have to keep moving. They really have to keep learning just to be able to keep their job
*  And um, I feel like i'm getting off
*  No, this is I mean that is ultimately where we want to go
*  But that's okay because we can go back and forth but just to like just to drive it home
*  It's okay to get the point halfway through the podcast. Um
*  Um, I I one gets the impression that a successful
*  undergraduate majoring in a stem field is going to come out of college thinking of themselves as
*  elite and well trained etc
*  But one of the messages of your book is it's exactly those people who?
*  The employers think of as basically cheap and disposable, right?
*  They're going to use them for a little while until their skills are not quite as cutting edge anymore
*  And they're not going to really mind if they just fire them and hire new graduates
*  right, I I talked to a ceo of a of a stem
*  an innovation economy
*  sort of company and
*  they hired a lot of stem workers and
*  This ceo used the phrase that I titled a chapter of the book burn and churn
*  And it was striking. He he said just so matter-of-factly. Yeah, we burn and churn through them
*  They have a lot of enthusiasm and we take advantage of that
*  And when their skills fall out of date or when they get kind of burned out
*  Then we hire some more and we there's other studies that show stem employers like to get new blood. They like to get
*  New folks coming in there like they like this churn
*  And so that's seen as as a positive and there's not that much concern about what happens to people who get burned out
*  There's a lot of research. It's it's funny because for years i've advised students and maybe you have as well
*  To to major in the field that you're passionate about, you know to choose a career that you think you can be passionate about
*  But leave it to the social scientists to find something negative about that
*  And there's there's new research mainly from my field in sociology
*  About how employers exploit this passion. Oh, they think wow. We've got these workers who really love this
*  and let's
*  You know get them to work 60 70 hours a week
*  We don't even have to pay them extra because they're so passionate
*  They've had great teachers and professors who've fired their excitement about this field
*  and let's ride that wave until it crashes or peters out or something and
*  And and maybe we can then hire the next group of passionate workers
*  So what leads these companies to complain about a shortage? Is it just that they want even more cheap workers just out of college?
*  So I
*  I kind of play dumb in the book a little bit. I'm like, all right employers
*  You say that there's a shortage i'm going to take that at face value
*  If there really is a shortage, are you behaving like there's a shortage?
*  Are you acting like stem grads are scarce and valuable and can just produce magic?
*  That's going to benefit all of us
*  or are you treating these folks as
*  as as disposable I
*  There's a lot of good metaphors sean that work here
*  One of the ones I think about is squeezing an orange getting that juice out of it
*  In my la times op-ed. I I suddenly thought about fast fashion
*  Something that kind of works or that's like really great for a short time, but you don't expect it to last you move through it
*  And so that's what they do and I just kept believing them pretending to believe them and saying all right
*  Let's see if your actions match your words
*  and
*  They just really it it just really doesn't the new york times has a headline today
*  It's I don't know if I can mention the date in in this but
*  But it could be almost any day. There's a there's a new round of layoffs at major major tech companies
*  These are the firms they they created this lobbying group called forward us
*  That their whole
*  Their whole reason for being is the idea of a stem shortage
*  Their whole reason for being is lobbying the government for both more stem grads more stem education and also more stem migrants to come
*  And a lot of these companies and it's part of the reason I talk about these tech companies
*  they
*  They're rich, you know, I mean some of these are are
*  Are near monopolies. We're talking google. We're talking amazon. We're talking
*  Well alphabet, you know google it's tedious they change their names facebook's now meta but huge, you know
*  Two billion people have facebook. They own instagram
*  Apple has like a billion dollars in cash. They're they lay off workers
*  Yeah, they you know, they just we're done with you guys. We don't do we hired too many. Sorry. We don't need you guys anymore
*  I
*  I met a guy who was a former
*  HR expert at a major tech company
*  And he had a brilliant idea and i'm not going to give him credit because he actually wanted to remain anonymous
*  But he moved into the education field like elementary education and high school education
*  And in that field for students with learning disabilities, there's this thing called the iep
*  Which stands for individual education program or individualized education?
*  plan something like that, but the idea is
*  You have a student with some kind of learning disability you monitor their progress you figure out what their strengths are you figure out what they need to know
*  And and he thought that was a great model for these really rich tech companies that are constantly complaining about shortages
*  If if it looks like and who's going to know better than the employers themselves if it looks like some skills are about to be obsolete
*  Why not tell these workers hey
*  You've already got this great foundation in stem education
*  Your specialty is kind of going
*  Going down. We need something new. This looks like it's going to be the new thing
*  We're going to put a little bit of money in there and we're going to train you and deploy you somewhere else in the firm
*  They they typically don't do that
*  They they let you go
*  I google. Um, I think it was google was
*  Basically told companies or told employees you've got this many months to figure out
*  What skill you want to develop you're on your own to figure that out? How do you know?
*  How do you know what's going to be the next in demand skill?
*  And so they moved into that, you know
*  They were given the opportunity to move into that but without guidance or without without paid training. So that that's really tough
*  I gotta lay another metaphor on you and this came from someone
*  a stem worker an engineer who emailed me after
*  My my la times op-ed came out and I loved you know, I love to get the the voices from the field
*  It's so interesting to hear their stories
*  this engineer told me that he thought stem work was was something like
*  prospect prospecting and mining in the 1800s
*  And you've got these people who chased the chased the latest gold rush. Yeah, we're gonna go do that thing
*  It's gonna be really hot for a while
*  Maybe some people are going to get rich. Maybe some you know, stem workers are gonna stock options
*  There's going to be a lot of stem people are going to get rich, but then it's going to peter out
*  And then those folks got to find the next big thing
*  and this engineer told me he didn't want his children to go into these fields because
*  He said it gets tiring chasing these gold rushes chasing these, you know the the next
*  the next mine to be exploited and and and just really really
*  You know people really dig into it, you know, I can give your your readers can probably think of examples
*  But blockchain was really huge for a while
*  Um ai is now the huge one
*  You know, it it goes up and down if you're in oil and gas, you know
*  If the price of oil is super high, they're like wow, we need more. Look at we can pay them a lot
*  And then suddenly that price plummets and then that goes down
*  For people in the life sciences
*  There could be some promising new
*  Technologies in life sciences like right now mr. Naa is really big
*  Maybe there's going to be some limitations there gene editing really big
*  Might be some limitations there. We'll see but
*  You get these fields that get super hot and then they try they hire a lot of folks
*  If they don't get fda approval if the clinical trials don't work out
*  See you later
*  And and and life sciences will lay off a bunch of workers as well
*  Is it possible to oversimplify your argument by saying that there might possibly be downsides to capitalism
*  I would say
*  That the problem isn't necessarily capitalism per se
*  the problem really
*  is
*  And this is where I really put on my sociologist hat and i'm but i'm borrowing from some ideas that come from from economists as well
*  There are cultural practices
*  That characterize american capitalism, especially american capitalism
*  Today and certainly over the last few decades which are creating this problem
*  and
*  There's a lot of folks who've written about this but there's
*  Expectations that investors have that they didn't used to have and that is that they
*  It they call it maximizing short-term
*  Shareholder value various
*  permutations of that phrase various versions of that phrase
*  But share like there's there's a whole movement to create this thing that that the that the stakeholders who really matter
*  For a corporation are the shareholders not the employees
*  The shareholders not the customers
*  Not the customers as anyone who's tried to do customer service in almost any field
*  Any sector not the people in the regional economy where the company might be based
*  It's the shareholders and they should expect valued on their investment in the short term
*  And there's a lot of complicated stuff about how this came about
*  There used to be these massive
*  conglomerates that are all these
*  diverse sort of
*  companies under one roof
*  underwear and apple pie
*  Sarah lee owned haynes
*  The sarah lee company, you know like under underwear company like all these crazy things
*  Put together and they were doing that to hedge them
*  You know kind of hedge their bets if the apple pie market collapsed at least they can make some money on t-shirts
*  So, uh, but shareholders were like no no no we want you to do what you do find your core competency do that thing
*  It was a massive redefinition of what
*  corporations were really about
*  And there was a redefinition of what workers were and workers became costs
*  and investors began to applaud
*  Corporations that shed workers
*  This was a big shift, you know, you would always have companies that would lay off workers when the economy was bad
*  But by the 1980s as we got to shift to this maximizing short-term shareholder value kind of approach to corporations
*  You got companies that shed workers even in good times
*  And and the stock price would go up
*  I I give the example of sarah lee because it's just such a it's such a great example and and the and the ceo complains
*  You know that like my god, you know what the investors just want us to get rid of workers. That's what they want. Yeah, and
*  you know
*  investors
*  They don't like training in the united states
*  Especially the europeans are better at investing and training than the american american corporations are why?
*  You know sociologists like to talk about training as investing but investors see that as spending money
*  And why are you spending money on that when you should be maybe doing stock buybacks or doing something to boost the value of your stock?
*  So I wouldn't say it's capitalism. I would say it's this version of capitalism that we have right now
*  We have similar kinds of short-term expectations among venture venture capitalists
*  Which I think are very important it drives them
*  To put their money into software at the expense of other industries, which I think we need very badly
*  In the book i'm very transparent about what I want staff workers to do. I want them to save the planet
*  I really want them to develop clean energy better plastics
*  Uh
*  Carbon capture technologies. There's so many things we badly need
*  But investors want software they love software
*  You know instagram was worth a billion dollars when it had 11
*  employees
*  Instagram was was software. Yeah, and and the reason investors love software is because
*  That is a from the from the perspective of the investor. That's a fantastic investment
*  You can easily demonstrate the technology works
*  unlike
*  New battery technologies unlike things that we badly need like fusion energy
*  You know, there's some startups doing fusion energy, but boy, when are we going to get that?
*  Can we really demonstrate that that works?
*  With software you can pretty much show that it works pretty quickly
*  You don't need a factory to create it, which is a major advantage
*  If you don't need a factory, you don't need employees
*  You just need a few people to do the software
*  um and
*  and and so
*  and then you can make massive amounts of money that the return on software investments are like
*  10 times much percentage higher than returns on clean energy, which is which is what I think we badly need
*  And so investors, you know, if they just keep blockchain
*  AI is the new ones that I mentioned but any kind of software fintech, you know technology related to to finance social media
*  Sir the surveillance capitalism, which is another very, you know, this term coined by shershana zuboff
*  You know tracking us on the internet. Wow, we can sell you more things
*  And and not necessarily have to produce things so we don't need factories
*  We don't have what investors call the valley of death where you kind of go from the the innovation to the actual
*  Manufacturing phase which can take a while making sure the prototype works and all that kind of stuff
*  So that's a long way to say
*  Capitalism is not the problem. I think it's the version of capitalism that we have right now
*  Okay, and there's probably like a whole other podcast we could devote to how that version of capitalism came to be but i'll
*  We'll stay a little bit focused here
*  uh, and I do want to give you a chance to mention that
*  the fear of becoming obsolete and then getting fired is not the only thing that is
*  Keeping stem grads slightly unhappy. I mean there's the overwork
*  Aspect there's other things where the grass isn't quite as green as they hoped it would be once you've gotten your
*  bachelor's in electrical engineering and enter the job market
*  Yeah, so I I tend to think
*  Again taking at face value these employers that there are these dire shortages and it's a crisis and those are the words that they use
*  Take that at face value. Well, what are they doing?
*  How are they treating these these stem workers and one of the things that they do is they incentivize movements out of stem
*  and they do that by
*  Paying their managers more
*  And I I know you're an nba basketball fan. I know you love
*  you love
*  The sixers you've got your passions there. Do you still love the sixers? We had darrell morrie as a guest on the podcast
*  Okay, the dl the sixers. Yes
*  uh, so
*  It's interesting because in professional sports the players who have these scarce skills are paid more than the managers, right?
*  in in stem the managers are typically not always
*  Typically paid more than the folks who have the skills that are supposedly scarce. Yeah, and
*  and
*  employers control wages
*  they can
*  They decide how much to pay their workers
*  This is an area where I I think sociologists have done a little bit better than the economists the the economists
*  They have some theories about wages, but
*  understanding
*  The starting point of the wage. I don't think they've been very good at
*  And I think sociologists are a little bit better at this. I talked to the coo of a tech company
*  I'm using an anecdote here
*  And he was telling me
*  We need more we need more user experience designers the folks who design the interface of the software that we're using right now
*  and
*  And I don't want to pay them what they're demanding
*  And and he showed me there's these there's these services that kind of do surveys of how much people are paying
*  People in different fields including user experience designers and he's saying look at how much they make I don't want to pay them more than this
*  That's a sociological kind of dynamic it's it's you know isomorphism is the jargony thing
*  But you know, we want to look like we're doing what other folks are doing
*  We don't want to be someone who pays their user experience designer too much
*  This this this uh, this guy decided I can't find people here to do it. I'm going to outsource this job
*  So he went around the world
*  Eastern Europe, China, Mexico
*  India looking for cheaper user experience designers
*  Until he found some that he thought were competent and he could pay them less
*  so
*  And then that's you know, the more that kind of thing takes off the
*  The less you incentivize people to move into that field in the united states and the more you become dependent on outsourcing that thing
*  but but a big argument that I make in the book is that
*  There's a lot of self-inflicted wounds here
*  If indeed there is there is scarcity and the decision to pay your stem workers less than their managers
*  And to incentivize movements out of stem which not every firm does but it's very common
*  It's one of it's one of the problems in this area
*  well, and
*  there is also the idea that
*  Because there truly are so many stem graduates that these employers can hire
*  That they can kind of abuse them once they're there right that they can kind of give them over time. Uh, there's these
*  schedules that are invented to hit targets and really crush people and
*  It can be it can be kind of soul-destroying to just toil away this job for a few years before you get outdated
*  I I think that that's exactly right. Sean and I I rely
*  pretty heavily on
*  to kind of explore the detail of this a
*  Ethnography an ethnography by a sociologist named ofer charone. I want to give him a shout out because I think he did such great work
*  where he spent some time at a
*  Big tech company he had to keep it anonymous, but it's a it's a major tech company that that folks know and that is
*  you know has deep pockets it has a lot of money and
*  Boy, they work their workers really hard and and he he kind of captured this thing and I
*  I actually use this for my in my intro to sociology class to kind of in my sociology of work to talk about
*  Again, the sort of social scientists making everything seem bad
*  But even these jobs that are supposedly great even these jobs that looks that look fun
*  And the media image of some of these stem jobs is people
*  Playing foosball people playing ping pong
*  There was a stem employer here in san diego that had this big swirly slide in the atrium
*  Of their of their workplace
*  This ofer charone went to this company and saw that people didn't really use this stuff
*  That it looked like a lot of fun stuff was around but people didn't use it and that was because for much of the year
*  These workers were in what they call crunch mode or crunch time
*  And that is the time when they're racing to deliver a product that has been promised at a for
*  for a delivery date at a particular time
*  and they've got to make sure that it works and they've
*  They've started working
*  He found workers worked an average of 67 hours a week
*  That's a long time
*  And and they and they did it sort of voluntarily the the managers have these clever ways of managing workers to
*  If they didn't come with the passion to sort of coax the passion out of them or make them behave as if they're passionate
*  It's these pretty bruising performance reviews
*  Where every worker is ranked it's it's called stacked ranking or forced ranking
*  Sometimes it's called
*  Cynically rank and yank where you rank up the workers and you yank out the ones that are ranked in a low in a low position
*  But the workers themselves choose their hours and they choose the hours
*  Based on this idea that they want to impress their manager
*  So the manager might go to them and say hey, we got us this product
*  We want to deliver we wanted to have this and that capability
*  We need someone to do this particular aspect of this software, for example
*  And do you think you could do it and how long do you think it'll take you?
*  And they want a high ranking. They want a high evaluation for their performance elevation
*  So they kind of over promise or they certainly promise very ambitiously
*  Because if they say uh, that looks hard. Oh, I don't know about that
*  Maybe you should dial down your expectations
*  That that manager is going to think I don't know if I want this guy
*  I mean the the obvious analogies to graduate school cannot have missed your notice
*  Yes. Yeah, there's
*  there's
*  There's definitely a lot of analogies to to graduate school. You are absolutely right
*  My mind is racing right now with some of them, but trying to stay focused here. So
*  So what you have is workers?
*  Seemingly voluntarily taking on these excessive hours and then
*  Working themselves very very hard
*  One one software developer compared it to drinking out of a fire hose
*  Just trying to keep up with all the stuff that's going on
*  and and developing the skills that they need
*  Maybe they promise something that involves a skill that they don't have yet
*  So they got to work to develop that and and that stuff is very difficult. And one of the things that
*  Maybe some of your listeners are familiar with I know some of the
*  Some of the stem workers with whom i've spoken are familiar with this
*  It's often a young person's game
*  and and part of that there's there's reasons for that one of them is that
*  Some young people kind of realize wow, i'm gonna have to keep my skills up to date all the time
*  That's going to be hard and I can do this for a little while but I kind of burn out and then I move on to something else
*  The other thing is that older workers often have families and if you have families
*  They take time, unfortunately
*  Maybe that's not that's okay. It's not it's not
*  It's it's something it's a job that you have to do
*  and
*  It doesn't go away and and these workers
*  They have a they have a second shift at home
*  If they're not shutting that off onto a spouse
*  And and it gets harder and harder to self-train in your in your in your own
*  Your own time and so it just creates it creates more and more stress
*  so these these deadlines happen and and it does put a lot of pressure on on workers and again, this might sound very
*  Softwarey very tech focused but but those are the employers who?
*  Say their shortages. Those are the employers who often are the richest
*  Those are the employers getting all this investment from investors
*  And if there's any place where we would expect stem workers to be treated really great
*  It should be these employers and and I don't think we see that and there is there's a point you make in the book
*  and I wasn't sure whether this was
*  in your mind more aspirational or factual but the
*  Idea that a lot of there's some idealism in the young stem workers
*  They want to or they should want to i'm, not sure make the world a better place
*  And that turns out not to be the most lucrative job opportunity than making a world a better place kind of fields
*  Yeah, so this is where I was able to
*  explore some of the
*  Issues I was a double major in sociology and philosophy and i've always been interested like you in the meaning of life
*  What is this all for?
*  I don't get much
*  Opportunity to really study that but in the last chapter of the book
*  I wanted to really explore this question of stem education for what?
*  What are we?
*  What are we?
*  What are we as a society hoping to get?
*  With these innovations that stem workers are producing
*  And I think that some stem workers and I want to be really clear about this
*  I'm sure there's some very very happy stem workers who are listening to this right now
*  I hope they're still listening and they're thinking
*  I love my job
*  I'm, not working 70 hours a week. This is fantastic. I'm making tons of money. I can retire early
*  There are those folks i'm talking about the aggregate
*  And there are folks who are really excited to be working on interesting stem problems
*  Regardless of what it is
*  Some some stem workers are and I admire them. They're kind of pure scientists in a way they love
*  particular ways of thinking
*  And so they could move from
*  cosmology or astrophysics into data science and predictive algorithms and things like that thinking I
*  There's a guy I I don't know if he ended up in the book I may have
*  I may have had him in there. I may have cut him out, but he was an astrophysics major
*  Who couldn't get a job or decided not to get a job in academia?
*  And then he worked for a clothing retailer
*  Who that needed?
*  Experts in ai and machine learning and that sort of thing so that they could
*  give
*  customers
*  Suggestions of new clothes to buy
*  Okay now very different I would find that to be kind of soul-destroying to go from thinking about general relativity to be thinking about
*  How can I get someone to buy things that they don't need?
*  Yeah, but but from a pure science standpoint from the pure complexity of problem standpoint
*  Some folks can make that transition
*  But not everybody right and so there's a literature in sociology and management and psychology
*  About how some jobs can produce moral stresses or even moral injuries
*  Anyone who's seen at their workplace workplace bullying that you know
*  They might have felt a moral stress
*  If they've known that their employer is someone at their job is embezzling that could create create a moral stress
*  But what I was interested in the last chapter of the book asking stem education for what?
*  Are the stem workers who?
*  Are uncomfortable morally with the business model of their of their firm
*  And it's it's easy to pick on social media
*  But it's easy to pick on social media because there's a lot of evidence that social media produces a lot of social harms
*  and so I quote some workers at
*  at facebook
*  Who said facebook is hurting?
*  people at scale
*  another worker another worker
*  more
*  more
*  Graphically said I feel like I have blood on my hands
*  for
*  Facebook's role in promoting disinformation and promoting political conflict in societies other than the united states
*  Other people have said well, they actually promote conflict in the united states
*  There's new research coming out
*  about
*  Rises in depression, especially teen depression, especially teen girls. It's pretty effective and
*  And there's there's
*  There's there's evidence that
*  suggests
*  Hard to prove these things definitively causal inferences are very difficult in social science
*  But there's evidence that suggests social media use is part of the reason we're seeing
*  Very alarming rises in teen depression
*  So, you know some stem workers can think oh, we're i'm doing interesting things
*  Analytically, these are exciting problems to solve. I'm working with smart people. They can get really jazzed about that
*  Other workers can kind of think
*  When I go home at night, I don't feel good about what i'm doing here. Yeah
*  you know, they're even like
*  I don't know if any
*  I don't know if any of your you are any of your friends
*  You are any of your listeners have kind of gone on these youtube rabbit holes where you start watching a video and then youtube saying
*  What about this one? What about this one? How about that one? You like that? Check out this one
*  and they they tend to
*  Lead you into more extreme content or more shocking or emotionally
*  uh provocative content
*  There's a phrase
*  Engagement equals enragement or maybe you could reverse it enragement equals engagement but the idea is
*  Getting this emotional hook into the users by
*  Outraging them
*  Is a way to get them to use the app longer
*  and so
*  you know
*  google the google owns alphabet owns google google owns youtube
*  They're involved in this stuff as well very rich company using
*  Using different technologies to get people very upset and you can imagine workers not being happy with this
*  well before you
*  Defended capitalism a little bit saying that there's a particular type of capitalism
*  Which we've evolved to and and I I appreciate the benefits of capitalism in in certain circumstances markets are good at solving certain problems
*  but a lot of what you're describing really just sounds like
*  Capitalism that's gotten better at being efficiently
*  Capitalistic because of faster information flows and faster decisions and more scales and
*  wider labor markets and things like that whereas
*  as a
*  Globe as a species we produce a lot we produce abundance and and do we need to think radically?
*  It's late in the podcast. This is where we let to you know get to speculate a little bit
*  So do we need to think more radically about the system that lets this all happen?
*  I actually don't think we need to think more radically about it. I think that
*  we have the tools available now to
*  Get more out of our investments in stem education than we are getting now
*  one of the things we could do is create more incentives for
*  Innovators in the fields that we desperately need
*  I often think you know if if we're all made extinct by climate change or something like that
*  And you know when alien civilization comes down and they look at us and they think well
*  What were you guys investing in?
*  When the planet was falling apart and there were pandemics and the signs were all around you that you were in big trouble
*  And if we say cryptocurrency blockchain ai
*  Surveillance economy, you know
*  It's going to look a little silly
*  so
*  I think some intervention is needed but not a radical change
*  So one of the things we could do is create more government incentives in investment in clean energy
*  better plastics that don't
*  That don't create micro nano plastics that are in our bodies and human breast milk incredibly
*  Forever chemicals that we don't know are what are doing with us. We can create it we can create
*  incentives through tax
*  Rebates or tax incentives to make these movements happen the inflation reduction act
*  Which is a very general name for a very big bill did create these incentives and it's created stakeholders who are are
*  Moving into the clean energy space. So one thing you can do is create incentives for more of the investments we need
*  That'll produce more
*  Opportunities for stem workers to deploy their skills in ways that might feel morally
*  resonant with them
*  And another thing you can do is simply
*  Make illegal
*  Some uses of stem skills. There's there's a lot of debate in
*  among legal experts about whether
*  targeted advertising should just be banned so that you remove the incentive for these companies to
*  endlessly find ways to
*  to surveil their
*  All of us on the internet because if they can't do this targeted advertising then they don't have an incentive to do that anymore
*  So you can legislate things away
*  And then
*  Another thing you could do is just think about
*  Moral limits on investors and and business models, you know
*  Cannabis is legal in my state of california
*  But my understanding is the cannabis business is a little shaky because banks are a little nervous working with those folks
*  Uh, there's there's this kind of sense that they're sort of cordoned off like whoa. You guys are a little bit different
*  Um
*  I I hesitate to use this word, but pornography is a very lucrative field
*  That's also kind of like whoa. We don't want to invest in that. You know, we don't really want to be a part of that
*  So we already have moral limits that shape investor behavior and and what people are willing to
*  Spend their time on in terms of business practices and investing
*  but for some reason
*  it's okay to
*  Take away people's privacy to stoke division and conflict to encourage
*  Disinformation the spread of disinformation in society a lot of things that you might argue are more harmful than cannabis
*  You know are are okay for investors to invest in you know, mass layoffs which disrupt families
*  There's a lot of things that investors tolerate right now
*  Which perhaps they shouldn't perhaps a little more moral education
*  Um could could go a ways here as well. You know, i'm not a cannabis guy, but I was an online poker player
*  and uh
*  It it used to be done by many many people and the government swooped in one friday and seized all their assets
*  And uh, you basically can't play poker online now
*  It's certain states you can but it used to just be all over and and I agree that's a lot less harmful than
*  Some of the things you just mentioned
*  Yeah, so there's there's research that suggests that
*  You can you can tweak capitalism you can you can fix it and which in ways that will generate
*  The productive energies the innovation the riches that capitalism that can produce and minimize some of the harms that we that we see
*  Well, I don't quite so the thing that i'm still missing though is
*  the innovation disrupting
*  the kinds of jobs that people grew up having you know if if if as is plausible the rate of innovation and which skills are relevant is
*  Increasing the rate so it's faster now
*  We're always going to have a an issue where people who hit 50 are no longer valued and that that does seem a bit
*  Harder to solve i'm not quite sure how to do it
*  Yeah, so
*  The the national survey of college graduates they they asked this broad range of of college graduates
*  did they take skills related training in the past year or two and
*  and
*  We looked at the time since their degree and about 60 percent
*  Have taken skills related training in stem
*  Up to 30 years after their degree
*  So we're getting into the 50s it starts to go down when we're getting into getting into people's 60s
*  So you're absolutely right that that is an issue
*  so one of the things that we need to do is
*  The I don't like this phrase shawn because it sounds so 1970s
*  the lifelong learning
*  We we have this model of education
*  That you graduate
*  in your early 20s, and then you're gone
*  and
*  And I really think we need to change that we're in a different era now
*  And we need a model where we think of college as a place you return to
*  periodically
*  for skills updating or
*  Reskilling something in a different area altogether when your skills become obsolete
*  Maybe something like a subscription model or something where you can go back to your alma mater or a different university
*  But this expectation that we have of college is something you do when you're young and then you move on
*  Maybe needs to be changed a little bit
*  I I still think that college education is absolutely essential for creating
*  But I what I like to think of as foundational skills the basic skills that a college graduate has
*  One of the things is to learn how to learn
*  PhD training really makes you good at that
*  But even with the bachelor's you kind of learn how to learn you can discern good knowledge from bad knowledge
*  You learn how to sort of sort through what's what's good and bad in in in
*  Trying to find the skills that you might need or the knowledge you might need
*  But you'll have that core foundation
*  But then on top of that the skills that you actually deploy at work might change many times throughout your career
*  So I would argue and i'm working on a book on this with a colleague right now
*  College education is great for that foundation
*  But circling back to college to get a skills updating not for another degree
*  but kind of a short-term certificate
*  kind of
*  Very specific narrow kind of skill that can be deployed now might be something that many people will have to do
*  Repeatedly throughout their careers. I mean I of course of course i'm very much in favor of lifelong learning
*  I do wonder though about the model because
*  One is at a very different life stage at age 40 than age 20, right?
*  When you're 20, not only you're learning it for the first time but there's a certain
*  Freedom to fail because your obligations are relatively low. But once you have a kid and mortgages and things like that
*  And also you've been happy for the last 20 years doing some job. I mean I i'm in favor of efficiency
*  But I feel the human cost of having to say I need to do something different than what i've been doing before
*  Yeah, I
*  Agree with that but the reality is
*  The reality is upon us. You are going to have to do something different. There was a great study that was done
*  you know social scientists love a natural experiment where something happens and you can
*  Something happens that's rare and you could examine how human beings respond to it
*  so steve jobs decided that the
*  iPhone was no longer going to support adobe flash software, right?
*  Said you know what? We're not going to do adobe flash anymore. We're going to use something else
*  And there were a lot of software experts
*  On adobe flash not necessarily employed by adobe, but that was what they did
*  Suddenly that was gone. Yeah, they had to respond so that reality is already there
*  Where the where a skill that?
*  Has maybe been developed over a few years
*  It's just no longer needed
*  and
*  So that reality is already there. So how are we as a society going to going to deal with the
*  the regular obsolescing of technical skills and
*  You're right. It's definitely hard
*  people's identities get wrapped up in their jobs and
*  And they their their skill sets get get you know
*  More and more fine-tuned and then to lose that can be really tragic, especially as you say if they have a family
*  so that's going to be difficult, I think if
*  If shareholders don't punish companies for investing in the training of their workers, especially the richest companies
*  And for investing in their workers, that should be something that's encouraged and applauded
*  I got to tell you I don't want to go off the subject too much here
*  But google invests a lot of money in schools
*  They they give away chromebooks to students
*  They do a lot of things to get to train the next generation of software developers at that stage
*  But they could do more for their incumbent workers. Yeah
*  You know that that's the odd thing and so social scientists they they talk about corporate social responsibility and
*  Some things are done kind of as corporate branding, you know, like look how good we are we give away this money
*  Some of it's done to kind of create market share. Let's get a bunch of people using chromebooks and they're going to love google
*  So there's there's money that's being spent in this area
*  But I would argue they could do more for their incumbent workers to manage these sometimes
*  Sometimes very difficult to navigate
*  Career changes or job skill changes later in life
*  Maybe maybe as a final thought we can be more idealistic ourselves because of course
*  We want people to get lucrative
*  Rewarding jobs that they can have some level of security throughout their career
*  But that's not the only reason to get an education, right?
*  When people ask me about applying to graduate school in physics
*  My line is typically that you probably will probably go in hoping to be a professor
*  You probably will not succeed at being a professor, but getting a phd in physics is actually an intrinsically good thing
*  You'll you'll be able to do something else. You'll learn a lot of skills, etc
*  I don't feel the same way about being a postdoc, but that's a different conversation
*  But you where does that fit in to this conversation?
*  Just the idea that getting a degree in stem or related fields, you know has some value
*  Whatever your future life trajectory turns out to be
*  so
*  I've seen that argument and
*  I appreciate your honesty when you tell people that the odds are
*  The odds are they will end up doing something different, right?
*  Then I think that's an important message to give them say yes
*  This is a great thing to do you're going to get some very important skills
*  But keep an open mind for developing
*  Keep an open mind toward career trajectories that don't look like physics, right? So one of the
*  One of the disturbing findings I had in some research with a colleague when we looked at the national survey of college graduates
*  And we looked at people with stem degrees who went into non-stem jobs
*  Is they were significantly less likely to report being satisfied with their jobs?
*  overall
*  and interestingly
*  They were significantly less likely to be satisfied with the intellectual challenge of their jobs interesting
*  so
*  A little bit less or they're less satisfied. They seem to be a little bit more likely to be bored
*  I don't feel so great about that
*  and
*  and so
*  You know being honest with people and telling them hey, there's a good chance. You'll be doing something else
*  I would encourage folks to develop a broad range of skills through
*  We've got this I call it stem mania in the book at my university. Sean university of california san diego
*  It's it's sort of like a public caltech. I always thought of it as that. It's it's really stem focused
*  It was born
*  It's it is in san diego because that's where the scripts institute of oceanography was and that sort of stem tone
*  Really kind of dominates the university
*  And the students who major in the humanities and social scientists are social sciences other than economics
*  regularly have to defend themselves to the
*  Their their the stem group the stem majors who are like, what are you going to do with that? What's wrong with you?
*  This is crazy
*  And so this will sound self-serving but I tell my stem majors who do take sociology classes
*  It is important to get a broad range of skills skills related to
*  communication
*  written oral critical thinking outside of technical skills because
*  Chances are you're going to move into something outside of stem stem or sort of stem adjacent
*  And and and college is a time to really develop that that broad range of skills
*  I mean you always had that I mean you really always stood out your double major in philosophy and astronomy as I recall
*  Yeah, so you always had that message, but that's not typical
*  And so you could segue into this whole podcast thing and you know
*  This this whole range of stuff that you do because of that undergraduate training
*  I'm trying to make a world of little miniature sean carolls
*  So that they will have that
*  Flexibility to plug into different places in the economy stem expertise is great to have I I would think the best thing that you could
*  have to prepare yourself for the workplace of tomorrow is stem skills and
*  Non-stem skills foundational sorts of skills like like like you have
*  Yeah, I mean you're not going to get any argument from me that the broad base is important
*  But if it's true that people who get stem degrees
*  report dissatisfaction with their jobs once they get them
*  What are the data about humanities degrees or social science degrees?
*  No one cares about them. So I
*  I didn't have a grant to look at them. I didn't really look at those folks
*  There are I I initially wanted to explore this there are a
*  pretty significant percentage
*  Different studies have different percentages, but a good 15 percent, you know of stem workers don't have stem degrees
*  And so you have folks
*  Excuse me
*  You have folks who majored in humanities sort of subjects and they moved into technical fields
*  One of the great things about
*  Software development is it's a field that's pretty porous
*  You don't it's not like electrical engineering. It's hard to break into electrical engineering
*  Life sciences without those degrees
*  But software is is wonderfully porous you can you can be this sort of kid who worked on a computer in high school
*  Went and got I actually have a friend of mine who was a creative writing major, but
*  He tinkered with computers in high school. He developed some some software
*  Sold it to a major software company did really well
*  Even though his major was creative writing. So software is is is really welcoming to people
*  You can do these boot camps where you get your foundational skills in writing and communication
*  Then you do a boot camp in coding or data data analytics or something then you can plug into the stem economy that way
*  So that's definitely something that that you that you can do
*  So I I I applaud those folks but for the most part people are not
*  Worried or valorizing our humanities majors
*  And so it and and I don't want to say we need to treat our stem majors and our stem grad our stem grads better than the other
*  grads
*  but
*  If we say that there's shortages of stem grads if we say that stem grads are so important for the economy
*  We should at least treat these feeks these folks really well
*  And and hopefully treat everybody really well
*  But at least these folks who were constantly saying are so important and in such short supply
*  Well, okay. I like your final message, which is everyone should major in creative writing. I think that's a very
*  Like a wonderful world going forward so john scranton. Thanks so much for being on the mindscape podcast
*  Thanks, sean. It was great to be here. And you know, I just want to end with one thing
*  I've listened to podcasts before where people know the interviewer the host of the podcast and they tediously kind of say
*  Oh, we had so many great times in the past. You can cut this out my friend
*  But probably not many listeners know that you were a double threat on the basketball court
*  Not enough of them know that you had a sweet jump shot from the outside
*  I still remember the sound of the ball going through the net and nothing but the sound of that
*  And you had a you had a pretty good drive to the to the hoop as well
*  If someone covered you too close to the three-point line, you could blow by him
*  So not many not many of your listeners may know that about you
*  But that's definitely you were a a multifaceted skilled guy and still are sorry
*  He's the past tense. You must remember that that lefty hook shot was so annoying to everyone else yours
*  That like so many people, you know complained about it that you started complaining about them complaining about it because they weren't used to a lefty
*  That's that's right, but if everyone expects a right-handed jump shot
*  Then the left-handed hook is gonna is gonna is gonna keep me keep me going for quite a while something to remember
*  Thanks very much. John
*  Okay. Thanks, Sean
*  You
