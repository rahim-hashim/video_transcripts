People have a complicated relationship to mathematics. We all use it in our everyday lives, from calculating a tip at a restaurant to estimating the probability of some future event. But many people find the subject intimidating, if not off-putting. John Allen Paulos has long been working to make mathematics more approachable and encourage people to become more numerate. We talk about how people think about math, what kinds of math they should know, and the role of stories and narrative to make math come alive. 

John Allen Paulos received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He is currently a professor of mathematics at Temple University. He s a bestselling author, and frequent contributor to publications such as ABCNews.com, the Guardian, and Scientific American. Among his awards are the Science Communication award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Mathematics Communication Award from the Joint Policy Board of Mathematics. His new book is Whoâ€™s Counting? Uniting Numbers and Narratives with Stories from Pop Culture, Puzzles, Politics, and More.

# Mindscape 216 | John Allen Paulos on Numbers, Narratives, and Numeracy
**Mindscape Podcast:** [October 31, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdjnRialt90)
*  Hello everyone, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. So as
*  I'm recording this, I recently was reading an article by Clive Thompson on
*  the effect that the COVID pandemic has had on education. And the fact, of course,
*  there was a whole thing where students couldn't go to
*  school for a while and people had to learn remotely. But what about not
*  university students but lower levels, high school and secondary school students?
*  Well, it turns out the effect of the pandemic was bad on education here in
*  the United States for sure. And that's maybe not surprising. You know, a lot of
*  the resources, a lot of the usual ways that we did things just weren't
*  available. Even if we could have found ways that were just as good, it takes
*  time to do that. And so certain students are really hurt by that. But interestingly,
*  the decline in scores, which is sort of across the board, is much higher in math
*  than it is in reading. So for whatever reason, there was a much bigger
*  deleterious effect of homeschooling on kids trying to learn math than kids
*  trying to learn reading. And why is that? And the essay tries to argue that it's
*  basically because when you're at home and you're trying to learn math, you're
*  going to learn it from your parents and chances are good that your parents hate
*  math because a lot of people hate math. It's considered okay to hate math, to
*  say, oh, I'm not so good at math. I don't really understand that stuff. It's too
*  hard in a way that it's not considered okay to hate reading or history or other
*  forms of knowledge. And that's a weird thing and it's probably a bad thing. And
*  one of the people in the world who's done the most to combat this feeling is
*  today's guest, John Alan Palos. Famously, he's the author of Enumeracy,
*  Mathematical Illiteracy and His Consequences. That's back in 1988. But he's
*  a mathematician at Temple University and he's kept up this fight to get people to
*  overcome their enumeracy, their mathematical illiteracy, and to learn
*  more, to be more comfortable learning math, including in a brand new book
*  called Who's Counting? Uniting Numbers and Narratives with Stories from Pop Culture,
*  Puzzles, Politics and More. In the podcast, we're going to talk a little bit
*  about math, but largely in some sense, we're talking about the relationship
*  between ordinary people and math. What is the math that people should know? How
*  should we teach it to them? Why don't they want to learn it? Why is it so
*  frightening? Is it their fault? Is it our fault for how we teach it? How could we
*  do better? But then we also do talk a little about the substance of math
*  because it's not just that we need to teach math and need to get better at it,
*  but what kinds of math should we teach? And I think that there's a thing that is
*  said over and over again in my circles that we actually don't spend nearly
*  enough time teaching probability and statistics. To people of all sorts of
*  backgrounds, whether you're going to be a professional scientist or whether you're
*  just going to be doing anything else in the world, there's a knowledge of
*  probability that is very, very helpful that somehow we do not successfully
*  convey to people in the educational system. So we talk a little about
*  conditional probabilities and how you can get an intuition for things like
*  that and why math works at all and how it can be conveyed using jokes and
*  humor, which makes everything a little bit better. So I think this is kind of an
*  important topic. I'm not sure that we solved it once and for all, but paying
*  attention to it is one step in the right direction. Occasional reminder that here
*  at Mindscape, we have a Patreon feed. Go to patreon.com slash Sean M. Carroll, and you can get both ad-free episodes and the ability to contribute to the Ask Me Anything questions that we have. And yet another occasional reminder that we have the Mindscape Big Picture Scholarship. It's been going very, very well. I think we're going to be able to give out three college scholarships this year of $10,000 each. So if you go to bold.org slash scholarship.org, you'll see that we have a lot of great
*  scholarships slash Mindscape. You can either contribute to it if you're at that stage of your life or apply for it if you're at that stage of your life. So I'm looking forward to seeing what the winners are going to be and what great things they're going to do. And with that, let's go.
*  John Allen Polos, welcome to the Mindscape podcast.
*  It's a pleasure to be here, Sean.
*  So you've, in some sense, maybe tell me this is fair or not, but in some sense, you've devoted your life to fighting against innumeracy, or maybe you want to say to promoting numeracy. You wrote a wonderful book with the title innumeracy. How do you yourself define numeracy or innumeracy?
*  I think numeracy is just the ability to deal reasonably well with numbers, probabilities, logic. So it's no hard and fast, precise definition. But innumeracy, of course, is an inability to deal with basic numbers, basic probability, basic logic. And again, it's one of the points I like to make over again is the dubiousness of numeracy.
*  It's a dubiousness of precision. And so I, you know, people are very precise, and the precision is unwarranted. So that's my defense for not giving a more precise definition of numeracy.
*  That's completely fair, I think. I guess the reason why I'm wondering is because I'm thinking about literacy, which is the obvious comparison. And in some sense, literacy is more of a yes no question, you know, some people have bigger vocabularies than others, but you read or you don't. Whereas, when it comes to math, there's just seems to be a continuum. Like I know a lot of math, I've learned a lot, I use it all the time, I still feel there's enormously more math than I don't know, than what I know.
*  Well, I think that to some extent, that's still the case with with literacy. I mean, people who can, you know, read the newspaper, you give them a book by, you know, I don't know, Heidegger. Yeah, or even even a normal person reading a book by Heidegger would be baffled. So there is kind of a continuum, although it's a little bit more binary with literacy than it is with numeracy.
*  And I think that, but there are different kinds of mathematical knowledge. I think that maybe some people who are not into the world of math, maybe don't appreciate what mathematicians do for a living versus calculating, you know, like what I do, I'm no better at calculating a tip or doing my taxes than anybody else's. I don't know about you.
*  Yeah, no, it's the same.
*  Sorry, what?
*  So what is, how do you think about that difference? How do you think about math as opposed to just multiplying and dividing?
*  Well, I mean, one point I've made in a couple of my books is that math is much greater than computation. That's most people's kind of myopic view of it. But math is to computation as literature is to typing. Nobody says you're a great typist, why don't you write a novel or converse?
*  And so, you know, that's why one of the obstacles to teaching math, people think they know it already. I know how to multiply, I know how to plug formulas into numbers into formulas. Is there something more? But there's a lot more. I mean, patterns, logic, structure of various sorts. And that, you know, it maps on to everyday events often enough that it's worth knowing.
*  Even if you're not going to be a mathematician, even among mathematicians, I find that people who are analysts often don't understand some what I think is an obvious point in probability of statistics, people who are in algebraic topology don't necessarily understand much about
*  But that's the case in a lot of things. I mean, my son's a lawyer. And, you know, whenever my wife or I have a question, we know not to ask him because he's a very good lawyer, he makes a lot of money, but he only knows what he knows.
*  Right. Yeah, it's specialized. Let's get some examples on the table so people have an idea of what we're talking about in the book. Like right at the beginning, you say the following thing. If at least one of a woman's two children is a boy born in summer, the probability she has two boys is 7 15ths.
*  Well, let me back up. The probability a woman has two sons, if the given, well, probability two sons given she's got at least one son, that's one third, because you can't have girl girls. So probability two boys given at least one boy is one third.
*  The probability of two boys given at least one boy born in the summer is 7 15ths, which is close to a half. So it's the more precise you are about, I mean, you can set up the sample space and convince yourself, but the more precise you are about the boy she does have, has two boys, at least one of whom is born on July 4th.
*  Then the probability is almost a half. So the more I mean, it's hard without writing out the sample space, but it's typical of problems in many problems in probability. They're counterintuitive. That's one reason people have problems with probability.
*  Their probabilistic vocabulary is limited to one in a million, maybe or 50 50 or sure thing. And on top of that, people don't think naturally in terms of probability and many people. Everything has a reason.
*  And the fact that propositions like you just mentioned are counterintuitive. The most famous example is the birthday puzzle. 23 people is sufficient for if you have 23 people in the room, the probability is one half that at least two have the same birthday.
*  Well, that's why I wanted to discuss this example in particular, because the number 7 15ths is maybe not, you know, I don't really care what that number is. This is not going to come up very often. But it's an example of conditional probability of, you know, probability of one thing and how it changes given some extra information. I mean, is that something that people struggle with, especially in your experience?
*  Yeah, conditional probability, revising one's probability estimates is something we do in everyday life. The only thing is, if you study probability or Bayes rule in particular, you can refine it. So everything we do in probability, in a sense, are refinements of notions that develop naturally. I mean, the notion of mean, median and mode or central tendency, there are all kinds of words in English.
*  Or other natural languages, average, so so whatever complex of words that essentially mean 5050 or the mean average, the same thing with variance. There's all kinds of words in English that are natural languages too far out disparate, very different, far out as interesting as far out on a distribution.
*  And the same thing with with probability. I mean, as Moliere commented, people generally have been, you know, speaking prose all their life, and they're generally been speaking probability all their life, it just that they speak with a very bad accent. I mean, a simple example in Bayes theorem, if you have two coins, and one of them is two headed, and one of them is fair, you don't know which is which, you pick one up and flip it three times, you get three heads in a row.
*  And it's common sense to say, well, it's very likely, more likely that you pick the two headed coin, but what only Bayes theorem says that that probability rises from one half to eight nights. So as I said, probability statistics are refinements or distillations of kind of hazy, nebulous, everyday notions.
*  Well, the classic example of this that roiled, I guess it wasn't the internet, it seemed before the internet was around, but the Monty Hall problem got people very worked up, right? Why don't you remind us of what the Monty Hall problem is? Because maybe there's still people out there who never heard of it.
*  Yeah, there are actually, at least in my experience, the Monty Hall problem has to do with a TV show a number of years ago, let's make a deal, in which there's a host and a guest and three doors behind one of which is a car. And the host asks the guest to choose the door behind which he hopes is a new car and if he's correct, he gets a new car. So let's say the guest picks door one.
*  Then the host, who knows where the car is, always opens one of the other doors where he's certain that there's no car. So he always opens a door behind which there's nothing. And then he asks the guest, are you sure you don't want to switch from one to two? Let's say he opens door three.
*  You're sure you don't want to switch from one to two? You chose door one, I've opened door three, you want to switch your bet to two? And often people say, no, it doesn't make any difference. There's two doors open, chances are 50-50, one half that might as well stay here.
*  But he shouldn't switch because the probability he was right the first time is one third. The car is behind one of the other two doors is two thirds. But since the host opens door three, that two thirds probability is now focused on the unopened door.
*  So worry to switch, he would raise his probability of winning the car from one third to two thirds. But many people, including them, there's a story that may be apocryphal, but the great Paul Erdos, a mathematician, was supposedly baffled by this.
*  I find it hard to believe myself too. But maybe I don't because the way that you stated the problem, everything makes super duper perfect sense. I do think that sometimes when people state problems like this, they kind of want people to get the wrong answer just to explain the trickiness of it.
*  So they kind of hide that fact that Monty Hall will only ever open a door where the car is not there. And that does change the problem.
*  Yeah, it does. It does change the problem. I mean, it's one thing I tell my students to in probability of math in general, being really clear about what you're saying is very important. In fact, yesterday, I asked my class, I said, if you flip a coin 1000 times, what's the most likely number of heads you get?
*  And two, is that a likely number of heads to get? And of course, 500 is the most likely number of heads. And no, it's not very likely as you're going to get 500 heads.
*  But with the guy Monty Hall, what I try to do is show the relevance of puzzles, the puzzles I do talk about to everyday life. So I imagine a duel game, which instead of Monty Hall, there's this psychopath called Tonky Hall.
*  And there's a guest. And the same thing. The only thing is, if he picks the door, the crucial door, there's not a car there. There's a little gun that shoots out a toxic mist of gas and sickens the person choosing that door.
*  So again, the person picks a door, let's say picks door one, Tonky Hall always opens the door behind which he knows there's nothing. Let's say he opens three and then he asks the guest, do you want to switch to door two?
*  And now he should say no, because for the same reason he was right one third of the time, two thirds of the probability than the other two doors, but he wants to limit his exposure. So he should stick there.
*  So it's a kind of dual problem. You should stick with what he picked. And, you know, the relevance of that, let's say to COVID is you want to limit the number of people you come in contact with.
*  I mean, there are versions of this with 100 doors or whatever, but in any case.
*  And did you, do I remember in the book you claim, I might be completely misremembering this, but people are better at getting that version of the problem right than the original Monty Hall problem?
*  I think they are. I mean, maybe fear is, induces one to think more clearly than does greed, I'm not sure. Although greed does a good job too.
*  Greed does a pretty good job, but I think it's actually, maybe it's just not about thinking clearly, right? You know, I pretty firmly believe that the human brain was not evolved and optimized to do math problems, but there's sort of situations we find ourselves in that are analogous to math problems that we are.
*  That our brain is pretty good at and maybe being scared of something is closer to that instinctual correctness than looking out for a reward.
*  Yeah, I think that's true. I mean, you don't know, primitive man didn't need probability to realize if there's a rustling in the bush to run.
*  It's interesting because I've been thinking for various reasons, both teaching and research, about the arrow of time and the second law of thermodynamics recently.
*  And reading back in the history of it, or even hearing what modern physics professors tell their students, that there's this issue that came up in the 1870s about the number of ways a system can go from low entropy to high entropy versus the number it can go from high entropy to low entropy.
*  And the answer is those two numbers have to be exactly the same because the underlying symmetry of reversibility of the underlying system and Lohschmidt famously made this objection to Boltzmann.
*  But there's plenty of textbooks you can read that will tell you, no, there's more ways to go from low entropy to high than high to low.
*  And they're making the same mistake about conditional probabilities, I think. They're conditionalizing on starting in low entropy, which is a big cheat.
*  Yeah, no, that's an interesting point. Yeah, that's true. Actually, there's one kind of political instance of thermodynamics for lack of a better term.
*  And that's Baldini's principle that it's much easier, sometimes called the bullshit principle, much easier to produce bullshit than it is to refute it.
*  And Mark Twain had a similar comment. He said it's much easier to con people than it is to convince them they've been conned.
*  Oh, yeah, right. People don't want to believe that.
*  Yeah, I mean, so QAnon, conspiracy theorists, election deniers, once they publicly state the nonsense they believe, it's very hard to get them back.
*  Well, you've talked in this book and elsewhere a lot about pseudoscience and conspiracy theories and so forth.
*  What is the connection to numeracy or innumeracy there?
*  Well, I think it's just clear thinking there in that case. I mean, you've got to know some facts. You've got to know a modicum of arithmetic probability.
*  And if you don't, you're more easily fooled. I mean, the prosecutor's paradox is relevant, again, to the
*  conditional probability. There's some crime and there's a lot of evidence and they arrest somebody. If that person's innocent, the probability of the evidence, he was around the murder.
*  He did have big shoes. He did talk to people around there. So the probability that evidence, given he's innocent, is low. But that's not the relevant conditional probability.
*  The relevant conditional probability is the probability he's innocent, given the evidence. And the defense attorney will bring in all the other people who have these characteristics.
*  And the probability of innocence given evidence is much higher often than the probability of evidence given innocence.
*  But it's very easy if people don't understand about conditional probability or just conditional statements. They don't know the difference between if A then B and if B then A, which is basically what conditional probability is.
*  And this kind of feeds in with, in the case of the conspiracy theories, some kind of wishful thinking, right, or some kind of search for clarity in a simple system that covers everything.
*  And so maybe this is an example where human psychology and bad math work hand in hand to lead people to wrong conclusions.
*  Oh, that's definitely the case. In fact, cognitive portables in general are a big part of what leads people astray. And we're all vulnerable to the anchoring effect, availability error, confirmation bias.
*  One that doesn't get as much publicity is the conjunction fallacy. You have somebody that says he's a senator, US senator, and he's everybody, you know, he's very moderate, he's intelligent.
*  You know, rectitude is the word that comes to mind for everybody thinks of him. He lives modestly with his wife and his daughter, who's unfortunately very sick.
*  But in any case, given that background, what's more likely that this senator took a bribe from a lobbyist or that he took a bribe from a lobbyist and use the money to pay for his daughter's expensive operation?
*  Right. And most people say, well, or at least a lot of people, probably the latter, given what you said about him. But it's more likely that he took money from a lobbyist period because it's always easier to satisfy one condition than two or more conditions.
*  And what that has to do with the Internet and fake news is given the Internet, all kinds of odd facts, factoids, little details are available.
*  So it's easy to kind of cobble together a superficially plausible story. And there's this trade off between probability and plausibility.
*  And if you add more details, which you can glean from the Internet, your story becomes in a way more plausible, the same way this senator thinks it works, but less probable.
*  And, you know, if you're vulnerable, if you're gullible to begin with and you have all these seemingly precise details, you can fool people.
*  And a lot of this, what we're talking about is not maybe what I would necessarily think of as a math in the traditional math curriculum, so much as just logic and clear thinking.
*  Do you distinguish between these two things or is it all one set of sensible thoughts to you?
*  I guess it is possible to distinguish. I mean, it is a matter of clear thinking. But yeah, there are other components.
*  In fact, I mean, one thing I tried to do in my writing is kind of set up links between stories and statistics or narratives and numbers, whatever.
*  Even in my first book, Math and Humor, I talked about the similarities between jokes and mathematics.
*  Both math and jokes depend on logic, although the logic might be converted, the patterns might be different.
*  But you use some of the same tools we do to you out of absurdum for different reasons.
*  And humor and jokes is for the absurdum and math is to disprove something.
*  But there is a kind of continuum and the continuum between math and jokes is puzzles.
*  They're more substantial than jokes, but they do share with math also this aha moment.
*  And so in essence, puzzles are very mathematical and whether they're mechanical puzzles like Rubik's Cube, group theory and that or verbal puzzles like get money home.
*  So, you know, there are similarities. But I mean, there are, you know, so it is kind of a continuum.
*  There's not a chasm between here's numbers and here's narratives. There is a connection.
*  I mean, there's differences. One is that in mathematics or science, the logic is extensional.
*  If you have a proof or something every every time you have a three, you could put in square root of nine or cube root of twenty seven.
*  It doesn't make a difference. But you can't just a woman can't just say or a man can't just say, oh, the happiest day of my life was the 80th anniversary of 110th anniversary of Millard Fillmore's death.
*  Even if even if that was her way, it was the day. Yeah, it was the day.
*  But, you know, are you crazy that the happy anniversary is 110th anniversary?
*  So you can't do that. And also just the whole kind of psychological mindset that we do reading a story, science fiction or whatever, just for the enjoyment, you suspend disbelief.
*  Okay, let's go with it. But in math or science or statistics, you do just the opposite.
*  You suspend beliefs. So you're not bamboozled. You want to really prove it.
*  So there are lots of differences. But but still, they're both human endeavors and they're not totally distinct things.
*  Storytelling and theorem proving or number crunching.
*  Well, you have the word narrative right there in the title of the new book.
*  So it's clear that that that you recognize that. And I guess it is interesting how human beings we use math, but we love stories.
*  I recently did a podcast with Peter Dodds, who is a statistician, complex system theorists who made a quote that I will never stop quoting, which is never bring statistics to a story fight.
*  People love their stories. And I guess maybe I don't know how intentional it is or just seem to be the best way to do it.
*  But what you're doing in your books is telling people math and helping them learn math through the device of fun little stories.
*  Exactly. I like to use jokes, puzzles, anecdotes, little vignettes.
*  And you can often get the math across without rousing people's kind of too many people's and they if not fear discomfort with numbers or fear they're going to be judged.
*  But you get the same idea across without the formalism. I mean, there's a limit to it.
*  But but you can get a good deal of mathematics across with with stories.
*  In fact, one of my books, I think, therefore I laugh.
*  I was based inspired by a quote by Wittgenstein, who said you could write a good and serious book in philosophy that consisted entirely of jokes.
*  Where joke is interpreted very loosely, very loosely.
*  You get the joke, you get the relevant philosophical point.
*  And so the conceit in the book is here's a collection of stories, jokes, anecdotes that get points across.
*  Well, I'll confess, I have not actually read your books that discuss math and humor.
*  But now that you brought up the idea, I'm fascinated by the concept of a continuum between math and jokes.
*  It does make sense that there's this aha moment, right?
*  I mean, a joke is somehow confounding our expectations somehow and a math puzzle is somehow resisting immediate analysis.
*  Has there been, I don't know, academic work on the relationship between these two things?
*  Not too much. There are a couple of journals of humor that kind of touch on it.
*  But I mean, I think that's one of the appeal of counterintuitive results in math.
*  They're kind of like jokes like what? You can't do that.
*  It's continuous, but not differentiable.
*  And so I even in this book, I bring up some philosophical issues about Eugene Wigner and unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.
*  Narratives is a collection of metaphors.
*  Justified true belief is not equally knowledge.
*  I can tell that you had some philosophical background as well as the usual mathematical background.
*  Yeah, as an undergraduate, I skipped around.
*  I majored for a while in philosophy and English and physics.
*  I kept coming back to math, but I always wanted to write.
*  So in a sense, I do both.
*  Exactly the right thing.
*  So a lot of the examples we've been talking about here are either logic or probability.
*  There's a lot more to math than that, obviously.
*  If you were put in charge, if you were the emperor of math education now, what is it that you would say people should learn?
*  What is the minimum basic knowledge of math that one has to be numerate?
*  Well, facility with arithmetic, first of all.
*  And of course, probability and logic and notions in the philosophy of science.
*  I mean, just everyday notions like what's a placebo?
*  What's a double blind study?
*  Which most people are innocent of.
*  In fact, I just wrote a piece for three parts daily about quizzes for congressional aspirants.
*  I mean, any time you apply for a job, especially a high tech job, you are interviewed and they give you some problems.
*  Can you program this in Python or whatever?
*  But yet you can run for Congress, you can run for president, and there's no such test.
*  And perhaps there should be, although you'd have to drag people into it or shame them into it.
*  But you wouldn't have personal walkers saying, yeah, why are we making clean air?
*  We just send it to China and they send us dirty air and evolutions of hoax.
*  It's kind of embarrassing.
*  I do want to note your mention of three quarks daily.
*  That's one of our favorite websites here at the Winescape podcast.
*  So I'm glad that you put in a plug for that.
*  Oh, yeah, no, I enjoy it as well.
*  In fact, I write a kind of semi-regular column for them.
*  But let's take seriously this somewhat provocative idea that we should have standards for politicians or leaders or something like that.
*  And we should have standards, but it's very hard to get it right.
*  I mean, for various reasons in my Ask Me Anything episodes of the podcast,
*  I recently revealed my love as a high school kid for reading Robert Heinlein novels.
*  And Heinlein once said that you shouldn't be allowed to vote if you can't solve a quadratic equation.
*  And that seems a bit extreme to me.
*  I mean, I understand the motivation, but should politicians be allowed to run for office if they can't solve a quadratic equation?
*  Yeah, I think that's a bad example.
*  But being able to having some feel for like scaling, you can scale up things.
*  Every time I go to a movie, I'm always amazed you can get a soda that's eight inches high or 10 inches high.
*  And the 10 inch high one is 50 cents more than the 8 inch high one, even though it's probably what the volume is much greater or ordering a pizza.
*  So I mean, people don't realize that things scale up squares or cubes, geometric things,
*  but even the size of cities scale up with the fractional exponent, Jouffre West talked about that.
*  So it's a kind of basic notion that I think some people should have some idea about,
*  as well as being able to estimate things.
*  It's a very rough estimate. You get to tell somebody on part of Stateville, two miles high,
*  you don't have to know that exact height happens to be 1776 feet.
*  But two miles high, do you really realize that?
*  So some appreciation for normal estimates.
*  I mean, if you ask people, there's a study that's done that 42% of heart attacks occur on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
*  And people attribute this to heavy drinking and partying.
*  So I can see people saying, well, I better be careful.
*  But Friday, Saturday and Sunday is three sevenths of a week, which is 43%.
*  So I mean, the same thing, a four day holiday weekend, 400 people are going to die.
*  Thirty five thousand or more a year do die in the highway.
*  So it's normal four days.
*  So some feeling for relevant magnitudes, for scaling, for estimating, for sequencing,
*  some things you have to do in a certain order, there are lots of little puzzles like that.
*  And those don't involve quadratic equations, which I don't think that would be a reasonable requirement.
*  No, it's just memorizing a formula. Yeah, I do get that.
*  But it's interesting because all the examples you're giving are a little bit different than what we actually teach people in high school, right?
*  Or even in college. We take geometry and trigonometry, maybe calculus.
*  And I love all these subjects dearly.
*  But as far as I know, at least when I was in high school, we didn't take probabilities, statistics, scaling estimates, anything like that.
*  Are you are you implicitly suggesting a radical revision of the secondary school math curriculum?
*  Well, I mean, it's hard to generalize because some schools I think do and the best schools do.
*  But I don't know about a radical revision, but certainly an addition of such topics that are most relevant to politics, popular culture, everyday life.
*  I think, you know, scaling, as I said, estimation and so on, and just the ability to kind of think outside the box.
*  One thing I talk about in argument, so anti anti-abortionist that is, you know, is kind of fanciful, but it is interesting that people who are absolute, super absolutist with regard to banning abortion.
*  I think that it could be useful to kind of get them to admit that in certain cases, I'm not talking about rape or incest, but in certain regular cases, they should have abortion should be there.
*  And there's a story I like that I preface the abortion story with about George Bernard Shaw.
*  Supposedly, again, the story might be apocryphal, sitting next to a woman at this posh dinner party.
*  And he said, Would you sleep with me for a million pounds? And she says, Yes, I will.
*  And she laughs and giggles. And then she then he said, Would you sleep with me for 10 pounds?
*  And she says, No, what do you who do you think I am? And he says, Well, we already established that now we're just haggling about the details.
*  But, you know, it's a stupid story, sexist story, but it's relevant to this argument I'm going to make.
*  Imagine that because of some cosmic catastrophe or toxins in the environment or whatever, that women who became pregnant became pregnant with 10 to 20 fetuses.
*  That's one assumption. And two, imagine that advances in technology and birth procedures and neonatal technology enabled the doctors to save some or all of the fetuses if they intervene in the first three months.
*  So if that's the case, what would people who are absolutist opponents of abortion do if people got the woman got pregnant with 10 or 20 fetuses?
*  They can't just say, Well, we'll take some of them and let the other ones go because that's tantamount to abortion.
*  And so they'd have to to be maintain their position, they'd have to accept a 10 to 20 fold increase in birth rates, which I think they wouldn't do.
*  And so again, just to get away from the absolutist position and the relevance of that to the George Bernard Shaw story is once you get them off of this totally absolutist position, then the rest is haggling about the details.
*  You go for 15 weeks or 20 weeks or whatever.
*  I think the concept that the kinds of math that we teach people in high school or whatever, I really think that's something we should take much more seriously.
*  You know, I myself when it comes to science often complain that we teach science as a list of facts, right, a list of true things rather than as the process, the empirical hypothesis testing process, which is much more central to it.
*  And people come out not really understanding what to do with news stories about science in the media.
*  And I guess probably the same thing is true with math also, that there's a different kind of math that is equally good that would be way more relevant to people's reasoning in everyday circumstances.
*  Yeah, I think that's true, except in the case of physics or science in general, those stories do make it into popular press, whereas there's very rare that any breakthrough in or big result in mathematics will be written about.
*  But no, but I agree.
*  But I think it should be part of a general, I mean, general knowledge is important as well.
*  And it's, you know, and teaching wariness, skepticism, suspending belief and so on is important.
*  And it's connected to a lot of things.
*  I mean, it's interesting, I write about people who are most pro free enterprise have no problem accepting the complexity of an economy.
*  And they don't say, wow, how do they come into being all of a sudden?
*  But it does. You can go to any store in the country, any convenience store, and you can get a Snickers bar or half a gallon of milk and get any kind of clothes or shoes anywhere you want.
*  And nobody said how did this come into into being immediately?
*  But yet they make this some people make the intelligent design people so called, make the same make the comparable argument.
*  Look at it came out. How did life come into being so immediately?
*  How did this lie come into being?
*  And instead of saying well, to use the verboten word, it evolved the same way cities and economy evolved.
*  But they are most accepting of capitalism and least accepting of the analogous process when it comes to life.
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess this is a common theme of what you're saying is it's not just clear thinking, but a consistency of thinking across domains.
*  And people always talk about we should teach critical thinking or something like that.
*  I actually don't know whether or not that makes sense.
*  Is that something that can be taught in your experience?
*  To some extent, I mean, it does often devolve into something kind of silly.
*  But I mean, I think getting people to know a lot, not just facts, but the trends and connections between disparate fields like economics and evolution is I mean, if you if you know something, not a lot necessarily.
*  I mean, it helps if you know a lot, but you know something and are taught to bring bring things together to try to relate to have a kind of more holistic attitude towards knowledge.
*  I think that's that's a worthwhile endeavor.
*  But you're right. I mean, it's hard.
*  I'm not sure how you go about teaching critical thinking because people always are drawing me on to some fact.
*  The key, the key formula, the key thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And often there is no clear thing.
*  Well, and often it's sort of against their interests, right?
*  People don't want to reach certain conclusions and the human brain is really, really good at reaching the conclusions we want to reach, not the ones that the data are forcing us to go toward.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I mean, I talk a lot about logic, though, logic in the book and paradoxes and their relevance every day.
*  I mean, even in the stock market, the efficient market hypothesis says that information about a stock is immediately available to everybody.
*  But it most markets aren't all that efficient, but it's you can have a trade of kind of relevant example.
*  I relevant something that's relevant to the lawyers paradox.
*  Efficient market hypothesis is true to the effect that most people think it's not true.
*  Because if most people think it's not true, then they'll say, oh, there's a way I can make more money and they'll do all kinds of contortions, research that.
*  And by doing that, they'll make it efficient.
*  And if they already think it's efficient, then what's the worth of doing that?
*  That's every information, every bit of information is already priced in.
*  What do I want to do that for?
*  So a lot of these paradoxes are relevant to broader themes.
*  And again, to your point, that's generally not taught in a math class is hard there any class.
*  So you kind of have to come upon it yourself or or whatever.
*  I read who's counting. Yeah, exactly.
*  Read who's counting. Speaking of which, this is a perfect segue because I wanted to shift gears a little bit.
*  You have the new book out.
*  I have a new book that recently came out that also well, I wanted to contrast it a little bit because my in my new book, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe,
*  I try to teach people the basics of classical physics, the difference being from other books that I do the math, that I show them all the equations.
*  There's over 100 equations in the book all the way up to Einstein's equation.
*  And so one of the angles I try out when I come across a skeptic is who says, you know, I just don't understand equations.
*  I will never be able to understand it.
*  And I say, look, you understand two plus two equals four.
*  That's an equation. Right. And it's a matter of degree, not of kind to understand Einstein's equation.
*  It's just a little bit more complicated.
*  There's no such thing as people who can't understand equations.
*  It's just, you know, are you willing to do a little bit more work than you usually do?
*  So what do you think of that of that angle? Is that a plausible story?
*  I think so. I think, you know, Stephen Hawking allegedly said that if you put an equation in your book, you cut the readership by a half.
*  So if you put 100 equations in a book.
*  Very, very tiny.
*  But I think that's false.
*  But, yeah, you just have to have to do it carefully.
*  I mean, you have to embed the equation in a discussion in which it makes sense.
*  You can't just wall and say, here's the formulas.
*  But I think that's, you know, that's, you know, so I think that's a good idea.
*  I'm sure you did. I've read some of your stuff.
*  You do write very well and it is embedded in a context that gives it meaning.
*  Well, we tried, but I'm wondering about the level of abstraction, right?
*  I mean, now that I've done this experiment, I'm curious to see whether people enjoy it or not.
*  But when you talk about Einstein's equation for general relativity, you know, not equals MC squared, but R mu nu minus one half R g mu nu.
*  That is there's some journey that the learner has to go on to really wrap their heads around it.
*  And I'm just I'm wondering if it is really something that, you know, some people just aren't going to do or aren't willing to do.
*  Or is it could we teach everybody Einstein's equation and those other kinds of higher math that we're certainly not going to do in high school?
*  I think you could reach a lot of people.
*  I wouldn't say everybody, but you could reach many more people than I reached now because if it was done right.
*  Yeah. Give them the opportunity.
*  Yeah. Given the opportunity requiring your book.
*  Exactly. There you go. Fishing for that one.
*  But yes, but I mean, actually, sorry. Go ahead.
*  Now, I was just going to say, I mean, two and two equals four is always put forth as a standard simple fact.
*  But but everything is depends on context.
*  I mean, it's not always the case if you take two cups of popcorn and add two cups of water to it.
*  You get three cups of soggy popcorn, not not four.
*  So in that's I mean, so any bit of mathematics can be misapplied.
*  And there's a story of the bear hunters who became extinct shortly after they mastered vector analysis.
*  This before they had mastered the vector analysis, when they saw a bear to the northwest, they shot it.
*  But now that they know vector analysis, they see a bear to the northwest.
*  They shoot one arrow to the north and one arrow to the west and the bear gets away.
*  So and math like adding the integers and simple vector analysis, this silliness is is clear as apparent.
*  But if you get into more complex mathematics, you can say something equally stupid.
*  And and but it goes by.
*  It's very easy to intimidate people if you if you're a mathematician or a physicist, because people aren't going to challenge you.
*  You can say the most true, sound being nonsense.
*  Well, this is the famous anxiety people have when they take math classes about word problems, right?
*  Like you can memorize how to manipulate the equations and maybe get the right answer.
*  But if you need to translate from words into equations, that's harder.
*  But in some sense, that's by far the more important skill.
*  Yeah, exactly. It goes back to my narrative numbers continuum.
*  Yeah, there and that is by far more important.
*  You mentioned already the phrase the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and the what?
*  The unreal, the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and physics, which is a famous phrase from Eugene Wigner,
*  which, by the way, I'm a little skeptical that it's true, that it's unreasonably effective.
*  I kind of think that no matter what physics turned out to be, we would find math for it after the fact.
*  Right. I'm very skeptical of it.
*  We learn about numbers by playing with little pebbles and putting together.
*  You take this one and that one. That's addition.
*  Learn about geometry by looking at little twigs and extending them and making little triangles of them.
*  And also we learn about physics by our working through the walking through the world.
*  So mathematics is kind of an idealization and abstraction of everyday things that we do.
*  So I don't think it's all that unreasonable.
*  If you abstract, if you idealize what you do when you're playing with the pebbles and twigs and moving around,
*  it's not surprising you get a mathematics that's going to be effective.
*  It grew out of things that work.
*  But then there are some that's a great that's another great segue because I've been recently thinking in part
*  because I had a podcast interview with Justin Clark Doane, who is a philosopher of mathematics.
*  So I've been thinking about the foundations of mathematics and mathematical logic.
*  And it is the part of math that I understand the least.
*  I really, really struggle with like geometry and topology.
*  I can do. But when you get into proving relationships between models and axiom systems and things like that,
*  I just really, really struggle with it.
*  But am I correct that that's part of that was part of your mathematical research?
*  Yeah, yeah. My degree was in mathematics, but I was most interested in my thesis and papers were in logic and model theory and nonstandard logics.
*  And, yeah, I was interested, as I said, as an undergraduate in philosophy.
*  And that's still kind of mathematics that I know, at least initially was most interested in.
*  And I talk about GÃ¶del's theorem, but a nonstandard proof of it using ideas from complexity theory, Greg Chaitin.
*  And, yeah, so I think a little bit of some logic doesn't have to go too far.
*  But people don't know the difference being, you know, affirming a consequent and least laughing term.
*  I think they should. They don't have to be probably just focus on memorizing the terms instead of understanding them.
*  Can you say more about proving GÃ¶del's theorem using complexity theory?
*  Yeah, a sequence is random if the shortest program that generates it is about as long as the sequence itself.
*  And it's not random if you can generate, I mean, 010101, you can generate that by just saying 01 repeated a thousand times.
*  But you can never generate something more complex than the generating algorithm.
*  And so it uses that and various paradox to show that, you know, you can't speak loosely.
*  You can't generate 10 pounds of theorems from five pounds of axioms.
*  There's always going to be things or statements that you're not going to be able to prove because of the limited complexity of any logical system.
*  A nice example that's kind of silly, but I like various paradoxes.
*  You're in an elevator. You're very short. The building is very tall.
*  Press the first button that you can't reach.
*  By definition, you can't reach it.
*  So it's, you know, I sketch a little bit more than that.
*  But I like the Chaitin proof of GÃ¶del's theorem better because it's connected to more basic stuff about the notion of complexity.
*  Complexity is something that's in the world and is an important topic in computer science.
*  And from it follows GÃ¶del's incompleteness and without going through and looking at GÃ¶del numberings and so on.
*  No, that's fascinating. I didn't really know about it. So just to make sure I get it right.
*  I mean, GÃ¶del's theorem is saying that if you have a system that you assume is consistent, which you can't prove, right?
*  But if you assume it's consistent, there's roughly speaking going to always be statements that are true but unprovable in that system.
*  Yeah, that would be neither, you know, neither provable nor disprovable.
*  Right, right.
*  Just undecided.
*  And undecidable, exactly. And so what you're saying is that that kind of follows from a counting argument that you can just imagine that there's, I don't quite see the argument, but I get that it could be there.
*  That given a finite axiomatic system, you can only reach so many provable statements and there's a lot more out there that are neither provable nor disprovable.
*  Right. Beyond our, our or the system's complexity horizon.
*  And is that kind of higher level abstract mathematics also useful to people on the street?
*  You know, beyond conditional probabilities and things like that. Are these sort of wilder realms of mathematics also rewarding?
*  Rewarding, but I'm not sure it'd be useful to too many people on the street. They'd have to have a kind of theoretical bent, I guess.
*  But computer science is a big part of it is about classifying sets according to their complexity and getting algorithms that are harder and harder to break.
*  And quantum algorithms, but the regular ones involving prime numbers and simple facts about the number theory.
*  Right.
*  So in essence, I mean, they're important. I mean, there's G.H. Hardy, mathematician, once wrote a book called The Mathematician's Apology, in which case he said he only pure math and only number theory.
*  Pure number theory is the only thing that's that's worth our reverence and applied mathematics.
*  He acted like it was pornography or something. But actually somebody once wrote a review of his book, a one sentence review of G.H. Hardy's apology.
*  And he said the world sickens from such cloistered cloning.
*  The funny thing is that number theory, which he thought was so pure, you couldn't carry on a modern economy without being able to transfer trillions of dollars over oceans and around the world instantaneously.
*  So this even number theory was very applied. You can't tell what's applied.
*  And the same thing in relativity and Minkowski, Riemann and so on.
*  They weren't talking about physics, but they constructed the tools.
*  It's also fascinating to me how people get worked up about these mathematical issues.
*  I was just reading a little bit about Georg Kontor and his proof of the different kinds of infinity and how, I guess, Leopold Kronecker really gave him a hard time,
*  like really just tried to ruin his career because he had proven that there were different kinds of infinity.
*  Yeah, right. There's only the integers and everything else is made up.
*  I've been wondering again for research level reasons.
*  Do we really need infinity or do we really need a continuous infinity or could we just imagine that reality just works on either a finite or at least a countable set of things?
*  And we're sort of kind of just amusing ourselves, but not really making productive understanding of the universe by thinking about all these more difficult levels of infinity.
*  That's a good question. I don't know.
*  I mean, it's a very beautiful subject, transfinite arithmetic and transfinite set theory in general.
*  But I don't know.
*  But one thing about Kronecker, he said only the integers exist, but there's lots of connections between the two.
*  But one that I find and discuss in the book is the number E, 2.718 and so on, which plays a big role in math.
*  Finance, everything else, all kinds of instances.
*  But this one I like. You tell people to look at their computer or phone and randomly pick a real number between zero and a thousand.
*  OK, you have to pick rational if you're doing it with a computer, but still it's close enough.
*  So pick a real number between zero and a thousand.
*  Then keep on doing it until the sum of the real numbers you've picked is over one thousand.
*  OK, so I pick 502, 308, 607.
*  The third number would be over.
*  So if you have a whole many, many people do this or you do it yourself many, many times,
*  the average number of numbers you have to choose before you get a sum over a thousand is E.
*  Which seems, really?
*  That seems weird.
*  Yeah, so that's weird.
*  I mean, so Kroniker was even his beloved just integers, positive integers, give rise to the number E, which is irrational, transcendental and so on.
*  It is. Yeah, I get that it's hard to get around the appearance of these numbers.
*  You know, one of my favorite blog posts I ever wrote was on Pi Day, you know, Pi Day, March 14th, which is also Einstein's birthday.
*  And so I wrote about the fact that in Einstein's equation that we were just talking about, the one for general relativity, the right hand side is 8 pi g T mu nu.
*  And so pi appears there in the equation for gravity.
*  And why is that? And, you know, it's a very interesting story having to do with the fact that spheres have pi in them when you calculate the area of a sphere.
*  And Isaac Newton gave us a law for forces rather than for fields.
*  So all these numbers are there.
*  Yeah, maybe maybe that's a good reason not to try to discretize the world too much.
*  Yeah, I think you can.
*  I mean, actually, you look at Ramanujan, a famous Indian mathematician who died early.
*  He has he came up with all sorts of crazy identities that that involve pi and E and infinite sums.
*  And and you say, oh, did he ever come to that?
*  And he did. Nobody I mean, that G.H. Hardy writes about him.
*  He said it is the only I'm paraphrasing it, but the only person he ever loved of platonically is more for him.
*  It would be was Ramanujan.
*  I mean, he just fell in love with the amazing kind of resonance that Ramanujan had with the mathematical universe.
*  Yeah, Ramanujan is a great example, almost as a counterexample, but as a version of this this idea that I like to mention that the human brain is not meant to do math.
*  We have to train ourselves, right?
*  You know, we're meant to make rough and ready things, rough and ready estimates, but not so much more precise calculations.
*  But not all brains are equal at it.
*  And he is an example of someone who really did in a way that no one understands seem to just see things out there in the world of the natural numbers and continued fractions and things like that that were pretty amazing.
*  It is. And to this day, incomprehensible.
*  How did he come to that?
*  He didn't necessarily believe in proofs.
*  I mean, Hardy had a he came from India and Hardy gave him some conventional mathematics where we proved things.
*  And he often just intuited it in some sense.
*  And so a lot of his amazing results are just statements.
*  And then people, mathematicians, work feverishly.
*  Oh, yeah, I proved it.
*  It makes you wonder, do you have feelings about the future of artificial intelligence as mathematical proof generator?
*  Could we could we get a lot more proofs for theorems once the AIs really get good at it?
*  I think so. Yeah, it's hard to make predictions.
*  But yeah, I think so.
*  And not just mathematics. I mean, everyday life, everyday humans sometimes I fear.
*  And I do want to give you a chance to there was one little piece of advanced math that appeared in the book that I thought was very amusing.
*  And I would like to understand better myself.
*  So, you know, it's getting late in the podcast. We can you can indulge ourselves a little bit, which is Ramsey theory.
*  You use it as an example of how complexity appears in unexpected places.
*  So I'll give you a chance to explain that a little bit.
*  Now, Ramsey theory is just the idea that with a big enough set and a big enough number of connections among the elements,
*  you're going to have necessarily have some bit of order.
*  The order is going to be there if you if you have six six points and you connect them with lines, six nodes, you connect them with lines.
*  There's necessarily going to be some of them with blue lines, some of them with red lines.
*  There's necessarily going to be a triangle where all three are the same.
*  And results of that sort and with bigger sets, you need you need a much bigger set to have more order.
*  But it's impossible to to not have any bit of order.
*  In fact, I mean, in general, that's an idea I've always liked that the the impossibility of total disorder,
*  because if you have total disorder on a higher level, in a sense, those order, I mean, that's a statistical mechanics,
*  I mean, disorder. And then at the higher level, you get that you get a definition of temperature, which is more macro.
*  And there are other elements like Kaufman, you connect light bulbs in some random way on and off.
*  And if you have some rule, if two of the three inputs are on, it'll go on or off.
*  And no matter how kind of random you make the rules, after a while you get some pattern that keeps appearing.
*  And I mean, it's like the game of life.
*  I mean, you get these random things become computers and Wolfram's work and Conway's life, a life game and so on.
*  So order arises no matter what, which I find an intriguing kind of result in a kind of generalized sort of way.
*  Yeah, I'll confess, I don't completely understand it myself.
*  I would love to understand this better because I do know there are these examples which are very provocative, like you just said, of orderliness emerging.
*  Emergent is the word that I would that I would like to use out of the underlying lack of order.
*  But I don't understand how robust it is.
*  Is it inevitable? Does it always happen? Or are we cherry picking examples where it happens?
*  And I'm just not really sure.
*  I think, you know, again, I'm just talking off the top of my head here, but I think it always happens.
*  It just maybe takes takes longer in some cases, but which is kind of a weak result.
*  Oh, it's very, very important if it's true. Yeah, that's why I don't know.
*  It would be nice to have a I don't know.
*  There's probably other people who do know much more than I do about that.
*  But yeah, but OK, so good.
*  We've indulged ourselves a little bit of less practical mathematical speculation.
*  But to bring it back to to to close things up, you know, you've done an enormous amount for spreading the word of mathematics, as it were, to a broad set of people.
*  And I'm sure in various ways, large and small, you've gotten pushback about is this elitist?
*  Is it paternalistic? You know, are you just getting annoying people for letting them or for making them not just get on with their lives and thinking about all this abstract stuff?
*  So how do we get people excited and interested and educated about math in a way that doesn't come across as elitist and paternalistic?
*  I don't know. I don't think elitism is part of it.
*  I don't see why. Here's some interesting stuff relevant to some stuff you might be interested in.
*  Here's how it works. Why that's viewed as elitist.
*  I mean, of course, it is by a lot of people.
*  I mean, one of the reasons for Trump, I mean, resentment drives a lot of his base.
*  But I don't I don't buy it.
*  I mean, just because somebody feels that presenting mathematics, presenting physics, presenting history, I mean, looking at something seriously, trying to understand it, relating it to other things.
*  That's not elitist. That's human.
*  Well, and maybe not to present this as a leading answer, but I think that being human, being warm, being engaging, being likable is probably goes a longer way toward making the math palatable than we want to admit.
*  It's not all just about the math. We're still human beings at the end of the day.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I mean, if you are a very dour look on your face and hit your students on the knuckles with a ruler and tell them to go sit in the corner with a dunce cap.
*  Yeah, you're not that's not a way to get them to appreciate or love mathematics, physics, history.
*  I mean, yeah, you're right. I mean, I think it's easier to learn from a from a professor or from anybody if you in a sense like them or can kind of map yourself onto them in some way.
*  I mean, if that person who's enlightening you to use that term is kind of repellent, you're not going to want to learn much from that person.
*  You did mention in passing that big stories in physics get more play in the news or in science than big stories in math do.
*  Do you think that's changing? Do you think that there's more and better math outreach and public engagement today than there was 50 years ago?
*  I think there is. But science is something that people understand.
*  I mean, they don't understand the details, but they know that the moon's up there and the universe is expanding and light goes this fast.
*  And, you know, and even just speculative theories, multiverse and so on.
*  That's something that engages people's imagination.
*  And so there can be more stories about advances in physics or science or biology as well.
*  Whereas math, I mean, you get a new result and consequence of the axiom of choice or a Bonhoch theorem.
*  You can take a part of the sphere and put it together and make it twice as large.
*  I mean, it strikes people as just, you know, that's just hopeless focus. That's, you know, mathematicians, you know, whatever.
*  So, I mean, but as far as outreach in general, I think STEM is more widely understood as why it's important.
