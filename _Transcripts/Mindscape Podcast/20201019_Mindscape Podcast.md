Video Description: In the service of seeking truth, there would seem to be value in intellectual diversity, both in keeping ourselves honest and in the possibility of new ideas coming from unexpected quarters. That’s true in the natural sciences, but even more so in the humanities and social sciences, where the right/wrong distinction is sometimes less clear. But academia isn’t always diverse; as an empirical fact, there are a lot more liberals on university faculties than there are conservatives. I talk with Musa al-Gharbi about why this is true — self-selection? discrimination? — the extent to which it’s a real problem, and how we should better think about the value of diverse viewpoints.

Musa al-Gharbi received Masters degrees in philosophy from the University of Arizona and in sociology from Columbia University. He is currently a Paul F. Lazarsfeld Fellow in Sociology at Columbia, and until recently served as the Communications Director for Heterodox Academy. His essays have appeared in outlets such as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Atlantic Magazine, Foreign Affairs, Voice of America, and Al-Jazeera.

# Mindscape 119 | Musa al-Gharbi on the Value of Intellectual Diversity
**Mindscape Podcast:** [October 19, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_3auwIV-cc)
*  Hello everyone and welcome to the Mindscape Podcast. I'm your host, Sean Carroll. And
*  if you're like me, nothing makes you happier than talking to people you disagree with.
*  Most of us, I think, go out of our way to surround ourselves with people with utterly
*  different perspectives. It's so boring, so tiresome to talk to people who think you're
*  right. What we would like is to always be talking to people who have completely wrong
*  ideas from our point of view. Well, anyway, that's what we tell ourselves sometimes. Most
*  of us would actually say, if you asked, yes, of course, I love having a diverse selection
*  of opinions exposing themselves to me all the time. But in fact, in practice, sarcasm
*  aside, many of us find it more comfortable, find it more easy to be surrounded by people
*  we kind of agree with, or at least when we disagree, it's in relatively mild ways. And
*  the Academy, colleges and universities is no different from that. And the Academy, for
*  various reasons, has leaned toward the liberal side of the spectrum for a very long time.
*  And I think it's true, I think that the data back up the idea that it's becoming more liberal
*  over time. So we can ask why this is, we can ask whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.
*  And that's what we're going to do today in our discussion. I'm going to talk to Musa
*  Algarbi, who is a sociologist, a member of Heterodox Academy for a long time, and someone
*  who's really, I think, done a very good job of sort of putting people's feet to the fire
*  in the public sphere in being honest about their commitment to intellectual diversity.
*  This is probably a good place for me to tell a story that Musa actually told while we were
*  recording, but due to technical glitches, the recording didn't come through. So I'm
*  going to try to tell it not quite as well as he did, but it helps illuminate his perspective
*  where he's coming from. When he was a graduate student at the University of Arizona, he was
*  a teacher there, an instructor there, he wrote an article for a left-wing publication that
*  was critical of the US military. It pointed out that the military's activities in the
*  Middle East have worked to destabilize things, that the military had conducted torture and
*  mistreated prisoners and so forth. Various claims that you may or may not agree with
*  or you may not like the framing of them, but they're certainly within the realm of acceptable
*  opinions that you should be able to have about these things. But because his name sounds
*  kind of Arabic and because he's Muslim and he made critical remarks about the US military,
*  this was picked up by Fox News. Fox News started a little campaign, they criticized him, this
*  caught on in other right-wing outlets, let's say that, and he got a lot of death threats
*  and things like that. The University of Arizona disowned him and said, it wasn't us, please
*  don't take away our funding, that kind of thing. And interestingly, what Moose's response
*  to this was, was to say, what I should do is write for more right-wing outlets. If he's
*  just talking to people who are already ready to hear the message that he has, then he's
*  not doing as much good as if he reaches a different kind of audience. And so he has
*  done that, writing for National Review and elsewhere, and of course being active in Heterodox
*  Academy. And his claim is that this has helped him be a better scholar and thinker, because
*  you have to really think about what you're saying when you think that the audience you're
*  saying it to might start out being skeptical. So I don't think we're going to come up with
*  any answers here. I don't agree with Moose on everything. He doesn't agree with me on
*  There you go, right? But the point is, I'm not giving this podcast as a solution to the
*  solution to these problems. I think it's a conversation we should be having. After all,
*  as I mentioned in the podcast, when it comes to hiring new people for your department,
*  it kind of makes sense. You're more likely to hire people you think have correct ideas
*  than incorrect ideas, right? We all know that astronomy departments don't want to hire
*  astrologers. We all know that physics departments don't want to hire flat earthers or anything
*  like that. And you can say, well, those are facts, they're not values. But I think you
*  can make the case we don't want political science departments to hire objectively pro-fascist
*  or pro-Nazi point of views. We don't want child development departments to hire pedophiles
*  or pro-pedophile advocates. There are some ideas we don't want to engage with. So why
*  is it the case that a large majority of academics turn out to be liberals or leftists? Is it
*  because people who are conservatives select themselves out or is it because conservatives
*  are discriminated against? And you'll be not at all surprised, I think, to learn that it's
*  both like many of these things actually are. So I'm on the left side of things myself,
*  as you may have gathered over the course of many podcasts, but I actually do want to think
*  that it's better to be surrounded by a diverse set of ideas, but ideas that sort of, even
*  if I don't agree with them, I think they have something to offer. And I think this is actually
*  hopefully reflected in the selection of podcast guests that I have. I am very interested in
*  talking to people I do disagree with, but only those who I think have something to offer.
*  And that's an interesting and very difficult distinction to try to make. So I'm not being,
*  I don't have a feeling of superiority here with any of my academic colleagues. I recognize how
*  hard it is to truly walk the walk when it comes to intellectual diversity, but I think it's an
*  important thing to try to do and to try to understand what its limits as well as what its
*  benefits really are. So that's what we're going to try to do. Let's go.
*  Musa Algarbi, welcome to the Mindscape Podcast.
*  Hey, it's good to be here. Thank you for having me.
*  I think this is going to be a fun conversation. I have planned it out even less than I usually
*  plan out my podcast conversations, because there's a lot of issues that are kind of tied into each
*  other in different ways where it's hard to extract a narrative from the beginning to the end, but I
*  hope we can talk about a bunch of them. And there are also fraught issues, right? These are issues
*  that are intellectually important, but also politically and emotionally fraught. So that's
*  what I really liked about a lot of the things that I read on your website, a lot of your essays,
*  is that you're clearly trying to be fair and analytical and rigorous about these fraught issues.
*  So maybe the best way to dive in is through the first essay that I read, which introduced me to
*  your work, which was about the Heterodox Academy, where you've worked for a while and have stepped
*  down from. So maybe you could set the stage a little bit by telling us about Heterodox Academy,
*  and especially in the article I read, it was about some of the more recent challenges that
*  it's been facing. Sure. So the objective of Heterodox Academy is to promote constructive
*  disagreement and open inquiry and viewpoint diversity in institutions of higher learning.
*  By viewpoint diversity, we take a more holistic approach, which includes diversity along the
*  more standard demographic dimensions that most people in academia already care about, more or
*  less. For instance, race, gender, socioeconomic status, geography, which is, I guess, a lot of
*  people... It's not controversial, but it's under emphasized. But then also including ideological
*  diversity, and we focus a lot on the... Which by that we mean mostly religious and political
*  diversity, although that's not the full extent of ideological diverse. Yeah. So the organization was
*  founded to promote those things. And basically, it's been an epic journey
*  through the organization over the time that I was involved with it. So we were formed in early 2015,
*  and at that time, most people, including the founders of Heterodox Academy, were assuming
*  that Hillary Clinton was going to win the presidency. And so we were engaging in this
*  conversation from a standpoint of assuming that those of us on the left were coming from a position
*  of, I guess, strength and could afford to... And should be more generous, right? Generous in victory
*  or whatever, however you want to frame that. But then the election didn't go the way that a lot of
*  people were expecting. And so the message... And so trying to engage with others on the left about
*  why this was important and about why they should care about it in the age of Trump at a time when
*  they're very concerned about... When they're seeing horrible things happening all the time,
*  and their people are panicked and uncertain and freaking out about the future and where he's...
*  The president is saying repugnant things and they're assuming that his supporters must also
*  be of a similar mind or else why would they have voted for him, etc. So trying to make the case
*  for why these things are important in the climate we found ourselves in shortly after we were formed
*  was a very different sort of landscape to navigate than the one we had initially been
*  expecting to enter. And then after the election, it got worse. There are these major campaigns to
*  try to basically troll students who are... Especially students who are shaken up by the
*  election and the way it went. And so higher ed became issues about... And so oftentimes these
*  people who are trying to troll these students got their reactions they were looking for. There were
*  these big altercations, blowups in campuses nationwide. So by the trolls, you mean people
*  inviting especially provocative speakers to campus hoping to get a rise and a cancellation
*  so they could act canceled and like the victims? Is that what you mean? Absolutely. So sometimes
*  people are invited to campus and they have something... Because they have something
*  substantive to contribute to the conversation and the people want to hear them for that reason.
*  And even if they're controversial, that wish should be respected, right? They should have
*  the right to hear from the people that they're trying to engage with or learn from, even if
*  they're people that we disagree with. But in some cases, in many of these cases, people were inviting
*  people like Milo Yiannopoulos, who doesn't have anything particular to say. His whole shtick was
*  literally just trying to provoke people. And he would write essays about this. He had one in
*  Breitbart that was something like, how you can beat me, but spoiler, you won't, basically.
*  Or he was saying something like, I'm going to come to your area. I'm going to try to trigger you.
*  I'm going to get the reaction I'm looking for because even though you know what I'm trying to do,
*  you won't be able to resist giving me the reaction I'm looking for. And that will, etc. So there are
*  these people, there became this whole kind of dynamic where a lot of groups would be inviting
*  speakers to campus, basically just to troll other people to get a reaction. Yeah. And then when they
*  got the reaction they were looking for, it made them seem like their opponents were reactionaries
*  who, you know, and again, they were kind of being reactionary. They didn't have to give the people,
*  they didn't have to give the reaction that these people were trying to solicit. But it's also,
*  at the same time as we recognize that, it's also important to recognize that the people they were
*  engaging with weren't necessarily engaging in good for self. Yeah, everyone is dragged down a little
*  bit by this. Yeah. And so this was the environment in which Heterodox Academy was trying to find its
*  footing. So there are these major blowups at campuses nationwide. There was a significant
*  uptick in fire and professors being fired for political speech on the left and the right. On
*  the right, mostly led by Fox News oriented, you know, Fox News campaigns, which I have some
*  personal experience with. And then on the left, you know, a lot of times it was sort of student-led
*  campaigns to get someone fired for saying something they didn't like or otherwise
*  referencing. And it escalated even to the point of physical clashes in some cases,
*  culminating, I would say, probably with the death of Heather Heyer at University of Virginia.
*  And so, you know, we recognize that, I guess, our initial approach to the problem, which was like,
*  here, let's make some arguments and present some data about why this is important. Like,
*  that wasn't going to cut it for the kind of problem, the kind of situation that we were
*  facing post-2016. So we tried to be a lot more systematic in how we thought about the problems
*  and tried to address them. We started developing different tools and resources. We developed a
*  robust, a much more robust organizational structure to help move projects along, a much,
*  a different membership structure to fold more people into the project and sort of pull their
*  ideas and information and resources and stuff and disseminate them. And so now Heterodox Academy is,
*  we have, I guess they have about 4,500 members who are primarily faculty, but also grad students and
*  administrators from all around the country. I stepped down in January of 2020, and so I haven't
*  been like super involved with a lot of the sort of day-to-day operational stuff there. But, yeah,
*  at the time I left, we were a very different organization from the one we started with. We
*  had a totally different approach to talking about and engaging on these problems. And, yeah, it was
*  just a pretty wild journey. It's interesting because it's sort of the flip side of, not maybe
*  not the flip side, but a different version of what Will Wilkinson told me about. I had him on the
*  podcast and he works for a libertarian think tank, the Niskanen Center, and they had plans
*  for what happened when Hillary Clinton would get elected. Namely, they would work closely with
*  people in Congress to sort of nudge everyone in a more libertarian direction and reach across the
*  aisle and so forth. And all of those plans went very much out the window when the actual election
*  results came in. But there's sort of how we respond to the moment and then there's the bigger picture.
*  So I'm sure that there's plenty of listeners who have heard of the issue of intellectual diversity
*  in the academy, but maybe don't know some of the numbers. So the background fact that you're
*  responding to, and we can talk about what the right response is, but there is a fact, namely,
*  that professors in the academy are on average much more liberal than people in the country. And then
*  is that good or what can we do about it? Tell us about the founding impulse for having something
*  like Heterodox Academy. Yeah, well, I'll say at the outset, actually, one ironic thing,
*  I guess one ironic thing about our whole positioning in the lead up to the election is
*  that we were assuming, like everyone, I guess the leadership of Heterodox Academy was assuming,
*  as were most people, that Hillary Clinton was going to win. But part of the reason people had
*  that overconfidence that Hillary Clinton was going to win, ironically, was because there was a certain
*  kind of groupthink that had set in along the expert class. It's the very kind of problem.
*  There you go.
*  Heterodox Academy was supposed to be responding to. I was one of the people who had predicted the
*  election would go the other way consistently starting in March 2016. But my view was not the
*  predominant view in the organization or in general. And so, yes. But so basically,
*  the Academy skews about, you know, most people in the general population aren't hardcore,
*  progressive or conservatives. And that's true in the Academy, too. There's a lot of people who are
*  moderates, but people who are highly educated and especially people who are highly educated tend to
*  be more partisan than the general population. So there are once you once you say when you have
*  among those who are in academia, you're much more you're less likely to be kind of in that
*  middle centrist kind of position. You're someone who's more likely to be decisive, you know,
*  more decisively on the left or right. And among those who work in higher ed, it's the ratio is
*  something like 10 to one left to right in social research fields and about five to one left to right
*  in the Academy overall. And in terms of political diversity, and that matters.
*  That matters for a number of reasons. I'll say so some examples of how it matters. It matters in
*  terms of how questions are sort of framed and understood. So for instance, is inequality
*  a problem? In what senses or is it a problem? Or is it a phenomenon that should be sort of understood
*  on its own terms? The predominant approach is to start by assuming inequality is a problem that
*  must be rectified. And it's a problem that that is described as originating in very particular ways.
*  For instance, it's pretty much exclusively the actions of people in the dominant class,
*  whatever dimension of inequality you're looking at, socioeconomic, racial, gender,
*  sexual orientation, whatever dimension you're looking at, it's people in the dominant class.
*  So whites, men, rich people, heterosexuals, whatever, who are responsible for inequality
*  and its rectification. And there's sort of an asymmetrical way in which these problems are
*  discussed. And there's a value to that. But at the same time, there's a lot that's sort of over,
*  it's a highly in virtue of being a highly constrained sort of conceptual field. There are
*  a number of phenomenon and dimensions of these problems which go underexplored or not explored
*  at all. And that can often undermine our ability to actually understand and address the problems
*  that we're trying to solve. And it's not just, in addition to the sort of, I guess, epistemological
*  problems related to the lack of viewpoint diversity in higher ed, there are also sort of
*  more pragmatic problems about the reach of our research and the impact of our research and the
*  viability of our research. So for instance, you know, most people in the country are religious,
*  but social researchers tend to be pretty not religious and kind of uncomfortable talking
*  about religion or talking about things in religious ways. And so this undermines,
*  in a world where people were more comfortable talking and engaging with these different kind
*  of metaphysical and moral frameworks, we would be more effective at activism, we would be more
*  effective at making the case to policymakers in some cases, we would be more effective at convincing
*  ordinary people about why what we do matters and should be supported. And to the extent that people
*  don't, that people in the general population don't feel like their views or their values or people
*  like them in general are represented in institutions of higher learning, they don't necessarily feel
*  like they have a stake in those institutions and in fact often support them being, you know, cut
*  monitored, surveilled, interfered with, because they assume that it's other people who are sort of,
*  that it's some class of people who are not like them using these institutions to attack or ignore
*  or override the will of people like them, etc. So in addition to the epistemological consequences,
*  I guess the short is, we also, a lot of academics have a difficult time engaging with the public and
*  policymakers and about our work as a result of these same shortcomings.

*  My reaction is that there's so many things to unpack here, and it's fascinating and difficult
*  to get it all right. I think the most important thing I want to talk about is why, if and why,
*  and when, and under what circumstances, intellectual diversity is important. But let me not ask that
*  right away because you've already given some basic answers and I want to dig into it deeper, but
*  there's some things I know are going to instantly be brought up in people's minds, like, okay,
*  if there's a five to one ratio of liberals to conservatives in academia, why is that? And
*  number two, let's just stick with number one there for a second. I mean, what are the best
*  explanations? Is it because liberals are smarter and better professors, or is it because conservatives
*  are discriminated against by narrow-minded liberals, or is it because conservatives self-select out and
*  they join industries or think tanks? And how do we even know what the answer is?
*  Yeah, so it's a complicated phenomenon, and the short answer is that it seems to be a combination
*  of, I would say it's primarily a combination of discrimination and self-selection, and those two
*  things are related to each other. So, for instance, and the reason we know that it's not that
*  conservatives are just intrinsically bad scholars or are not interested in the academy or, you know,
*  these kinds of narratives is a few things. One, that until the mid-90s or so, the ratio of liberals
*  to conservatives in the academy was much different. So Sam Abrams, a political scientist at Sarah
*  Lawrence College, has some good data on this. You really saw this shift happen in the professoriate
*  around the mid-90s, and it's a shift that corresponds to changes in the political
*  makeup of the geographical areas of the country, where universities tend to be located as well,
*  interestingly enough. So I think part of the shift is responding to sort of broader
*  socio-cultural trends in higher ed. One thing that happened around this time, actually a little bit
*  prior, but kind of around this time, is that think tanks became more of a thing.
*  And so you saw the emergence of, you know, heritage. Brookings had existed before that, but,
*  you know, Heritage, Cato, other institutions like this. So for libertarians or conservatives who felt
*  ill at ease in the academy, because even though the ratios were much closer than they are today,
*  the academy has been a consistently left-skewed institution for as long as, I mean, there's
*  research on this going back to decades. It's had a pretty consistent left skew, but it hasn't been,
*  but it wasn't like it is today. So what you saw, I would say around the mid-90s,
*  is you saw the emergence of these sort of alternative academic centers where people
*  could do research and they could pursue the kinds of questions they wanted to pursue and using the
*  methods they wanted to pursue without worrying about their ideas being spiked, for instance,
*  in peer review or institutional review boards and things like this. We do know that there is
*  a number of biases in things like peer review, institutional review boards, hiring and promotion
*  committees. We know this from empirical research. It's not just along the political dimension,
*  it's actually along a lot of dimensions. So along race, for instance, along gender lines,
*  along the lines of sexuality in many cases. But the political and religious dimension is one
*  dimension in which this kind of discrimination occurs. And then there becomes this kind of
*  self-reinforcing dynamic where a lot of people go into the academy thinking that an academic
*  career is out of their reach because the academy is skewed and the skew is increasing. And there
*  are these potential concerns about discrimination and things like that. So they don't even try
*  necessarily to even become a professor. They instead plan from the outset to move on to a
*  think tank afterwards, et cetera. And so you see this kind of self-selection effect that is
*  responding to perceived discrimination. And so it's kind of a weird gnarly feedback loop that
*  we're in right now. And so this is the point. One of the things that I talked about in a couple of
*  my essays is that the goal of an organization like Heterodox Academy isn't to have the academy,
*  have institutions of higher learning perfectly mirror the ideological base rates in the general
*  population. Or the goal is to create conditions under which regardless of what one's ideological
*  sensibilities are, your work is going to be that you're not going to be subject to this kind of
*  discrimination and that there's not this kind of capture over certain institutions and especially
*  certain sort of sub fields of knowledge. One interesting thing that you see, I'll just note
*  also about the conservatives that are in the academy today, is that for the ones that didn't
*  exit the academy, most of them increasingly they try to work on topics that are non-controversial,
*  that don't dive into political things. And they kind of try to stay on the DL about what their
*  political leanings are. And there's a few reasons for this. Again, part of it is that they're
*  worried about having their work spiked and things like peer review or whatever. But then part of it
*  too is they don't want to end up being that person who they walk into the room and everyone rolls
*  their eyes or they have something to say. So there's kind of a social dimension to this that also
*  matters. No one wants to be a pariah in their department or anything like that.
*  So mostly a lot of the conservatives who remain in the academy today try to work on sort of non-
*  political issues and or try to keep their political leanings kind of close to the vest. And so one
*  consequence of that, ironically though, is that we're not even able to reap the epistemic benefits,
*  I guess, of the ideological diversity that is in the academy. Because what of it there is,
*  it's kind of concealed in many cases. And so we've been talking about the political dimension,
*  but this is also true, like I said, along other lines, along religious lines.
*  I want to actually use this as a sort of jumping off point for digging a little bit more deeply
*  into this justification for when and why intellectual diversity is important. Because
*  there's certainly a tension going on here. On the one hand, I think that a lot of people,
*  if you just ask, is diversity important along intellectual as well as other dimensions,
*  they would probably give a sort of boilerplate positive response to that. Like some million
*  idea of the free market of ideas, let a whole bunch of things be bounced around. But there's the,
*  on the other hand, we have people who are lifelong committed to their intellectual
*  endeavors, and they think that certain points of view are correct, and certain points of
*  view are incorrect. And I'm a natural scientist, so I see that in very non-political contexts,
*  where certain departments have nothing but string theorists in them, and other departments will
*  never hire a string theorist. And so how do you balance the idea that, you know, I'm sure
*  that I'm sure I'm very, I shouldn't say sure, I'm very open to the idea that people with
*  liberal political leanings will end up discriminating de facto against people with
*  conservative political leanings. How do you separate that out from just a substantive
*  belief that these people are on the wrong track? I mean, I think, I think it, I think the
*  discrimination is fundamentally rooted in, as you said, in this, in this exactly, it's funny.
*  There's this tension in surveys, there's a sociologist at Columbia, his name is Seamus
*  Kahn, and along with Colin Jerewmak, who wrote this great essay on what's called the attitudinal
*  fallacy, which is basically, basically what they argue is that in order to understand what people
*  actually believe, it's not enough to kind of like ask them questions, but to look at behaviors,
*  right? So in the abstract, when you ask people, do you support free speech? Do you support
*  diversity? Do you support anything like, like, as you said, people overwhelmingly say yes, but then
*  when they're faced with difficult cases in their local context, and in fact, you don't even have
*  to look at actual behaviors in the world, because sometimes you can actually elicit a similar effect
*  when you just present them with concrete cases, even in, even in polling. So for instance, one
*  essay that I did was focused on the results of a of a Cato Institute survey on free expression on
*  campus. And so when they asked students, like, do you support viewpoint diversity? Do you think
*  people with controversial views should be able to speak on campus, etc. People overwhelmingly said,
*  yes, yes, yes, great, great, great. But then when and you but then you present them with like specific
*  examples, like this, do you think that, you know, this wasn't from the study, but like off the top
*  my head, like, do you think that someone who, you know, is a is a hardcore sort of trans
*  exclusionary feminist should be allowed to speak on campus? Right? A lot of people who said, oh,
*  yes, viewpoint diversity, go, I don't know about that, though. Or, or should we invite someone who,
*  should we engage with someone who says who wants to do a talk about, about inequality,
*  but focused on the role of African Americans in, in, in the perpetuation of racial inequality?
*  They'll be like, Well, I don't know about that, though. Or, you know, you can go on down the
*  road. Right? So if you ask them in general, do you support this? Do you support engaging with views
*  that you disagree with? Everyone says, Yes, of course, I do. I'm open minded. Everyone thinks
*  they're open minded, everyone, you know, etc. But then when you present them with cases that
*  actually challenge their core beliefs, then they're like, ah, and this is a phenomenon that
*  you can see in polling. If when you zoom into specifics, but it's even more clear when people
*  are forced to confront these kinds of decisions in their local context in the real world, when
*  there's actually things that stick, right? So for instance, with faculty hiring decisions, this,
*  whoever you bring on, when you're when you're hiring a new faculty member is someone that you
*  can expect to work with for years, you'll have to make decisions with about who to bring into
*  graduate, you know, about which graduate students to admit or not about a whole range of other
*  things about how the department is structured. And so these are high stakes decisions that have
*  a lot of sort of so if you feel like so if you feel like this person is is sort of fundamentally
*  opposed to things that you find important or valuable or or whatever, it's going to be
*  difficult to, to justify it'll be difficult for a lot of people to feel like even if they believe in
*  diversity in principle, when the rubber meets the road, if they can pick someone who is sort of an
*  ally to themselves, or they can pick this person who they disagree with, assuming their records are
*  kind of comparably, you know, everyone sort of clears the bar of whatever meritocratic decision
*  procedure they have, then people tend to gravitate towards the person who's more like them, the
*  person who's going to be an ally, the person who's going to advance the cause they care about rather
*  than the person who's not. And that's a normal impulse that people have. But the problem is,
*  when everyone makes that same kind of calculation, and virtually all institutions of higher learning
*  have a sort of decisive left skew, and social science departments have an even more pronounced
*  left skew, right, then you see this kind of then certain kinds of perspectives are sort of
*  systematically locked out of the academy in general, because no one because everyone else
*  is making that same calculation that you're making. And so this is one of this one of the
*  challenges. So one of the and so the tension is, and this is where this kind of work gets hard,
*  where the rubber meeting the road gets challenging, where it's legitimately challenging,
*  is convincing people that in certain circumstances, you actually should you should try to bring on
*  this person that you disagree with instead of the person who's the ally, because it will benefit
*  it will benefit the academic community, it will benefit the knowledge environment. And but it
*  brings it brings its own challenges, you know, diversity brings challenges.
*  With all that's going on in the world right now, it can be hard to focus on things that are long
*  term and kind of annoying, but nevertheless important. And surely buying life insurance
*  has to be up there on the list of such things. Policygenius.com is here to help. It's a
*  marketplace. It's not an insurance company by itself, you go to Policygenius, and you can find
*  different insurers offering you different plans and figure out which one is right for you. Right
*  now you could save 50% or more by using Policygenius to compare life insurance from
*  different insurers. And the process is simple. You go to the website, in minutes you can work
*  out how much coverage you need, as well as comparing quotes from top insurers to find the
*  best price. And Policygenius will let you know whether for example, you can skip the in-person
*  medical exam. And then once you've chosen your policy, Policygenius themselves will handle all
*  the paperwork, all the red tape. The best part is they work for you, not for the insurance company.
*  So if you hit any speed bumps along the way, they will take care of everything. So if you need life
*  insurance, head to Policygenius.com right now to get started. You could save 50% or more by comparing
*  quotes. Policygenius, when it comes to insurance, it's nice to get it right. Part of my job here is
*  to be the devil's advocate. So I can't help but ask this question. You know, if I if couldn't I take
*  a an attitude that this is exactly the kind of issue that should be solved by the free market.
*  If we find that there is systematic discrimination against brilliant conservative, isn't that a
*  wonderful opportunity for certain departments to corner the market by hiring all these brilliant
*  conservatives that can't get hired anywhere else? I don't necessarily buy that argument,
*  but I'm curious as to what your response is. Well, so there has been a market solution,
*  an almost an almost literal market solution. And that is the emergence of these private think tanks
*  that have that are taking all of these conservative intellectuals and whatever who feel like they don't
*  have a place in the academy overall. The problem, though, what you see as a result of that is that
*  basically neither is you get these two sort of separate ecosystems. So you actually lose the
*  benefit of diversity happens when you have these different viewpoints actually engaging with each
*  other and having the answer to each other and clashing with each other and exposing one another
*  twice. But instead, what you see is two separate echo chambers. You have a sort of think tank echo
*  chamber with a lot of right wingers or religious people or whatever kind of talking amongst
*  themselves without much of a challenge referring to one another's work, et cetera. And then on
*  within the mainstream academy, you see a similar phenomenon on the left. And so there's technically
*  diversity in the sense of there are conservative intellectuals, a lot of them outside of the
*  academy. But the benefits of diversity that you get from putting these perspectives into
*  conversation with each other by being challenged, et cetera, by collaborating, by having people
*  with differing views actually collaborate on projects and et cetera. None of that's happening.
*  And in fact, what one consequence of that is that a lot of the institutional structures that we have
*  like peer review or institutional review boards, committee decisions, they're sort of they're
*  fundamentally premised on the idea of this kind of adversarial thing that you would have people
*  with diverse frameworks and views and whatever, hashing it out. And so as a result, these kinds
*  of committee decisions like peer review and institutional review boards and committee decisions
*  and whatever will push us towards a more objective, more truthful, more accurate, you know,
*  understanding of reality towards better decisions, more objective decisions, et cetera. But in a world
*  where the people making decisions all share the same axioms, the same blind spots, the same
*  assumptions about the world, then you can have then rather than correcting biases by means of
*  things like peer review or committee decisions, you can actually exacerbate biases like as a result
*  of these processes that were supposed to correct the biases. And I think that's been the consequence
*  of taking the sort of hands off, I guess, the nonchalant perspective that, you know, look,
*  if they don't fit in here, they'll figure it out. You know, someone will, you know,
*  life finds a way. That's the Jurassic Park metaphor. I guess the point is, they did find a
*  place where they can do research and pursue scholarship and whatever. But it's just there
*  are a whole bunch of negative consequences for this. And one negative consequence, ironically,
*  for institutions of higher learnings and academics, I'll say, is that a number of
*  policymakers then, the think tanks from the very beginning, and think tanks like Heritage and AEI,
*  et cetera, were tightly connected with policymakers, with practical applications. And as a result of
*  the fact that institutions of higher learning don't really have, and especially specific fields,
*  don't really have a lot of political diversity and are perceived as being partisan fields,
*  there's a whole range of, like, if you're a Republican policymaker, and you're trying to
*  formulate, say, a response to COVID-19 or something like that, you're not going to,
*  one, you're probably not going to consult, say, a sociologist about, you're not going to look at,
*  like, what does sociologists have to say about this if you're a Republican lawmaker? Because
*  your assumption about sociology is that all a sociologist is going to tell you is, you're wrong,
*  you're stupid, you're evil, you should probably become a Democrat. If that's what you think you're
*  going to hear from a sociologist if you ask for their opinion about something, is basically,
*  you should abandon entirely your whole sort of premise and approach to policymaking,
*  then you're just not even going to waste your time. You're going to ask someone,
*  maybe an economist instead. And then, and this is part of the reason why economics has this kind of
*  prestige it has among social sciences compared to other fields like anthropology and sociology,
*  is because it's relatively less skewed. It's still significantly skewed in favor of the left,
*  but less so. And even left leaning economists can sort of are known to like talk and engage with
*  people on the right in an amicable way and can often sort of, you know, in a way that's different
*  from, say, the reputation of sociology or anthropology or, you know. But this brings up,
*  this brings up a different way of being a devil's advocate in the following up on your,
*  the start, starting point of how things have changed since, you know, the Trump election
*  and so forth. Like, are there people who would say if asked, you know, I have no trouble talking to,
*  I'm a liberal, I'm a progressive, I'm leftist. I have no trouble whatsoever with people in my
*  department saying that the free market is a best engine of growth. I might disagree with them,
*  but I can talk to them. I have no trouble at all talking to people who say that God exists and,
*  you know, they go to church every day. But I don't want people in my department who say that,
*  you know, gay marriage should be illegal, or we shouldn't invest in Africa because black people
*  are too stupid to use the resources that we give them. I just think that's too dehumanizing to
*  allow in my department. Is that a different kind of issue? Are there intellectual diversities that
*  it's okay to not want to have? So I mean, yes, so there are always, there are sort of limits. So
*  the way I always talk about it and think about it is that viewpoint diversity, I think, should be
*  understood best as an instrumental good rather than an absolute good. So it's valuable for the
*  purpose of increasing our knowledge and understanding about the world, helping us engage
*  with the wider swath of society, etc. You know, you can list the ways in which it's
*  instrumentally valuable, but it's not something that you pursue just for its own sake, in my view.
*  And so to the extent that, and so they're implicit in that is an idea that there could be things that
*  fall outside the scope, right? So if it's- They might be hard to decide what they are, but they
*  might be there. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, it's a tough question. It's not a question that you can
*  easily answer. It's a question that has to be worked out by intellectual communities,
*  sort of responsive to their needs and priorities and things like that. But so for instance,
*  you know, if you're a geographer, you don't necessarily need a flat earth geography person
*  or something like that, right? So these kinds of like paradigm cases that people evoke to say,
*  but you know, shouldn't there be some kind of limits? Yes, there should be some kind of limits.
*  But the problem is right now, I would say is that we're very far, you know, so I guess the point is
*  there is a sense in which in principle, viewpoint diversity, these kind of a campaign for viewpoint
*  diversity could be overly permissive, folding in a bunch of viewpoints that actually aren't
*  valuable for helping us understand the world, helping us understand society, things like that.
*  But we're very far from that. And one of the tensions is, again, is that, and I guess one
*  helpful distinction too, is to draw a line between, is that it's helpful to think, I guess,
*  between sort of empiric, like, just purely empirical problems, which can be resolved, like,
*  or more straightforwardly empirical problems, I guess. So questions about whether or not the
*  earth is flat versus, versus, yeah, versus sort of social questions about that involve sort of that
*  take you beyond just questions about facts, but also into questions about values and priorities,
*  the sociologist Gil Ayel has a good, has a pithy way of putting it as trans-scientific questions.
*  Yeah, I mean, this, this, this really makes me wonder what to do. And I'm, this is, I'm not
*  playing devil's advocate now. This is something where I truly don't know what the answer should
*  be. On the one hand, it makes perfect sense to say, unlike facts, values are not shared by
*  different people. And therefore we should have diversity of values, because we can't just do an
*  experiment to decide who's right. On the other hand, I can easily see people saying, but these
*  values that that person has are just out of bounds. I don't, I don't, you know, those deny my basic
*  humanity and I don't want to engage with them. So I'm sure this is a hard question to answer,
*  but how do we decide which, which values we want to be diverse in with respect to?
*  Yeah, it's kind of a hard question to answer. But I mean, I think some helpful guidelines or ways to
*  structure the, so, so one of them, for instance, is if it's a widely held view that a lot of people
*  in society hold, that a lot of policymakers hold, then it's a kind of view that you're going to have
*  to engage with. And that if you don't engage with, it's actually probably going to be counterproductive
*  to, to, to advancing, you know, whatever your values are, if you just can't even talk to or
*  understand where other people are from. So, so when you're talking about sort of weird niche views,
*  that's not too many people hold, then those are the kinds of things which can be more safely
*  excluded, although still under certain circumstances, there might be, you know,
*  reasons to engage with them anyway. They, but for things that are sort of that there's millions and
*  millions of people in America who, who you will have to engage with, or policymakers or whatever,
*  who hold a certain view. And if you're saying that's out of bounds, that's something that I'm
*  not even going to be able to deal with or talk about or whatever, then that's a problem. That's
*  a problem for you in a very practical sense. And that's a problem also, again, in, in, and so,
*  so for instance, on, on the question of whether or not to return to, to one of your examples about,
*  say, you know, gay marriage or something, that's a, that's a topic in which Americans have moved
*  substantially over the last, you know, 10 years, but, but there are still a number of Americans who,
*  who hold the view that, you know, marriage is a religious sacrament between a man and a woman,
*  etc. And if you, and if you're putting it beyond the pale to even talk with those people or
*  understand where they're coming from, or engage their perspectives and views, then not only are
*  you then, you know, you're doing, then you're undermining your ability to one, reach those
*  people. And then two, in some cases, you might be even undermining your ability to understand,
*  well, that's the sort of policy ques- but you might be undermining your ability to understand
*  the phenomenon in question, right? So, so I guess that's one thing is like, if it's a view that's
*  sort of widely held that a lot of people in America hold, then it's a view that you should be able,
*  that you should probably be engaging with. And this is, so for instance, and you see,
*  you see this playing out in a few ways. So for instance, with the election of Donald Trump,
*  a lot of social researchers, like, they can't imagine how anyone could reasonably vote for
*  Donald Trump. And that is a problem, because it is their job to imagine that, right?
*  Well, and so a consequence of that is that a lot of the research on Trump and his supporters
*  basically starts from the premise that there must be something wrong with those people.
*  So they try to explain Trump votes in an, by looking specifically at pathologies or deficits.
*  So there are whole studies that are literally designed like, what best explains why someone
*  would vote for Trump? Is it that they're more racist or sexist or authoritarian or ignorant?
*  Right? And so all the options are bad. It can't be that they voted for Trump because they,
*  you know, are patriotic or whatever, that they love their families or they're concerned about,
*  you know, so all the options are bad. And there's not a symmetrical analysis with respect to why
*  people voted for, say, Hillary Clinton, right? Like they don't, sometimes they measure the
*  extent to which they try to frame Trump votes as motivated by sexism, for instance, but don't
*  explore the extent to which these same factors could explain Hillary Clinton votes or, and there's
*  just a lack, like if someone designed a study that was like, why would someone vote for Hillary
*  Clinton? Is it because they're communists or they hate America or, right? Or something like that?
*  We would immediately go, well, that's a prejudicial study design that's, you know, not, you know,
*  but when it applies to the Trump voter, you know, there's, that's a perfectly normal thing.
*  And the impulse that sort of generates that, this is a kind of thing you see in a lot of fields,
*  right? And not just with respect to Trump, that's just an easy example because it's, you know,
*  current, but researchers in general approach situations by thinking that their own
*  views are correct. That's why we hold the views, because we think they're correct.
*  So our own sort of theoretical perspective, metaphysical views, moral view, etc. And so
*  one consequence of that assumption though, is that we tend to assume that we tend to use our own,
*  our own sort of position as the baseline against which others should be measured. And then deviance
*  from that baseline is often explained again, in terms of negative attributes, some kind of deficit,
*  some kind of pathology. And, and this even holds in cases where the scholars themselves hold
*  demonstrably idiosyncratic views. So on a number of issues, on a range of things, academics are
*  kind of weird with respect to the rest of society, like the way we talk about things, the way we
*  think about things. But then, but when this, when academics notice a divergence between how they
*  think about the world and how others seem to think about the world, the question isn't usually,
*  why do people like us hold such idiosyncratic views on this matter? Right? The question is,
*  what's wrong with everyone else, such that they can't see the obviously correct answer here?
*  And so, and so, and that matters, that will that matters for a few reasons. Like one of them,
*  for instance, one consequence of this sort of other oriented blaming other people kind of
*  approach to social, to studying social issues, is that there's sort of, is that there's often sort
*  of blind spots. So I've written a little bit on, for instance, racial inequality, racialized
*  inequality in the United States, I have an article that I recently published in Sociological Forum
*  on this, where people in the professional, what, what is often called the professional
*  managerial class, often when they're trying to understand something, a phenomenon like racialized
*  inequality, the first people they look at to assume that as the bad guys, as the as the people
*  who are responsible for racialized inequality, are the millionaires and billionaires, the 1%,
*  etc. It's like these these elites over here are the ones who are responsible for this problem.
*  The issue with that is that millionaires and billionaires can't just sort of don't just sort
*  of make things happen as if by by magic, they work through institutions, right institutions run by
*  the professional managerial class. So if you want to understand how a lot of these phenomena happen,
*  you have to look at media organizations and institutions of higher learning and government
*  bureaucracies. These are the institutions through which the 1% exercise their will,
*  it would actually be impossible for a lot of these conditions to be maintained without the active
*  participation of people in the professional managerial class. But to the extent that they
*  focus that people within that class don't look at their own actions and behaviors, don't consider
*  the way their own institutions serve to reify and perpetuate these states of affairs, they have a
*  poor understanding of how the social phenomena come about, of what to do about them. And yeah,
*  so I mean, there are there are significant consequences that that sort of flow from this
*  blind spot. So this so I think we can finally get to the question I suppressed way at the beginning,
*  which was, what are we going to do about it? Or, you know, what is the strategy for dealing with it?
*  I really liked one of the essays you wrote on diversity training programs and how, you know,
*  their their hearts are in the right place, diversity is good. And they're typically
*  diversity training programs for, you know, racism and sexism and things like that, not for political
*  or religious orientation. But you point out that they generally are not effective in actually
*  fixing the problem. It seems like this problem of viewpoint diversity within the academy would be
*  even harder to solve in a systematic way. Or is it is the strategy just to sort of bring people's
*  attention to it to sort of let them self correct because their hearts are also in the right place,
*  hopefully? Yeah, so the Yeah, so the I mean, the diversity training thing, I'll just bracket that,
*  actually. Okay. So, so yeah, the general strategy, though, the general hope is, when people say things
*  like, I, you know, I believe in engaging with people I disagree with, I believe in, like,
*  I don't think that they're lying about that. I think they're sincere about that, even though when
*  presented with concrete cases, a lot of times they have this kind of like, reaction, right, when it's
*  time to put those values into practice, that turns out to happen less than maybe they're aware of or
*  with desire. So living those values is tough. So what Heterodox Academy and other initiatives like
*  it are trying to do is provide people with tools and resources to to better live those values. So
*  a lot of people, for instance, if you're a professor, and you're like, you know what, I think maybe
*  we should be engaging more with, say, conservative or religious perspectives and studying these
*  issues. But you're not conservative and religious, you don't know too many people who are you don't
*  even know where to start. So like, how would you design a syllabus, for instance, on racial
*  inequality that folds in conservative or religious perspectives, if you're not familiar with them
*  yourself, right? It would be hard. And so but what we can so what Heterodox Academy is trying to do
*  is provide people with resources like template. So this is one thing that we're trying to do now is
*  crowdsource, for instance, syllabi made by people who who who support the mission and who have tried
*  to who have tried to sort of incorporate conservative or religious perspectives into their
*  exploration of some of these issues. If they've taught a class based on the syllabus, and it went
*  really well, and it was valuable, then like, our perspective was like, share it with us. This is a
*  resource that other people can use, right? So we can crowdsource what works to lower the bar to lower
*  the amount of effort it takes for people to put it into practice. So that's one sort of plank is
*  trying to crowdsource what works from other people and learn from that, so that we're not having to
*  reinvent the wheel each of us, you know, from scratch, because that's, that's a high bar. I mean,
*  that in itself often disincentivizes people who agree on principle, but don't know where
*  to start. So they just kind of do what they've always done. And then, but another plank, I guess,
*  is is drawing people's awareness to the problem. So, you know, people know that the academy skews
*  left, for instance, or that, you know, it's a secular institution, but they're less aware,
*  maybe of one how dire the skew is. And two, the fact that it that it's not just kind of an organic
*  thing that happens, but it's a thing that people actively, you know, create through
*  discriminatory behaviors or actions that they might not even be necessarily aware of. So making
*  them aware of them can help and can end and spelling out the consequences of, you know,
*  if we don't have these kinds of diversity, here's how it messes up our understanding of the world.
*  Here's how it undermines the viability of our research in the future or the impact of our
*  research here now, etc. So spelling out the consequences is helpful for creating a sense
*  of urgency around the problem. And, and then cultivating sort of communities of practice,
*  I guess this is related to the crowdsourcing thing, but putting people in touch with one another.
*  So if you're someone who's concerned about this problem, but you don't, but when you look around
*  your department, you don't necessarily know that anyone else is concerned about this problem,
*  or, you know, then it can be hard to be the one to kind of, right. But if you know that there are a
*  whole bunch of other people in your field who are also concerned about this, who are committed to
*  doing something about it, then we're trying to sort of create communities where people within
*  different fields can collaborate together, think on this together, work it out together. Because
*  what we don't think what Heterodox Academy doesn't think is that they're in a position to just kind
*  of decree like this is what must happen. But, but we are, we, you know, these are, again,
*  these are questions that intellectual communities have to work out, we within themselves that
*  different fields have to work out that different, you know, universities have to work out in
*  accordance with their own needs, their own priorities, etc. So we want to facilitate them
*  doing that. That's the main role of Heterodox Academy is to help facilitate those efforts.
*  I think, but at the same time, one thing that we have to, one thing that we have to that we're
*  concerned about, and that we're trying to, and that motivates some of the urgency we have around
*  this problem is that we recognize that there are people in this country, all around policymakers,
*  ordinary citizens, etc., who also recognize who, who are not patient, who are not content to let
*  academics figure this out themselves, either because they don't trust the academics, or because
*  they think the problem has been going on too long, and there's nothing changing, or maybe it's even
*  getting worse, or whatever. And so there are all these external stakeholders who are trying to find
*  ways to intervene in the academy in a way that runs contrary to academic freedom, that runs
*  contra- that is often kind of these ham-fisted interventions that make things worse rather than
*  better, politicize things more rather than looking down. And everything from Fox News campaigns to
*  get people fired to, you know, state legislators, legislatures defunding, you know, sociology and
*  other fields like that, like as has happened in Wisconsin, to interventions at the federal level,
*  for instance, like Trump and his attempted executive orders on free speech and things like this.
*  So if this isn't a problem that- so I guess the urgency for us is that we recognize that this,
*  right now, these are problems that we can try to address within the academy by, by acting together,
*  by thinking through these with a sense of urgency, by trying to reform institutions
*  in ways that preserve academic freedom, that enhance knowledge production and things like that.
*  But if these problems continue to be ignored by us, they're not being ignored, you know, outside,
*  and eventually, probably sooner rather than later, these outside actors are going to be able,
*  and actually already are, but will probably be increasingly able to threaten academic freedom,
*  threaten autonomy of professors and institutions of higher learning. Very hard-fought economy
*  that organizations like the AAUP and the AACNU have been fighting to preserve since 1910.
*  Already tenure is being eroded radically. I mean, like something like 70% of new academic
*  appointments today are non-tenure track, and even for people who are on the tenure track,
*  you know, are sometimes being fired for, for, you know, political reasons. And so, so these are,
*  these are problems that it's still within our capacity to help sort of resolve some of these
*  problems ourselves, but it won't be that way forever. So that's, that's kind of the urgency
*  that we have for trying to sort of resolve some of these issues. Let me, let me even take the
*  lens back a little bit more to a wider perspective here, because these issues of why it's good
*  in the academy, you forget about politics and forget, I like the points you just made,
*  don't get me wrong, but if I'm just worried about being the best intellectual I can be,
*  being the best thinker about thing, you've written interesting essays on the role of critique
*  and, and how it's so important to have this attitude, I guess, towards ideas that we should
*  be suspicious of them in some sense. And somehow, if we put aside, you know, modern politics and
*  contemporary worries, there is this fundamental value or orientation difference in my mind that
*  maybe maps on to some of these questions between people who say, look, most changes that we could
*  make to the present system would be bad, you know, we've been, we spent a lot of time coming up with
*  the present system. And so like, don't ruin it, just for the sake of change. And those people
*  will be labeled conservatives and other people will say, well, it's clear the present system
*  can't be the best system we have, you know, there's all sorts of influences on it that are
*  not oriented towards making things they can. So our job is to undermine the present system. And,
*  you know, how do we balance in a very broad sense, the project of being the best intellectual we can
*  given these, you know, competing, fairly reasonable sounding claim? Yeah. And, and actually,
*  I think you put your your thumb pretty firmly on the issue of, for instance, why conservative
*  perspectives would be more valuable in the academy than a lot of people understand. And it's
*  precisely this orientation towards tradition and concern about things like, you know, harm caused
*  by naive interventionism, the fact that the things that persist sometimes persist for a reason. And
*  that if we don't understand sort of how they came about and why they persist, then when we change
*  things, we can often make things worse. And, you know, history is replete with examples of
*  people trying to make radical changes to society. And it not one not working out how they
*  anticipated but to, you know, not just them failing to achieve their planned objectives,
*  but making things far, far, far worse, and sometimes sliding into just outright totalitarianism
*  and famine and things like that. So so there is I mean, and so you really need these two, these two,
*  but at the same time, you know, absent the sort of progressive impulse to have critique and
*  critiquing the prevailing order and looking for improvement, right, then you get stagnation and,
*  and, and similarly, it's those are social orders that also tend not to be to persist because they
*  aren't responsive to contemporary needs, contemporary concerns, priorities. So you really
*  need these orientations to be in dialogue with one another. You did half of answering the question.
*  I mean, you gave a good pep talk for taking on board the more conservative notion of let's be
*  suspicious of proposed changes, right? But there is the, you know, the left is progressive liberal
*  point of view of let's be suspicious of the present system as well, which which also serves a purpose.
*  And, you know, I know that you value that purpose as well. So maybe I'll give you a chance to say
*  something about that. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Um, well, okay. So, yeah, so I mean, one one one fact
*  of the matter is that part of the reason that social orders exist is usually because they
*  solve sort of specific problems and that gave rise to that caused the the collapse of the previous
*  order and that led to the emergence of the new one. And part of the reason why it's stable is
*  because it actually is working pretty well for a lot of people. But it's often the case that there
*  are a number of people for whom the prevailing order does not work and has never worked. And
*  there are people people who are excluded and marginalized at this advantage. And,
*  and they matter too. Right. So and, and so this is one of one of the sources of critique of the
*  prevailing social order often comes from these people for whom the social order isn't working
*  well for people who are marginalized and disenfranchised. Additionally, you know,
*  social orders come into being usually in a particular context, a particular historical
*  context face, you know, in response to particular challenges from particular actors, but you know,
*  the world evolves, situations evolve, the challenges change. And to the extent that society
*  can't change with them, then it tends again, then then that social order tends not to survive. So
*  for both of those reasons, one to help to help elevate and ensure the dignity of people for whom
*  the spiritual order previously has not that social order has not been serving well, and then two to
*  make sure that the social order sort of is responsive to contemporary needs and correcting
*  circumstances, right? This is why that impulse towards critique and that impulse towards change
*  matters and is important and is like, absolutely essential. I mean, literally, again, social orders
*  tend to collapse or die without that impulse as well. And so these are perspectives that that
*  that need to be put into contact with one another. One ironic thing, though, I'll say, and actually,
*  this is the this is why they need to be put in dialogue with each other, is that the sort of the
*  impulse to critique is usually other oriented. Yes, right. Or you usually are critiquing, again,
*  things you disagree with, things that that aren't working well for you. You're critiquing people who
*  are you're perceived to be your ideological adversaries or whatever. And and again, that
*  a lack of reflexivity of turning the critical lens towards oneself, towards the actors that one
*  agrees with towards the causes that one agrees with or sympathizes with is often the reason why
*  these sort of well intentioned things go awry. It's because, you know, with the critique oriented
*  people, the change oriented people are focused on changing and critiquing everyone else.
*  And and so this is the ones who are wrong. This is why it can't just be all of the if you have the
*  critiques centered people that somehow, you know, that that it will be self correcting with just
*  those people as because you need you need the lens to be turned turned against the people who are
*  making that those critiques. Well, it's it's I agree. And you know, but it I worry that it gets a bit
*  utopian. I mean, I worry that in a world where there are plenty of people who are willing to critique
*  me, and you're asking me to now join them in critiquing me this could I better spend my time
*  critiquing the wrong people rather than myself. But I think but I think, you know, I say that
*  jokingly, because it is important because, you know, on the one hand, we should have some
*  convictions and move forward on the basis of them. And at the same time, we should be always
*  questioning that we haven't gotten things right. It's just so difficult to pull off and practice.
*  Well, and one reason why it's important, a flag is that is actually this is super important for
*  trying to help people from historically marginalized and disadvantaged groups. So one irony,
*  for instance, is that so for instance, look at African Americans or Hispanic, or, or lower
*  socio economic status people, the people who are not well served by the basically they tend to,
*  they often skew more socially conservative. So like blacks and Hispanics are most socially
*  conservative on average than whites. So are many immigrant communities. They're also more religious
*  on average than whites and low socio economic status people the same way compared to upper
*  socioeconomic status people. And so if you create an environment that's hostile towards, for instance,
*  socially conservative or religious views, that will disproportionately affect people of color.
*  It will disproportionately affect immigrants, it will disproportionately affect, you know,
*  first generation students or socio economic students. So often, so sometimes what happens
*  is in the very name of championing people from disadvantaged groups, we alienate and ignore
*  some of those very people. And it's important if you want to help promote the interests of say,
*  African Americans to listen to what African Americans actually want. So for instance,
*  with respect to police reform, there's a movement to defund the police. But if you ask black people,
*  do you want to defund the police? They overwhelmingly say no, they want substantive
*  police reform, they want to end discrimination, but they want police in their communities,
*  like communities dealing with crime with violent crime, you know, want police and, and, you know,
*  a lot of times, I've written extensively about police reform. And this was always a check on me
*  as well that I tried to check myself when I get a little too amped up about the problems with law
*  enforcement. And it's trying to keep in mind the fact that, you know, I come from a very particular
*  position. I'm at an Ivy League school, you know, I'm not from a wealthy background. I started at
*  community college and whatever, but like the milieu in which I'm currently in mesh, and the
*  environment in which I'm is very different from from that of most African American. Similarly,
*  you you know, and so for substantial things like that, and then even for more work, we're oftentimes
*  the the desires and opinions of the very people you're supposedly championing are being ignored.
*  And that's that happens in substantial issues that also happens in trivial issues, like for instance,
*  the term Latin X is often championed as a as the proper way of referring to people of Hispanic or
*  Latino origin. But if you ask people of Hispanic or Latino origin, do you like the term Latin X?
*  Do you consider yourself this like overwhelmingly, like, you know, 80 20, they say no, we don't like
*  this term. This doesn't even even when you ask people of there's a great essay report that just
*  came out in the New York Times, where for instance, a lot of speech coded as racist dog whistles. So
*  usually they would take say some rhetoric from Trump and they would say this is a dog whistle
*  that appeals to sort of white supremacy, white supremacist leanings or whatever. And so because
*  they come with this analytical frame, it never occurs to a lot of it didn't occur to a lot of
*  researchers to like ask people of color how they understood these comments, because the researcher
*  said that's racist, right? They didn't ask, do you find this racist? But when they did that,
*  it turned out that a lot of that black people were no less likely than white people that the
*  messages resonated just as strongly with blacks as with whites and resonated even more strongly
*  with Hispanics than African Americans or whites. So these dog whistles resonated more strongly with
*  minorities than with white people and people across the board didn't find them racist.
*  Similarly, with microaggressions, so you can when you present black and Hispanic people with
*  canonical microaggressions and ask them, do you find this offensive? Overwhelmingly, they do not
*  find them offensive, let alone harmful. And the reason that this matters, that this microaggressions
*  fact matters is because we do know from research, however, that when people perceive themselves to
*  have been the target of racism or discrimination, that corresponds to a number of negative emotional
*  effects, mental health effects, even just physical health effects. So sensitizing people more to these
*  things that they don't currently find offensive. So taking people of color and teaching them that
*  they should be offended by these things that they're not currently offended by would probably
*  correlate with worse mental health outcomes, worse physical outcomes, worse interpersonal outcomes
*  for minorities by trying to sensitize them to these slights that they don't find offensive right now,
*  ostensibly in the name of promoting their own interests. So it's important. So I guess the
*  shorthand is oftentimes disturbingly this impulse to champion people from historically marginalized
*  and underrepresented groups. Oftentimes, scholars ignore those very people whose interests they're
*  championing. And I'll say they don't necessarily ignore them entirely. What happens is you'll have
*  elites who represent those groups, basically, whose views are not representative, whose views are more
*  in line with other white elites than with the typical black or Hispanic person. We'll be serving
*  as the sort of lead on the reference point for other academics about what is in black or
*  Hispanic people's interests. So for instance, people are going to consult to these people about,
*  well, what do black people want? What's good for black people? Let's do what Coates has to say,
*  right? Rather than like, let's poll African Americans. And that's a problem, right? Because
*  Coates is, again, he's great. But his views on the world are demonstrably out of touch. His
*  socioeconomic position is demonstrably out of step, etc. with the typical black or Hispanic person.
*  So if you're looking at Coates to understand what's best for the typical black or Hispanic person,
*  you're probably going to be led astray. And this is a trap that we fall into.
*  Let me, I think we're closing up here. So let me just sort of give you an open question that you
*  can answer as you choose. I mean, a lot of these individual specific issues we've been talking about
*  play into the question of the role of the intellectual in modern society. And I think
*  the word intellectual has even become hard to take seriously in some sense. Like if you call
*  yourself intellectual, you're pretentious, and it's used, you know, in a sort of denigrating sense
*  in some way. There's a feeling that we live in a world where the discourse is not really
*  fundamentally intellectually oriented. What do you think about that situation we're in? And does
*  it turn into any specific advice you could give on would be or current intellectuals out there?
*  Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, I definitely hear that. I mean, I've had to struggle a lot myself, even.
*  I mean, again, I don't come from a background where where the word intellectual would be
*  understood as a positive thing, it would be a derisive thing you started on. So it's been a
*  journey myself to understand myself as an intellectual in a non, I guess, you know, anyway.
*  So I mean, I guess my advice to people, one bit of advice to people is that I think academics have
*  been kind of bad at explaining things like, you know, why our work matters, connecting the work
*  we do to the needs and priorities of ordinary people. And this matters, especially, I think,
*  for scholars at institutions that are paid for largely through taxpayer funds. You know, I feel
*  like a lot of taxpayers and politicians who represent them feel like, and not unreasonably,
*  that if they're making these large investments in these institutions of higher learning, that there
*  should be some kind of benefit to them or society or whatever, you know, that emerges out of this
*  investment that the public is making in these institutions. And I don't know that intellectuals
*  have done an excellent job of explaining what that benefit is. And so I guess one plank is
*  that I think intellectuals need to do better at engaging with the public, you know, talking about
*  their research in more accessible and compelling ways for ordinary people, engaging in more events
*  outside of the academy to engage with, you know, just people in their communities and their needs
*  and priorities and concerns, connecting their scholarship to sort of practical matters that
*  people care about. That's one plank. Oh, but I will say there are actually some great organizations
*  out there whose purpose is to help connect academics to the public, such as Scholar Strategy
*  Network or the Frameworks Institute has good work about how to talk about matters in a compelling
*  way to the public. And I think that that would help. Yeah.
*  Well, I think it's some good advice. It's I think you've given us a lot to think about.
