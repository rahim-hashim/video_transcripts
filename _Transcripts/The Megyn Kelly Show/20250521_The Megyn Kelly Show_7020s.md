Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Victor Davis Hanson, author of "The End of Everything," to discuss the viral interview between Megyn and Jake Tapper, how Tapper admitted that the “conservative media was right” about Biden, how the corporate media is using Jake Tapper’s book to cover up their own culpability, how the left media and Democrats used Biden until he was no longer useful, the way the media themselves perpetrated the Biden cover-up for years, the "Biden office" claiming Biden never had a PSA test after 2014, the dubious claims that his White House physicals wouldn't have caught his serious cancer, Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s heated exchange with Sen. Van Hollen during a Senate hearing over the left cozying up with illegal gang members and USAID waste, Rubio as a potential major 2028 player, the way the left and media are trying to spin Afrikaner refugees coming to the U.S. under Trump as having a racist motive, how the New York Times is totally missing the story, Trump sparring with South Africa's president over murders of white farmers in his country during an Oval Office meeting, the truth about the story that the media is trying to suppress, and more.

# Media Covers Up Their Role in Biden Cover-Up & Rubio Goes After Dem Senators, w/ Victor Davis Hanson

*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Wow. Just a ton, a ton of reaction [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=0.0s)]

*  is it going to be JD or is it going to be Rubio as the likely front runner when Trump is done? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=32.4s)]
*  I don't know. We have a depth, a depth of talent to choose from. So here to help us break it all [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  down is Victor Davis Hansen. He's senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and author of the book, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=45.68s)]

*  VDH, welcome back. Great to have you. Thank you. So a ton of reaction to the exchange we had with [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=119.92s)]
*  Tapper and Thompson who I felt a little bad for because Thompson really did try to cover Biden's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=126.96s)]
*  mental decline and really I didn't even get to mention it but yesterday he did a great job, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=132.72s)]
*  Thompson, for Axios of trying to follow up with Kamala Harris on all of her reversals when she ran [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  in 2024 from Kamala Harris in 1920 and got stiff-armed but man he did try. So for a large [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=143.12s)]
*  part of yesterday's interview he was just sort of a bystander as I tried to press Jake Tapper on how [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=151.04s)]
*  he can be the one who unearths the truth of this cover-up of which many people think he was a part. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=156.48s)]
*  Right? So we had a back-end change over that. He ultimately wound up admitting he got it wrong, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=164.0s)]
*  conservative media got it right. Here's a bit of that in Sat. 1. And Alex and I are here to say [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=171.28s)]
*  that conservative media was right and conservative media was correct and that there should be a lot [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=175.76s)]
*  of soul-searching not just among me but among the legacy media to begin with, all of us, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=184.08s)]
*  for how this was covered or not covered sufficiently. 100%. So I mean I'm not here [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  to defend coverage that I've already acknowledged. I wish I could do differently. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=198.72000000000003s)]
*  So Victor, he's out there on this media tour and now what we're seeing is media outlet [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=202.88000000000002s)]
*  after media outlet cover this book like, oh, new revelations. It appears that President Biden was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=209.84s)]
*  in significant cognitive decline for those four years and sort of taking the opportunity that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  the book offers to totally whitewash their own role in helping cover for him during that time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  Your thoughts on it? Well, what Jake Tapper doesn't tell you is he just, he didn't just [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=236.24s)]
*  deny that Joe Biden was cognitively impaired. He really was rude and attacked people who said [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=243.28s)]
*  that he was. And remember that Laura Trump. He cut her off and he made fun of her and he said that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=251.12s)]
*  she was basically a cruel person. He knew that it wasn't just a matter of a stutter and he did that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=256.32s)]
*  on numerous occasions. So that was number one. And then number two, he could have come forward [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=262.96s)]
*  any time after Joe Biden left office or even after he was stepped down. He didn't. He only came forward [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=270.23999999999995s)]
*  really in connection with this book. And then three, if you think about it, he can say all he [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=278.0s)]
*  wants post facto about an apology, but he's going to profit enormously off the, I guess it's a [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=284.08s)]
*  conspiracy or it's either incompetence that he was a central part of. And yet it's easy to say, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=291.68s)]
*  well, we're sorry, we're doing, but he's shown nothing, I think, that suggests that he wouldn't [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=297.76s)]
*  do it again. And that's what there's not, there's nobody's going to resign. Nobody's going to pay a [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=303.36s)]
*  professional price. Nobody's going to say, you know, I'm discredited. I just need to take a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=308.4s)]
*  leave of absence. It's, it's when you compare all the journalists that they destroyed during the Me [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=313.76s)]
*  2 phenomenon in 2019, and then you compare it to this, this makes that look just like amateurish. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=319.68s)]
*  You know, I'm not, I'm not trying to deprecate the seriousness of sexual harassment, but they [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=329.44s)]
*  went after everybody and they destroyed entire careers and people never recovered from that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=334.24s)]
*  Some of them were just sort of Randy. They didn't really, I mean, they weren't criminally guilty of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=340.4s)]
*  anything. They weren't Harvey Weinstein. It was kind of a witch hunt against something. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=345.76s)]
*  Think of Kavanaugh and others, but this, this was much worse because this was the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=350.64s)]
*  president of the United States. He had all sorts of, I mean, if you look at what this president did, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  he destroyed U.S. deterrence with the debacle in Afghanistan. He told Putin he wouldn't react [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=362.24s)]
*  unless it was a, basically if it was a minor invasion, he distanced himself from Israel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=368.88s)]
*  He took the terrorist designation off of the Houthis. He empowered Hezbollah. He was responsible, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  I think, for two theater wars on his watch. He had hyperinflation and now we're, we're starting [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=382.96s)]
*  to say, well, maybe he didn't do any of it. The auto pen, maybe he didn't even know who he was [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=389.28s)]
*  pardoning. Maybe he didn't even know where he was. And then it gets worse, Megan, you know, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  you can say all you want if you're a doctor that after 70 men don't get PSA, but that's, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=400.24s)]
*  that's average American men over 70. And most of the people I know, I'm 71, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=405.52s)]
*  they do. But the idea that the president of the United States wouldn't, nobody's going to believe [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  that. And nobody believes that he didn't have a serious problem that was covered up. And that, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  that was part of the, so what I'm getting at is, that's a multi-layered, multifaceted effort to [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=422.48s)]
*  delude the American people for cheap political purposes. It involved his medical team, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=428.8s)]
*  involved his staff, involved the surrogate people who were really running the country, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=433.92s)]
*  and it involved the media. That cheap fake, cheap fake, that was a talking point for six months, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=439.44s)]
*  that if anybody questioned him or they looked at a video where he was lost or wondering, they said [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  it's cheap fake, cheap fake, cheap fake. And they were relentless. And who else is apologized [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=449.92s)]
*  besides Jake Tapper? No one, exactly. And now they're using, they're using him. It's kind of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=455.68s)]
*  infuriating to watch them pretend like this is a real aha moment for them to read this book. Like, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  gee, for the first time now, I'm really seeing it. Like, I'll give you this from [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  the Washington Post, which was all over the cheap fake narrative. I mean, I could give you [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  headline after headline that I researched in preparing for the Jake interview, but Washington [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  Post, trust me, was one of the worst offenders on that cheap fake narrative. Now they have an [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  editorial board post online. If Biden was too frail for his job, voters should have been informed. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes, they should have by you. It's just like the New York Times, we were lied to on COVID. These [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  newspapers of record after the fact, like, well, the government should have told us we were lied to. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=507.2s)]
*  Yes. And many of us knew you don't trust the government on things that may make it look bad. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  You press the claims. You ask others. You go around the lying liars who lie to try to bring [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=521.92s)]
*  the real story to your audience. And none of you did that because you had an agenda. You were totally [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=528.4s)]
*  on board with the whole deceptive scheme. They were. And they knew that if they told the truth, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=534.4s)]
*  the vindictive staff would call them up and say, we're not going to let you, you're not going to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=541.28s)]
*  get a question or you're not going to be allowed to interview or you're not going to be in the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=546.0s)]
*  press room. And they folded like a tent. The question I would have for Jake Tapper is twofold. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=549.84s)]
*  Would you have apologized and said that you feel humility if you hadn't written this book? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=556.4s)]
*  In other words, you were just one of the many people who have not apologized. And two, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=562.72s)]
*  if is your apology central for this book sales? In other words, what if you didn't apologize? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=570.48s)]
*  And you just said, I wrote a book and this is what happened. There was a conspiracy and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=577.28s)]
*  I didn't have any part of it. Wouldn't that hurt your interviews? Would you get book by people? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=581.6s)]
*  Because people would say, well, he's writing a conspiracy and he's unapologetic. He was part of [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=587.68s)]
*  it. But what I'm getting at is he's only apologizing because he's in a process of making several [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=593.12s)]
*  million dollars off of something that he was culpable for. And he knows that if he didn't [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=600.0s)]
*  apologize, his interviews, his book tours and his sales would be impaired by it. So the apology is [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=605.52s)]
*  central to give him a second chance or some type of contrition so that people will say, well, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=612.3199999999999s)]
*  he feels bad and he was the one that kind of exposed it now. But he wouldn't apologize if [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=621.92s)]
*  he hadn't written a book and he wouldn't apologize unless he thought it was central to the book's [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=627.6s)]
*  success. He said he called her a few months ago, which was obviously post debate and, you know, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=633.68s)]
*  there's no question that it was while he was writing the book that he called her. No question [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=642.0s)]
*  at all. Here's a little bit more of where we got into why he did not cover the infirmity much [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=646.2399999999999s)]
*  earlier, Satu. It could only ever work if you allowed it, if the press allowed it. Some of us [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=653.28s)]
*  tried not to and some of us were complicit. The Biden White House did not like me. Okay, this is, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=660.16s)]
*  I do not have great connections with the Biden White House. Well, clearly you have a lot of sources. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=666.88s)]
*  You say you talked to over 200 sources for this book. You have some that could have called and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=671.12s)]
*  worked. No, that's the point is that they were not being honest. That's the point. Well, how did the [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=674.9599999999999s)]
*  Wall Street Journal get it in June of 2024 and Jake Tapper and CNN couldn't find sources for this [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=680.9599999999999s)]
*  story then before he dropped out? Annie Linsky and Siobhan Hughes did an amazing job in their [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=685.92s)]
*  reporting and they should be heralded and I heralded them. I had them on my show right after the debate [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=693.5999999999999s)]
*  to talk about their great reporting. But Annie Linsky- After the debate, but you did not put them on when they [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=699.52s)]
*  published that story, which was before the debate. Correct. If we're going to do this, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=704.16s)]
*  let's just stick to the facts here, okay? When there is a damaging report- Jake, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  that's what I've been doing all along. I'm talking about what you just said. One of us [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=713.2s)]
*  didn't miss the biggest story of the century when it comes to presidential politics and one of us did. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  The business about the Wall Street Journal reporters and with all due respect to the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=725.44s)]
*  two reporters on that story, I meant what I said yesterday. Everybody who read that story was like, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=730.0s)]
*  okay, somebody's finally doing it. It was in June of 2024, Victor. We'd all been covering this at [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=734.32s)]
*  length in conservative and independent media for years by that point, for years. I mean, it's like, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=740.48s)]
*  great. They finally took a shot and they got some Republicans to go on record in that piece, which [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=746.72s)]
*  immediately was dismissed because it was only Republicans who were on the record. But now he [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=751.6s)]
*  wants to pretend that like, well, that was a watershed moment when finally the Wall Street [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=755.6s)]
*  Journal got a couple of people to go on record about the infirmity. It's like, oh, please, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=760.48s)]
*  they were very, very, very late to the party. And Jake did not book them right after that report [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=764.4s)]
*  hit, which was early June. He didn't put them on at all. He put on a Democrat co-chair of the Biden [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=770.24s)]
*  campaign and then didn't vigorously cross-examine him with all the evidence, not just what was in [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=777.36s)]
*  the journal report, but all the evidence that we had seen of Mr. Biden's infirmity. This revisionist [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=782.64s)]
*  history around like when we knew is infuriating because all of us know it was there, it was in [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=788.96s)]
*  front of our very eyes for years. CNN was a platform, maybe not he, not to the same degree, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=795.2s)]
*  but he was complicit. CNN was a platform to attack the Wall Street Journal and to attack people who [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=802.24s)]
*  said that even as late as they did. And they still do it. They were doing it until the announcement [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=809.12s)]
*  of the book. And we haven't heard the thing that I think is most critical is if he has all of these [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=814.4000000000001s)]
*  auto-pin pardons and no one has really asked him, why did you pardon Dr. Fauci or why did you pardon [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=822.4000000000001s)]
*  Adam Schiff? There's been no journalistic follow-up asking Joe Biden and all of these [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  interviews. I guess he's desperate for money and he's doing these post-tenure interviews. Nobody [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=836.6400000000001s)]
*  asked him, did you remember this tenure? Did you remember this tenure? And the second big question [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=842.88s)]
*  is if Jake Tapper wants to redeem himself, he could write a long essay now, who was running [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=847.52s)]
*  the White House? We need names. Who were the people? Well, he did name names. He did. I asked him [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=852.72s)]
*  that. They were in the book. I asked him and Alex Thompson and they gave us names. It was Mike [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=857.92s)]
*  Donilon. It was this guy Steve Riketty and a couple of others, Jill Biden. He's also said Hunter Biden. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=861.36s)]
*  But I mean by rule, I don't mean the actual agents that were doing it, but who was, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=867.92s)]
*  who was thinking up the initiative? Who said, let's get out of Afghanistan like this? Who said, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=873.12s)]
*  let's distance ourselves from Israel? Who said, there's, you know, Janet Yellen, don't worry about [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=878.4s)]
*  inflation or Merrick. Who was the one that weaponized the FBI? And we know Anthony Blinken [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=884.0s)]
*  did the 51 intelligence authorities, but were they Obama operatives or who were they? Who was, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=889.12s)]
*  who was, who was the person who? The book does say Anthony Blinken understood that he would be [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=894.96s)]
*  standing in for Biden on virtually anything having to do with foreign policy. The book points out that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=899.36s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, whose name had been forgotten twice. He kept calling [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=907.28s)]
*  him Steve. Biden did, was well aware of Biden's deterioration and was part of the inner circle. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=912.72s)]
*  They talk about Anita Dunn, who had that special governmental employee status, same as Elon had. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=921.04s)]
*  That just kept getting renewed and renewed, renewed. So she didn't undergo much scrutiny [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=926.4000000000001s)]
*  was one of the inner circle. She knew they don't really take a lot of aim at [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=930.48s)]
*  Kareem Jean-Pierre and Jen Psaki. Gee, I wonder why, but there's no question they knew. I mean, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=935.44s)]
*  they were as close to the inner circle as you could get. So, no, they don't say like, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=940.6400000000001s)]
*  this is the person who made the decision for X, Y, and Z, but we do now at least have names. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=945.5200000000001s)]
*  And if somebody on the left who's got access to the two guys, like Mike Donnellan, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=949.84s)]
*  if they don't do their jobs now and get that man in front of a camera, stick a mic in his face, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=955.2s)]
*  Steve Riketti too, and find out what they knew and when and why they're guilty of this coverup, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=961.6s)]
*  then it's yet another dereliction of duty. See, I think a lot of people fairly or not [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=967.28s)]
*  feel that it wasn't just a cover up, but if you look at the mechanisms by which Joe Biden got the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=974.32s)]
*  nomination, because it was evident in 2020. Cory Booker on the debate stage said, I don't know what [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=980.72s)]
*  he's talking about when Joe Biden would flub or forget his mic. So they knew as early as 2020, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=987.0400000000001s)]
*  and then Jim Clyburn changed the date of the South Carolina primary. So he was coronated. In fact, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=994.96s)]
*  the Democratic Party didn't really have an open nomination for eight years. He was nominated and [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1000.0s)]
*  then he was coronated and then he was removed. And then there's been no Democratic action. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1006.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's very frustrating now to watch the gaslighting continue because there was gaslighting [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1012.9599999999999s)]
*  in this book. And for me, it was cathartic to be able to confront Jake with some of that. And to [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1019.52s)]
*  his credit, he came on the show and he said yesterday, he knew I was going to give him a [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1025.36s)]
*  hard time and he showed up anyway. A lot of people thought he was going to give him a hard time. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1028.6399999999999s)]
*  And I was saying to them, he's not going to cancel. He'll be here. And he took his licks like a man. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1032.64s)]
*  And I respect that. I do. I respect that. But now what's happening is extra infuriating because [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1037.52s)]
*  CBS, the Washington Post, CNN, they're all using this to make themselves sound like these dough-eyed, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1044.4s)]
*  innocent, G-O-G. I've just learned so much. The ladies on the view, the ladies on the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1052.88s)]
*  view. I've learned so much from this book. And it's not that there aren't new revelations in the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1058.8s)]
*  book, but it's a farce because the underlying narrative is what is truly important. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1066.32s)]
*  And they all knew, like the Washington Post having the nerve to come out and say, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1073.2s)]
*  voters should have been informed. That's literally your job. This is the paper that broke [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1078.24s)]
*  Watergate. They were so vigorous in their testing of presidential lies when it was a Republican [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1083.92s)]
*  in there. But now that they had Biden, a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1090.96s)]
*  poor memory, they lost all curiosity, Victor. But see, I think it goes back. I don't want to [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  belabor the point, but I think we've never seen anything like the Democratic Party of 2020 when [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1103.52s)]
*  all of the candidates just disappeared. And then the dates were changed and he had not won a single [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1108.88s)]
*  caucus, not New Hampshire or Iowa. Then he was coordinated and then they used the COVID-19. He [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1114.48s)]
*  was in the basement. And so what I'm getting at is from the very beginning, they knew that he was [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1121.5200000000002s)]
*  old Joe Biden from Scranton, this ossified centrist, and that was very useful for them. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1126.4s)]
*  And then a group of people who otherwise would have had trouble pushing the most progressive [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1133.5200000000002s)]
*  agenda, really in modern memory, found this waxen effigy very helpful. It wasn't that they were [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1139.04s)]
*  covering up because they were astounded at how debilitated he was. And they had to make the, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1145.9199999999998s)]
*  it was more, we know he's debilitated, but Jill and Hunter and the Obama people, this is kind of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1152.24s)]
*  an opportunity to push through a more radical third term of Obama. So they knew it all along [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1159.6s)]
*  when he was nominated. And that's why they could go to him and say, you're going to get out. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1166.8s)]
*  And he- [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1171.6s)]
*  Look at this, Victor. Look at this. This is April 2020. April 2020. Okay. Before the 2020 election, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  which was in November, of course, here is Joe Biden. Oh, do we have this? You guys, sorry. I [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1180.6399999999999s)]
*  don't know if we pulled this over. Pull over stop five from yesterday, but I'll show you [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1184.1599999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden on CNN in April, 2020. Stand by. Before we get to that, I'll show you one other. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  Here is Brian Stelter. Now that they're now, now CNN is out there saying, oh gee, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1193.2s)]
*  you know, we learned a lot about his infirmity. My gosh, this is shocking. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1198.96s)]
*  Well, here's CNN back in June 19th, 2024. This is before the debate on these so-called cheap fake [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1203.44s)]
*  videos that the rest of the media was dishonestly portraying, using to portray Joe Biden as infirm. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1211.2800000000002s)]
*  Sat nai. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1217.92s)]
*  We've been worried for years about AI deepfakes, that computer-generated images are going to trick [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1219.3000000000002s)]
*  people into believing something that's totally false. Cheap fakes are a little bit simpler. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1223.22s)]
*  They're cheap. They're just distorted, out of context videos, chopped up in certain ways. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1227.0600000000002s)]
*  The Biden administration, the Biden campaign is so worried about right now, but make no mistake, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1231.7s)]
*  they are worried about this. This is a real problem. This is not some made-up fiction. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1235.8600000000001s)]
*  The videos are oftentimes made up, but the problem is real. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1240.1000000000001s)]
*  And now here's more, okay, because CNN today out there like, gee, oh wow, they're interviewing [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1242.9s)]
*  Jake like this is all new to them. Let me just give you a couple of examples. August of 21, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1249.6200000000001s)]
*  Chris Saliza, he's upset because Republicans are hitting this issue. He says to raise doubts in [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1254.02s)]
*  voters' minds about Biden and his age in particular, this is the sort of gross, lowest common denominator [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1263.22s)]
*  politics that drive people away from public life. Chris Saliza got it so wrong. He's one of the only [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1268.98s)]
*  ones to actually come out because he had to go into pen. He got fired from CNN to say, okay, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1274.18s)]
*  sorry, I got it wrong. Now I would like to be one of the ones who apologize. We have that? Okay, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1279.6200000000001s)]
*  let's watch. This is a guy who was the president of the United States for four years and thought [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1284.74s)]
*  and ran for a second term, at which point he would have been in his mid-80s had he won and served. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1291.3s)]
*  So that to me is a really serious conversation about how did we get to this point given that [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1297.22s)]
*  there were a lot of signs that suggested that Joe Biden definitely should not have run for a second [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1303.7s)]
*  term. How did we get to this point? It's a media story. We got here because of you. It's a sort of [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1310.1000000000001s)]
*  transparency story. Because of you, Chris Saliza and CNN. Here's a couple more, Victor. July 12th, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1315.94s)]
*  2022. Not for nothing, but it was a month prior to that that the Megyn Kelly show did a full two [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1324.74s)]
*  hour show on Biden's mental decline, including by interviewing one of the foremost dementia experts [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1329.06s)]
*  in the world. But here's a month after that, CNN's John Harwood taking issue with the allegations [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1333.6200000000001s)]
*  that he was not cogent and capable. What's true is the presidency is a hugely taxing job mentally [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1338.34s)]
*  and physically and that Joe Biden is old. What's not true is the trope pushed in conservative media [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1343.78s)]
*  that Biden is not currently mentally capable of doing the job. The president is engaged and acute. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1349.46s)]
*  February of 23, John Avalon of CNN, Republican slurs that Mr. Biden is mentally impaired [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1358.18s)]
*  are fear mongering politics. June 25th, 2024, two days before the presidential debate that would [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1365.06s)]
*  seal Joe Biden's faith fate, Oliver Darcy on CNN lamenting how for years MAGA media has been [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1373.46s)]
*  portraying Joe Biden as a senile mentally incapacitated elderly man who cannot remember [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1382.18s)]
*  what he had for breakfast, let alone run the federal government. That might sound like an [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1387.38s)]
*  exaggeration to those who don't tune into Fox News or listen to talk radio, but it's been a real and [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1391.22s)]
*  constant theme in the right wing media universe to support the narrative. These outlets and [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1395.78s)]
*  personalities have seized on Biden's verbal gaffes while ignoring Trump's and presented [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1400.02s)]
*  out of context video clips to their large audiences, a deceptive but effective strategy. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1404.82s)]
*  Okay, that's CNN. That was CNN who now is using the Jake Tapper book to act like the guy in [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1412.42s)]
*  Casablanca. Shocked, shocked, there's gambling going on in here. Yeah, these are the same people [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1421.3s)]
*  if you recall in 2019 and 20, they hauled up and the media went gaga. They hauled up a Yale [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1427.78s)]
*  psychiatrist, Bandy Yee, and they brought her before the Senate and she'd telediagnosed Donald [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1435.7s)]
*  Trump as mentally unfit and she wrote a book about it and they lauded her and she was all over the [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1440.5s)]
*  media that she said that they needed an intervention and then we also had this weird psychodrama [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1446.58s)]
*  between Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosenstein. Rod was going to wear a wire and the FBI [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1453.38s)]
*  interim director was going to go in and trap Donald Trump and record him speaking and this [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1460.98s)]
*  was going to be proof that he needed to be 25th amended, amended, removed and all of the left [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1468.18s)]
*  media got in this fury and finally Donald Trump took the Montreal cognitive assessment because [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1476.2600000000002s)]
*  he was so worried that people had started with this narrative and so these were the same people [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1481.86s)]
*  who thought there was nothing unethical about diagnosing somebody as cognitively unfit who [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1487.1399999999999s)]
*  obviously wasn't. If you look at those long rally speeches and constant interviews and impromptu and [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1493.1399999999999s)]
*  ad hoc repartee that Trump did every single day. Let me just tell you one thing on that Victor and then I'll give you back the floor. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1499.4599999999998s)]
*  Two weeks after Jake Tapper had on Laura Trump and gave her such a hard time saying like how dare you [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1507.38s)]
*  try to cognitively diagnose Joe Biden. Two weeks after that he had on Mary Trump and allowed her [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1513.78s)]
*  to make the case that they ought to be able to diagnose Donald Trump and his you know weird [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1523.7s)]
*  mental problems in her mind because it was obvious and because she had some sort of a [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1528.5s)]
*  background in psychiatry or psychological whatever. Two weeks later he let Mary Trump do it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1533.22s)]
*  Yeah and I think when you look I went back and looked at a lot of the debates and when you look [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1540.42s)]
*  at the 2000 not 2020 debates on the Democratic primary when Joe Biden would say things there the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1546.58s)]
*  other candidates were stunned sometime. They had no comprehension of what he was saying [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1553.94s)]
*  and if you look at Bernie and Buttigieg were the only people who had won a caucus and then all of [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1559.38s)]
*  a sudden Jim Clyburn changed the South Carolina date. Presto he was gone. Buttigieg stepped down. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1563.8600000000001s)]
*  Warren stepped down. Sanders stepped down and then it was old Joe Biden and then all these news came [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1570.5s)]
*  out that he was actually a moderate and then he was going to then he went in the basement and that [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1575.6200000000001s)]
*  was a useful vessel and that's why they really didn't have an open primary. They didn't have an [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1581.0600000000002s)]
*  open primary in 2024. They put Harris without an open primary. He lived by the kind of he was [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1586.66s)]
*  nominated by a coup and he was deposed by a coup but the point is what we thought was a debility [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1594.42s)]
*  and he was kind of an empty vessel and struggling with cognitive problems. I think the hard left [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1601.6200000000001s)]
*  wing of the of the Democratic party found this useful and advantageous because they could have [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1608.3400000000001s)]
*  they could wheel him out and certain cases he could say stuff and then if you look what he did [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1614.02s)]
*  at the border we have never had anybody who destroyed a border and invited in 10 million people. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1619.46s)]
*  It was just lunatic. We never had anybody who's printed seven trillion dollars. We never had [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1626.1s)]
*  anything like since maybe 75 in Vietnam anything comparable to that Afghan pullout. It was just [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1631.54s)]
*  Mallorca. It was in like an alternate reality listening to Mallorca's talk for four years [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1638.66s)]
*  and so they got what they wanted. That's what my point is. I really think they found him useful [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1643.46s)]
*  because he put a thin veneer for as long as he could maintain it and then when he was no longer [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1649.7s)]
*  useful and they said you know what we can't push this left wing agenda anymore because he can't [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1655.5400000000002s)]
*  even function as a as a veneer. They got rid of him. They just deposed him. They just called him [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1660.5800000000002s)]
*  in a room and said you're done and if you complain we made you we got you nominated and we have the [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1666.18s)]
*  right to get rid of you and then there was no primary there was no other candidates. I think [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1671.38s)]
*  Joe Manchin for a nanosecond said he might consider running and it was over like that and yeah look [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1675.6200000000001s)]
*  what they did to Dean Phillips look what they did to Bobby Kennedy. They were like there will be [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1682.3400000000001s)]
*  no comers whatsoever. We've got our man and only when he imploded on stage in front of our very [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1685.78s)]
*  eyes live did they have to admit the jig was up. Two things I want to show you. First I mentioned [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1691.86s)]
*  that soundbite on CNN. This happened on CNN in 2020 where he could not function in talking about [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1697.78s)]
*  the coronavirus. Watch this. Kinds of things that that have to be done. You know there's a [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1707.6999999999998s)]
*  during World War II you know where Roosevelt came up with a thing that you know was totally [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1715.14s)]
*  different than a than the he called it the you know the World War II. He had the world the [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1722.26s)]
*  war production board. Oh my god and then and then there's this so to the point you were just making [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1729.46s)]
*  about who was governing the country who really was the president. President Trump weighed in on this [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1736.98s)]
*  a bit yesterday. He's on Capitol Hill trying to get support for his big beautiful budget bill [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1742.42s)]
*  and he took a moment to make the following point. Watch this. Look it's a very sad thing what happened [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1746.74s)]
*  but I really wanted to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1751.94s)]
*  Who signed legislation opening our border? I don't think he knew. I said there's nobody that could [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1756.8200000000002s)]
*  want an open border. Nobody. And now I find out that it wasn't me. He auto-pended. Who was [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1762.02s)]
*  operating the auto-pend? This is a very serious thing. We had a president that didn't sign anything. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1768.82s)]
*  He auto-pend almost everything. He opened the borders of the United States of America and I kept [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1773.86s)]
*  saying who would do such a thing allowing criminals to border from all over the world. You know who [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1779.54s)]
*  signed it? Radical F Lunatics that were running our country and the auto-pend signed it and they [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1785.46s)]
*  didn't want him and they were disappointed in getting him because they wanted Bernie Sanders [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1790.6599999999999s)]
*  and then after about two weeks they said wait a minute this is a gift he'll do anything. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1795.6200000000001s)]
*  That's amazing Victor that's basically what you were just saying that the president totally [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1802.98s)]
*  agrees. He was absolutely right and that's the biggest that is the biggest scandal and I think [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1806.42s)]
*  they need to call on everybody on every pardon and ask who operated the auto-pend. Who was there [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1812.02s)]
*  and what they did. They need to do that and they need to do it right away and I think it's and [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1819.7s)]
*  then the other big scandal and they don't stop because now we are told that the most observed, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1825.7s)]
*  most diagnosed, most monitored man in the world did not have a PSA test for what 11 years? Since [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1831.94s)]
*  2014 that's what they want us to believe. And by the way just by the way so the audience knows [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1840.9s)]
*  this was put out again by quote the Biden office not by a doctor not by Dr. Kevin O'Connor who was [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1845.22s)]
*  his handpicked by Jill Biden loyalist doctor throughout his term but just quote the Biden [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1852.74s)]
*  office. Let me see a doctor assuring us with his name that that's true as somebody other than Kevin [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1859.46s)]
*  O'Connor ideally but at least Kevin O'Connor let's see him come out to the cameras and do a [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1866.98s)]
*  full-throated press conference on this and then maybe we'll start listening but quote unsigned by [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1871.38s)]
*  the Biden office I'm convinced is a lie. No it is and I know I think you everybody knows people [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1876.8200000000002s)]
*  over I'm 71 and I can tell you that no urologist in the world if you want a PSA test they will [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1886.42s)]
*  give you a PSA test and if he has one in 2014 was it we just need to know the results was it [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1894.26s)]
*  negative was it positive was that high was it low but why don't say that that's what's interesting [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1903.06s)]
*  so just just they don't they say he last had a PSA test in 2014 they don't say what the results [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1907.94s)]
*  were they do say this was the first time he was diagnosed with prostate cancer which doesn't mean [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1913.46s)]
*  he didn't have a sky-high PSA in 2014 that he just chose to treat quietly there are pictures [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1919.38s)]
*  of bruises on his hands throughout his presidency there had been speculation at the time was he [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1925.3000000000002s)]
*  getting some sort of IV treatment when he was going home to Rehoboth Beach Beach House all those [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1930.1000000000001s)]
*  weekends was he getting some sort of treatment you know all of those questions are unanswered go ahead [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1934.42s)]
*  and they're gonna they need to get Dr O'Connor and they need to bring him in very politely and put [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1940.66s)]
*  him under oath and said did you in the last 11 years to your knowledge but especially when you [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1946.26s)]
*  were the White House physician did you give either a PSA that was officially recorded or did you do [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1953.78s)]
*  a PSA that was privately recorded that you for your own diagnostic purposes did you yes or no [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1960.5s)]
*  under oath and I I just don't think any and I don't want to be a doctor at all but I don't think any [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1966.8200000000002s)]
*  doctor in the world would believe that the president of the United States had not had a PSA [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1973.22s)]
*  and when you look at Obama's medical records you look at Donald Trump's medical records that's [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1980.1000000000001s)]
*  their PSA and I just don't believe that's true and I think they don't believe it's true they don't [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1984.5s)]
*  believe and they want us to believe that he didn't do the testing and and they talk about like the PSA [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1989.54s)]
*  like it's some sort of difficult thing to do it's literally just an extra box on your blood test [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1994.26s)]
*  and by the way I have real questions about whether a normal annual blood test would not have shown [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=1998.82s)]
*  any abnormality if he had cancer raging through his body but you know aggressive metastasized [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2003.54s)]
*  bone cancer or prostate cancer I don't I'm not sure what the answer is to that but Dr. David [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2010.34s)]
*  Samadi was on the program on Monday world-renowned prostate surgeon this is what he does he operates [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2015.06s)]
*  on men with prostate cancer and said there's no way that they could have said like they did and [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2021.1399999999999s)]
*  again the statement from the Biden office that he has the kind of cancer that is responding [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2027.14s)]

*  around this book that would make perfect sense to try to guilt people out of discussing the big [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2189.38s)]
*  cover-up attempted cover-up so other in other words and this is what I think we're all thinking [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2194.1s)]
*  they use the serious medical condition and they use it as leverage and for their own [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2200.42s)]
*  political purposes and then in addition to that they were quite willing to demonize anybody who [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2207.06s)]
*  saw what they were doing as the real insensitive people not themselves who were using cancer as a [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2213.06s)]
*  way of deflecting attention from a very incriminating book it's I think that's right on brand I mean we [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2219.22s)]

*  stuff and I'm going to show you I mean there's a pattern there's obviously a pattern of lying [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2229.38s)]
*  by this White House around anything related to Joe Biden that makes him look bad but especially [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2233.2999999999997s)]
*  his cognitive decline and the measures that those around him were going to cover it up which is [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2237.7s)]
*  exactly the same theme as we are discussing now with respect to this prostate cancer diagnosis [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2243.22s)]
*  Joe Biden having a medical issue and those around him suspected of trying to cover it up [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2249.3799999999997s)]
*  here is TJ Ducklow deputy press campaign press secretary for the campaign you don't have that [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2254.4199999999996s)]

*  the teleprompter in public events and Brett pressed him we'll get to it hold on before I get to that [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2271.3799999999997s)]
*  I'll stick with this to to start it was okay yeah the videos we have that right Debbie yeah we've [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2276.9799999999996s)]
*  got that here is Joe Biden during the campaign trying to challenge Donald Trump and you can see [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2284.18s)]
*  for the listening audience multiple jump cuts in this tape meaning you see him talking straight to [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2291.94s)]
*  camera and then from the side he's being shot and then back to straight to camera and then you see [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2297.94s)]
*  him from the profile and that means there are more than one camera on him and it's a way of [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2302.26s)]
*  hiding the person's multiple flubs of what appear to be a very simple script here it is [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2308.1s)]
*  Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020 since then he hadn't shown up for debate now he's acting [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2316.02s)]
*  like he wants to debate me again well make my day pal I'll even do it twice so let's pick the [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2320.98s)]
*  dates Donald I hear you're free on Wednesdays now it was obvious what they had done we talked about [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2326.9s)]
*  it on this show explicitly many others did as well here was morning Joe reacting to it well make my [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2333.46s)]
*  day pal I'll even do it twice so let's pick the dates down I hear you're free on Wednesdays [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2340.34s)]
*  oh wow [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2346.26s)]
*  yeah and now watch watch today morning Joe [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2350.5s)]
*  now one thing in your specific case Joe our reporting indicates that Joe Biden who as you [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2358.42s)]
*  know is a frequent viewer of the show saw when David Ignatius wrote that column in I think August [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2365.3s)]
*  2023 saying that Joe Biden should not run for re-election because of what he had been hearing [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2372.18s)]
*  about this you largely agreed that you'd been hearing things about this but that there was [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2376.8199999999997s)]
*  really no alternative that Kamala Harris was not up to the job that's what Democrats were telling [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2380.98s)]
*  you behind the scenes Joe Biden saw that Joe Biden said to staffers that he wanted to convince [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2384.8999999999996s)]
*  you that you were wrong and he focused on you like you were a constituency like you were farmers in [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2391.94s)]
*  Iowa like you were the Kiwanis club in New Hampshire and he made sure that you thought [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2398.58s)]
*  he made sure that you thought differently I think he did this with a couple people [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2404.18s)]
*  I think he did it with Meacham he might have done it with Evan Osnos he knew that there were people [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2408.18s)]
*  that had to be convinced that he was fine and he and he tried to prove that to you [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2412.74s)]
*  how embarrassing how embarrassing yeah I don't think he had to prove anything I think they [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2419.2999999999997s)]
*  willingly volunteered I don't think they were coerced at all Meacham I remember Meacham [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2425.38s)]
*  and Scarborough they they volunteered how cognizant and how you know how alert how [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2432.5800000000004s)]
*  powerful how strong Biden was and I don't think Joe Biden this idea that they they were targeted [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2441.54s)]
*  is just silly but they had people volunteering for that role exactly he didn't need to [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2448.82s)]
*  and and again in a way it's more running cover right like it's if this is this exchange while [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2455.3s)]
*  it may be true is a way of letting Scarborough off the hook like there was a fraud perpetrated [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2460.9s)]
*  on you poor Joe that you know no man could have seen through which is another lie I know I don't [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2467.1400000000003s)]
*  think you know in 2020 I wrote about Joe Biden hiding in the basement that he was cognitively [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2475.94s)]
*  impaired I did that I got so many hate letters and people from Stanford University [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2482.26s)]
*  and you know in one case I was called up before the faculty senate for what I was writing or what [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2488.34s)]
*  I had said on Fox and I and and you get attacked there were so many people there were 50 60 people [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2494.34s)]
*  who independently said this is this is something very wrong with this man he should not be president [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2501.7000000000003s)]
*  in the manner in which he has been nominated and the manner in which he is campaigning in 2020 we've [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2507.3s)]
*  never seen anything like it I always said this is not the 19th century in a log cabin where you just [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2512.82s)]
*  sit out in the wilderness and watch the thing pass you by he it was it was incredible he would be go [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2517.78s)]
*  to a it was almost like a drive-in movie he was in a car and then all the other people like 20 people [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2523.78s)]
*  in cars honking their applause and it just kept going on the more that you tried to point it out [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2529.2200000000003s)]
*  the more hatred you would incur from letters and text and everything and it wasn't just [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2534.66s)]
*  to be frank Megan it wasn't just the left that was angry it was the it was the Republican [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2542.1s)]
*  establishment said don't say that you're that's cruel just tampering it was it was really [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2547.3799999999997s)]
*  it was really something else and that's why people are so bitter because these people who attacked [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2554.3399999999997s)]
*  people who tried to not just tell the truth but to inform the nation that this was an unprecedented [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2559.86s)]
*  conspiracy and we'd never seen anything like it it was very dangerous because we did not know [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2567.06s)]
*  who was responsible for this radical agenda that that was far more radical than Obama and Obama [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2572.5s)]
*  could have never pulled that off because he was suspect as a radical himself but the use of this [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2579.6200000000003s)]
*  this ossified figure from our past that had passed himself off as a moderate and an aged [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2585.94s)]
*  moderate was a useful vessel and when you wrote about that people got they accused you of being [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2592.26s)]
*  insensitive mean hating old people it was everybody incurred that hatred so it's really frustrating [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2598.42s)]
*  to see all these people come out of the woodwork now and say well you know i knew it but i didn't [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2605.54s)]
*  quite want to say it but i i feel humiliated because you know they're going to do it again [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2612.34s)]
*  they're doing it again with the medical story and they will do it again and again and again [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2617.38s)]
*  there's no consequence i don't know anybody who's had you know anybody who's resigned because of [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2622.5s)]
*  this is scarborough going to resign is he going to say you know what i i tried to uh convince all of [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2627.06s)]
*  you in america of something that was clearly false and i apologize and i resign i don't think yeah [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2634.1000000000004s)]
*  no he didn't sound very contrite when he sat down with mark halperin yesterday at all and he'll [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2640.1s)]
*  never admit that he wasn't fooled for one second he knew he knew what we all knew they all knew [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2644.98s)]
*  that's what's so galling about this whole thing i wanted to show that tj duck low thing just because [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2652.9s)]
*  it's so irritating we knew that joe biden was using teleprompters during campaign events back [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2658.18s)]
*  in 2020 during covid and now it's come out that not only were they using multiple cameras so they [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2666.82s)]
*  could do the the jump cuts i read this to the audience yesterday from the book but just as a [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2672.1000000000004s)]
*  refresher uh this is from the book original sin um biden often couldn't make it through one or [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2675.94s)]
*  two minutes without botching a line or two in certain five minute video addresses to compensate [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2682.7400000000002s)]
*  for it aids film biden with two cameras instead of one if he messed up the edit was less obvious [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2687.54s)]
*  with the jump cut other politicians uh use jump cuts but but biden aids noted to themselves how [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2693.06s)]
*  much more often they had to use them for him when they recorded videos much of the footage was [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2697.94s)]
*  unusable the man could not speak said one person involved it was in his stutter it was his inability [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2702.1s)]
*  to find words to remember what he was saying to stay on the train of thought aids would sometimes [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2707.7s)]
*  make the videos in slo-mo to blur the reality of how slowly he actually walked every shoot was [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2711.62s)]
*  anxiety inducing for biden's team doing the videos without the extra camera would have been [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2716.9s)]
*  impossible at times the president had such trouble communicating that the videos were unsalvageable [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2722.82s)]
*  and the biden team just opted not to release them at other times they released video whose heavy [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2728.34s)]
*  editing was so obvious that they immediately regretted putting them out and on and on and then [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2733.3s)]
*  it it did come out that he was using the teleprompter to do um well notes that he just [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2739.78s)]
*  read off of for donor events and then the teleprompter for campaign events where he even [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=2745.86s)]

*  from the pentagon the secretary of defense has accepted a boeing 747 from qatar in accordance with [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3041.46s)]
*  all federal rules and regulations the department of defense will work to ensure property security [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3047.62s)]

*  president of the united states for additional information we refer you to the u.s air force [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3057.38s)]
*  this was controversial is controversial because they um cutters got a very checkered history when [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3062.34s)]
*  it comes to terrorism in the united states for one thing can this plane be secured in a way that [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3070.98s)]
*  will satisfy everyone that they're not listening to the president of the united states and his [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3076.1s)]
*  security team while on board it um and because it looks like lining the pockets of this particular [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3080.02s)]
*  president it's worth 400 million he says it's not a gift to me it's a gift to the united states or [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3086.42s)]
*  in this case to the pentagon but he'll be riding on it soon and only when it came under fire did [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3092.58s)]
*  he then say oh yeah we'll leave it for other presidents to use too after i'm done with it [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3100.66s)]
*  and then when it gets retired it will go to the trump presidential library i won't be flying [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3106.98s)]
*  around on it in other words post my presidency now i don't know whether he'll live up to any [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3112.3399999999997s)]
*  of that but right now it appears we've accepted a 400 million dollar gift from qatar your thoughts [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3118.18s)]
*  you know it's very it's a very complex story because there's so many different narratives [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3125.3799999999997s)]
*  like senator mullins said that it was discussed during the biden administration i don't know [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3129.54s)]
*  that if that was ever confirmed or not but the more you read about it it's kind of a white [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3134.18s)]
*  elephant it's a 2013 plane and it's the latest 747 but they haven't been making them for 12 years [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3139.62s)]
*  so they're kind of white elephants in the sense they're a good plane but they're very hard to [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3147.86s)]
*  maintain and to operate with extra pilots they're huge they take an enormous amount of [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3152.98s)]
*  fuel most people that have large jets prefer 757 777 787 so they're kind of a white elephant as i [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3159.86s)]
*  understand they had it on the market megan since 2020 and no one wanted it and there was a rumor [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3168.8199999999997s)]
*  that they gave one to turkey the other one yeah so the problem is that you get the impression that [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3175.2999999999997s)]
*  they wanted to unload this white elephant that you really i mean it was it was configured in a way [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3182.3399999999997s)]
*  that wasn't really practical for people and then when trump said i think that was not wise to say [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3187.54s)]
*  that it would be given to the foundation he could have said one of two things well we have a plane [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3193.14s)]
*  and if you if the air force doesn't want it or other presidents don't want it then we'll do what [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3199.7799999999997s)]
*  reagan did and just put it out there and not fly it because who in their right mind would want to [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3205.62s)]
*  fly around the united states with a gas guzzling out of date hard to maintain expensive to operate [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3210.66s)]
*  jumbo jet and i think he would have he would have avoided a lot of the problems maybe that's his [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3217.06s)]
*  position now the other thing is gutter always does this anybody they built that al oled air force [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3223.7s)]
*  base we didn't build it they built a billion dollars i've seen it it's huge and they just [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3233.06s)]
*  presented it to us and the military i i wrote at the time is this wise to take this big gift [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3238.74s)]
*  because they would looked on one side to iran and then they looked at the golf and they were saying [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3244.58s)]
*  we're going to play both sides and we're going to be the conduit between terrorists and legitimate [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3249.14s)]
*  governments and iran and the saudis and the sunni monarchies but this is a precarious position we [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3255.2999999999997s)]
*  have al jazeera so we want protection so we're going to build this billion dollar base and give [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3262.3399999999997s)]
*  it to you and you don't have to spend a penny and that's what we did and then they came back and we [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3268.1s)]
*  said well we need this and we need more and we want a bigger run they said fine we'll do a [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3272.9s)]
*  another billion dollar so this is a long history that we've had with them and i think what was [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3277.7s)]
*  behind it was that donald trump cemented all these deals and he did one with gutter and they thought [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3284.98s)]
*  we're going to compromise them or we're going to give a gift and it didn't look good to turn the [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3292.02s)]
*  gift down but if you look at the actual value of the plane and what you're going to have to do to [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3296.18s)]
*  it and the it'll probably the time to refit this plane might not be that much quicker than the two [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3301.7s)]
*  boeings that are on order anyway so i don't quite understand there's no utility there's no upside is [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3308.4199999999996s)]
*  what i'm saying either in the plane itself or and i guess the only explanation i can think is donald [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3315.94s)]
*  trump is transactional he didn't want to offend his host by turning down something that they had [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3323.3s)]
*  already tried to give to turkey and successfully and has no market value because no one no one [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3328.98s)]
*  wanted to buy it well i mean the report said that trump was very unhappy with air force one and even [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3334.42s)]
*  some of the reporters writing on it said it had gotten really kind of rickety you know like the [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3338.9s)]
*  takeoff 40 years old yes yeah and it's it's like a you know aircraft carrier in the sky [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3342.9s)]
*  and you know trump is used to flying on a luxury plane and he didn't like this and suddenly this [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3348.6600000000003s)]
*  gift is offered and that plane is absolutely stunning and gorgeous and i can see why he was [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3353.14s)]
*  like hell yes that looks like a much nicer way to spend the next four years right i mean i think [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3357.3799999999997s)]
*  i think he just has to i just i just think he's going to have to say that if he wants to get out [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3362.9s)]
*  of it he's going to have to say the u.s military has taken gifts we watch this country very [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3368.42s)]
*  carefully in my first term i was very tough on it and the rules are it's going to be a air force [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3373.22s)]
*  jet it's if it if the two boeings are still tardy the next president will use it it'll be retrofitted [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3379.22s)]
*  and it's just a stop got measure and if they want to give it to the trump foundation we will [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3387.7799999999997s)]
*  accord it the same status that ronald reagan did with the 747 that's at the library legally it looks [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3392.8999999999996s)]
*  like it's okay because it would be a violation of the emoluments clause and if it were a gift or a [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3400.66s)]
*  fee for service situation unless congress approved it congress didn't approve it but [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3407.3s)]
*  they're arguing at the doj this isn't a gift to trump it's a gift to the pentagon that will stay [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3411.86s)]
*  government owned until it's retired and that he's not performing any service to receive it there's [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3417.54s)]
*  no you know quid pro quo with qatar that's the argument i mean that doesn't answer the question [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3423.86s)]
*  about whether this is this feels ethically wrong it puts us in a position where we're somehow [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3428.1800000000003s)]
*  beholden to qatar which most americans don't want it just feels kind of gross it does and i [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3434.9s)]
*  think it raises a larger question that donald trump was very successful in pointing out the [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3441.7000000000003s)]
*  corruption of the biden family consortium they were into everything 30 million dollars hunter [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3449.06s)]

*  makes us stronger and more prosperous as a nation we spent 227 000 for big cats youtube channel [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3700.02s)]

*  one you had a margarita with and that guy is a human trafficker and that guy is a gang banger [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3717.9399999999996s)]
*  and that and the evidence is going to be clear in the days that mr chairman you're going to see who [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3723.7s)]
*  you went to do i'm sorry mr chairman rubio has the floor chairman he can't make unsubstantiated [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3726.8999999999996s)]
*  like that secretary rubio has the floor you should take that testimony the federal [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3732.74s)]
*  senator united states because he hasn't done it under oath here's another point okay [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3737.7799999999997s)]
*  there is a division in our government between the federal branch and the judicial branch [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3743.2999999999997s)]
*  no judge and the judicial branch cannot tell me or the president how to conduct foreign policy [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3747.14s)]
*  and he went on it was beautiful yeah it was and uh you know when you look at [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3753.54s)]
*  who is really uh articulating this counter-revolution is scott de sent in economics [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3761.54s)]
*  and marco rubio in state and without those two guys i think they'd be in trouble because they [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3767.94s)]
*  they have a reassuring calm but they're very tough and they don't back down and they're not [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3772.9s)]
*  afraid of controversy and when you sent rubio down to panama after all the media was going crazy [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3778.02s)]
*  we're going to invade panama and he went down there and he just solved the problem sued everything [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3784.42s)]
*  over but did not back down i wish because i do think they have so many uh balls in the air they've [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3790.02s)]
*  got the ukraine war they've got the iranian nuclear negotiations they've got the hostages [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3797.94s)]
*  with hamas and i think they need to uh i know that's well cough is a special envoy but no special [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3803.3s)]
*  can be doing all of that and not yeah with cough excuse me and i it would be very wise i think if [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3811.86s)]
*  all of that was bundled back into the state department and rubio himself and let rubio pick [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3818.3399999999997s)]
*  the special envoys and operate just let this just outsource because he's very competent and he's [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3824.8199999999997s)]
*  he's on the same page with trump but i i just feel i think the american people feel that when he is [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3832.1s)]
*  conducting 100 of our foreign policy to the degree that it's delegated by the president it's reassuring [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3838.02s)]
*  and he doesn't make slips or gaffes so i and i understand he's he's probably the most powerful [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3845.46s)]
*  secretary of state given the national security portfolio that we've had in a long time but [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3851.2999999999997s)]
*  i wish that these major uh negotiations and there's three or four of them that have got global [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3857.14s)]
*  and historical importance that he was the point man on it i think that would be wise he is 53 [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3863.8599999999997s)]
*  years old jd vance just turned 40 um they're they're both very formidable jd vance much more [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3871.54s)]
*  aligned i think with the restrainer wing of the republican party but marco rubio has been talking [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3881.22s)]
*  that talk too but he's close to trump i would say on foreign policy where he's he feels the [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3887.22s)]
*  restrainer influence and doesn't reject it and sees its wisdom but isn't afraid to bomb sulamani [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3893.46s)]
*  you know that's trump and also i would say rubio who's not afraid to be very strong in his language [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3900.26s)]
*  about for example hamas and what they did to israel who has no quarter for iran and that's where [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3905.0600000000004s)]
*  there is a little split between some of the hardcore restrainers and that may include jd [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3912.5800000000004s)]
*  and guys like marco so that you're kind of seeing the future of the republican party [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3917.5400000000004s)]
*  develop and you know come into its own and mark halperin was on fox last night making the following [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3921.46s)]
*  point about those two watch this sot nine when he was back in the florida legislature he was tagged [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3928.18s)]
*  as someone destined for you know a national profile and his presidential campaign disappointed his [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3933.7799999999997s)]
*  supporters but he is just one of the stars of this administration if you even if you don't agree with [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3938.98s)]
*  his policies his his knowledge of policy his knowledge his rhetoric his confidence and his [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3943.3799999999997s)]
*  winning over magga he went a rough spell with magga over immigration and now he is one of the [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3948.8999999999996s)]
*  heroes of the movement and i said earlier today i'll say it again i really do think jd vance and [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3953.7s)]
*  marco rubio could end up being a pre-ordained ticket in 2028 unlike we've ever seen before [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3958.8999999999996s)]
*  i mean you can dream victor that would be amazing it would and i've been amazed by mark halpern that [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3966.74s)]
*  he's really come into his own after yes yeah i've been really everyone subscribed to next up with [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3973.46s)]
*  mark halpern it's out there as part of our mk media network keep going yeah he's been i think [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3979.14s)]
*  he's very good but uh the thing that the that uh marco rubio kind of you said the two wings i guess [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3983.46s)]
*  i think what you would call it is jacksonianism and walter russell mead has used that term a lot [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3992.58s)]
*  in other words the idea is that we don't look for optional military engagements in the middle east [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=3997.94s)]
*  we don't want ground troops we don't want to slay dragons overseas but we're going to [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4003.46s)]
*  be no better friend and no worse enemy and if you screw around with the united states we're going [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4009.06s)]
*  to retaliate disproportionately and that was solomani that was baghdaddy that was the wagner [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4015.54s)]
*  group in syria and when trump left he had really established the idea with north korea with the [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4021.06s)]
*  houthis that he was unpredictable but he would retaliate and if he retaliated it would be [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4027.78s)]
*  disproportionate so don't don't provoke him and that that was why jake sullivan bragged just i [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4033.2999999999997s)]
*  think three days before october 7th he said our portfolio in the middle east is the calmest i've [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4040.02s)]
*  ever seen it what he was really unknowingly saying is that we have eroded this the last three years [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4046.18s)]
*  but it was so strong that people still felt that the trump jacksonian policy was in effect even [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4052.74s)]
*  though we delisted the houthis as a terrorist organization even though we tried to beg the [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4059.38s)]
*  iranians to get back in the uh the nuclear deal even though the afghanistan disaster even though [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4063.86s)]
*  we distance ourselves and that finally ran out is what i'm saying and they destroyed what what [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4070.02s)]
*  what had happened but rubio really does represent a nice fusion of mega neo isolationism or non [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4075.2200000000003s)]
*  interventionism and deterrence and it's it's uh i think that's why he's getting a higher profile [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4083.06s)]
*  because he seems to me it just as an outsider to reflect more the natural inclinations of donald [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4090.2599999999998s)]
*  trump donald trump is not wanting to mention him trump like when trump talks about the future of [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4097.14s)]
*  the republican party and somebody says is it jd is it jd trump keeps saying jd is great marco [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4102.5s)]
*  rubio is great too like he keeps making space for him and donald trump thinks it's as a businessman [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4107.46s)]
*  he thinks war is bad business blowing stuff up is not what he does and he thinks it's a waste of time [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4113.94s)]
*  and but at the same time and that that's a mega strain but at the same time he understands [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4120.34s)]
*  that if you broadcast your mega mega mega mega and you're not going it's not worth getting involved [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4125.86s)]
*  people are going to involve you and the only way you can prevent that is from time to time show [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4130.9s)]
*  force that makes your deterrence credible and that's what rubio and i think trump agree on [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4136.66s)]
*  let me ask you something about um speaking of foreign policy what's happening now with russia [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4142.18s)]
*  and ukraine it's not going very well the attempts to end this thing you know we signed this minerals [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4145.86s)]
*  deal with ukraine but trump and putin spoke the other day and trump came out and said you know all [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4150.58s)]
*  sort of flowery oh great we had great talk great talk but putin came out was like nothing nothing [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4157.94s)]
*  much happened you know like kind of no change and now um i'm looking at the new york times here on [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4163.38s)]
*  the front page their headline is trump's shift on ukraine you all fix it us backs off putin splitting [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4169.3s)]
*  with allies they report as follows mr trump and president zelensky of ukraine and other european [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4174.900000000001s)]

*  ukraine would have to find a solution to the war themselves just days after saying that only he and [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4188.74s)]
*  mr putin had the power to broker a deal so that i mean if that's the case because you know the [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4194.099999999999s)]
*  other piece of this is um hold on i just want to get the exact reporting right they say um okay [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4200.74s)]
*  unless he again reverses course monday's developments left mr putin with exactly what [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4210.0199999999995s)]
*  he wanted not only an end to the american pressure but the creation of a deep fissure [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4214.26s)]
*  inside nato between the americans and their traditional european allies who say they are [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4219.7s)]
*  going ahead with sanctions anyway the point that they seem to be making is that trump's giving up [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4224.66s)]
*  whatever leverage he has on putin he just pulling out of it the u.s just pulling out of this thing [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4230.02s)]
*  means pulling out of our support for ukraine which means likely possible collapse of ukraine [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4234.900000000001s)]
*  putin i mean he could keep it going he could take over all of ukraine if if we don't have [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4240.34s)]
*  any involvement there it would be up to the europeans which no one wants to hear if it's [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4245.22s)]
*  their country's fate so what do you make of where we are right now on that conflict [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4250.9s)]
*  well after what we saw in afghanistan i don't think donald trump is going to pull [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4256.0199999999995s)]
*  all support out of ukraine that would be a disaster he'd be blamed for it he's not going [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4260.0199999999995s)]
*  to do that i think what is wholly holding up everything i think donald trump realizes now [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4263.78s)]
*  belatedly but it's still only been 120 days versus a three-year war that vladimir putin's [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4270.66s)]
*  challenge is that even though he has all of the assets in his favor he's got 10 times the gdp [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4278.58s)]
*  30 times the area four times the population he has suffered a million casualties dead wounded [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4287.139999999999s)]
*  and missing probably there's a million and a half total and his military has been really destroyed [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4293.22s)]
*  his gdp has been warped and he wants out of it but he's got to tell the apparatus the the military [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4298.740000000001s)]
*  and people that it was worth it and so far what he sees that he's gotten out of it for the million [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4307.22s)]
*  casualties is he's advanced 40 80 miles and places beyond crimea and donbass he's institutionalized [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4314.5s)]
*  that he's not going to give them back and he's got that ukraine won't be a nato but he doesn't [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4322.5s)]
*  think at this point given the blunder that he committed that he can go back to the people that [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4330.74s)]
*  have the power to get rid of them and there are people that have the power to get rid of them in [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4336.26s)]
*  russia that they're not going to accept that and yet he can't go on because he is he is bleeding [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4339.86s)]
*  maybe he's got more resources and he can bleed out ukraine first but he is he's damaged the [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4346.66s)]
*  russian military for probably 10 years and he's and he's got i mean we've never seen anything like [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4352.74s)]
*  this in europe since stalingrad in 1942 never it's got more casualties now than stalingrad [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4358.66s)]
*  and the weird thing about the whole thing is donald trump gyrates and fluid but he is the [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4366.34s)]
*  only president i'd never heard a word in 2014 from obama about crimea and donbass are from biden [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4373.14s)]
*  when the fighting about the human cost and they never biden said well what's your strategy just [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4381.22s)]
*  give it what it takes but there was never anything this is horrific a million and a half people [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4386.34s)]
*  dead wounded maimed for what and trump so he really does that's all he talks about it's it doesn't [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4392.1s)]
*  make any sense and so i think psychologically whether he knows it or not he's invested in it [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4398.74s)]
*  and then more importantly he's learned that vladimir putin started the war vladimir putin [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4404.66s)]
*  has objectives and no one not even putin knows at what point he can stop the war and stay in power [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4410.9s)]
*  and i have a feeling that if we just persevere a little bit longer and i don't mean give it [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4418.179999999999s)]
*  whatever it takes that there will be a point where putin will negotiate and but trump is in [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4425.54s)]
*  a very difficult position because the mega majority of the party wants to cut completely off and just [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4433.22s)]
*  say let the europeans do it the europeans the europeans claim they're going to put 40 000 [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4440.66s)]
*  troops they won't do that i can guarantee you they will not they will not do that and they say [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4446.18s)]
*  they're going to give them 200 billion dollars i can guarantee you they're not going to do that [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4450.26s)]
*  all they're going to do is attack the united states and and then hope that we intervene [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4454.1s)]
*  in the way that we have and then they they piggyback on so whether we like it or not [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4459.22s)]
*  the existence of ukraine as an independent nation depends on us and that's very hard to to reconcile [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4464.820000000001s)]
*  with the mega doctrine that we don't get in the affairs of others when you add that it's got [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4471.780000000001s)]
*  russia's got 6000 deliverable nuclear weapons and almost daily threatens to use a tactical [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4478.26s)]
*  nuclear weapon the whole thing is a mess but i still think that the only chance for this thing [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4484.74s)]
*  to end is for trump to find out how much uh putin is going to take before he stops and i think [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4489.62s)]
*  he can't he can't give in to putin but he's got to convince him no more you've got Crimea you've [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4500.5s)]
*  got don't pass go back and tell everybody you institutionalize that and it was up it was not [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4506.34s)]
*  determined until you win go back and tell them that yes ukraine will not be a nato go back and [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4512.1s)]
*  tell them there's a dmz here and we'll have a ceasefire basically where the battle line but [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4517.860000000001s)]
*  there's not it can't you're not going to get any more all you're going to do is is find yourself [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4522.34s)]
*  killing innocent people and your own people for what and i think trump has come out i mean he [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4527.38s)]
*  goes between like i'm out and i'm gonna put secondary sanctions out there i'm gonna i'm [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4532.74s)]
*  not gonna do business at the as the united states with any bank that does business with russia which [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4538.98s)]
*  he knows actually would hurt now we're talking and that that is the one thing that p Biden would not [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4543.78s)]
*  do that's it's very ironic because everybody said the only thing that will stop russia is a secondary [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4549.3s)]
*  boycott that people who deal business with russia will not be doing business with us and that's very [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4555.38s)]
*  rare to do it's very rare in history but if you do that it's almost like a declaration of war because [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4561.62s)]
*  it's it is final it's what we did that with japan and uh you know it was pretty tough in pearl harbor [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4567.46s)]
*  not that we didn't you know that we deserved it but we we made the decision when we cut off all oil [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4575.54s)]
*  and cut off all banking and finance and shipments that we were ready for a new phase with japan and [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4582.099999999999s)]
*  it was a wise thing to do but it's ironic that people are criticizing trump as too soft on [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4590.02s)]
*  putin but he's the only one that has even broached the subject of the only thing that would stop [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4596.5s)]
*  putin that would really stop putin well that's where we are today uh it's very slow going all [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4601.700000000001s)]
*  right let's shift over to the white house where something extraordinary just happened you've got [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4608.5s)]
*  the leader of south africa now what's been happening in south africa is um post apartheid [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4612.900000000001s)]
*  it seems very much like the shoe's now on the other foot and they're perfectly happy to [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4618.74s)]
*  discriminate against the eight percent of south african citizens who are white and and to be [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4622.98s)]
*  honest it looks like they're enjoying discriminating against these eight percent white um sins of the [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4629.0599999999995s)]
*  father and so on that's their justification so now trump has let some it's 59 south african white [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4634.66s)]
*  farmers and their families come to the united states saying that they're refugees fleeing [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4641.78s)]
*  persecution and he's used the term genocide and we've been doing our own research to find out what [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4647.46s)]
*  exactly is happening in south africa because unlike jake tapper we don't just take the word [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4652.9800000000005s)]
*  of the president sorry jake but the left i should say left wing reporters uh we actually started [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4657.7s)]
*  kicking these claims and trying to figure out whether they were true and we can't support [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4663.06s)]
*  genocide so far based on what we've seen but there is 100 threatened violence and there has been some [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4667.38s)]
*  violence against farmers though they don't distinguish in the numbers that they release [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4675.06s)]
*  when it comes to race so there's no way that we have been able to figure out of knowing exactly [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4681.46s)]
*  who's who's died what we know is the following and i'm going to get to what's happening at the [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4686.18s)]
*  white house i'm just giving the audience some background um overall there is consensus that [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4690.42s)]
*  there's some violence occurring against white farmers in south africa it is disputed just how [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4694.740000000001s)]
*  much and how big a problem this is via the non-profit afra forum which is a south african [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4700.9s)]
*  land forum that focuses on the interest of africaners they said in 2022 there were verified [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4707.219999999999s)]
*  333 attacks on south african farms including 50 murders the year before that 415 attacks 55 murders [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4712.099999999999s)]
*  but they're not broken down by race however we do know that whites in south africa own about three [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4719.62s)]
*  quarters of the farms so if you're seeing all this violence on farms and you know that whites [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4728.5s)]
*  own three quarters of the farms the odds are good that a lot of whites are being killed or at least [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4735.54s)]
*  were in 2021 and 2022 via the federalist in 2024 april through september citing south african [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4740.98s)]
*  police stats there were 197 reported farm murders and 154 attempts and nearly 600 total cases of [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4750.42s)]
*  assaults on farms okay so all of that is pretty good evidence that there are white farmers being [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4760.42s)]
*  killed or attempted murders on those white farmers fyi the un defines genocide under the article 2 [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4766.02s)]
*  of the convention as a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national ethnic racial or [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4774.74s)]
*  religious group in whole or in part or in part so it's open to interpretation and so what happened [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4780.02s)]
*  now is the south african president ramaphosa shows up to the white house because they have deals they [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4786.900000000001s)]
*  want to negotiate we're mad that they turned in israel to the hag for war crimes in gaza and they [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4794.9800000000005s)]
*  would like to do more business with us but we are also saying we're not going to have economic [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4802.5s)]
*  meetings and summits in south africa because you're you're doing this and we object to it so [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4807.38s)]
*  this was an attempted you know reconciliation of sorts when this guy comes over here and sits down [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4812.02s)]
*  with president trump in the oval okay now here comes today's developments president trump stayed [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4817.7s)]
*  now reporting here from the new york times staged a video screening in the oval showing some kind of [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4824.9800000000005s)]
*  documentary that purportedly shows violence against white farmers in south africa the delegation from [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4830.34s)]
*  south africa sitting in silence watching looking somewhat bemused and perplexed according to the [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4835.94s)]
*  times they write this is an extraordinary scene the trump team clearly came to the meeting prepared [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4841.139999999999s)]
*  to play videos backing up what the times describes as their false claim that there are mass killings [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4845.62s)]
*  against white south africans as an aside the times is very upset as is most of the left wing [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4851.54s)]
*  that trump has given refugee status to these 59 white south african citizens they are convinced [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4857.78s)]
*  it's because they have white skin suddenly they're very concerned about refugees coming [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4864.18s)]
*  into the united states not the three million that biden allowed but the 59 that trump allowed [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4868.5s)]
*  because they're white and before i show you what happened today at the at the oval let me show you [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4874.900000000001s)]
*  a little bit of how the new york times has been covering this ongoing um problem and and their [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4881.06s)]
*  take on it we're going to play it's a little on the long side but let's play 11c from their new [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4888.740000000001s)]
*  york times podcast the daily which aired on monday for decades white south africans ruled [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4892.98s)]

*  because if we look at his ascendancy to the presidency part of his whole pitch was to be this [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4929.78s)]
*  president who would ensure that the forgotten white man would be taken care of right that we would [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4937.3s)]
*  fight back against sort of this demographic shift these demographic changes these [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4945.22s)]
*  brown people coming into our country and invading our borders trump's presidency and his whole [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4949.62s)]
*  political identity has always had an element that has really spoken to the folks all around the [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4956.42s)]
*  world who embrace these sort of theories these feelings that white people are under threat and [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4962.740000000001s)]
*  so here he had an example south africa could now be the example that he points to and says like [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4969.3s)]
*  this is what could come for us here in america and how much has it been about circumstances [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4977.860000000001s)]
*  within the united states the perceived threat level against white citizens here in other words [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4984.5s)]
*  is this about the tale of the africaners or that cautionary tale that trump and those around him [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4991.54s)]
*  feel it represents two white americans [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=4999.54s)]
*  okay so you get the flavor victor they're upset that the refugees are white that's not allowed [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5005.780000000001s)]
*  your thoughts on it before i take you to inside the oval and some more of what we heard well one [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5012.1s)]
*  thing we did know is they applied for refugee status before they got here and they were granted [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5017.46s)]
*  that we know that the first thing joe biden did was say that refugees who came to the united states [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5022.66s)]
*  could declare if they i shouldn't say refugees anybody who came to the united states could [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5029.46s)]
*  declare they were refugees after they got here and they they got rid of the idea under the first [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5033.780000000001s)]
*  trump administration you had to apply for refugee status in your home country so first of all [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5038.9800000000005s)]
*  what they're basically saying is and this is a racist thing what they're saying is if donald [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5044.900000000001s)]
*  trump has people who apply for refugee status and he allows the men say 60 something 70 might maybe [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5050.18s)]
*  even get to 100 and they happen to be white that's proof of racism but if we let in 10 million [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5056.82s)]
*  people and maybe three million have applied for refugee status after they got here and we let them [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5063.7s)]
*  in and the vast majority are not white that's okay but we can't make these people apply in their own [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5069.7s)]
*  country and they're under 100 and that and so what what i'm getting at is the left is it opens another [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5078.9s)]
*  issue very quickly megan and that is people are using the word white in kind of a racist context [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5085.86s)]
*  i haven't seen in in recent times i'll give you just a few examples we had caitlin clark in the [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5092.5s)]
*  foul the other day and she was called a white gal in the work and then we had jasmine crocket talk [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5098.74s)]
*  about she didn't trust the democrats not to nominate white boys and then we had illian [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5104.98s)]
*  omar a tape surface where she called basically white men the greatest terrorist threat and so [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5111.06s)]
*  they the left has taken this idea and we saw it with milley and austin said white privilege white [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5118.1s)]
*  rage white supremacists we're going to fare it out in the pentagon they found no by the way that [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5123.46s)]
*  pentagon report that finally surfaced found no such systemic white racism in the military but it [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5128.1s)]
*  did it did account for 45 000 people not joining the military and the data shows that they were [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5133.9400000000005s)]
*  overwhelmingly white males who fell under the di they were under suspicion on unjustifiably [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5140.26s)]
*  and by the way they were the demographic that died at double their numbers in the general [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5147.06s)]
*  population in afghanistan and iraq so we just basically alienated them and then when we got [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5152.02s)]
*  rid of di they came back so there it's been the bar like everything else with the left the bar's [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5158.5s)]
*  been lowered and you can just now say that donald trump is a white racist if that were true [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5164.66s)]
*  there was a rast muslim report as you know came out two weeks ago about the first hundred days [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5172.34s)]
*  and what was interesting about that was 39 percent of african-americans said they approved of the [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5176.98s)]
*  first hundred days 62 percent of hispanics said they did and they were much higher than whites [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5182.74s)]
*  and so if donald trump is a racist and he's favoring [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5189.7s)]
*  he's favoring white immigrants as refugees why in the world are people of color supporting him [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5194.74s)]
*  far more than any other republican candidate in modern memory and i think what we're seeing is [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5201.78s)]
*  that the democratic party and the left realizes that their boutique issues transgenderism open [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5208.98s)]
*  borders no deportations the basically dei pro hamas appeals to nobody and they are a party of [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5216.18s)]
*  the very very wealthy bi-costal elite and and the subsidized poor but my point is african-americans [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5227.780000000001s)]
*  and hispanics are starting to look at a jasmine crocket or an aoc in the same way working white [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5235.9400000000005s)]
*  people look at the architects a senator holland or a nancy they don't feel connected with them [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5242.66s)]
*  and what's getting them really angry is donald trump is appealing to people on terms of middle [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5250.66s)]
*  class solidarity that trans that kind of transcends race and that's really hurt them and they're very [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5256.74s)]
*  angry about it so they've got to keep trying to tell their former constituencies he's a racist [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5263.86s)]
*  he's a racist he's a racist white boy white boy white boy white males white males might [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5269.38s)]
*  might privilege what and they drive it into the ground and it has the opposite effect people are [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5274.42s)]
*  sick of it and they know that they do not they don't appeal to working-class hispanics or blacks [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5278.5s)]
*  they don't care about them they dump illegal immigrations and immigrants in the inner city [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5283.9400000000005s)]

*  bankrupting him he's blaming it on trump's tariffs but we are seeing the consequences [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5308.74s)]
*  to these disasters policy i'm speaking in california 50 percent of all the births in [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5313.7s)]

*  elsewhere i'd like to know where that is because this i've never seen says ramaphosa suggesting [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5728.58s)]
*  without directly saying it that trump is being misled and this video is from somewhere other [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5733.94s)]

*  interjection of his own when that happened here in sat 43 we've got to deal with the past the [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5746.5s)]
*  government and as your government also has the right to expropriate land for public use and [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5754.58s)]

*  passed a law that makes it legal to seize privately owned land without compensation [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5802.66s)]

*  anything we have reasons though to separate ourselves more from south africa besides just [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5935.54s)]
*  and that's one reason but they are the most one of the most anti-semitic anti-israel countries in [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5940.74s)]
*  the world at least on their voting record in the un they're no friend of the united states [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5946.74s)]

*  history of kind of an apartheid too there not kind of but an actual one in rodisha [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5978.58s)]
*  zimbabwe so they got rid of all of the white farmers they were a neck food exporter and then [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5983.78s)]
*  they they were not self-sufficient in food and that's the trajectory that south africa is going [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5989.62s)]
*  to be and so they've got a problem and it was a very advanced sophisticated country but it was [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=5995.46s)]
*  an apartheid country so they don't know quite they're a little bit confused because they have [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6001.22s)]
*  that zimbabwe example before them so they're not as they're not as overt and they're going after [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6005.54s)]
*  white farmers but uh basically their attitude and the attitude of the international left is that they [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6013.06s)]
*  get a blank check to do whatever they want because of the history of apartheid and and nobody yeah [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6019.860000000001s)]

*  immigration laws so what are you so you can't reason with them and i think rubio understands [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6056.5s)]
*  that he doesn't want to argue with them they're they're just ideologues and they're racist too [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6061.78s)]

*  all races should be on an equal footing in south africa that's the right thing to do not to replace [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6399.7s)]
*  one set of racist laws with another set of racist laws which is utterly wrong and improper [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6404.42s)]
*  and then here's the follow-up 11b now i'm in this absurd situation where i was born in south africa [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6410.74s)]
*  but can't get a license to operate in starlink because i'm not black well it looks like that's [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6415.7s)]

*  everyone wants to hear from you yes or no not for me not for me to answer i have got a question for [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6447.22s)]
*  you about uh about your government work there and the amount of savings why do you like racist laws [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6453.9400000000005s)]

*  so good victor she's not going to answer because she agrees with the odd thing is [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6472.74s)]
*  we have somewhat similar laws here that on public construction a certain number percentage of [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6477.54s)]
*  i think we saw that with the obama library that there is there is an idea that black-owned [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6483.62s)]
*  businesses are guaranteed a particular percentage of a particular yeah look what's happening in [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6490.34s)]
*  hollywood you can't get your film nominated for these awards unless you have a certain quota [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6494.66s)]
*  of black minority lgbtq whatever uh employees working for you yeah and the question that i [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6500.34s)]
*  would have is does this help the majority of citizens of south africa all of these laws and [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6508.0199999999995s)]
*  to discourage foreign investment and to go after these people who right they've been there for nine [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6512.5s)]
*  generations some of them and they're very good they're some of the best farmers in the world [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6518.18s)]
*  and the foreign exchange they earn and the bounty they produce helps everybody in the country [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6522.9s)]
*  and to get rid of them and kill them or drive them off the land and put people on there that [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6528.66s)]
*  don't have that expertise we know what happened because we saw it in rodisha there has to be a [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6532.98s)]
*  trend there has to be some type of of mechanism where if you really want blacks to be better [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6538.179999999999s)]
*  farmers have internships or something or have i think over half the land in south africa is [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6544.66s)]
*  owned by the government anyway then have government land sold to people who qualify you know as as as [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6549.62s)]
*  adept farmers but it's it's not it's not going to happen and south africa is the polar opposite of [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6556.0199999999995s)]
*  israel the international community idolizes and overlooks all of the felonies of south africa [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6563.14s)]
*  and they idolize them because of mandela and the apartheid and all of that i understand that and [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6571.3s)]
*  then they magnify everything israel doesn't hate israel and you can usually see a person's [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6576.18s)]
*  political ideology on those two barometers they hate israel and they idolize south africa and if [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6582.1s)]
*  you try to argue with them that israel is a functional progressive democracy and south [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6587.3s)]
*  africa is not they they don't care it's race race race race race last topic because you're the [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6593.22s)]
*  perfect person to ask about james comey and his little walk along the seashore where he just [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6600.34s)]
*  innocently surprisingly stumbled upon seashells arranged in the numbers 86 47 now he's trying to [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6607.7s)]
*  promote a book and he's gotten himself a lot of free media coverage the latest was on msnbc [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6617.860000000001s)]

*  a political firestorm yeah for walking on the beach with my wife so i don't know how we ended [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6637.78s)]
*  up here never occurred to me that it was any kind of controversial thing but that's the time we live [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6644.179999999999s)]
*  in as a kid it always meant to leave a place to ditch a place i said that's really clever so then [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6648.58s)]
*  she said you should take a picture of that and i did and i posted it on my instagram account [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6654.1s)]
*  and thought nothing more of i regret the distraction and the controversy around it but again it's hard [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6659.22s)]
*  to have regret about something that even in hindsight looks to me to be totally innocent [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6665.14s)]
*  totally innocent we have got to show you one more here he is on colbert late uh last night [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6671.06s)]
*  tuesday night what look at this dot 22 you in this instagram instagram you grahammed this you [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6676.1s)]

*  yeah my wife and i patrice were walking on the beach and saw those numbers in shells on the beach [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6686.42s)]
*  you didn't do this somebody else did this yeah somebody else did it we were on a walk [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6691.540000000001s)]
*  preparing for this week right roll out of my book yep she looked at it and said why'd someone put [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6694.900000000001s)]
*  their address in the sand all right and then we we stood at it trying to figure looked at it trying [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6699.06s)]
*  to figure out what it was and she'd long been a server in restaurants and she said you know what [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6704.18s)]
*  i think it is yeah i think it's a reference to restaurants when you would 86 something in a [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6707.62s)]
*  restaurant right off the menu yeah i said no i remember as a kid you'd say 86 to get out of a [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6711.78s)]
*  place this place stinks let's 86 it i was a bartender you would 86 a customer if they were [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6716.9s)]
*  getting drunk like that's 86 i'm just like give them a low proof alcohol something like that yeah [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6721.22s)]
*  and so i said i i think it's a clever political message and she said you should take a picture [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6726.26s)]
*  of it i said sure and then she said you should instagram that and boom [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6731.0599999999995s)]
*  boom [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6734.5s)]
*  that's that's not quite the story is it because what was unique about that entire exegesis he [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6737.38s)]
*  never worked he never mentioned the word 47 not once he didn't say he just took 86 no you you know [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6743.06s)]
*  that while it is a common vernacular to say you're going to kick somebody out of a bar 86 [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6750.26s)]
*  that in the last two decades has taken on another connotation to eliminate somebody and it has and [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6755.46s)]
*  the FBI knows that better than anybody and he knows that he took that picture to put it on [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6761.0599999999995s)]
*  there to generate controversy and he and to reflect his visceral hatred of Donald Trump whom he blames [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6768.259999999999s)]
*  for ending his corrupt career and it was going to be public publicity for the book and it worked [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6774.9s)]
*  out pretty well for him he thinks but remember Megan this is the guy who hired Christopher [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6779.459999999999s)]
*  Steele and basically as an FBI contractor he used the Steele dossier was completely bogus to get [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6785.62s)]
*  FISA warrants his lawyer Kevin one of the FBI lawyers Kevin Kline Smith forged the document [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6792.74s)]
*  he himself had a conversation with the president of the United States which was confidential he [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6799.14s)]
*  turned around recorded it on FBI device leaked it he bragged that he had ambushed his FBI agents [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6804.34s)]
*  had ambushed Michael Flynn on a bogus Logan act and destroyed Michael Flynn's career [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6811.22s)]
*  uh we also know that he said that Hillary Clinton he took on the the role not just as an FBI [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6817.14s)]
*  investigator but for some reason as a prosecutor a virtual uh attorney general in the 2016 election [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6823.14s)]
*  said Hillary Clinton was guilty of transmitting classified files maybe destroying subpoenaed [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6830.26s)]
*  evidence but no jury would convict her and therefore as a now he as a attorney general he [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6836.02s)]
*  was not going to prosecute Loretta Lynch just abdicated so he was the he was the iconic person [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6843.38s)]

*  yet they let the 51 intelligence authorities lie to the American people on the verge of a debate [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6910.66s)]
*  that whole thing was corrupt and now they're going to shut down the office transfer the [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6916.18s)]

*  McCabe as did Christopher right a iconic institution and when they got done with it [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZZUEcjhrow&t=6930.66s)]
