Then Emily Jashinsky, D.C. correspondent for UnHerd, and Eliana Johnson, editor of the Washington Free Beacon, join to discuss the Colorado attack by an illegal migrant yelling "Free Palestine," CNN pundits attacking the FBI for daring to describe it correctly as a terror attack, a black South Carolina mother's murder at the hands of six illegal migrants that's being ignored by the corporate media, President Trump and protection of young women, a new poll showing Democratic voters hate their party, Biden's awkward comments to reporters, Nicolle Wallace's new podcast, she and Rachel Maddow laughing about fascism, MSNBC and CNN seeing massive cratering ratings, Rosie O'Donnell's cringey appearance on the new "Sex and the City" season as a lesbian nun, her past comments about Trump giving her a cold sore, Patti Lupone’s comments trashing two Broadway actresses, backlash to her calling a "black" musical "loud," the civil war that ensued and her forced apology, and more.

# Illegal Migrant Commits Terror Attack, and Left Turning on Each Other, with Jashinsky and Johnson
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Monday. Gosh, there's a lot [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=0.0s)]
*  There's a lot to go over. Is it every Monday? I don't know. It's this Monday. There's a lot to go over [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5.76s)]
*  Including this horrific story this this just it just keeps happening this one out of Colorado [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=12.24s)]
*  elderly women and men won a Holocaust survivor [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=19.32s)]
*  Set on fire in an attempt to burn them to death in a vile [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=22.88s)]
*  Anti-semitic terror attack. Have you checked in on your Jewish friends? I [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=27.84s)]
*  Like I can't imagine what it was like for them to go to synagogue this past weekend. I [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=32.2s)]
*  mean [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=38.24s)]
*  This keeps happening and it doesn't change the national conversation and it's not dominating news coverage the way a mass shooting [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  would the way a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=47.44s)]
*  Single attack by a white person on a single black person would it's just kind of like [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=49.84s)]
*  Anyway [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=56.4s)]
*  Zero calls in fact for a national conversation to take place in legacy media. They they don't see the pattern [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  And let's face it. There are sympathies for some weird reason are [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=63.84s)]
*  entirely with the Hamas defenders [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=68.84s)]
*  It's not even the top story right now on the New York Times website. What is there? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=72.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. Was there another terror attack someplace that I missed? I [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=76.16s)]
*  Maybe maybe I missed it. Was it was it the horrific? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=79.72s)]
*  Gang violence with these six illegals who killed a black woman is the New York Times leading wet [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=84.04s)]
*  No, they don't give a shit about that either because it's not white people who did it, but we'll get to it [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=91.0s)]
*  in fact [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  In response to what happened in Colorado [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  Where they were openly trying to rally support for the hostages that are still in the custody of Hamas [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=102.2s)]
*  And the perpetrator was out there yelling and Zionists [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  And death to these Jews were supposed to wait to call it terror [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=113.4s)]
*  Like he's out there free free Palestine and Zionists and threatening the children openly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=119.08000000000001s)]
*  But you know it it may have just been some sort of civil disobedience [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=123.84s)]
*  Maybe he didn't like his taxes. I don't remember him calling for that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=128.28s)]
*  I don't see anything about taxes or anything other than the evil Zionists in what he was saying [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=131.8s)]
*  So to me seems pretty clear and thank God to the Trump administration. It seems clear, too [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=137.72s)]
*  We've had absolute moral clarity from cash patel and damn bungeeno [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=143.36s)]
*  No matter how cowardly the locals seem to be and by the way jared polis [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=148.16s)]
*  Well, he didn't call it a terrorist attack called it an act of terror, which at least is closer [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=153.28s)]
*  Um, i'm not sure what's wrong with the local cops [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=159.04s)]
*  To top it all off the suspect in this case, of course cherry on top of the sundae is here illegally [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=162.16s)]
*  Of course he is and he came here wait for it [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=169.44s)]
*  During the biden administration now you're starting to sense why the media is not in love with the story. It's got everything [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  The attack happened yesterday around 3 30 pm in boulder [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Since november of 2023 this group of mostly elderly residents [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  They've been holding a weekly gathering to show solidarity with the israeli hostages and by the way american hostages, too [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=189.76000000000002s)]
*  Being held captive by hamas in gaza [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=197.28s)]
*  One witness telling msnbc the suspect might have been posing as a gardener doing yard work before he began his attack [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=200.96s)]
*  I saw him holding him and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=208.16000000000003s)]
*  And looking like he was about to throw it at people and they looked exactly like what I would think would be a molotov cocktail [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=209.84s)]
*  Uh, there's also a big pink [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=215.12s)]
*  Behind him with like a chemical sprayer and he has initially an orange vest on [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=217.60000000000002s)]
*  Um, so I had the same impression that somebody else had mentioned earlier that he was posing as someone who was like a gardener or something [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=223.12s)]
*  Uh, and he was lighting people on fire while spraying gasoline on them [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=229.76s)]
*  That's what it I mean gasoline is what it smelled like. I thought it was initially was alcohol [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=234.48s)]
*  um, but I I assume it was gasoline [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=238.32s)]
*  which again sting the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=241.52s)]
*  the pants, um off of some of the elderly women [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=243.84s)]
*  um, and the shirt of one of the women that I can't really [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=247.36s)]
*  Frankly, I can't imagine [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=250.16s)]
*  You can hear him overcome with emotion [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=254.16s)]
*  According to the mbc affiliate in denver eight people ages 52 to 88 [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=257.52s)]
*  Were injured at least one seriously in the attack [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=264.48s)]
*  88 [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=267.76s)]
*  88 by my calculation. That means the person was born in the what like 1936 around there [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=269.2s)]
*  Think about that think of what that person has lived through [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=275.6s)]
*  I mean, I told you that this this [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  At least one. I don't know how many 88 year olds there were but at least one of them [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=281.12s)]
*  Is a woman and a holocaust refugee who fled from europe to escape the nazis [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  Think of what that woman has seen in the course of her life and now [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=290.24s)]
*  at nearly 90 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=294.48s)]
*  She's burned [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=296.56s)]
*  in america [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=298.56s)]
*  By a jew hater [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=300.56s)]
*  And she's burned [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=302.56s)]
*  By an anti-zionist [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=305.52s)]
*  What [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=308.64s)]
*  What are we coming to how does that happen? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=310.24s)]
*  On the streets of boulder, of course one of our most liberal cities [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=312.88s)]
*  I mean the guy not for nothing is like [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=317.76s)]
*  Setting people on fire in front of a pride flag [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=320.0s)]
*  In this image here you see one of the victims [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=324.48s)]
*  Good samaritans are surrounding her trying to pour water on her. Oh [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=327.76s)]
*  Her body next to it [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=331.36s)]
*  Uh is what looks like an israeli flag in front of her you see a flyer with the face of a hostage and a u.s [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Flag lying on the ground. She was out there to remind people that there are hostages who are suffering [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=340.56s)]
*  And she was made to suffer herself the eyewitness also describing the injuries that the victims suffered [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=349.6s)]
*  This is hard to listen to but we must [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=355.12s)]
*  But we must [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=357.6s)]
*  In order to understand exactly what this man did a man probably if I had to guess was probably in his like 50s to 60s [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=359.68s)]
*  uh just kind of in shock and figuring out what he could do to make himself more comfortable, I mean his [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  leg from ankle or foot to all the way up to his buttocks was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=372.48s)]
*  Melted his skin was melted basically off or shaved off his leg. Um [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=378.0s)]
*  Sorry [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  I've talked about this a bunch in the last couple hours and i'm not getting it choked up as good as it is when I was there [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  um [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  I think so there were there's some deep cuts, uh in a bunch of these people's legs. Um, probably an inch [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=392.24s)]
*  Inch in diameter with you know blood coming out of them. There's uh, this other woman had burns all over her hand ankle seat [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=398.88s)]
*  Uh elbows, they look stunned confused [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=405.92s)]
*  This is just so wrong [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=411.68s)]
*  The suspect was caught on camera. The video was widely shared on social media [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=414.08s)]
*  You almost couldn't believe your eyes and watching it. It was I mean [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=418.32s)]
*  I sent it to my team like [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=421.52s)]
*  Is this it this is [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=423.68s)]
*  This happened this guy [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=425.68s)]
*  He's still out there [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=427.36s)]
*  Still threatening still holding what appear to be bottles that are about to become molotov cocktails [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  Which is basically like a bottle of alcohol or gasoline with some sort of a starter inside of it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=434.48s)]
*  Like a like a rag that will catch on fire and then they light it [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  Um, I mean honestly, we just saw this in the ditty case. There were testimony there was testimony about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=442.72s)]
*  how this [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=447.68s)]
*  rapper kid cuddy [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=449.12s)]
*  Uh his porsche was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=450.8s)]
*  Fire bombed by a molotov cocktail and the fire chief was on stand explaining exactly how it's done and how that one didn't go off [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=452.88s)]
*  To the extent it could have because they used a silk rag instead of you know [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=459.76s)]
*  Sort of your bargain basement rag and the silk I guess was less flammable, but it's disturbingly [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=463.92s)]
*  easy [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=469.76s)]
*  for anyone to make one [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=470.96s)]
*  And apparently this guy made many because when you're going to see him on this [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  This tape we're about to play for you. He's already unleashed the carnage. This is after he's hurt the people [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  And what you see here he [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=483.52s)]
*  He's threatening more he's got more bottles [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=485.52s)]
*  That he could potentially throw and people seem to be coming [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=488.64s)]
*  Maybe they're just new passersby seem to be coming to grips with the fact that this is a very dangerous man [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=490.96s)]
*  And he means business and he should not be approached. He cannot be subdued [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=496.08s)]
*  and get anywhere within [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=501.03999999999996s)]

*  So i've been in contact with our local fbi multiple times. So we are in contact with them here [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=653.2s)]
*  We are not calling it a terror attack at this point again. It's way too early to speculate motive [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=658.24s)]
*  Um, you know, I know there's a lot out there on social media [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=662.64s)]
*  But I ask people just to give us a little bit of patience while we work through a really complex scene [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=664.96s)]

*  It sounds maybe it is what we all think it is, but maybe it's not and he has no incentive [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=703.46s)]
*  To get it wrong. Uh, so we're going to take a step back [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=710.34s)]

*  But that was that's like nothing i'd ever seen before and until we know that the victims were members of that organ of the of the jewish [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=731.36s)]
*  Event we don't have the nexus and and I will believe the denver police chief that they do not have that nexus now [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=740.16s)]
*  And if they do I will be the first one out here saying that that is a hate crime, but until we do [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=747.44s)]

*  So it was very clear [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=945.02s)]
*  As you were saying that this was an act of terror as the fbi described it [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=947.26s)]
*  And i'm not sure where the rule came from that you need to trust the local authorities over the over the national authorities [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=952.46s)]
*  Um, I don't know where it's it's a very simple rule. I was paying attention [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=958.62s)]
*  Convenient though. Yeah, it kicks in when the victims are jewish and um, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=962.62s)]
*  No, I think that's the end of my list. That's when it kicks in [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=968.3s)]
*  I mean, um, but I will say [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=971.42s)]
*  the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=974.78s)]
*  Press last night was pretty quick to pick up on the guys out there chanting death to zionists [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=975.5s)]
*  and you know kill all the jews basically and um, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=982.38s)]
*  And the media in reports in the new york times in the wall street journal and else elsewhere is saying [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=986.7800000000001s)]
*  The motive has yet to be determined like uh, yeah, we we may never know why the guy did this [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=992.62s)]
*  We may never know same by the way a couple of weeks ago when that young couple [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=997.74s)]
*  Was gunned down outside of the jewish professionals event shouted free palestine and we got the same. Um, you know [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1001.6600000000001s)]
*  Police are still trying to discover. You know what the guy's motive was. It's total mystery [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1008.46s)]
*  And we got the same after they fire bombed the governor's mansion emily in, uh, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1014.8599999999999s)]
*  pennsylvania a jewish governor and once again the guy was shouting anti-semitic things and saying he was saying clearly [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1019.8s)]
*  He was fire bombing the governor's mansion because he was upset about josh apiro's stance on israel like the only when it comes to [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1027.58s)]
*  Israel and jews is the media really confused like we got a slow roll this [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1034.54s)]
*  Not sure what the motivation actually was it's plain as the nose on your face [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1040.5400000000002s)]
*  Why do we need months of investigation when the person is saying, please believe me i'm upset about these quote zionists [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1044.8600000000001s)]
*  It's happened in cases of radical islamists as well [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1053.26s)]
*  You suddenly get a pause from the media and there has to be a steep period of reflection before we know what happens [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1055.98s)]
*  And in this case, I mean the video circulated [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1061.3400000000001s)]
*  Immediately immediately and I checked the time stamp of that cnn video [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1065.3200000000002s)]

*  Uh, secondly, why is that guy not being? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1105.98s)]

*  That is not an exaggeration that it was literally one of the incidents that was cited by the fbi to justify its interference [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1349.82s)]
*  In these school board meetings, so it's only now that we see a guy [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1357.74s)]
*  Burning 88 year olds saying exactly why he did it that they're saying, you know a bit of caution [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1361.9599999999998s)]
*  Let's just let the locals take the lead [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1367.98s)]

*  And also they're not being the fbi is not being asked to [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1382.6200000000001s)]
*  Convict anybody of being a terrorist just to say that we are investigating [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1387.4s)]
*  Terrorism when you immediately have a video of somebody explicitly saying this is political [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1392.92s)]
*  There's absolutely nothing wrong with saying we are investigating terrorism. This looks like terrorism [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1397.9s)]
*  So to actually take issue with cash patel and dan bonjino [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1404.14s)]
*  for like [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1409.26s)]
*  Going and saying that they're investigating somebody's plainest day [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1410.86s)]
*  Like I came out there and said that do they have any indications that he was being forced to say that or that he said that [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1413.58s)]
*  For some reason other than that [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1418.22s)]
*  It's his sincerely held belief because he was shouting it shirtless in the streets of boulder [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1419.42s)]
*  While he was committing violence and it's just so stupid. It's such a silly silly thing to say on tv [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1424.3000000000002s)]
*  It's just like they'll the left-wing press will run. They'll use that word terror if it's a white on black crime [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1429.8200000000002s)]
*  They will they'll be quick to inflame all of the rhetoric around the crime the the crime [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1436.3000000000002s)]
*  And have absolutely no compunction about doing it [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1442.3000000000002s)]
*  But when we know it's staring us in the face that they won't say it they won't do it [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1444.3000000000002s)]
*  They won't call it a hate crime unless those are the stats right now [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1448.78s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why this isn't the lead on virtually every paper in the country [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1453.02s)]
*  This is a reading here from the new york post published this morning [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1457.74s)]

*  And they allegedly texted each other about the crime afterward the lancaster county sheriff's office down there located [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1487.84s)]
*  The victim larisha cheryl thompson 40 years old deceased with a gunshot wound behind the wheel of her vehicle [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1494.48s)]

*  And this is just the beginning [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1554.48s)]
*  Uh, the text messages have been cited in open court and cite a complete lack of remorse by the defendants said the attorney [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1556.8s)]
*  General charlie condon the evidence indicates a premeditated plan [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1563.52s)]
*  After the murder was accomplished there was no remorse whatsoever or any regret expressed by any of them for murdering [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1568.32s)]
*  this innocent lady [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1576.32s)]
*  So they killed her because I don't know if they wanted her car [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1578.8s)]
*  Or they wanted what was in her car and then they realized that the car was locked [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1583.04s)]
*  And seemed to be like oh shit [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1587.84s)]

*  They are accused of attempting to enter her vehicle and then fleeing the scene upon realizing it was locked [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1745.36s)]
*  That's why they were texting. Oh mission fail [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1752.8s)]
*  Okay, so a young woman is dead and bleeding out in front of us and what a fail [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1755.9199999999998s)]
*  We couldn't get her car after all because I guess this is how the illegals roll in honduras [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1760.8000000000002s)]
*  I wouldn't know it's not a country to which i'd like to visit [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1766.88s)]
*  But they're running around amongst us and now the ringleader we find out is um [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1770.72s)]
*  Was previously arrested just in 2023 for domestic violence [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1776.5600000000002s)]
*  Which is another theme we see emerging around these illegals who do not have the same standard of care when it comes to [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1781.2800000000002s)]
*  Human life [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1789.92s)]
*  As your average american does and yet [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1791.44s)]
*  We are spending every day arguing about what kind of a hearing we need to give them before we kick their asses out of here [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  Can I just point out one similarity [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1805.2s)]
*  Between this case and the solomon case [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1808.48s)]
*  Um, we don't know all the facts of that case yet [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1813.04s)]
*  But he's actually been charged with two counts of murder even though nobody [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1815.92s)]
*  Died in denver and those two counts are now a mystery. So we may learn [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1820.4s)]
*  Although we don't know that he too had a prior law enforcement [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1826.0s)]
*  Record and was let go. We just don't know [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1831.6s)]
*  But but that's what i'm seeing in reports [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1835.52s)]
*  That say they also the reports also don't know what that's about [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1839.04s)]
*  But [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1843.92s)]
*  megan, I think you're hitting on why illegal immigration and these deportations have been such a potent issue for the president because [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1844.8s)]
*  Americans read about cases like this and it's not [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1853.98s)]
*  in this case, it's not [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1858.64s)]
*  one assailant, but six who are here illegally and the feeling is just outrage and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1860.48s)]
*  when [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1868.0s)]
*  Immigrants come with the fact that well actually on average illegal immigrants commit less crime than the average citizen [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1869.26s)]
*  That just doesn't resonate as a counter argument because the feeling is [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1877.02s)]
*  that any single act committed [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1881.42s)]
*  Shouldn't have been because these people shouldn't have been in the country in the first place and it's why names like laken riley [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1884.62s)]
*  um become famous from coast to coast in this country and [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1890.46s)]
*  Why the why the issue of immigration? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1895.74s)]
*  Um has become such a potent one for donald trump from 2016 through you know, we're going on almost a decade [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1898.46s)]
*  Six months. It'll be a decade [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1907.66s)]
*  Because that's exactly right. So I I have got to I've got to play for you [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1910.14s)]
*  Chris cuomo who i'm sorry. He's trying to reinvent himself as like a more reasonable alternative to what he used to be [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1914.94s)]
*  He's the same. He's the same [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1920.5400000000002s)]
*  He's just trying to build an audience now with some occasional false moments of understanding the right wing [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1922.38s)]
*  but this guy [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1928.22s)]
*  I I stood out there for president trump and endorsed him the night before the election [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1929.98s)]
*  In pittsburgh, pennsylvania, and I said because trump was getting hit because he said he would be a protector of women [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1934.6200000000001s)]
*  And the chris cuomo's of the world his side of the aisle jumped all over trump saying he was being some somehow [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1941.18s)]
*  Sexist in in saying that and bringing up his past history with women when it comes to affairs and alleged [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1947.88s)]
*  inappropriate exchanges sexually [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1955.64s)]
*  And I stood up there and said what I believed which was that he really would be a protector of women and I mentioned [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1958.7800000000002s)]
*  Jocelyn nungari the little girl down in texas 12 years old who was sexually assaulted and murdered by illegals [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1965.0800000000002s)]
*  And I I mentioned laken riley and I I said among many other examples that these are reasons [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1971.9s)]
*  I believe president trump will protect young women. He won't allow the opening of the border and mass [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1977.3400000000001s)]
*  influx of dangerous illegals who will kill and rape [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1982.94s)]
*  The most vulnerable among us are girls our young promising nursing students who only want to give back to communities like laken [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1987.26s)]
*  and [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1995.3400000000001s)]
*  You know what chris cuomo did that night? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1996.14s)]
*  Not only did he not take the remarks which went live on all the cable channels when I spoke at the trump rally [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=1998.06s)]
*  He insisted news nation not take the remarks and then he mocked the remarks. He mocked them. He mocked me [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2003.18s)]
*  Oh, I need president trump to protect me as though it was something about me [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2009.74s)]
*  As opposed to a 12 year old little girl who is dead in texas [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2014.94s)]
*  Or a girl who was 22 years old in georgia [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2020.6200000000001s)]
*  Who was killed by an illegal who we already nabbed in new york and then released and then put on a federally [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2024.6200000000001s)]
*  Taxpayer-funded plane down to georgia where he could kill laken riley [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2031.0s)]
*  And so i'm sick of this guy's bullshit [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2036.14s)]
*  So chris cuomo goes on the air [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2039.18s)]
*  Thursday on his podcast which literally nobody's listening to other than my producers [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2041.98s)]
*  and says [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2047.5800000000002s)]
*  This about laken riley and illegal immigration [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2048.94s)]
*  Change how I feel about the parties. They are the problem. They are the root [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2052.62s)]
*  Of this binary battle to the bottom the division is almost exclusively [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2057.1800000000003s)]
*  Manufactured we are fighting over culture issues and controversies that are completely made up [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2063.0s)]
*  We divide this country over a single homicide [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2070.7s)]
*  Of somebody and it's absolutely wrong. What happened to laken riley is horrible. It's one too many any way you want to look at it [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2075.5s)]
*  But it is also an artificial [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2081.9799999999996s)]
*  Issue [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2085.9799999999996s)]
*  We have crime issues in this country [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2087.66s)]
*  Our homicide problem is not from illegal immigrants [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2091.02s)]
*  Okay [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2094.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but there shouldn't be any there shouldn't be any of a lot of things that we haven't made a top priority [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2095.42s)]
*  The division is manufactured [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2102.38s)]
*  Oh [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2107.02s)]
*  Go ahead emily [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2108.14s)]
*  But he can screw off because it's absolutely not fake if you look at the numbers of people who cross into this country [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2109.58s)]
*  with criminal backgrounds that are not just [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2115.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh people who have crossed the crime of crossing the country illegally and returning if you look at people with histories of violent crime [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2119.02s)]
*  Who have gotten into this country? There is plenty to sustain [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2125.1s)]
*  significant concern for that broader narrative that there are [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2129.96s)]
*  Significant numbers of criminals who have entered our border and if you talked about the way people who work in in law enforcement [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2133.58s)]
*  Um, this it's it's sort of obvious right that the open borders have been exploited [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2140.2200000000003s)]
*  Uh by people who wish to do terror people who wish to [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2145.26s)]
*  Uh do great harm to the american people so there's an argument right that there are times [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2149.58s)]
*  That bad actors in the media will take an anecdote and blow it up into a national story [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2154.8599999999997s)]
*  One example is when you pull people in the past when people have been pulled and said how many [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2160.62s)]
*  Unarmed black men are killed by police every year because of the media coverage people will wildly overestimate the actual number [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2165.8799999999997s)]
*  And so it's true that like media is very very powerful [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2173.5s)]
*  But this is by the way on average is under 12 according to the washington post running tally of it [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2177.18s)]
*  It's it's 11 12 maybe 15 at worst and they include unarmed people who are running down a police officer in a car [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2182.06s)]
*  People who have a gun in the glove compartment you're still considered unarmed by the washington post numbers [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2189.82s)]
*  But in any event, it's a minuscule number of unarmed black men that are being shot by cops keep going right [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2195.5800000000004s)]
*  And no, the argument he's making is that people are blowing up isolated anecdotes into broader narratives [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2201.5s)]
*  And in this case to say that these are isolated anecdotes. It's absolutely insane [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2206.7000000000003s)]
*  It's where you're actually you can get that number spiraling out of control because it falsely [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2210.14s)]
*  gives people a sense of security that they should not have whether it's terrorism or robbery [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2215.5s)]
*  And the thing that the thing that's driving me nuts about i'll stay with you on this. I'm like [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2221.7400000000002s)]
*  The thing that's driving me fucking nuts about this point is [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2225.9s)]
*  There is no policy [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2229.58s)]
*  That allows cops to shoot [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2231.9s)]
*  Unarmed black men, this is not something that's being encouraged or blessed in any city in america [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2235.02s)]
*  But there is a policy in multiple cities and states across america. It's called sanctuary [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2242.54s)]
*  to allow [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2249.5s)]
*  Illegals who commit additional crimes not to be turned over to the feds for deportation [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2251.0s)]
*  Once they're in the crosshairs and maybe that's what's happening. Eliana to this guy solomon [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2256.3s)]
*  Whatever his name is out in colorado [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2261.5s)]
*  Maybe that's why the two murders just popped up because maybe he was arrested for something else [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2263.18s)]
*  And they didn't turn him over to the feds because they found he was an illegal and didn't want to see him deported [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2267.58s)]
*  By the big bad evil trump administration [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2272.06s)]
*  But this is what happened to leek and riley what happened to jocelyn nangare. What's what happened out in colorado? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2274.3s)]
*  What happened to this poor woman here happened because of a policy? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2281.34s)]
*  That the that joe biden put in place and the democrats [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2285.5s)]
*  universally wanted emily [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2289.24s)]
*  Which is to open the borders irrespective of not knowing who the hell was coming in [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2291.74s)]
*  And defended repeatedly and I think it gets even worse when you consider that [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2298.54s)]
*  Democrats part of them were so some of them were just so cowardly and so reflexively anti trump [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2303.02s)]
*  That even policies that you looked like obama era, you know when he was called by the left the deporter in chief [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2309.82s)]
*  Even policies that looked like that they had to be reflexively aggressively against and to say not only were these you know [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2317.18s)]
*  By their phrases cruel, but they were also necessarily rooted in bigotry. That is the reason that joe biden came into office [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2323.5s)]
*  Thought he was reading the mood of the electorate because it had been artificially [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2330.54s)]
*  Um, I guess it had artificially been represented by the media, which was completely out to lunch [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2334.62s)]
*  Completely also in the same camp as many of those democrats were way too afraid to say anything that might make it look like they were [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2339.8199999999997s)]
*  agreeing with or [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2346.22s)]
*  Empowering enabling donald trump and it was that cowardice and stupidity and incompetence from the media and democrats [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2347.64s)]
*  Democrats suddenly signed on to the laken riley act after donald trump won the election. I mean it's just [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2355.5s)]
*  Gawling they they put they put themselves in the situation [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2360.92s)]
*  They put the american people in this situation because they were too afraid the media too [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2363.5s)]
*  By the way to repeatedly cover the story with the the level of importance that it deserved [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2367.2599999999998s)]
*  Here's eliana to your point that you just made. Um, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2372.7s)]
*  I was on [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2375.58s)]
*  bill mahr [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2376.7799999999997s)]
*  About three weeks before I did that thing with trump. I was on bill mahr and we had [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2377.98s)]
*  A debate about illegal immigration and he raised the point you just raised [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2382.46s)]
*  About you know, well, you'll see watch here. It is. Here's part of it [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2389.02s)]
*  Look, you you want to know why i'm going to vote for him notwithstanding what you said [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2392.94s)]
*  And i'll give you a couple good reasons off the top of my head number one [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2396.62s)]
*  What's happened with illegal immigration? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2400.62s)]
*  I'm voting for him because I don't want any more laken rileys [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2402.38s)]
*  I I don't want any more jocelyn nongarro's the 12 year old girl who was killed in houston [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2405.58s)]
*  By two venezuelan illegal immigrants who took her to a bridge and murdered her and threw her over over the bridge [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2410.46s)]
*  And americans have ever done that [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2416.7000000000003s)]
*  That's not the point. We have to take the americans. We don't have to take it from venezuelan illegals [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2418.78s)]
*  That's it [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2425.58s)]
*  100 [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2427.58s)]
*  Um, but can I just say I think you guys are being a little unfair to joe biden blaming this on him [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2430.22s)]
*  um, not sure he actually made the decision after reading the tapper thompson book and uh, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2435.18s)]
*  You know, so fair point maybe we should maybe maybe we should say ron clain [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2442.06s)]
*  Um, but or jill anyway [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2445.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly doctor. It might be it might be dr. Jill. We should really hold on the hook. Yeah [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2447.98s)]
*  Uh for these uh for these open door immigration policies, but you know what they bill maher or and chris cuomo [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2454.3s)]
*  and all of them like [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2461.9s)]
*  Keep on that argument guys [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2464.14s)]
*  Keep keep it up because it is a loser [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2466.38s)]
*  Uh, the american people aren't buying it and they're outraged by all of this stuff [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2470.86s)]
*  And by the way, I mean boulder is a sanctuary city. So we don't know the whole story of muhammad sullivan [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2476.3s)]
*  When he got there why he was there but um, they are reaping what they're sowing with this [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2482.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Right. Let me read you. Uh, eliana what just came in trump just senator truth social about boulder [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2489.44s)]
*  Yesterday's horrific attack in boulder, colorado will not be tolerated in the united states of america [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2495.98s)]
*  He came in through biden's ridiculous open border policy, which has hurt our country so badly [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2501.04s)]
*  He must go out under trump policy acts of terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2505.8399999999997s)]
*  This is yet another example of why we must keep our borders secure and deport illegal [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2512.0800000000004s)]
*  Anti-american radicals from our homeland. My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible tragedy and the great people of boulder colorado [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2517.26s)]
*  It's it's interesting. So trump is coming in and going out on the illegal immigration [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2526.4s)]
*  Aspect of this and that's obviously one of the main things trump has also been amazing [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2533.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm trying to crack down on anti-semitism where it exists on college campuses, which we haven't even talked to but I mean there hasn't been [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2538.32s)]
*  Joe biden did nothing. He did nothing to try to stop the harassment of jews on college campuses president trump who [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2546.1600000000003s)]
*  For some reason american jews still don't vote for him. They still vote democrat [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2554.6400000000003s)]
*  Even though he's done more than any sitting president for the jewish people [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2559.1200000000003s)]
*  But he's out there he's been battling on that front he's been battling the illegal immigration front [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2563.7599999999998s)]
*  And you tell me eliana what's going to happen now with these numbers because trump was winning on illegal immigration [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2568.7999999999997s)]
*  Both yes on november 4th, but for virtually every day thereafter up until very recently where the numbers started to wobble [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2573.6s)]
*  A little only a little but these kinds of cases are a stark reminder [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2580.72s)]
*  Of the stakes the stakes that this debate is about the open border policies. Yes [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2586.64s)]
*  But also the deportations [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2592.1600000000003s)]
*  Right and let me say dreaded words which are let me just make one point before before I get to that which is that [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2596.8s)]
*  There's a connection between what's happened on college campuses over the past, you know since october 7th, 2023 [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2602.6400000000003s)]
*  and these events in our cities which is that [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2609.76s)]
*  For a year and a half. We've seen lawlessness and chaos on our college campuses targeted at jewish students [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2613.2000000000003s)]
*  Including acts of violence the storming of buildings the breaking of windows [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2621.04s)]
*  Uh the breaking of laws [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2626.0s)]
*  without much consequence we've had [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2628.48s)]
*  police [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2631.2s)]
*  Presence on campuses required students arrested and then they're brought into court and they're let off [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2632.4s)]
*  virtually none of them have been [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2639.04s)]
*  sanctioned in any meaningful way [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2641.34s)]
*  and I think that sent a message to these [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2644.16s)]
*  Uh political activists in this case students, but also some adult outside activists that they can target [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2647.76s)]
*  jews and pro-israel activists and [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2655.92s)]
*  With impunity and that message has clearly been received by outsiders who are now taking those that sort of behavior [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2658.88s)]
*  and [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2666.6400000000003s)]
*  Targeting people in the case of the dc couple these people were just out of college 26 and 30 years old [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2667.52s)]
*  And now older people [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2674.32s)]
*  But we see a direct line of political violence from our college campuses [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2676.48s)]
*  more petty type violence, but extremely disruptive where graduation ceremonies [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2681.76s)]
*  and [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2687.52s)]
*  In columbia's case the end of the school year was cancelled [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2688.8s)]
*  to [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2692.96s)]
*  to violence in american cities targeting political figures and civilians [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2694.0s)]
*  And that's because the message has been sent that you will pay no consequences [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2699.52s)]
*  And so I think it's incumbent now on the federal government to send the message that [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2703.2s)]
*  They're going to enforce the laws and the perpetrators will pay consequences [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2709.2799999999997s)]
*  Mm-hmm the um [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2713.52s)]
*  The sanctuary city thing is huge [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2716.0s)]
*  Trump has been trying to press past it emily [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2718.96s)]
*  You know [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2721.8399999999997s)]
*  He'll send tom homon into any any city and tom homon has been saying you want to be a so-called sanctuary for illegals [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2722.08s)]
*  That's just it's going to make it harder for us, but it's not going to stop us [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2728.0s)]
*  You know [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2731.04s)]
*  It's going to make it more painful for your entire community when we get there because you're not going to cooperate could get ugly [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2731.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, you're not going to like what you what you're going to see while they went to marthas vineyard [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2736.64s)]
*  Martha's vineyard where ronda santis sent a busload of illegal immigrants immigrants and they said oh fine fine fine [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2740.7s)]
*  And they shipped them out of there and under what 48 hours [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2746.72s)]
*  It was like 30 hours something like that that they got rid of them [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2749.6s)]
*  And then you had these woke leftist women coming out saying we missed them [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2752.16s)]
*  We were going to go visit them at the detention facility to which they had them shipped [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2756.56s)]
*  Oh, i'm sure you're really sad. Well now they're doing the same song and dance as the residents [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2761.04s)]
*  They are are really sad [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2766.0s)]
*  They're super sad and angry that ice had the nerve to come into their community and arrest 40 illegals. Listen to this. It's not 25 [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2767.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it could be any of us next marthas vineyard resident jane catch held a sign yesterday at the vineyard haven terminal [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2774.8799999999997s)]
*  Warning visitors the island has a history of supporting [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2782.1600000000003s)]
*  People who are different [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2786.88s)]
*  Supporting immigrants everyone in this country is entitled to due process [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2788.88s)]
*  Whether they [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2794.8s)]
*  Have paperwork or they don't [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2796.1600000000003s)]
*  So they have a history of supporting the immigrants for like a good 24 25 hours [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2800.48s)]
*  Emily until they become kind of annoying and start marring the coastline and then they have to go [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2806.0s)]
*  The thing is meghan they didn't have room. They did they did not have enough room [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2812.2400000000002s)]
*  There's much more room in new york city here in washington dc, you know, much less crowded places than marthas vineyard [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2815.92s)]
*  Um, and you know it listen is she right about due process, of course [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2822.6400000000003s)]
*  But in these cases time after time we see there's so much due process involved [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2826.48s)]
*  Not all of them [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2831.44s)]
*  There are some cases where i've had an issue with the way that the trump administration has handled them [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2831.92s)]
*  But in many of these cases, um the migrants have been given an abundance [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2834.96s)]
*  Um of process over all of this and then in the case of like lake and raleigh, for example [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2840.26s)]
*  You have somebody who ends up reoffending and you have sanctuary cities sanctuary jurisdictions are the least humane places [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2844.58s)]
*  In the country when it comes to immigration enforcement because what you have is this desperate and tragic [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2851.54s)]
*  um sort of [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2858.34s)]
*  Subsection of society the shadow society where people get they're incredibly desperate [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2860.08s)]
*  They are afraid for example to report cases of domestic abuse, which is something we've seen come up in these high-profile cases [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2866.76s)]
*  Um, and they live in fear [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2873.96s)]
*  They live with uncertainty and precarity in some cases for years and years in some cases for decades [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2876.92s)]
*  Which if we're just sticking on this from the perspective of the migrant communities is completely inhumane [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2883.0s)]
*  Even though the most the people who say that they're the most humane in the world like I think her name was jane in that clip [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2888.36s)]
*  That's what they want to subject people to but secondly for the tax paying citizens that sustain the police forces the law enforcement [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2893.56s)]
*  That then has to deal with this that have to deal with the the tax paying citizens who have to deal with the housing increase [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2900.6s)]
*  Uh housing price increases, uh with all of the downstream with paying for the social safety net with paying for the money that goes to the [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2906.12s)]
*  Ngo's I mean it's inhumane across the board and we've been told for years to say that it's actually inhumane to oppose those policies [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2913.2999999999997s)]
*  It's insane it's insane and I think the lie has finally become apparent [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2921.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're exactly right. Um, I think we do have time for sat 26 [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2925.32s)]
*  Let's play it this is from 2022 Martha's Vineyard the difficult challenges are [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2930.76s)]
*  We have at some point in time they have to move [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2939.0800000000004s)]
*  Somewhere else, right? We we cannot we don't have the services to take care of 50 immigrants [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2942.28s)]
*  And we we certainly don't have housing we're in a housing crisis as we are on this island and [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2949.4s)]
*  We don't we can't house everyone here that lives here and works here. We don't have housing for 50 more people [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2955.56s)]
*  But they need to stay but just not not here but they they definitely need to stay that's the that's the bottom line memoly [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=2963.56s)]

*  Before we leave this topic. I just want to hit a couple of other things. Jamie. Diamond [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3050.84s)]
*  The head of jp morgan was out there [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3055.8s)]
*  Over the past couple of days. It was friday actually at the reagan library [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3059.1600000000003s)]
*  Talking like a republican listen here [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3063.0s)]
*  South 28 [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3068.1200000000003s)]
*  We have to acknowledge the grievances that put us in this position to start with [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3069.56s)]
*  And they're real. Okay immigration. What the hell are we doing? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3073.8s)]
*  You know, uh the 20 but the bottom 20 of our population, you know, their wages didn't go up for 20 years [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3077.08s)]
*  They're dying seven years younger [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3082.84s)]
*  You know when when administrations, you know [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3084.92s)]
*  The biden is giving all this money to evs and cars and wasting a lot of money on green stuff, which isn't going to work [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3087.48s)]
*  Uh, and all that do you think people in rural cities? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3093.96s)]
*  Do you think people in inner cities thought they were getting anything? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3096.92s)]
*  Do you think that those people think that are the american government is fair and competent and that this was in their best interest [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3100.8399999999997s)]
*  Their schools don't work. They're not getting the skills they need and you heard that [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3106.3599999999997s)]
*  Uh just now so we got to acknowledge you and I also call it blue tape [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3109.56s)]
*  Because you know republicans you generally don't like red tape you understand the devastation of it [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3114.44s)]
*  But you know most democrats, they love it [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3119.56s)]
*  They want more of it and they want to make it so confusing you can't even meet the rules so you get punished and fined afterwards [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3121.48s)]
*  Whoa eliana [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3129.4s)]
*  He sounds like um, who's that guy? Oh donald trump. That's who he sounds like [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3132.04s)]
*  Come in the water's warm jimmy, right? Uh, you know, it's not it's not the first time [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3137.7200000000003s)]
*  uh, though at the [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3143.56s)]
*  You recall you may have covered you probably covered it on your show megan when he talked about coming back to the office [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3146.52s)]
*  from covid [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3152.2000000000003s)]
*  Um and said yes seven days seven freaking days a week everybody needs to come back [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3153.48s)]
*  um, but frankly I have to say, um [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3159.48s)]
*  what he [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3163.0s)]
*  sounded like in that clip [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3164.6000000000004s)]
*  was [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3166.6000000000004s)]
*  simply speaking common sense [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3167.48s)]
*  and [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3169.96s)]
*  That's why I actually think trump's message resonated with so many people and the democrats message of [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3171.08s)]
*  I mean, they didn't really have a message on immigration at all [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3178.44s)]
*  Is why they lost the election and so many of their messages? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3183.24s)]
*  Simply were out of touch with regular people. Um, I wouldn't say that what jamie diamond just said was some [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3188.2s)]
*  You know particularly [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3195.08s)]
*  Republican message that we need to have a sensible immigration policy [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3196.9s)]
*  um and that [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3201.46s)]
*  He mentioned 20% [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3203.78s)]
*  Yeah elect he mentioned electric vehicles [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3205.38s)]
*  The biden administration used billions of dollars ported into evs and then built five charging stations. So nobody saw [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3208.5s)]
*  Anything come of that money, but I think look in their defense [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3218.02s)]
*  They tried to solve that on that by ruining tesla so you can't be so hard on them they they [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3222.9s)]
*  They came up with a solution to their own problem. They would just destroy [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3228.98s)]
*  Their least favorite ev company. Um, totally [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3232.98s)]
*  like people voted with their feet on on gas powered cars for now and seemed to be fairly happy with that and [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3236.58s)]
*  using the um [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3243.7000000000003s)]
*  Using the federal government to try and try and push them in a different direction [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3245.86s)]
*  Fecklessly because they spent the money on nothing, um with the green new deal [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3250.1s)]
*  Wasn't particularly effective. So he's talking like basically a common sense business guy and that's actually the reason [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3255.8599999999997s)]
*  Republicans want um is what he said was sensible. He's also keeping his dei and est programs at jp morgan [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3265.2799999999997s)]
*  uh quietly in the background which is also fairly amusing because I don't think he understands exactly how the uh, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3272.18s)]
*  The trickle-down effect of that goes to making some of these problems a lot worse, right? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3278.82s)]
*  His bank has been part of the problem. There is no question [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3284.1s)]
*  I know plenty of people at all these big banks and they talk to me [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3287.46s)]
*  They won't say it in front of a microphone [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3290.5s)]
*  But they all talk to me and tell me exactly what's happening and jp morgan is part of the problem when it comes to dei [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3292.42s)]
*  And breaking the law [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3298.5s)]
*  Breaking the law it's illegal to hire or fire somebody based on the color of their skin [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3300.5s)]
*  It can't be a factor it can't be the factor and if you think your company is doing that [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3306.26s)]
*  You should report them because it's illegal. You should sue them here is [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3312.34s)]
*  Why that this all the issues we've been discussing [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3318.02s)]
*  And some outlined by jamie diamond there. Um, I think this latest poll by cnn, which we highlighted on am update today [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3321.38s)]
*  Shows the following [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3329.38s)]
*  among all americans [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3331.38s)]
*  The party that has strong leaders only 16 percent of americans say the democrats have strong leaders [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3334.1s)]
*  16 [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3341.84s)]
*  40 percent of americans say the gop has strong leaders [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3343.54s)]
*  The party that gets things done [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3348.1s)]
*  Only 19 percent say it's the democrats [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3350.26s)]
*  Double that say it's the gop [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3353.38s)]
*  Among democrats only just polling democrats now how many of you would describe your own party as having strong leaders? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3356.1s)]
*  32 percent to republicans how many of you would describe your party as having a strong leader 82 percent [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3362.98s)]
*  think of that 82 percent there is a [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3371.14s)]
*  50 [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3374.7200000000003s)]
*  percentage point difference between the two parties on strong leaders. That means the democrats have no one they have no one [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3375.86s)]
*  um [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3383.38s)]
*  party that gets things done [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3384.34s)]
*  Let's see [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3386.5s)]
*  Among democrats at saying does your party get things done if only 41 said yes, my party gets things done republicans [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3387.78s)]
*  Almost 80 77 percent say our party gets shit done. We're we're good [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3394.5800000000004s)]
*  And independents seem unhappy with everybody [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3399.7000000000003s)]
*  Not surprisingly. So [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3402.5s)]
*  This is this doesn't spell good news for team blue emily and no one is surprised to see this because [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3404.42s)]
*  They've been in complete disarray and just keep recirculating clips of jasmine crocket [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3410.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3415.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that should do it [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3416.5800000000004s)]
*  Well, the one thing that joe biden and donald trump and the biden allies and the trump allies agree on is actually that [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3417.86s)]
*  Joe biden was able to do a lot in a short span of time. He had uh some [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3424.6600000000003s)]
*  He had some signature legislative accomplishments that makes this even more of a disaster for democrats when you think about the fact [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3429.3s)]
*  That they just passed several massive pieces of legislation which I would argue contributed significantly to inflation [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3436.82s)]
*  Uh, but nevertheless, they are still very proud of that record. So they passed these big bills [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3443.62s)]
*  This is massive spending an industrial policy basically [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3448.66s)]
*  And yet everyone's looking around and saying they the republicans are the ones that get things done. I mean that is an incredible [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3452.98s)]
*  Disaster for democrats because even if I disagree with them, they definitely did shit during the biden administration [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3461.2s)]
*  Just a whole lot of it was fairly destructive [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3467.62s)]
*  So, yeah, I can't like I mean I don't understand how you [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3470.26s)]
*  How you come out of those four years with these numbers? That's horrible to the point. Eliana was making leader, you know [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3473.94s)]
*  I maybe they're being too hard on joe biden because you know [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3479.2200000000003s)]
*  Like i'm not sure he he his auto pen seemed to have been very strong [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3484.02s)]
*  His wife seems extremely strong very unlikable but very strong [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3488.26s)]
*  And I would say joe biden himself would take issue with him not being counted as a strong leader. He was asked [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3493.3s)]
*  Some questions at a memorial day event in delaware [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3500.1800000000003s)]
*  first, uh, there was someone who asked a question of him that he didn't [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3504.1800000000003s)]
*  Like but the woman he's about to respond to [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3509.5400000000004s)]
*  Is not the reporter who asked the question he didn't like and yet he decided to berate berate some female reporter [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3512.7400000000002s)]
*  on friday watch [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3520.7400000000002s)]
*  I feel like everybody expects [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3522.7400000000002s)]
*  I've done it all because i'm loyal. I do it every damn year [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3524.7400000000002s)]
*  The very beginning i've never forget when I came from that's why [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3528.82s)]
*  I don't was he gonna kiss her or was he yelling at her for the listening audience? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3534.7400000000002s)]
*  He kind of bends down to get to the level of this female and like [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3538.5s)]
*  leans over right to her like the where i am with the microphone like right to her to make his point [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3542.5s)]

*  born to dilly dally [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3829.42s)]
*  forced to fight fascists [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3831.42s)]
*  You had me at dilly the election was coming to an end and the stories that we cover became so real [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3837.1s)]

*  I feel now like we're doing the actual work and I feel a little less scared [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3848.3s)]
*  It's just kind of a reminder that like we've been talking about and worrying about [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3854.2200000000003s)]
*  the edge of the cliff [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3859.82s)]
*  for so long [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3861.9s)]
*  And so now we have experienced what the edge of the cliff is like [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3863.7400000000002s)]
*  And what it's like to be in midair and we are now in the canyon on the other side of the cliff [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3867.9s)]
*  And we are seeing what life is like there [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3873.82s)]
*  In the middle of a fascist takeover what happens is there's a fascist takeover and you have to keep still doing the work [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3875.98s)]
*  Then you are a person who's fighting an existing [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3881.6600000000003s)]
*  fascist authoritarian government and not just warning about it [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3885.0s)]
*  Got it born born to dilly dally but forced to fight fascists [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3892.06s)]
*  That's what they're up to [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3899.42s)]
*  It's too painful [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3901.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3903.18s)]
*  That's probably the best guess she she may get [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3904.22s)]
*  I mean rachel is the highest rated anchor on that network and I have a feeling it's downhill from here [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3907.98s)]
*  But they sound they seem to be in pretty good spirits for fighting a fascist takeover [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3913.66s)]
*  Maybe maybe she could get steve schmidt and they can since the show is called the best people [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3919.4199999999996s)]
*  They can talk about how they orchestrated a misogynistic take down of sarah palin behind the scenes of the mccain campaign since there [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3923.8999999999996s)]
*  This is a show about good people virtuous people. I think that would be a good point [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3932.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I like that or like the best people maybe she'll book doug emhoff, you know her her colleague at msnbc [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3936.54s)]
*  Interviewed and didn't see fit to raise the allegation made by a woman who had dated him from for a long time that he [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3943.4s)]
*  beat her [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3950.78s)]
*  Um, you know, he denied it but would have been something some might have considered newsworthy [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3951.9s)]
*  Is he is he one of the best people? I don't know. Um, maybe kilmar [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3955.98s)]
*  We talked to them too [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3960.62s)]
*  I want to know how to get paid like I want to get paid like rachel maddow for fighting a fascist takeover one night a week [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3961.82s)]
*  It's good times appearance [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3968.38s)]
*  And then you can go out you can rip your network to shreds. Yeah, talking about how that gig [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3970.78s)]
*  Terrible they are when they cancel racist people like joy reed [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3975.9s)]
*  You can just lament how bad your network is while you're cashing their checks not actually doing anything to it [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3980.38s)]
*  By the way note to you guys [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3986.1400000000003s)]
*  MSNBC's new prime time lineup because rachel, you know, she she couldn't do that five day a week thing [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3988.7799999999997s)]
*  She couldn't fight the fascism five days a week. It's a one day a week kind of job [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3993.74s)]
*  You know, it's just like it's so exhausting just that one hour took so much out of her. So she she couldn't i'm sorry [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=3997.5s)]
*  She just couldn't you know, it's just like just like the guys at normandy [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4003.1s)]
*  Some of them couldn't keep going past the like the actual beachhead. They couldn't go up the hill. That's her [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4006.06s)]
*  um [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4011.5s)]
*  so now the lineup has been adjusted and [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4012.62s)]
*  Jen sake is in there [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4017.6600000000003s)]

*  Slashies when you read the ratings when you're under 50 000, they don't even give you the number [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4072.92s)]
*  On the the nielsen numbers. You just see slashies which you know means [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4078.3s)]
*  You're a loser if you could turn those two little lines in different directions and come up with [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4082.78s)]
*  loser [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4088.1400000000003s)]

*  2007 [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4108.679999999999s)]
*  We were getting about 1.3 million in the overall and about 300 plus thousand in the key demo. This is back [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4110.54s)]

*  Is not even breaking a million in total viewers at 9 p.m [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4134.3s)]
*  I was at 9 p.m [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4141.34s)]
*  Trust me. It's it's a great place to go for ratings. She can't even break a million [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4143.0199999999995s)]
*  That's unbelievable [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4149.42s)]
*  973 000 total viewers she's averaging since launch [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4150.92s)]
*  Which is almost which is 46 percent less than the average [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4154.94s)]
*  That the people had been watching to see mad out. So mad out does she's beloved by those leftists and [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4161.0199999999995s)]

*  20 from that absolute moron alex waggoner who as far as I can tell was literally only put there because she has a pleasant face [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4172.04s)]
*  Um [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4179.740000000001s)]
*  20 down from alex waggoner's average during the same period in 2024 [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4180.700000000001s)]
*  Uh cnn prime time for what it's worth moving to networks now cnn prime time dropped 18 percent in total viewers 21 percent in the total demo [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4185.740000000001s)]

*  the cnn prime time average [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4194.780000000001s)]
*  Prime time average. Okay. Now when I was there we were like four million five million. Whatever definitely three million [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4197.740000000001s)]
*  um [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4204.780000000001s)]
*  They're they're pulling those numbers now under trump [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4205.740000000001s)]
*  CNN's prime time average [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4208.7s)]
*  426 000 viewers [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4211.719999999999s)]

*  that's [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4215.82s)]
*  Terrible people are definitely going to get fired [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4217.32s)]
*  They're going to get salary slashed. You cannot continue to exist with these numbers elliana thoughts on whether it should [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4220.219999999999s)]
*  Well, it's interesting [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4228.46s)]
*  You know I was at fox for a few years starting in 2008 and I remember the talk [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4229.66s)]
*  This that was the beginning of the obama administration being that it's really great to be in the opposition [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4233.98s)]
*  now fast forward to 2024 fox's ratings are up anyway, though, they're not in the opposition and [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4240.139999999999s)]
*  What should be a boon for msnbc and cnn being the opposition and cnn, of course experience this in 2016 [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4248.379999999999s)]
*  um, their ratings are in the toilet [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4256.62s)]
*  And jen socky, by the way was their big recruit out of the biden white house [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4259.42s)]
*  She was supposed to be the prime time star and they got rid of alex waggoner and [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4263.82s)]
*  It does look like their programming experiment has been a complete and utter failure [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4269.0199999999995s)]
*  um in in this regard [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4275.099999999999s)]
*  And I think it's a combination of the cable news business collapsing because people just aren't watching [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4277.099999999999s)]
*  Tele, you know cable news anymore and just bad on interesting programming [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4283.74s)]
*  Um, and it's hard to get beyond that [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4289.179999999999s)]
*  Let me tell you let me stay on cnn for one second emily because cnn [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4291.82s)]
*  Jake tapper's been on this book tour. He's everywhere. I mean he's he's gotten on every left wing [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4295.82s)]
*  Uh show that there is to get on because they're all interested in whitewashing their own complicity by pretending [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4300.38s)]
*  I learned about it in this jake tapper book [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4306.0599999999995s)]
*  Ever since I learned about in the book [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4308.7s)]
*  I was totally on the bentham the biden mental acuity story because I was shocked shocked to read about it [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4309.98s)]
*  And then I realized I needed a report on it. Oh, that's them. Okay, um tapper's show [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4315.66s)]
*  Has been getting a ton of publicity [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4321.74s)]
*  And it has hit its lowest ratings [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4323.9s)]
*  in 10 years [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4327.66s)]
*  Its lowest rating since 2015 reports fox's brian flood despite all the buzz around his book and his intense publicity tour [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4329.74s)]
*  His lowest rated month in a decade in may [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4338.62s)]
*  He averaged [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4342.7s)]
*  125,000 total viewers, which is I guess slightly above average for cnn [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4344.660000000001s)]
*  and um [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4351.08s)]
*  He shed 25 of his audience from the same period last year [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4352.76s)]
*  fox news, uh in their [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4358.200000000001s)]
*  Their same period in this time slot is getting 3.3 million [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4360.92s)]
*  And he's getting 500,000 [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4365.160000000001s)]
*  MSNBC was getting 1 million and in the key demo he's averaging [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4367.700000000001s)]
*  Under 100,000 again only 95,000 [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4373.16s)]
*  Which tells me [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4377.88s)]
*  No one's buying this he's not getting some surge of like this reporter's [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4379.96s)]
*  In on things he's in the no, you know with all due respect to jake like people are not buying it [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4384.36s)]
*  That's exactly right no and I think that's really important point actually these are [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4390.679999999999s)]
*  Beyond embarrassing numbers. These are like stop showing up at cocktail party, uh in georgetown [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4394.759999999999s)]
*  Numbers, yes, they're actually but nobody will right because the only people that are still on that circuit are the people who have no [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4399.8s)]
*  Humility and I think that's actually why? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4405.8s)]
*  Um tapper in order to sell this book has come out with this total foe [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4408.280000000001s)]
*  Humility, uh, and you know he's like using that word [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4413.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because it's I think uh, uh glenn greenwald said this on tucker show [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4417.56s)]
*  Uh, he was like it's it's clearly coming from the crisis pr firm that just planted it in his brain [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4421.72s)]
*  To use the word humility and the reason is [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4427.0s)]
*  That is why cnn and msnbc are currently getting their butts kicked by like progressive youtubers and progressive [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4429.96s)]
*  Ex-users, whatever it is that are just bringing in podcasters that are bringing in [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4436.92s)]
*  Uh still behind the right on some of this stuff, but bringing in more and more viewers [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4441.080000000001s)]
*  It's because they so many people realize that actually rachel matto's coverage of trump 1.0 [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4444.92s)]
*  And the lawfare was bad like it has aged really really poorly msnbc cnn [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4450.52s)]
*  Their coverage of covet has aged really really poorly and it's just these sort of hardened inner [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4455.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh cultural progressive circle. It's just those people left [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4461.8s)]
*  Uh, the people who are still like masking up who are watching cnn and msnbc and thinking like this is yes [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4465.08s)]
*  Oh, it's so wonderful when rachel matto and nicole wallace, uh, you know talk about [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4471.48s)]
*  Fighting fascism, whatever it is [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4476.92s)]
*  Uh people realize that even these networks that they were suddenly subscribing to and watching nightly [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4479.08s)]
*  Like a stephen colbert over and over again during trump 1.0. The coverage was bad [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4484.92s)]
*  Uh, and so they have no humility about it and now they're realizing end of biden another good example [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4489.08s)]
*  And now they're they're realizing it and they're trying to pretend that they have some authenticity and humility [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4494.4400000000005s)]
*  But they actually have none and that's really unappealing to viewers who like, you know left or right? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4499.08s)]
*  You just want to feel like you're getting decent information. You don't feel like you're being lied to so people feel like that with these guys [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4504.6s)]
*  You don't feel like you're being made dumber as a result of watching the show [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4510.76s)]
*  I would submit to you eliana that the reason msnbc is struggling so mightily [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4514.2s)]
*  is [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4519.4s)]
*  Many many instances just like this watch [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4521.0s)]
*  He might misplace the word here and there but you talk to him for hours at a time [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4525.0s)]
*  Is he slower? Does it move slower? Yeah, he's moved slower [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4530.28s)]
*  Uh, so you stiffer. Yeah, he moves stiffer. He's had trouble walking sometimes. Yeah, so did fdr. I've said it [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4533.4800000000005s)]
*  For years now. He's cogent [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4541.0s)]
*  But I undersold him when I said he's cogent [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4543.64s)]
*  He's far beyond cogent [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4546.76s)]
*  In fact, I think he's better than he's ever been [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4549.08s)]
*  Start your tape right now because i'm about to tell you the truth. Okay, and fu we did if you can't handle the truth [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4552.44s)]
*  This version of biden [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4560.2s)]
*  Intellectually analytically is the best biden ever [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4564.5s)]
*  Not a close second not knowing for years we got it we got it that's enough [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4569.08s)]
*  That's the reason eliana those examples emily just gave and that like you don't survive that you just you just don't [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4573.879999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know megan. I think you're assuming that [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4583.639999999999s)]
*  Um that these people are capable of embarrassment and that their audiences expect honesty. Well, then why are their numbers down? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4588.679999999999s)]
*  Even pete buddha just saying they got covid wrong [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4596.68s)]
*  New york time. Oh, well everyone's saying they got everything wrong, but I don't actually I think there's not a lot of good news for democrats [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4599.64s)]
*  No, but so I disagree. I disagree. I I have been in the so-called opposition [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4608.84s)]
*  Many years on fox. I was there for all of obama [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4614.12s)]
*  I was a news anchor at fox news for the entirety of barack obama's germ [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4617.4800000000005s)]
*  Those were some lean years [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4623.72s)]
*  Editorially, he was beloved [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4626.34s)]
*  By much of the country. He had very high approval ratings republicans didn't absolutely love him [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4629.8s)]
*  And he did very controversial things that drew eyeballs at times like obamacare [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4634.52s)]
*  but [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4639.72s)]
*  He was kind of boring a lot of the time and yet fox news continued to stay number one because there's always something to talk about [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4640.68s)]
*  If they trust you and you know how to do good television and msnbc has neither of those two things going for it go ahead [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4647.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think there's a lot to that um at the same time I just I don't see any kind of course correction [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4658.5199999999995s)]
*  Coming here. I mean this goes back to um [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4665.639999999999s)]
*  Look scarborough is like the only thing that network has going for it [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4669.32s)]
*  Uh, where where do they turn now? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4673.4s)]
*  and [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4675.5599999999995s)]
*  and uh [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4678.28s)]
*  They've been wrong. This is not just msnbc [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4680.04s)]
*  This is the new york times the mainstream media writ large and it's why alternative outlets are thriving [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4683.08s)]
*  They've been wrong on covid. They were wrong on the big rushegate story [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4688.84s)]
*  And they didn't cover at all biden's decline [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4693.32s)]
*  and so [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4698.04s)]
*  They were wrong on the three biggest stories of the past five years [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4699.639999999999s)]
*  six years [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4705.4s)]
*  Um, and it is pretty hard to survive when you're supposed to be in the business of giving people news [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4706.68s)]
*  Yeah, like facts actual facts. Um, they were also wrong intentionally responses people are the people who most got things wrong [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4713.0s)]
*  Are promoted [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4721.64s)]
*  There's no penalty [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4723.0s)]
*  Within these organizations. You get 30 million dollars a year for lying to her audience [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4724.4400000000005s)]
*  They were also wrong about elon musk doing a nazi salute [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4728.200000000001s)]
*  All of them in the left-wing press went with that ms [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4734.28s)]
*  Like all of them every single print publication we pulled it and that got so much attention when he made that gesture at the trump rally [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4738.28s)]
*  Um, which was his hand on his heart and then motioning outward and they all said nazi salute nazi salute [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4746.28s)]
*  And then what happened? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4752.599999999999s)]
*  On saturday was this corrie booker [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4755.48s)]
*  beloved senator from new jersey went to the dem convention there [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4758.84s)]
*  And gave his own nazi salute [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4763.08s)]
*  Look at this. It's exactly what elon musk did. He puts his hand on his heart [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4765.24s)]
*  And gestures out to the crowd and no sane person thinks that corrie booker actually did a nazi salute [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4771.48s)]
*  We recognize it wasn't a nazi salute and neither was elon musk's neither one did a nazi salute [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4778.599999999999s)]
*  but one [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4786.04s)]
*  Suffered non-stop coverage in the press about their nazi salute and one did not i'll give you guys a guess [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4787.72s)]
*  Which one didn't get any of that nonsense rained down upon him trying to find this in my thing. Okay, here it is [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4795.88s)]
*  Now [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4804.04s)]
*  We checked [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4804.92s)]
*  as of noon yesterday [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4806.200000000001s)]
*  There was no coverage of corrie booker's quote nazi salute in the new york times in cnn [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4809.08s)]

*  MAGA melts down over corrie booker's quote nazi salute. That's the daily beast and newsweek [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4825.24s)]
*  MAGA accuses democratic senator corrie booker of doing nazi salute [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4833.08s)]
*  But let me just give you a contrast those same publications i'm going to run through after musk did [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4838.52s)]
*  Literally the exact same gesture [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4843.320000000001s)]
*  New york times [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4849.0s)]
*  It looked a lot like the salute used in nazi germany and fascist italy cnn [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4850.280000000001s)]
*  Uh, let's see aaron bernett our viewers are smart. They can take a look at that [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4855.96s)]
*  But it certainly was uh, it's not something you typically see in an american political rally [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4860.4400000000005s)]
*  Let's put it that way washington post mux musk sparked controversy with a hand gesture resembling a nazi salute msnbc musk condemn [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4865.0s)]
*  For gesturing for a gesture resembling a nazi salute mpr to many observers musk's arm movement appeared to be a nazi salute [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4872.68s)]
*  USA today elon musk's odd-looking salute sure looked like a sig-heil to me reuters [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4878.68s)]
*  Uh musk's hand gesture while he spoke during a celebration of trump drew online comparisons to a nazi salute axios [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4884.4400000000005s)]
*  musk and tesca tesla remain untouchable after nazi salute accusations associated press musk's straight arm gesture embraced by [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4891.56s)]
*  Right-wing extremists regardless of what he meant [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4899.08s)]
*  Um, by the way ap's most recent article on cori booker [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4903.24s)]
*  It's all about how he expanded upon his historic senator senate floor speech for his new book stand nothing nothing about the salute [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4906.36s)]
*  Stand in salute they forgot that part newsweek as I told you about daily beef democrats. No tweets about cori booker from aoc [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4913.56s)]
*  who [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4921.24s)]
*  Immediately attacked elon musk back in january. Um [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4922.4400000000005s)]
*  Which I think we have right we have her [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4926.76s)]
*  Let's listen to what aoc said about the exact same gesture from elon [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4930.92s)]
*  I don't care what elon musk is doing behind a presidential seal in this country. We hate nazis [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4936.36s)]
*  Kind of like a foundational defining thing that we beat the confederates and we beat the nazis [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4946.12s)]
*  and [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4952.68s)]
*  I don't know what side [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4953.72s)]
*  People may be on today [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4955.64s)]
*  But I still am not rocking [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4957.4800000000005s)]
*  with anyone sympathetic to nazis and I will do that until I am six feet in the ground [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4961.400000000001s)]
*  like kind of foundational to me as a human being and so [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4969.400000000001s)]
*  If you're cool and want to defend [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4975.320000000001s)]
*  the sig hails and the nazi salutes [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4978.68s)]
*  All the all the you know, whatever you want to do that's on you i'm on the opposite side of that [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4981.88s)]
*  I'm not with the nazis. How about that? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4988.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, okay me neither let's do this aoc I got a live one for you [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4993.32s)]
*  His name is cori booker and he is ready to take it like a man. Oh, oh wait. Oh wait [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=4998.04s)]
*  I'm sorry aoc has done it too [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5004.12s)]
*  Here she is [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5006.12s)]
*  It's kind of a conflict of interest ladies, I don't know who would like to take this one [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5008.28s)]
*  Well, can I just say I wish these people brought the same passion and the same ferocity [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5012.84s)]
*  to bear on [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5019.8s)]
*  The lunatic in denver who's actually fire bombing [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5022.04s)]
*  Yeah, jews trying to hold a vigil for [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5026.04s)]
*  hostages and the lunatic who gone down [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5029.5599999999995s)]
*  All right, two young people outside a pro israel event [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5033.8s)]
*  But there you know, they know exactly what was going through elon's head when he held his arm up right with these other people [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5037.88s)]
*  They they can't figure out the motive like we can't get ahead of that. So I wish I wish they could figure it out [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5044.04s)]
*  but the other people [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5050.04s)]
*  I mean, it's a very good point. Oh, they're all doing nazi salutes. We will show the video. We've got elizabeth warren [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5051.96s)]
*  We've got kamala harris. We've got um, like I said aoc and others [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5057.24s)]
*  So I I guess [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5061.32s)]
*  I'm not sure how it works like they [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5063.24s)]
*  Elon's a nazi but kamala is not a nazi and korey's not a nazi [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5066.36s)]
*  um, i'm sure you and I are nazis like I i'm not sure where the logic is here emily, but um, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5072.04s)]
*  Can you believe? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5079.32s)]
*  Not one of these news agencies has tried to pull this trick with korey booker not to mention liz warren aoc, etc [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5080.68s)]
*  The thing that's interesting about the booker video and it's just so it sounds so silly to even be talking in granular detail about these videos [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5089.0s)]
*  But they were like that one is basically apples to apples with the musk salute [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5094.679999999999s)]
*  And at the time I disagreed with some of my friends on this [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5099.4s)]
*  I mean for me it was just like the volume of coverage was i'm glad we just like look back on some of it because [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5102.12s)]
*  It was such a frenzied news cycle [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5108.12s)]
*  uh predicated on this idea that elon musk had just [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5110.92s)]
*  Definitively shown his true colors as a nazi on stage and now the fascism was naked [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5113.5599999999995s)]
*  And open and the bigotry was just in full public view [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5119.959999999999s)]
*  How could you possibly think anything other than that elon musk was paying homage to the nazis and [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5123.799999999999s)]
*  The volume of the coverage I just thought was completely ridiculous like again [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5130.5199999999995s)]
*  I had people friends who disagreed with me on whether or not it was a nazi salute [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5134.36s)]
*  I thought it was like obviously him just being weird and I took a lot of flak for it at the time [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5137.5599999999995s)]
*  But you can look at so many different people doing these gestures over time [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5143.48s)]
*  And even if you think that maybe elon musk was like just take that argument say maybe he was giving some secret sign [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5147.4s)]
*  to uh white supremacists and neo nazis [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5154.36s)]
*  Really you think that on stage elon musk was actually like giving like it doesn't make sense [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5158.5199999999995s)]
*  Like the argument just never made sense to justify like the thing about pete hickseth allegedly drinking scotch while giving one of his his first speech [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5164.28s)]
*  You know after he said he wouldn't let alcohol touches, but you know right here in front of everybody bottoms up keep going right? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5171.4s)]
*  Right. No, no, I just think that's a good like look at this. I don't look at this [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5177.719999999999s)]
*  Somebody on twitter put this together look at them side by side. That is [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5180.84s)]
*  Apples to apples like it's you know [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5183.96s)]
*  Again, even if you think that elon musk is a neo nazi the idea that he's going out on stage and openly doing a sig [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5186.36s)]
*  Hile with the president of the united states who has jewish grandchildren [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5194.36s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense to me to me [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5198.7s)]
*  So like this massive explosion of coverage where we had a frenzied multi-day news cycle over elon musk openly [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5201.179999999999s)]
*  Um paying homage to the nazis. It was just so it was such a waste of time [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5207.66s)]
*  And they the media research center did one of those uh analyses [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5212.78s)]
*  Eliana about what kind of coverage elon got and what kind of coverage pete got [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5216.7s)]
*  And it was both universally negative [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5221.74s)]
*  I think it was it was actually 100 negative in the case of pete and maybe 99 and elon [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5223.74s)]
*  My team will correct me, but they were both above 97. I mean it was insanely negative for both [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5229.66s)]
*  That's why elon has to be a nazi but corrie booker has written a new book called stand. Wow [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5235.98s)]
*  It's it's parlaying off of his historic filibuster where he never stood and stood up for the rest of us [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5241.42s)]
*  Um [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5249.66s)]
*  Yeah, historic I you think 10 years from now or five years from now two years from now six months from now [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5251.26s)]
*  We're all going to remember we're all going to remember the big history making history making speech [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5256.78s)]
*  That he that he then used to fundraise off of and write a book off of and I can't wait to know what [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5264.0599999999995s)]
*  Um how much this publisher gave him an advance for to write the book? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5270.86s)]
*  Um was it was all for history? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5275.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. He's historic and that's all you need to know and by the way elon must be destroyed [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5278.7s)]
*  Kia tesla bomb a tesla, but don't buy a tesla. That's the left today [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5284.54s)]
*  But if they just study the syntax of young men, they could find a way back. This is really [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5289.099999999999s)]
*  Actually the conversation that they're having right now on the left more with the ej's straight ahead. Don't go away [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5295.8s)]
*  You know how much my family and I love our dogs. Yes, even my sweet strudwick [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5302.62s)]
*  I cannot imagine life without them. They've got a great life, but some dogs are not so lucky [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5307.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's why i'm super glad to tell you about delta rescue the largest no-kill care for life animal sanctuary in the world [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5312.22s)]

*  An example of how bad the writing is on that show like the writing on some of these shows [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5450.22s)]
*  It's like they put it into like progressive chat gpt [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5456.3s)]
*  And come up with just like the worst [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5461.42s)]
*  The worst dialogue. It's so bad [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5464.46s)]

*  Not disclosing when you're in bed with somebody that you have herpes. It's important to disclose [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5484.9400000000005s)]
*  Before you have inter sexual interludes that you have the herpes virus [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5491.18s)]
*  I'm sorry exhibit a here is rosie o'donnell [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5496.38s)]
*  Bitching and moaning about her favorite person donald trump. I think this is before she moved [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5500.06s)]
*  I don't I can't keep track of where she's living in the world to avoid him watch [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5504.3s)]
*  Well, hey everybody, it's friday all day as my nana would say [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5508.780000000001s)]
*  And look what I have on my lip [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5513.02s)]
*  Everybody's been saying you have herpes you have herpes all this time and I never had a cold sore in my life [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5514.860000000001s)]
*  And now I have a cold sore and it makes me think that perhaps this weird pimple that had a tiny little head [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5520.780000000001s)]
*  Was a cold sore too [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5527.42s)]
*  And so I talked to my doctor today and I did a video telehealth [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5529.42s)]
*  and they said that [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5534.08s)]
*  It's not a cold sore it's some reaction to the sun [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5538.32s)]
*  So, I don't know. I will let you know tomorrow if I do in fact have herpes as some of the taunting [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5541.36s)]
*  from the maga people [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5547.36s)]
*  in the last uh couple of [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5549.36s)]
*  Couple of weeks hasn't it been fun ladies and gentlemen? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5552.24s)]
*  To be standing in direct opposition to everything he is and represents [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5555.5199999999995s)]
*  And always have been and always will be [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5559.38s)]
*  It's herpes it's herpes she came out later and told the world [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5567.38s)]
*  She has donald trump inflicted herpes from the stress and I wonder eliana whether really there was a legal obligation there for her to disclose that to [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5571.780000000001s)]
*  to [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5581.46s)]
*  The character of miranda [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5582.5s)]
*  The character of miranda [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5584.74s)]
*  I have to say she seems to be in a lot worse condition than rachel maddow and nicole wallace, uh in terms of [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5589.54s)]
*  Fighting fascism or whatever. Yeah. Yeah [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5596.42s)]
*  I I don't even have [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5600.5s)]
*  Response to that [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5602.9s)]
*  No, you can't it's stomach turning that [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5604.5s)]
*  It's too upsetting anybody wanted donald trump would never inflict herpes on rosie o'donnell. I think he's made that very clear [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5607.22s)]
*  Since eliana refuses to play emily, i've got another sound for you. I didn't even know sex in the city was back on the air [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5613.780000000001s)]
*  I saw it when it's happening [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5619.38s)]
*  You have to react live to the herpes. I'm sorry [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5621.46s)]
*  And I was like, uh, you know what the culture stuff. That's emily's baliwick. Anyway, here we go [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5624.820000000001s)]
*  Here we go [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5630.660000000001s)]
*  Here's another beauty. This is rosie in another scene [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5632.02s)]
*  Singing to miranda enjoy [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5636.58s)]
*  Because I knew you [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5639.860000000001s)]
*  Because I knew you I have been changed for good [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5643.14s)]
*  It's from wicked state dirt [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5652.900000000001s)]
*  Go ahead some comedy finally finally rosie odonnell is back with comedy. Um [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5659.3s)]
*  You know megan I haven't been watching this season and I think that's uh, probably being validated right now as everyone watches these clips [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5665.46s)]
*  But it's just the the writing on all of this stuff. It's so [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5672.34s)]
*  Because it's actually this is going to be a weird connection [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5676.34s)]
*  But it's actually similar to the nicole wallaces and the rachel matos. It's just that people have isolated themselves from criticism [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5678.900000000001s)]
*  Because of mental health like some of these people in like super super elite positions, uh for mental health reasons for ideology reasons [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5686.82s)]
*  They're convinced everybody who disagrees with them is a bigot [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5694.1s)]
*  So they don't get feedback really anymore from anyone other than people who like mostly agree with them and see the world the same way [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5696.9s)]
*  And it's really hurt stuff like sex in the city just in the same way that it's actually hurt news [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5704.66s)]
*  It's like they've they've just and we've seen it a little bit start to change like when you hear jamie diamond start to you know [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5710.34s)]
*  Flirt with maybe mass immigration and open borders could have some downstream consequences that are okay to talk about [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5716.1s)]
*  But mostly these people aren't taking criticism from people is they think everyone else is a big idiot [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5722.5s)]
*  um, but I mean like what do you do when those like [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5729.06s)]
*  Literally, those are two of the biggest brand ambassadors for team blue. They are i'm not just saying that they are [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5732.66s)]
*  I'm, sorry if you're a democrat, but you're stuck with them [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5739.860000000001s)]
*  I mean the one ran for governor of new york and continues to get out there and rail on the trans issues got like [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5743.3s)]
*  40 kids all of whom are trans and nine non-binary [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5748.42s)]
*  I mean, I think that might be true for both of them. I don't know rosie [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5751.639999999999s)]
*  She's unclear to me, but cynthia nixon for sure and rosie is so outspoken [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5754.44s)]
*  imagine the horror in being a democrat like [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5758.44s)]
*  Maybe a normal democrat like an old, you know blue dog democrat eliana and having one of the people most associated with your brand [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5761.5599999999995s)]
*  Out there pointing to some huge growth right underneath her nose saying it might be a pimple or it's a herpy and then [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5769.8s)]
*  Delivering an update. It's a herpy [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5777.5599999999995s)]
*  I I have herpes look at my herpy virus [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5779.64s)]
*  It was caused by donald trump and then asking us to picture her in bed with a vibrator and cynthia nixon nixon [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5783.160000000001s)]
*  And then they're like, why can't we get young men on team blue? What is it? What is it about us that drives them away? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5790.120000000001s)]
*  Megan don't interfere just let uh, let the immigration message continue as it is [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5799.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5806.04s)]
*  Let rosie continue don't do anything to mess this up. It's perfect [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5807.08s)]
*  I I think she's saying we need to stop calling attention to it. Just just to let let the consumer enjoy [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=5812.5199999999995s)]

*  with a different show [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6012.139999999999s)]
*  The alicia keys musical which is um called hell's kitchen. Okay, so their two shows shared a wall [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6013.9s)]
*  And the actress who stars in the alicia keys musical is kiesha lewis [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6021.74s)]
*  And patty lepone didn't like sharing a wall with kiesha lewis's show hell's kitchen because the sound [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6026.860000000001s)]
*  From the alicia keys musical would bleed through and patty lepone who really does fancy her fancy herself the queen of broadway [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6033.9800000000005s)]
*  Was unhappy that she had to listen to any of the musical notes [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6042.46s)]
*  So she spoke with the head of the other theater and asked him if he could fix the noise problem [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6046.22s)]
*  After those efforts which came this past november kiesha lewis [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6051.820000000001s)]
*  Posted a video on instagram [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6056.54s)]
*  Do we have the sought? Let's just play it [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6060.06s)]
*  Miss lepone here's what she actions in my opinion are bullying [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6062.700000000001s)]
*  They're offensive. They're racially microaggressive. They're rude [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6067.18s)]
*  They're rooted in privilege and these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6071.820000000001s)]
*  Who has been in the business as long as you have? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6078.22s)]
*  I want to explain what a microaggression is [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6081.18s)]
*  These are subtle unintentional comments or actions that convey stereotypes biases or negative assumptions [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6084.46s)]
*  About someone based on their race examples include calling a black show loud [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6091.58s)]
*  In a way that dismisses it referring to a predominantly black broadway show as loud [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6097.5s)]
*  Can unintentionally reinforce harmful stereotypes and it also feels dismissive of the artistry and the voices that are being celebrated on stage [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6103.9s)]
*  Miss lepone, I respectfully submit to you that you owe us an apology [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6113.82s)]
*  not flowers [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6118.0599999999995s)]

*  And flowers shots fired. This is so perfect, right? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6120.78s)]
*  It's like the woke and the woker and then like you're you're a racist is a microaggression to say a black show is loud [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6124.38s)]
*  Even though it's alicia keys. It is a musical. I'm sure the piano and the singing is loud [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6131.74s)]
*  It goes on the whole time, but so it does in most musicals in any event [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6135.82s)]
*  Shots fired, okay [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6140.860000000001s)]
*  so then [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6142.46s)]
*  Patti lepone sits down for an interview with the new yorker [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6144.38s)]

*  from the letter [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6352.32s)]
*  This language is not only degrading and misogynistic [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6353.68s)]
*  It is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6358.24s)]
*  The letter reads it is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6365.0599999999995s)]

*  It actually says that not not the kennedy not the kennedy [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6531.68s)]
*  Yeah, it really no it really says tony awards fundraiser raises and public programs they want a shunning [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6535.2s)]

*  You don't get these stories every day as of Saturday [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6553.78s)]
*  The letter had almost 700 signatures. They're probably over 700 [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6556.68s)]
*  I don't even think they're more than that on broadway probably have a thousand people working on broadway and then saturday [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6560.92s)]
*  Came [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6567.4800000000005s)]
*  By the way speaking of the kennedy center in that interview with a new yorker [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6568.68s)]
*  The writer pointed out that she told me more than once quote the trumpfied kennedy center should should get blown up [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6573.16s)]
*  She wants it blown up the kennedy center. So now by the way, she got no blowback for that [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6578.8s)]
*  No, no nasty letter. No open letter about her violent language. No one gave two shits [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6584.68s)]
*  But they're very upset. She said loud [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6590.3s)]
*  But the lady's very upset that she referred to a [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6593.66s)]
*  Musical by alicia keys is loud because they share a wall she can hear okay. So here of course was the forest apology [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6596.54s)]
*  Which is such a fun part of the act. Okay, here's the apology [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6603.74s)]
*  For as long as I have worked in the fucking theater. No, she doesn't it's just sounded like her in the theater [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6608.18s)]
*  I've spoken my mind and never apologized [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6614.0199999999995s)]
*  That is changing today [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6616.900000000001s)]
*  I am deeply sorry for the words I used during the new yorker interview particularly about kisha lewis, which were demeaning and [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6618.900000000001s)]
*  Disrespect disrespectful again. This is what she said about her. She calls herself a veteran. Let's find out how many broadway shows [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6627.06s)]
*  She's done. She doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about. She's on seven. I've done 31. Don't call yourself a vet bitch [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6632.5s)]
*  They were demeaning and disrespectful [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6639.42s)]
*  I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in the community [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6641.58s)]
*  I hope to have a chance to speak to Audra and kisha personally to offer my sincere apologies. I made a mistake I take [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6646.78s)]
*  full [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6654.58s)]
*  Responsibility for it and I am committed to making this right our entire theater community [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6655.86s)]
*  deserves better [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6661.86s)]
*  That's it. That's story time with MK courtesy of this guy who wrote a banger of a New Yorker piece the New York Post [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6664.26s)]
*  And Patti LuPone in her own very weird Broadway communities over reactions to [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6671.42s)]
*  Everything your thoughts on the whole thing [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6676.38s)]
*  Well, I have so many Megan, but first of all, I feel like I just watched a one-woman show [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6680.06s)]
*  Which was you as Patti LuPone [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6684.9800000000005s)]
*  Going back and forth in this this bitter civil war on Broadway now, it's just [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6689.58s)]
*  Patti LuPone has been a known sort of bully or the accusations of her being a bully have circulated around Broadway for years [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6696.900000000001s)]
*  It's sort of baked into the lore and the myth of Patti LuPone is that she's like this old-school Broadway [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6704.26s)]
*  Diva and so the fact that it's now [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6711.38s)]
*  Being treated as like a social justice issue to take down Patti LuPone is really something [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6715.34s)]
*  Now suddenly [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6722.34s)]
*  2025 everyone must take down Patti LuPone because she accused the Alicia Keys musical of being too loud at one point [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6723.82s)]
*  I mean just also this is I'm just gonna keep pulling on the same thread and make this connection between the awful [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6731.38s)]
*  Rosie O'Donnell Herpes video the sex in the city video and [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6738.34s)]
*  The Rachel Maddow Nicole Wallace podcast that we talked about on the show today Megan [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6742.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like these people don't have anyone to tell them stop because they have exercised they've purged [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6746.46s)]
*  Good faith critics who are still touching grass from their community [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6753.7s)]
*  So they don't have anyone to tell them how insane and ridiculous they sound and it is making their work [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6758.86s)]
*  Suffer it is turning them into not just like crazy eccentric interesting artists, but just like fully [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6765.42s)]
*  Sick mentally ill people like they're still lecturing people about microaggressions in [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6772.780000000001s)]
*  the year of our Lord 2025 it just you I [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6778.860000000001s)]
*  Think you couldn't write it because you would think at this point [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6782.740000000001s)]
*  They would have had some like humility and self-reflection [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6786.18s)]
*  But no because they've purged everyone who might be a good faith critic and it's not good for them [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6789.1s)]
*  It's not good for the country [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6794.58s)]
*  But at this point we can kind of just let them have their side show like their little side project self-destructing [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6795.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it's like they're all killing each other. So it's fine. I don't care. We win either way [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6801.7s)]
*  I don't care who wins this fight, but [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6806.42s)]
*  Not for nothing. How insane was that video by the star of the Alicia Keys musical? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6808.7s)]
*  Attacking what Patti LuPone said which was your shows loud and we can hear it through the wall [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6816.18s)]
*  I mean that was looney tunes the microaggressions [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6821.2s)]
*  Can we just watch that just can I just see it one more time? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6825.74s)]
*  I just need to see some of that one more time. This is Keisha Lewis on Instagram warning Patti LuPone about her terrible language [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6828.46s)]
*  Miss LuPone these actions in my opinion are bullying. They're offensive. They're racially microaggressive [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6835.42s)]
*  They're rude. They're rooted in privilege and these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6843.3s)]
*  For someone as yourself who has been in the business as long as you have I want to explain what a microaggression is [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6849.78s)]
*  These are subtle unintentional comments or actions that convey stereotypes biases or negative assumptions [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6857.12s)]
*  About someone based on their race [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6864.32s)]
*  Examples include calling a black show loud in a way that dismisses it referring to a predominantly [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6867.08s)]
*  black Broadway show as loud can unintentionally reinforce harmful [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6874.44s)]
*  Stereotypes and it also feels this is it is loud of the artistry and the voices that are being celebrated on stage [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6879.36s)]
*  Miss LuPone, I respectfully submit to you that you owe us an apology [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6886.5199999999995s)]
*  Not flowers unbelievable [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6890.719999999999s)]
*  Okay, she I mean isn't it a microaggression to tell someone to pull up their mask when they might have had a medical reason [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6893.84s)]
*  For not wearing a mask that sounds like a microaggression singling them out in the audience. Good point. Here's the thing that I [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6900.08s)]
*  Like my own analysis of this [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6906.759999999999s)]
*  Live by the sword die by the sword [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6909.639999999999s)]
*  You want it you want to make your career on Broadway and lecture everybody about the masks and you have to follow rules [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6911.48s)]
*  Well, you know what the rules on Broadway are [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6917.719999999999s)]
*  You are below all people of color way below and you are way way way below anybody who's LGBTQ [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6919.62s)]
*  I mean they're at the top of the food chain on Broadway and then come people of color and [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6926.339999999999s)]
*  Then you're in there Patty because you're a woman so you're still get you got something and you're old [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6931.5599999999995s)]
*  So you got those things going for you? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6935.379999999999s)]
*  There are no white men left on Broadway who are straight so they don't they're irrelevant [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6937.4800000000005s)]
*  But she's living by the sword and she's gonna die by the sword. So she you want to act in this environment? [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6941.7s)]
*  I'm sorry. It's just a cold hard reality. You're gonna have to be a [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6947.6s)]
*  member a citizen of Woke Topia and you are gonna have to play by those rules you are going to have to listen to your [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6952.22s)]
*  lectures from [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6959.9400000000005s)]
*  Keisha Lewis and you're gonna have to genuflect as she says the words microaggressions and [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6961.36s)]
*  Understand that you cannot show can't call a show loud that is [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6966.88s)]
*  Predominantly with a black cast that's racist in the world that you've chosen [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6971.719999999999s)]
*  To live and operate in and from which you regularly judge others [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6976.679999999999s)]
*  So you are the one who can F off Patty. I think I'm on the side of your insane [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6981.92s)]
*  antagonists [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6989.5599999999995s)]
*  Because while they're wrong and they're nutcases [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6990.92s)]
*  These are the weird rules of your universe and you've been just fine with them up until now [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=6994.36s)]
*  These people are too talented to be this dumb by the way, like it's just such a stupid position at this point [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7001.4800000000005s)]
*  Especially it's cut also kind of how I feel about Rachel Maddow [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7008.62s)]
*  Like she's genuinely a talented person who's just gone [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7010.96s)]
*  Like brain dead over the course of the last ten years and to see [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7014.799999999999s)]
*  People not be able to even like do their work [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7019.599999999999s)]
*  Well, because they have this awful like mind virus is very sad [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7022.9s)]
*  Yes, it really is it sucks. It sucks to watch especially [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7027.44s)]
*  Broadway is one American tradition. It's it's like a very proud American tradition [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7032.48s)]
*  And I don't want it to you feel out because there's stupid Civil War and granted [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7037.24s)]
*  I've been a total of one Broadway show and it was hairspray in 2007. So I don't really have [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7042.64s)]
*  They are talented people and it sucks to watch this stuff happen [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7049.360000000001s)]
*  But that's what you get when you completely surrender to these like lazy [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7053.160000000001s)]
*  Reflexive arguments is you ultimately they're so circular and incoherent that they will ultimately take you down with them [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7058.68s)]
*  I will end it on a happy note [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7066.08s)]
*  Not long ago the whole fam all five of us went to Broadway we keep trying, you know, we live close [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7068.32s)]
*  So we go and we can and we saw I don't remember seeing a show. I enjoyed more [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7074.7s)]
*  I did love back to the future, but this show was [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7079.86s)]
*  Spectacular and my advice to everybody is run. Don't walk to go see it. It is called [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7084.76s)]
*  operation mincemeat and it is [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7091.5599999999995s)]
*  Great. I mean truly great [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7095.32s)]
*  It's a musical it's based on the actual World War two [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7098.36s)]
*  operation mincemeat [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugCgLcNFJfg&t=7103.92s)]
