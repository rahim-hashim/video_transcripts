Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Maureen Callahan, host of "The Nerve with Maureen Callahan," to introduce the launch of Maureen’s new MK Media show, what viewers and listeners can expect, and they debut their new show "With Love, Megyn," a hilarious parody of Meghan Markle’s Netflix show. Then they discuss Meghan Markle’s tone-deaf “female founder” podcast, how the goal of the show is just to flatter Meghan, her total lack of self-awareness, Michelle Obama continuing to trash Barack on her new podcast, describing sometimes having a "bad decade" in marriage, her total lack of original thoughts, the celebrities who are pretending they're astronauts whining about criticism of their vanity space trip, how out-of-touch Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry, and Gayle King are, AOC and Bernie traveling by private jet for their "Fighting Oligarchy" tour, the ongoing case of Karmelo Anthony who stabbed Austin Metcalf, his family’s bizarre press conference, the disturbing criminal past of their chosen spokesperson, their attempt to portray themselves as victims, and more.

# Markle's "Founder" Absurdity, Michelle Trashes Barack, & Launching "The Nerve," w/ Maureen Callahan
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE)
*  Okay, this is going to be the greatest show we've ever done. I just want you to know today is going [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=0.0s)]
*  to be the greatest show we have ever put on the air in the history of the Megyn Kelly show. Well [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4.08s)]
*  over 1000 episodes. And if I'm a liar, you can email me, we're going to nail this show. And I [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=8.88s)]
*  know because I've already seen half of it. Let me explain. Welcome everybody. Just back from DC. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=14.8s)]
*  And by the way, check out my hour long sit down with FDA commissioner, Dr. Marty McCary. You guys [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=20.48s)]
*  know him from Johns Hopkins and from being a COVID contrarian in the best sense, a man of sense [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=25.2s)]
*  who is for that reason elevated to run and reform the FDA by President Trump. And we had a really [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=31.84s)]
*  good sit down together yesterday and he went over some of the things he's encountered at FDA since [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=37.68s)]
*  taking over 17 days ago and some of the swamp creatures who came out to try to snare him [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  when he was named. So it's a great exchange. I think you'll really enjoy it. It's doing very [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=48.96s)]
*  well. But now we told you we were going to do this. Okay. Maureen Callahan came on in a month [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=52.8s)]
*  or two ago when Meghan Markle's as ever series dropped and you know, we deconstructed it. You [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=61.28s)]
*  may recall, and we had an idea at that time. And our idea has become a reality. Now Maureen is a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=68.24s)]
*  columnist for the Daily Mail and she's also here to promote her new show on the MK media network. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=77.36s)]
*  You can find it wherever you get your podcasts for free. It's just being produced by us and it's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=83.76s)]
*  called the nerve with Maureen Callahan, the nerve. It launches on Tuesday of next week. So go subscribe [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=89.6s)]
*  now and we'll run Maureen up to the top of the charts at the nerve show on YouTube, Apple, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  Spotify and all social platforms. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=102.72s)]
*  follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. You've heard about tariffs recently plus inflation, supply chain [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=109.2s)]
*  disruptions. It's a lot, but there is a silver lining that most people missed. President Trump [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=115.6s)]
*  specifically exempted gold and silver bullion from the tariff talk. The administration preserved the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=121.28s)]
*  ability to diversify into precious metals. If you are concerned about your savings, consider a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=127.36s)]
*  free consultation with a Birch Gold precious metals specialist. The first step is to text MK [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=133.2s)]
*  to 989898 and receive your free no obligation info kit on gold. Learn how to hold gold and silver [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=138.88s)]
*  in a tax sheltered account. Birch Gold will help you convert an existing IRA or 401k into a gold [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=146.16s)]
*  IRA for no money out of pocket. With an A plus rating from the Better Business Bureau and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=152.88s)]
*  thousands of thankful customers, consider texting MK to 989898. Again, text MK to 989898 to claim [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=158.56s)]
*  your free info kit right now. Maureen, welcome back. You know, Megan, I've said this to you before, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=166.32s)]
*  and I mean it truly. I do not know what I've done to deserve you. I really, really don't. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=172.88s)]
*  Oh Maureen. And you, that was your idea, by the way, I'm just going to give you full credit for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=179.12s)]
*  it to do the Megan Markle spoof show. And we got, I think to act out a lot of our frustration. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  And I think we are absorbing a lot of communal energy because the response just even to the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=193.92s)]
*  trailer that you put up last night has been like a huge catharsis. They're with us. They're with us. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=199.92s)]
*  We all get it. And we all needed this. I'm going to show it in a minute, but before we get it, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  Maureen hasn't seen it. Okay. I intentionally withheld it from Maureen. I have seen it and I [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=211.76s)]
*  died. I died multiple times over. I laughed so hard. Abby and I watched it together. Our stomachs [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  hurt. We were laughing so hard. We're going to keep the sound down here on the set as we watch it [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=222.16s)]
*  because we don't want to ruin it for you guys with our laughter. But before we get to that, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=226.16s)]
*  I do want to start with the trailer for the nerve. You all love Maureen and I love this trailer [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=229.76s)]
*  because it really does give you a feel and a flavor for who she is because a lot of people [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=235.44s)]
*  don't know her yet. And they're about to watch this. This is the nerve. When Ben Affleck moves [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  out of the $65 million marital home he shared with JLo in the metaphorical dead of night, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=247.04s)]
*  while she's off in Europe, we're going to analyze it like the collapse of the Roman Empire. When [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=253.84s)]
*  Meghan Markle drops yet another mediocre show or podcast, we're going to take it all apart like a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=258.88s)]
*  piñata. We'll also be covering true crime in real time. Diddy, Luigi Mangione, Brian Coburger, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=264.96s)]
*  all those trials and what they say about America. We're your home for all things pop culture, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=272.24s)]
*  including fashion, TV, movies, books, social media, and the new health and wellness space [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=279.76s)]
*  targeted particularly at women. And I promise you, you'll never guess what we're about to say next. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=286.56s)]
*  The Nerve with Maureen Callahan, launching Tuesday, April 22nd. Please join us. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=292.72s)]

*  this extremely talented producer who I've worked with for years come over and this guy's a miracle [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=404.32s)]

*  Okay. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=557.12s)]

*  You know they don't really want you there. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=561.84s)]
*  And I just wanted you to know when you're upstairs alone in the other wing by yourself [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=564.24s)]
*  that we are thinking about you and we've given you enough things to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=569.12s)]

*  We're going to put it in one of these special cellophane bags [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=663.2s)]
*  because what is a fancy food staple if it doesn't get put in a fancy bag? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=668.5600000000001s)]

*  Okay. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=677.12s)]
*  It's okay. These aren't, it's not expensive like your clothes are. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=681.6s)]
*  Look at how fun that is. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=684.5600000000001s)]

*  Nailed it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=702.0s)]
*  So now what's important is to make sure that there's a bow on everything. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=703.3599999999999s)]
*  We're just going to have to do a little cutting [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=707.92s)]
*  and make sure that it looks absolutely perfect. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=711.92s)]
*  I really like to cut my ribbons in a diagonal because I'm not a barbarian. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=714.56s)]
*  And I really recommend that you do it too. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=721.8399999999999s)]

*  I have some more little baggies and that's because I have more little treats for you. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=732.16s)]
*  So I have to be honest, I've pretty much exhausted myself on the corn and the cob [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=742.8s)]
*  and therefore I went store bought, but these are amazing and you're going to absolutely love them. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=746.56s)]

*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=765.68s)]
*  The thought is everything. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=766.48s)]
*  Look how easy I can make this. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=767.44s)]
*  I open them. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=771.76s)]
*  Then I open the bag. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=774.24s)]
*  Could you? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=775.92s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=776.32s)]
*  And then look what I do. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=777.84s)]
*  Could you open a bit more? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=783.2s)]
*  And then I just, and then I just dump it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=785.6s)]
*  Just like that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=788.88s)]
*  Where are you getting all these like mini brainstorms? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=790.32s)]
*  I'm so impressed by this. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=793.36s)]
*  You have to be a founder to really understand it fully, but maybe in the next wave of our [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=795.36s)]
*  friendship, I'll try to explain it to you. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=801.04s)]
*  Hold that tight, please. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=802.48s)]
*  Now we're going to use a different color ribbon because we want everything to feel special [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=805.2s)]
*  in its place. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=810.0s)]
*  And how do we cut the ribbon Maureen? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=810.64s)]
*  On an angle. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=812.88s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=813.76s)]

*  I don't know if we're supposed to maybe mention your marriage, which seems like the love story [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=831.92s)]
*  of all love stories, really. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=838.96s)]

*  He isn't exactly what I thought he was. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=844.16s)]
*  I mean, I was told there'd be a big castle. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=848.16s)]

*  I have not seen any of that. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=888.16s)]
*  That day flew, by the way. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=890.16s)]
*  It flew. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=892.24s)]
*  And we had not talked before. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=892.88s)]
*  There was no script. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=896.72s)]
*  I didn't even have like a scene breakdown of anything. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=896.88s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=899.2s)]
*  Just walked in cold. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  And I don't know whether to be proud of us. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=901.28s)]
*  Or feel sorry for us. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=903.84s)]
*  That we are so well versed in what Meghan Markle or her supplicant would say at any [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=905.28s)]
*  given moment that we could just ad lib all day long. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=909.84s)]
*  And the cocktails helped a lot. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=913.9200000000001s)]
*  Those were real. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=915.84s)]
*  My favorite thing, my favorite part of the whole thing is like the one layer down boiling [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=917.28s)]
*  rage I have for you and everything. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=924.24s)]
*  And one layer down if that obvious like subservience and fear you have for me. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=927.76s)]
*  Well, I told you after that to me, like my inner child really came out. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=935.28s)]
*  My inner child who spent 12 years being tormented by nuns in Catholic school. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=941.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=945.84s)]
*  So the instinct is just defer and run the other way. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=946.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=949.68s)]
*  So that's all I had to do with you is just defer, defer, defer and get out of there. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=950.08s)]
*  It's so exactly. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=955.28s)]
*  If I do say so myself, we really nailed especially like her and Daniel the way she was with guest [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=956.5600000000001s)]
*  number one and kind of Mindy Kaling too. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  They're obviously all afraid of her hair trigger and she's like she could snap at any moment. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=965.36s)]

*  That's important. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1352.96s)]
*  On a lightly floured surface, we're going to roll out the dough. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1354.96s)]
*  Quarter cup of water to finish it off. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1356.96s)]
*  Filtered, of course. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1358.96s)]
*  Someone put too much water in the mixer. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1360.96s)]
*  Someone got left alone in the kitchen for another costume change. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1362.96s)]
*  Not to worry. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1366.96s)]

*  You already made them. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1374.96s)]
*  I already made them perfect. And guess what? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1376.96s)]
*  Since you already know this, because you made them, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1378.96s)]
*  they can be eaten by humans too. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1380.96s)]
*  Summon substance of coming to Megan's house for fun. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1386.96s)]

*  Cheers, dear! [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1410.96s)]
*  No problems whatsoever. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1414.96s)]
*  Bradwick! [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1422.96s)]
*  No. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1424.96s)]
*  I'm dying. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1434.96s)]
*  I was like doubled over in tears. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1436.96s)]
*  I'm on my second tissue. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1438.96s)]
*  We're both fixing our makeup during the video. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1440.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1444.96s)]
*  Also, Strudwick, really, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1446.96s)]
*  I think the secret weapon of that entire bit. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1448.96s)]
*  Megan's dog. I believe she probably dated that dog. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1452.96s)]
*  He sat perfectly in his little perfect doggy bed. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1456.96s)]
*  He was pretty good. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1458.96s)]
*  What didn't make the cut, and I hope you show online or something, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1460.96s)]
*  is Strudwick escaping to the pool. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1464.96s)]
*  We're in our black tie in the middle of the day. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1468.96s)]
*  And you had to run out in your sequined gorgeous gown [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1470.96s)]
*  trying to get Strudwick out of the pool [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1474.96s)]
*  while the sun tea is still brewing. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1476.96s)]
*  The pool guy must think you have lost your mind. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1480.96s)]
*  This is how I live. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1482.96s)]
*  I swear black formal sparkles during the day. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1484.96s)]
*  There's another scene that we'll get to in which we are, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1486.96s)]
*  we elevate the alvets even more, and we go black tie. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1488.96s)]
*  And that's why we then have fur on in this latest scene. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1492.96s)]
*  But yeah, Strudwick was his typical terrible self, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1496.96s)]
*  which will come to the surprise of no one listening to this show. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1498.96s)]
*  And for the listening audience, you can see him at the end. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1502.96s)]
*  He got up, we left to go do a wardrobe change, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1504.96s)]
*  and Jake had the cameras rolling and caught Strudwick, of course, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1508.96s)]
*  immediately jumping up and eating all the stuff that we had prepared. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1512.96s)]
*  So we caught that on camera. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1516.96s)]
*  And the little headlines in this one were, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1518.96s)]
*  how to put fruit in champagne. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1520.96s)]
*  This is the stuff you get from Meghan Markle's show. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1522.96s)]
*  How to make ice cubes. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1526.96s)]
*  Literally, this is what she's doing. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1528.96s)]
*  And then the edible flowers was a whole story in and of itself [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1530.96s)]
*  because Jake, the producer, he went to like five different stores, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1532.96s)]
*  grocery stores and flower stores to try to find edible flowers. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1537.96s)]
*  And what they said was at the grocery stores, they were all like, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1541.96s)]
*  oh, we got rid of those years ago. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1545.96s)]
*  They were way too expensive. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1546.96s)]
*  They're just ridiculous. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1547.96s)]
*  They die right away. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1548.96s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1549.96s)]
*  And that the floral shops, they said, we should never eat flowers. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1550.96s)]
*  They're toxic. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1553.96s)]
*  They're covered in pesticides. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1554.96s)]
*  They're only for looking. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1556.96s)]
*  And so that's why they have that little sticker on those flowers, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1557.96s)]
*  like do not eat, not edible. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1561.96s)]
*  And so she's trying to market these edible flowers, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1563.96s)]
*  which I guess I are they grown in her garden with no pesticides [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1566.96s)]
*  and no toxins whatsoever? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1569.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1571.96s)]
*  But you cannot buy these as a real person anywhere. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1572.96s)]
*  You have to conveniently buy them from her. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1575.96s)]
*  You know, we got those at the mail. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1579.96s)]
*  I should have brought them for you. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1582.96s)]
*  You would die. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1583.96s)]
*  Hers? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1584.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1585.96s)]
*  OK, so they come in this. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1586.96s)]
*  They come in, I guess, the packaging for her crepe mix, maybe. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1587.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1592.96s)]
*  Or the shortbread, whatever the crepe mix, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1593.96s)]
*  which she tells us, by the way, is French style. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1594.96s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1596.96s)]
*  Because crepes are actually a French invention. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1597.96s)]
*  So they are, by definition, French style, Megan. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1599.96s)]
*  And then they there's this little cellophane baggie. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1602.96s)]
*  Now, as you and I previously discussed, I've never consumed street drugs. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1606.96s)]
*  I know people who have. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1610.96s)]
*  And it looks like a little drug baggie. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1611.96s)]
*  It's so cheap. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1614.96s)]
*  And inside are these like flakes, these multicolored flakes that you would never go. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1615.96s)]
*  Those are fruit petals. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1622.96s)]
*  Those are lovely little fruit petals. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1623.96s)]
*  They look like hard pieces of lint that you would pull out of the dryer. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1625.96s)]
*  You're better off with sprinkles. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1629.96s)]
*  And also, until you went to we were I was deputized. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1631.96s)]
*  Thank you, Megan, to pick the flowers, the hydrangea petals off. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1636.96s)]
*  The toxin riddles. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1640.96s)]
*  Before we put them in the plastic ice tray. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1641.96s)]
*  You said, look at the label. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1646.96s)]
*  What does that label say to you? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1648.96s)]
*  What does that label say to you? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1649.96s)]
*  Just like a nun. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1650.96s)]
*  What does that label say to you? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1651.96s)]
*  And it said non edible, which, by the way, whenever I purchase flowers, I never think [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1652.96s)]
*  like, should I look and see if she's an edible item? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1657.96s)]
*  Like, who thinks this way? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1660.96s)]
*  Oh, no, these I can't eat. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1662.96s)]
*  Those I can't eat. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1664.96s)]
*  Can I eat the peonies? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1665.96s)]
*  Maybe the sunflower. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1666.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's so so hopefully we'll get to in the third installment, all the cooking we [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1668.96s)]
*  did because we actually did a fair amount of cooking and chopping and mixing. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1672.96s)]
*  It was hard labor. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1677.96s)]
*  It was hard labor. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1679.96s)]
*  It was hard labor. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1680.96s)]
*  And I was actually surprised. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1681.96s)]
*  I thought it was maybe sort of a threat that would not be made good. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1682.96s)]
*  The fruit platter almost killed me. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1688.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1690.96s)]
*  The fruit platter almost did me. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1691.96s)]
*  I was like, are we done? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1694.96s)]
*  Is this it? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1695.96s)]
*  We were not. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1696.96s)]
*  No, we were not. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1697.96s)]
*  But yeah, we were exhausted by the end of that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1698.96s)]
*  I mean, fruit was slipping out of our hands. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1699.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1701.96s)]
*  You were berating me for washing fruit too hard. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1702.96s)]
*  Like you were really channeling her method. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1704.96s)]
*  You really were. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1707.96s)]
*  And then the kicker was we finished that up. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1708.96s)]
*  It was a four hour shoot. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1711.96s)]
*  We finished that up and I had to do am update. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1712.96s)]
*  I had to tape that early that day because we had plans that evening. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1714.96s)]
*  So I'm like half in the bag from all the champagne we had. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1718.96s)]
*  And then I had to do this hour and a half long thing with Stanford Business School. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1721.96s)]
*  How did that go? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1724.96s)]
*  You guys have no idea what I spent my afternoon doing. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1725.96s)]
*  You have no idea what I've been through. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1728.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1730.96s)]
*  It's funny too because then of course the next day I'm sitting with Marty McCary and [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1731.96s)]
*  I'm like, I have the most bizarre variety in my job of pretty much anybody I know, like [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1733.96s)]
*  sitting down at the FDA and pretending to be Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex the day [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1738.96s)]
*  before. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1743.96s)]
*  Drinking champagne with just constantly piling fruit in, which we both acknowledge was actually [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1744.96s)]
*  pretty good. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1748.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1749.96s)]
*  We're going to give her that one. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1750.96s)]
*  I'll give her that one. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1751.96s)]
*  But really just guzzling, guzzling, guzzling because it was partly in character and we're [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1752.96s)]
*  in fur for day. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1756.96s)]
*  Like we really took it up. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1758.96s)]
*  And then when it was all over, just sitting and like having a moment to take all of our [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1760.96s)]
*  hard work in. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1765.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1766.96s)]
*  We really, we really, really, really worked hard that day. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1767.96s)]
*  The true is so fun. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1770.96s)]
*  The truest line I think it was spoken in that segment was, this was me in the character [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1771.96s)]
*  of Ms. Markle saying, people seem to like me a lot more when they're intoxicated. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1776.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1781.96s)]
*  That's why I serve champagne liberally. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1782.96s)]
*  And why I kept topping you off to try to like blunt some of that mean energy coming my way. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1785.96s)]
*  She probably has no idea why people are like, yes, for the love of God, get this champagne [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1791.96s)]
*  at 8 a.m. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1795.96s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1796.96s)]
*  Now, on the subject of the weird photos of, you know, the AI photos of the princess version [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1797.96s)]
*  of me, she's not a princess. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1802.96s)]
*  She's a Duchess at best. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1803.96s)]
*  Jake, he was asking you and me if we had any photos of ourselves when we were little girls [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1806.96s)]
*  in the kitchen. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1810.96s)]
*  And not surprisingly, we didn't. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1811.96s)]
*  And you wouldn't either. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1813.96s)]
*  No, of course we were never in the kitchen. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1814.96s)]
*  Do you do you have little pictures of you cooking as a kid? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1816.96s)]
*  I was like, are you kidding me? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1819.96s)]
*  First of all, I grew up in the 70s. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1820.96s)]
*  There are no pictures. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1821.96s)]
*  And I was the third kid. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1822.96s)]
*  There are no pictures of me. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1823.96s)]
*  There was zero interest in me. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1824.96s)]
*  But honestly, I was not an attractive child, so it's fine. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1826.96s)]
*  It worked out. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1828.96s)]
*  No swear. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1829.96s)]
*  I'll show. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1830.96s)]
*  I'll prove it to you. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1831.96s)]
*  But Jake ran our actual like our present day photos through this AI generator that was [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1832.96s)]
*  making these photos. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1838.96s)]
*  And let me tell you something, Maureen. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1839.96s)]
*  It doesn't work like that. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1841.96s)]
*  Okay, let's start with the one of Maureen and put it on the board. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1842.96s)]
*  See what AI came up with. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1845.96s)]
*  I look like an 80 year old. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1847.96s)]
*  Like I look like I have a form of dwarfism. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1850.96s)]
*  Oh, it's nothing compared to what you're about to see. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1853.96s)]
*  But stand by. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1856.96s)]
*  Let's just keep it on this one for a second. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1857.96s)]
*  It's like a Maureen. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1858.96s)]
*  It is an adult picture of Maureen's face and Maureen's kind of hair on like a little body. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1860.96s)]
*  It's been just shrunk. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1867.96s)]
*  It's like been miniaturized. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1868.96s)]
*  I've been miniaturized. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1869.96s)]
*  You look like a magical mythical creature. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1870.96s)]
*  That's like a Keebler elf. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1874.96s)]
*  Yeah, like elf. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1876.96s)]
*  I do. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1877.96s)]
*  Okay, but now I definitely look like a little person. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1878.96s)]
*  Look at the one they came up with for me. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1880.96s)]
*  Ew. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1882.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1883.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1884.96s)]
*  But this is like, this would be you. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1885.96s)]
*  Like that would be me at maybe two. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1887.96s)]
*  This would be you. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1888.96s)]
*  I feel like it's six maybe. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1889.96s)]
*  It'd be me with my current hair and my current face, but smaller in like a little person's [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1890.96s)]
*  body. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1896.96s)]
*  But something about this is incredibly disturbing and creepy and the kind of thing that you'll [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1897.96s)]
*  have nightmares over. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1902.6000000000001s)]
*  I love this. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1904.5s)]
*  I love that. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1905.5s)]
*  It's very Meghan Markle with your hair falling right into the food that you're creating. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1906.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1911.24s)]
*  Yeah, perfect. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1912.24s)]
*  Oh, that's the other thing. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1913.24s)]
*  And do you know, I found this out later that in a real kitchen, chefs are not allowed to [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1914.24s)]
*  wear any makeup. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1918.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1919.56s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1920.56s)]
*  Of course the hair has to be back. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1921.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1922.56s)]

*  She deserves it. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1954.5600000000002s)]
*  And I think the real loss is really only going to be Meghan Markle's because as we've discussed [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1955.5600000000002s)]
*  before she has zero sense of humor. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1960.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1962.64s)]
*  And if she could laugh at herself at all, she might really, really see the humor in that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1963.64s)]
*  And especially the interpersonal dynamics that she has with her great friends who come over. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1967.8400000000001s)]
*  So the line that killed me was when I asked you about your mini brainstorms of decanting [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1973.48s)]
*  and repackaging in multiple plastic containers. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1980.68s)]
*  And you said, and I'm guessing you have like in the next wave of our friendship, I'll try [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1983.96s)]
*  to explain it to you. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1989.68s)]
*  Like you could unpack the microaggressions in that one statement for days. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1992.32s)]
*  It's like there were so many things that were just flying by my head. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=1996.76s)]
*  And how about you when you're like, you know, yes, that's what our friendship has always [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2000.24s)]
*  been about me asking you lots of questions about yourself. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2004.2s)]
*  You really seem to come alive when you talk about yourself. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2008.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2013.24s)]
*  In some of the other clips, I'm sure we'll get to, it's Maureen anytime she tries to [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2015.0s)]
*  say anything about herself. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2019.32s)]
*  I talk over her. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2021.0s)]
*  Meghan just cut me right off. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2022.0s)]
*  She was really good at asking me a barbed question, like an insult, right? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2023.0s)]
*  Oh, I love you. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2028.04s)]
*  I love, I know all your weak spots. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2029.04s)]
*  Let me go right here. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2030.4s)]
*  And then I try to answer in a way that will like recover some dignity. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2031.88s)]
*  And you just cut me right off. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2035.8s)]
*  On to your next, back to you, back to you. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2037.88s)]
*  I'm sure everyone is more interested in me. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2040.88s)]
*  That's pretty much how she feels. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2043.0400000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2044.0400000000002s)]
*  She's fascinating. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2045.0400000000002s)]
*  Oh, this just in this just in. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2046.0400000000002s)]
*  We've been renewed for a second season. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2049.48s)]
*  You're kidding me. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2051.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2052.52s)]
*  Well, of course we're so great. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2053.52s)]
*  I mean, you're great. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2055.36s)]
*  I'm all right. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2057.36s)]
*  But you're you listen, it's your show. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2058.36s)]
*  So when you're a founder, good things just keep finding you. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2060.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, there is so much truth in that basic aphorism. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2064.2000000000003s)]
*  I never realized. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2068.04s)]
*  We're not leaving her quite yet because she's in addition to this show, launched another [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2069.2s)]
*  podcast about founders. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2074.84s)]
*  What else? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2078.24s)]
*  Founders. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2079.24s)]
*  OK, I've been dying to talk to you about this because I was on I was commuting on the train [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2080.24s)]
*  and listening to episode one. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2086.32s)]
*  OK, I did. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2088.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I did, too. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2089.7599999999998s)]
*  Again, you're always overachieving. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2090.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I did my base. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2091.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, no, even listening like even when we were talking about the Netflix show, I [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2092.7599999999998s)]
*  said I watched these following episodes. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2097.7200000000003s)]
*  They were three and totally go. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2099.7200000000003s)]
*  I did four. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2100.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, Megan. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2101.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, great. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2102.7200000000003s)]
*  You got to commit when it comes to this one. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2103.7200000000003s)]
*  You're going to fall behind. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2105.7200000000003s)]
*  I know I'm doing my best. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2106.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a it's it's that mountain gets harder to climb every time. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2108.7200000000003s)]
*  It's painstaking that that first episode struck me. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2111.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, she's got the founder of Bumble on. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2114.7200000000003s)]
*  OK, yeah. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2116.7200000000003s)]
*  I would never have been able to tell you her name. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2117.7200000000003s)]
*  No, still can't. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2119.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2120.7200000000003s)]
*  So like, again, where's the Guinness of the World? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2121.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2123.7200000000003s)]
*  Where are the real starry stars? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2126.68s)]
*  Founders. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2127.68s)]
*  This entire episode, it was like it was like watching a toothless child try to eat some [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2128.68s)]
*  oatmeal. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2135.12s)]
*  It was just like conversations about intentionality, making space, giving oneself permission to [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2136.12s)]
*  love oneself. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2143.68s)]
*  Like tell me how any of this is applicable to building an actual business. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2145.24s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's all her weird like self help talk. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2150.08s)]
*  We were getting at some of that in our little bit. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2153.6s)]
*  But if you listen to this podcast like the earlier one, it's all like she's overly [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2156.36s)]
*  therapy. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2161.4s)]
*  She's classic like this younger generation that has spent too much time online trying [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2162.4s)]
*  to explore themselves. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2167.08s)]
*  And she said something to the woman I heard in episode two who did Girls Who Code. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2169.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2175.24s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2176.24s)]
*  And the reason, of course, she's honest because apparently Meghan Markle put some money toward [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2177.24s)]
*  that company. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2181.32s)]
*  And so this was a chance for this woman to be like, you're so amazing. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2182.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2186.28s)]
*  You invested in me. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2187.28s)]
*  You support people. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2188.56s)]
*  It was completely just a setup for that. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2189.92s)]
*  Well, so the Whitney, the Bumble Woman episode was notable for a couple of things. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2192.36s)]
*  But one was so Whitney goes to Meghan. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2197.52s)]
*  Do you mind if I tell the story about you? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2199.32s)]
*  The Ireland story. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2201.84s)]
*  Can I tell that story? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2202.84s)]
*  I guess this really private, sacred piece of information. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2203.84s)]
*  It goes, oh, yeah, yeah, of course you can tell that story. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2206.32s)]
*  So they had just met. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2209.92s)]
*  And by the way, the way they met was like Meghan invited her and her husband over for [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2210.96s)]
*  a New Year's Eve party, which is really like how you get to like forge or, you know, some [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2214.08s)]
*  intimate bonding when you're having people over for a huge holiday party, whatever. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2218.32s)]
*  She goes, OK, so I'm in the airport in Ireland and I go into, you know, one of those like, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2222.7200000000003s)]
*  what do you call them? [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2226.88s)]
*  Like a newsstand. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2227.88s)]
*  She literally sent us what like a Hudson News like a news like they're OK. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2228.88s)]
*  So I'm in there and I'm looking at the at the racks and you are on the cover of every [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2232.7400000000002s)]
*  single magazine. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2238.0s)]
*  And I said to myself, how does this woman deal with all of this attention? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2240.28s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2244.92s)]
*  How does she how does she manage it? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2246.6400000000003s)]
*  And it was just like Meghan was just like, she's eating it. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2248.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2251.2400000000002s)]
*  I know it's so hard. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2252.2400000000002s)]
*  It's so hard. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2253.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what her show is about. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2254.6800000000003s)]
*  Really. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2255.6800000000003s)]
*  It's all secretly a cover for her. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2256.6800000000003s)]
*  The Netflix show that we just parodied this podcast like she was talking to this woman [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2258.1800000000003s)]
*  of Girls Who Code. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2262.6800000000003s)]
*  And of course, the woman referenced 10 times being a woman of color, a woman of color, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  how hard it is. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2268.1600000000003s)]
*  She's an Indian. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2269.24s)]
*  So like, not for another. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2270.24s)]
*  They're not exactly oppressed. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2271.24s)]
*  They're like at the top of the echelon and income and academic achievement. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2272.24s)]
*  OK, fine. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2277.16s)]
*  Nothing against Indians. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2279.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm just like, you're not really high on the oppression scale. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2280.3599999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2282.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2283.8799999999997s)]
*  Just stop. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2284.8799999999997s)]
*  And Meghan's like she said something like, you know, and that was that cut deep. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2285.8799999999997s)]
*  And Meghan's like, yes, were you cut or were you cut open? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2290.48s)]
*  She did not say that. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2294.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2295.56s)]
*  That opens you to more experiences, Maureen. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2296.96s)]
*  That's why that's a new way. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2300.04s)]
*  That's why founders get ahead because they look at life's crises in that manner. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2302.12s)]
*  The other thing I loved, she talked about being consumed with her packaging, which is [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2307.84s)]
*  someone who got the packaging, the items. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2313.4s)]
*  It's really cheap stuff. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2316.4s)]
*  She she. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2318.12s)]
*  Oh, we have some of this. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2319.12s)]
*  Wait, they cut this. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2320.56s)]
*  Yes, we did. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2321.56s)]
*  We played it once before that my team is telling me, but it's still good. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2322.56s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2325.44s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2326.52s)]
*  Launching a business, it can be so overwhelming, even with the best of teams. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2327.52s)]
*  It'll keep you up at night. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2334.2400000000002s)]
*  For example, a month ago, I was absolutely consumed with packaging boxes. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2336.28s)]
*  It's all I could think about. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2344.64s)]
*  And I would sit there doing the unboxing in my head. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2348.08s)]
*  Is there tissue paper? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2350.88s)]
*  What about the packing peanuts? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2351.88s)]
*  But they're biodegradable. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2352.88s)]
*  Where does the sticker go and hold on? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2353.88s)]
*  What size the box is going to be? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2354.88s)]
*  That's not going to fit all the skews. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2355.96s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2356.96s)]
*  And then someone says, but you don't want to brand the outside of the box because a [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2358.56s)]
*  porch pirate had never heard that before. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2361.2400000000002s)]
*  What's a porch pirate? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2364.12s)]
*  And then I'm sitting there and I'm like, does any of this actually matter? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2365.12s)]
*  Of course it matters. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2368.44s)]
*  It matters at the beginning. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2369.44s)]
*  But how much does it matter? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2370.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, my God, what twaddle. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2372.7200000000003s)]
*  She's never heard of a porch pirate. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2376.6s)]
*  She's never seen any of those videos that go viral of people stealing. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2378.6800000000003s)]
*  Like, OK, fine, whatever. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2382.6400000000003s)]
*  Also, I can tell you there's a million. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2384.6s)]
*  There are not a million, but there are significant mistakes on the packaging. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2386.32s)]
*  Miss perfectionist. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2390.32s)]
*  Because you ordered the goods. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2391.32s)]
*  You referenced that earlier. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2392.32s)]
*  You actually went to the website and ordered them. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2393.32s)]
*  My special. Well, someone did. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2395.8s)]
*  As Megan would say, I'm not doing that. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2397.8s)]
*  Someone else did it. Someone did it. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2399.8s)]
*  But so so so she's talking she's talking about her perfectionism and her struggles. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2401.44s)]
*  And does any of this matter? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2406.48s)]
*  Existentially, I can say it does not matter. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2407.88s)]
*  We're here for you. Exactly. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2410.12s)]
*  So the Bumble woman tells Megan, she reassures her by saying, listen, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2412.16s)]
*  the most important thing is, did you give it your all? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2416.72s)]
*  Oh, God, it doesn't matter if you succeed or fail. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2419.12s)]
*  But did you give it your all? Oh, to which I say it does matter. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2421.16s)]
*  No, it has to succeed or if that's actually the entire point of this enterprise, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2423.56s)]
*  because nobody wants to lose money on their investments. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2428.3199999999997s)]
*  You can't take another ding to your brand. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2430.72s)]
*  Sorry. Is that what you're going to tell your producer on your show? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2432.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, we don't really care about success. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2434.88s)]
*  Just try. Just trying hard. Just try hard. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2436.4s)]
*  And to me, it's this sort of like post covid [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2439.12s)]
*  Gen Z general philosophy in life, which is like, well, I tried hard. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2442.08s)]
*  Yeah. The outcome doesn't really matter. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2446.4s)]
*  Did I give it my all? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2448.3199999999997s)]
*  What matters is how I feel. Exactly. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2450.2s)]
*  Not really how I did. Exactly. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2452.44s)]
*  Here's one that you are going to love. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2454.88s)]
*  This is from episode two, when she confesses [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2456.96s)]
*  the secret of every successful woman. Here it is. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2461.6s)]
*  We're going to talk about what's behind every successful woman. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2465.64s)]
*  What's behind every successful? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2467.6s)]
*  What's behind every successful woman is self-awareness. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2469.48s)]
*  There comes a point where each of these women on their journeys [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2473.2s)]
*  has such a tremendous sense of self-awareness and the desire to dig deeper. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2476.56s)]
*  That is unflappable. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2482.92s)]
*  Self-awareness from this one. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2487.68s)]
*  It's almost like she's talking to herself about her. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2492.12s)]
*  But because she doesn't know herself, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2497.0s)]
*  she has no idea that she doesn't have self-awareness. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2499.4s)]
*  I think she thinks of these things as like items you almost pluck from a shelf. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2501.44s)]
*  Well, I need some intentionality today. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2505.08s)]
*  I need some authenticity today. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2507.4s)]
*  I need some self-awareness today. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2509.48s)]
*  What's behind every founder is such an odd question. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2510.96s)]
*  It's like what's inside every founder, right? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2513.4s)]
*  What is the thing that they have to that they feel they have to create or express? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2516.2s)]
*  Right. She what's behind this female founder? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2521.04s)]
*  It's so easy. It's a beta royal. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2523.92s)]
*  That's what's behind this female founder. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2527.24s)]
*  That's what's propelling her forward. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2529.16s)]
*  Truly, this is what's true about her and her business. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2530.84s)]
*  They only have a nickel between them because he's a royal. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2536.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2541.8s)]
*  She was doing fine as a D-list actress on Suits. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2543.48s)]
*  She could pay her bills. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2546.44s)]
*  I'm sure she could pay her monthly rent in Toronto. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2547.16s)]
*  Fine. But she was not living in Montecito with the mountain views [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2549.96s)]
*  and the huge mansion and the garden the size of Madison Square Garden. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2554.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2559.4s)]
*  The reason they got that money from Netflix and Spotify is because he is the grandson of the queen [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2559.88s)]
*  and son of the king, period. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2568.12s)]
*  But she wants us to listen to her like she's a founder. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2570.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2574.12s)]
*  Because she took all that money and launched her stupid ass lifestyle brand with jam. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2574.52s)]
*  With jam, that is inedible, truly. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2580.52s)]
*  When you open the jar, there's no center to it, which I think is the personification [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2585.48s)]
*  of the Meghan Markle brand. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2592.2000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2595.0800000000004s)]
*  Empty in the middle, nothing holding everything together. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2596.44s)]
*  There's nothing in the middle of the jam jar? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2600.44s)]
*  I mean like a kind of like something that keeps the jelly gelled, right? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2603.1600000000003s)]
*  It would be like me spilling a bit of this water. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2609.0s)]
*  It's that runny. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2611.08s)]
*  It's that disgusting. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2612.12s)]
*  So it's like... [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2613.4s)]
*  And the packaging you were showing me is very cheap. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2613.96s)]
*  It's extremely cheap. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2617.64s)]
*  And by the way, we're never supposed to see the children or talk about the children, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2619.08s)]
*  but we do talk about the children on the packaging. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2623.08s)]
*  Oh, is that right? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2625.96s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2626.92s)]
*  We talk about the children. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2627.8s)]
*  That's why you're not allowed to talk about them elsewhere. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2628.52s)]
*  We have to save it for the branding. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2629.8s)]
*  We have to save it for the branding. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2631.0s)]
*  And she talks about what she loves to do with her children, which is... [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2632.92s)]
*  I don't even think this woman sees her children. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2636.68s)]
*  How much time do you think it took her to shoot those episodes? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2639.56s)]
*  Oh, I mean a long time for her? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2643.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2646.12s)]
*  A long time. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2646.44s)]
*  She didn't bang that out in four hours like we did. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2647.16s)]
*  No way. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2649.08s)]
*  No way. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2649.96s)]
*  Because she also... [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2650.6s)]
*  Again, she can't talk to anybody. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2651.48s)]
*  She can't... [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2653.56s)]
*  It's all so silted. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2654.52s)]
*  And everything has to be perfect. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2656.04s)]
*  You can see, you know, she gets upset when like we were playing off of it, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2658.9199999999996s)]
*  but when like Daniel tasted the food and it was not time to taste the food. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2662.84s)]
*  And he cut his finger. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2667.96s)]
*  It was like, she doesn't like when things go wrong. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2669.48s)]
*  This is why she's such a bully. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2672.1200000000003s)]
*  And this is why I was trying to overplay like how important friendship is. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2673.7200000000003s)]
*  Because we all know that her reputation is that she bullies women. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2677.56s)]
*  No one who spends time with her can stand her. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2681.4s)]
*  The only people she's getting on this podcast are people who kind of owe her one [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2684.04s)]
*  because she used some of her royal money to seed their business. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2688.36s)]
*  So she could call herself altogether a founder. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2691.64s)]
*  Here's one more where she's talking about her favorite title, SOT31. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2696.3599999999997s)]
*  Title of mom. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2701.56s)]
*  Just like me. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2702.8399999999997s)]
*  Favorite title. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2703.48s)]
*  Love it. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2704.2s)]
*  I love being a mom. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2704.6s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2705.48s)]
*  I love being a mom so much. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2706.04s)]
*  It's my favorite thing. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2707.08s)]
*  It is the thing where you're like, oh my gosh, I just need a break. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2708.68s)]
*  I just need a minute. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2710.8399999999997s)]
*  I just need a minute. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2711.48s)]
*  And the second you step into the other room, you go, oh, but I... [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2712.04s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2714.2s)]
*  Let me just pop... [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2715.56s)]
*  Let me just... [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2716.04s)]
*  Let me scroll through pictures of them endlessly on my phone. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2716.44s)]
*  And then you just... [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2719.64s)]
*  My husband's like, my love, can you just give yourself a minute? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2720.44s)]
*  Why don't you go work out? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2724.2000000000003s)]
*  Why don't you go take a bath? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2725.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, I know, but I just want to cuddle for... [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2726.36s)]
*  It's the parenting paradigm where it is so full on and I wouldn't trade it for anything. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2729.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2738.44s)]
*  That is nauseating. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2739.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't believe her, first of all. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2741.0s)]
*  I don't believe her either. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2742.84s)]
*  What mother do you know who talks like that? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2743.8s)]
*  I mean, you're a mom. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2745.4s)]
*  You're telling me you have three kids that when they were little, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2747.08s)]
*  you were like, oh yeah, please just be all over me every minute of the day. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2749.8s)]
*  Like I... [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2753.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2753.32s)]
*  And then when they left the room, I immediately had to go to my photo app [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2753.88s)]
*  and look at photos of them until Doug came in. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2756.84s)]
*  Dee, I mean. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2759.2400000000002s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2759.96s)]
*  My love, please go take a bath. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2760.92s)]
*  Or go work out. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2764.28s)]
*  Do you take care of yourself? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2765.32s)]
*  You don't spend enough time at all thinking about yourself, right? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2767.0s)]
*  Like, please, it's self-indulge. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2770.36s)]
*  Just take self-care. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2772.2000000000003s)]
*  What she thinks mothers do. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2773.1600000000003s)]
*  And she goes, oh my God, I just love it. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2775.0s)]
*  First of all, Mom is my most important title. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2777.48s)]
*  So why are we not looking at the credits? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2779.88s)]
*  Meghan, mother of two instead of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2782.28s)]
*  Never forget. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2786.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2788.2s)]
*  We are the Duchess of Sussex first and foremost. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2788.36s)]
*  Sussex now. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2790.68s)]
*  I'm Sussex now. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2791.64s)]
*  Parenting paradigm. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2792.6s)]
*  Also, who doesn't talk like that? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2793.88s)]
*  She said, she's like, I think she meant the parenting dilemma. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2795.0s)]
*  That's what I think she meant. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2798.6s)]
*  She just like takes these garbage words that come out of like C-suite, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2799.4s)]
*  like guidebooks and just like just throws them at the wall. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2803.96s)]
*  Well, didn't she? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2807.56s)]
*  I mean, she's of course overly important and she refuses to drop that Duchess thing. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2808.2000000000003s)]
*  That's everywhere. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2812.36s)]
*  She's very proud of that even though she did absolutely nothing to earn it other than marry the guy. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2813.08s)]
*  But she just came to New York and she was spotted at the Broadway play Gypsy. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2817.2400000000002s)]
*  And she had like a motorcade. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2821.96s)]
*  She had multiple guards. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2824.6800000000003s)]
*  She went in there like she really was Princess Diana [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2826.6800000000003s)]
*  and made sure that got in the paper. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2829.96s)]
*  Of course, here, look at this. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2831.96s)]
*  Look at this motorcade. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2833.08s)]
*  Like she's still an active working royal. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2834.28s)]
*  Literally, nobody would have bothered her. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2837.0s)]
*  We have stars far bigger than Meghan Markle coming into New York and going to Broadway. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2838.6800000000003s)]
*  Presidents go to Broadway without that kind of stuff. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2845.5600000000004s)]
*  And, you know, I was reading like Taylor Swift at most will have like a motorcade of two, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2849.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, people who are far far and again, great environmentalist. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2854.92s)]
*  We've got four huge cars running just for hours on end so she can go backstage [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2858.92s)]
*  at a performance of Gypsy. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2865.2400000000002s)]
*  She doesn't want to be noticed. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2866.36s)]
*  She just she wants her privacy. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2867.56s)]
*  No, she's wearing a loud houndstooth floor length again. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2868.84s)]
*  Like what are you doing? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2871.96s)]
*  And they ate at Polo Bar, which is a wonderful restaurant, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2873.1600000000003s)]
*  but it is not someplace you go if you don't want to be seen. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2876.2000000000003s)]
*  No, and like one of the hardest reservations to get in the city. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2879.0s)]
*  So it's already a flex or a founder. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2881.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2884.1200000000003s)]
*  Those are the two ways in. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2884.6s)]
*  Exactly. I'm sure. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2885.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's also a flex. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2886.52s)]
*  She has to let everybody know first. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2887.88s)]
*  She went to Polo Bar with friends. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2889.32s)]
*  I'd love to see the friends who are the friends. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2891.32s)]
*  Yeah, because they're falling away by the minute. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2893.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2895.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2895.88s)]
*  Who are the friends? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2896.12s)]
*  And then she and we didn't see her with a friend at Broadway either. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2896.92s)]
*  I know they said that she was there with friends, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2900.12s)]
*  but I didn't see pictures of them. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2902.2s)]
*  And some of the ones who I saw like when she got married and they had it was maybe [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2903.72s)]
*  it's her baby shower. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2907.88s)]
*  I think remember the big big where Gail King went. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2908.92s)]
*  Serena. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2912.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2912.92s)]
*  And there was Taryn Toomey who started the class, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2913.4s)]
*  which is an exercise program that I used to do and enjoy. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2918.7599999999998s)]
*  But basically, I'm sorry, bootlickers. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2922.7599999999998s)]
*  It was all bootlickers who are going to be and that's what this woman who she had on [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2925.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=2966.44s)]

*  Okay, before we leave the wonderful world of people's podcasts, Michelle Obama is still [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3082.6s)]
*  at it. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3086.84s)]
*  And in this particular sound bite, she's got thoughts on relationships. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3088.76s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3094.6s)]
*  Relationships are long and there are also ebbs and flows, right? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3095.32s)]
*  So I think sometimes people who date don't realize that in long-term relationships, you're [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3099.32s)]
*  going to have deep, deep dips and you're going to have a bad year. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3105.4s)]
*  You're going to have a bad... [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3109.88s)]
*  I tell people and folks think that this is harsh. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3110.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like you're going to have a bad decade. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3113.56s)]
*  I mean, I've been married to my husband for 30 plus years. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3116.36s)]
*  I mean, the truth is if you add it all up, even the year, if the odds were [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3119.88s)]
*  you're going to be married to your partner for 50 years and 10 of those years could be bad, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3125.32s)]

*  You know, and that's really how it works out. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3135.1600000000003s)]
*  Is it, Michelle? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3140.04s)]
*  It's not. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  I've been married for 17 and a half years and not one was bad. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3142.6000000000004s)]
*  I think she and he married the wrong people. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3146.84s)]
*  I think you're 100% right. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3150.52s)]
*  This is only her third episode. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3152.28s)]
*  I can't think of anybody I would go to for advice less than Michelle Obama. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3154.52s)]
*  She really doesn't know what she's talking about. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3159.88s)]
*  First of all, she loves to tell us she hated Barack for a good decade. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3161.88s)]
*  Please teach me how to have a successful relationship with someone that you clearly [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3165.96s)]
*  respect and admire. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3170.52s)]
*  Every time she's on the air, it's like I'm dragging this ball of dead weight behind me. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3171.96s)]
*  His name Barack Obama. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3177.0s)]
*  He's bringing me down. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3179.48s)]
*  I'm trying to elevate myself with like these things on my head. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3180.92s)]
*  He looks like Mickey Mouse. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3183.96s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3185.08s)]
*  Like the two ears up there, these two big balls on the left and the right of her head. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3185.7200000000003s)]
*  Like what kind of midlife crisis is she in the throes of right now? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3189.2400000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3193.32s)]
*  She's constantly. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3193.88s)]
*  You see the other one where she had the three balls on the back of her head. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3194.36s)]
*  I think it was Benny Johnson was calling it her stegosaurus cut. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3199.64s)]
*  That's what it looks like, like the back of a stegosaurus. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3202.68s)]
*  I think that her... [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3205.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you remember Meghan McCain used to go on The View with those? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3207.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3211.08s)]
*  Everybody's theory was that her styling team, like her glam squad must be working out some [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3211.9599999999996s)]
*  animus towards her because like anyone else... [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3216.4399999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, not for today. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3219.56s)]
*  Not a good idea. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3221.56s)]
*  And she's also Michelle. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3222.68s)]
*  So she's constantly like hitting that wound of like, are we divorcing? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3224.8399999999997s)]
*  Don't be gossiping about us. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3229.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm just trying to be an independent woman over here. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3231.16s)]
*  I hate my husband, but I love my husband. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3233.24s)]
*  When she's not doing that. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3237.0s)]
*  So her brother is her podcast co-host. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3238.4399999999996s)]
*  She's constantly berating him. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3240.68s)]
*  Like every episode. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3242.8399999999997s)]
*  You didn't tell me you were having marital problems. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3243.96s)]
*  Like he has to explain to her a million freaking times. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3246.44s)]
*  Hey, I was trying to work out my marriage and if they did work out and I told you what [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3250.04s)]
*  the problems were, you would hold a grudge against my wife for the rest of your days. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3254.3599999999997s)]
*  Which is real. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3257.96s)]
*  We all know. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3258.9199999999996s)]
*  We all know nobody holds a grudge like Michelle Obama. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3259.48s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3262.2799999999997s)]
*  Every word she says about Barack Obama is negative. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3262.9199999999996s)]
*  I can't think of her sitting there just waxing poetic about him. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3265.72s)]
*  Complimenting he's brilliant. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3270.12s)]
*  He's a great dad. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3272.2s)]
*  He was the greatest president, whatever a normal wife of Barack Obama would say. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3273.88s)]
*  Every time she opines, it's something that reflects poorly on him, how he's insensitive, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3278.44s)]
*  how he's not a talker, how he doesn't know how to relate to people. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3283.72s)]
*  He doesn't keep the same schedule as she does. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3287.08s)]
*  And now we're talking about that. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3288.8399999999997s)]
*  You can have a bad decade in a marriage. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3290.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that's a very unhealthy position to take or to advise other people to gut it out. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3294.12s)]
*  For 10 years of misery. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3300.6s)]
*  I mean, first of all, what that would do to you physically alone. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3301.7999999999997s)]
*  I would never want to sign up for that. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3304.52s)]
*  And secondly, does she not realize that by talking shit about her partner of decades, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3306.2s)]
*  first black president of the United States, she's talking shit about herself. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3312.12s)]
*  Lady, you chose him. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3316.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3317.56s)]
*  And we would never know who you are if it hadn't been for him. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3318.2799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3322.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, I'm sure she would say the reverse. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3322.8399999999997s)]
*  He would never have been president if it hadn't been for her. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3324.52s)]
*  Like she was the inspo. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3326.92s)]
*  She was the strength and the force behind the man. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3328.12s)]
*  But, you know, he was very young. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3331.08s)]
*  We just actually saw a video of him speaking on the campus of Harvard Law School [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3332.52s)]
*  in favor of like more black professors and so on. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3336.7599999999998s)]
*  He still had the Barack Obama orator skills. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3339.48s)]
*  Like he was obviously a star in the making from a very young age. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3342.3599999999997s)]
*  Very young age. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3345.88s)]
*  I'm sure she thinks it's her, but I think it actually was him. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3346.68s)]
*  And some of his ex-girlfriends talk about how he made a choice to align with like this strong [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3350.12s)]
*  black woman as opposed to the white women he'd been dating. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3356.3599999999997s)]
*  And he's half white too. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3359.72s)]
*  Yep. Yep. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3360.9199999999996s)]
*  Right. And it's so like to get him the street cred he needed with Chicago voters where he started. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3361.48s)]
*  And she was it. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3367.0s)]
*  And yet now she's doing a podcast, which we are only listening to, by the way, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3368.6s)]
*  we're not listening to it. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3373.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3374.52s)]
*  Because she's former first lady. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3374.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3376.2799999999997s)]
*  That's the no one listens to a former lawyer from I think it was Jenner and Block [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3376.6s)]
*  do a podcast on with their brother on her thoughts on relationships. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3380.3599999999997s)]
*  We're doing it because he made you first lady, but she does not have a kind word for him. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3384.84s)]
*  He made her famous. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3390.04s)]
*  And aside from the lawyer, didn't she get like didn't Valerie Jarrett give Michelle Obama like [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3391.4s)]
*  a no show administrative job at a Chicago hospital, like 600 K a year while they were [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3398.2000000000003s)]
*  all getting ready. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3403.6400000000003s)]
*  They were all grooming Barack to be president. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3404.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3406.84s)]
*  That young of an age, the Chicago political apparatus knew this guy could go to the White [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3407.88s)]
*  House. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3412.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3413.0s)]
*  So they were like, let's take care of him and let's take care of the wife and like, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3413.48s)]
*  let's make sure everything's seamless. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3416.92s)]
*  I also really do think the root of her rage is that he is a natural star. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3419.48s)]
*  He was born with many gifts that through self-esteem and great education, he allowed [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3424.68s)]
*  himself to cultivate. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3431.0s)]
*  He allowed himself to achieve greatness. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3432.44s)]
*  She grinds it out. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3435.0s)]
*  She's grinding it out on this podcast. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3437.8s)]
*  You listen to this podcast. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3439.4s)]
*  Why am I listening to this woman bitch and moan and complain? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3440.6800000000003s)]
*  I've got better things to do with my free time. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3443.88s)]
*  You know what else is very clear? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3446.44s)]
*  She has a great speechwriter. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3448.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3449.96s)]
*  She does not have the gift of the spoken word that she's led us to believe she has in these [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3450.84s)]
*  speeches. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3457.1600000000003s)]
*  She can deliver it. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3457.88s)]
*  She clearly is not writing them. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3459.0s)]
*  She can deliver it. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3460.6000000000004s)]
*  And you know what else? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3461.32s)]
*  So Barack, I think he got his oratorical skills from the churches. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3462.2000000000003s)]
*  He gets a lot of that cadence and the way of bringing a crowd up and then taking them [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3468.6s)]
*  down. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3474.36s)]
*  She, I think, prior to Harvey in the clink, I think he was hooking her up with the Meryl [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3475.08s)]
*  Streeps or her acting coach or whoever and getting her really up there at that level. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3481.32s)]
*  But you're absolutely right because whatever charisma she's able to display at a DNC [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3488.84s)]
*  speech, she can't do it in the confines of it. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3493.88s)]
*  Or even I listen to you, Maureen. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3496.28s)]
*  Long before I ever saw you in person or spoke to you, I was reading you. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3498.28s)]
*  And one of the things that made me fall in love with you just on paper is just how witty [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3503.48s)]
*  you are. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3507.56s)]
*  And I love the acerbic pen against the right people. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3508.36s)]
*  And you're very smart. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3512.36s)]
*  And I've said this to my audience about you when you're not here. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3513.64s)]
*  It's just like you always say something different. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3515.56s)]
*  You don't comment any story with the same talking points that we hear everywhere else. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3517.32s)]
*  And then I meet you in person exactly the same. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3522.04s)]
*  Everybody listens to you. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3524.52s)]
*  Even on the show, you say things even on your tease for the nerve. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3525.32s)]
*  I will be studying it like the collapse of the Roman Empire or whatever it was. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3528.6000000000004s)]
*  That's you. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3532.52s)]
*  You can see it's the same person who is writing and speaking. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3533.0s)]
*  And it's exactly the opposite with her because she's a phony. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3535.4s)]
*  Maureen Cotter Well, thank you for those kind words. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3538.28s)]
*  And yes, I always want to come at something from a different angle, just like you do. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3540.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's not like it's that hard for me. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3543.96s)]
*  It's just like I get tired of hearing the same people parrot the same talking points [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3545.8s)]
*  or the same observations when I'm thinking differently. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3551.0s)]
*  And instead of going, I should shut that off because I think differently. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3554.36s)]
*  I want to express that because I think and suspect that more people than not feel the way I do. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3558.84s)]
*  They just can't say it because now it's not the thing you say. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3565.32s)]
*  Michelle Obama Because they don't have the nerve. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3568.0400000000004s)]
*  Maureen Cotter Exactly. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3570.28s)]
*  But that's with Michelle Obama. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3572.2000000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3574.76s)]
*  There is not an original thought rattling around in that head. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3575.2400000000002s)]
*  She's having conversations that like teenagers have. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3579.32s)]
*  Michelle Obama It's so boring. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3582.2000000000003s)]
*  Maureen Cotter The only person who has fewer watchers and [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3583.32s)]
*  listeners is Chuck Todd and the Chuck Todd cast, which I think might be up to like, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3587.0s)]
*  maybe he's got 2000 now. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3590.92s)]
*  I don't know. We haven't checked in a while. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3592.04s)]
*  But you know, big splash in the New York Times. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3593.1600000000003s)]
*  That day we looked, he had 1400 subscribers. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3596.44s)]
*  It was very sad. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3599.32s)]
*  I mean, he's a host. Meet the press, this guy. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3601.0s)]
*  So speaking of women who think they're all that in a biscuit, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3604.92s)]
*  I haven't gotten you to weigh in on our newest astronauts. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3609.1600000000003s)]
*  And their accomplishment. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3614.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. The latest on these ladies is Martha Stewart. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3616.04s)]
*  God bless Martha Stewart. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3620.76s)]
*  Decided to weigh in. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3622.6000000000004s)]
*  She posted something online. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3624.28s)]
*  Is it a site, you guys? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3626.36s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3628.44s)]
*  There is. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3630.76s)]
*  Okay. There is sound. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3631.2400000000002s)]
*  She posted something online. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3632.04s)]
*  It was basically like, remember this? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3633.1600000000003s)]
*  Because she went up in a flight that achieved zero gravity, which is all they did. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3635.96s)]
*  By the way, she was up there for 30 minutes, not three. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3641.3999999999996s)]
*  Here's some. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3645.56s)]
*  I boarded a Boeing 727 aircraft called G-Force One [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3646.6s)]
*  and experienced what astronauts feel when they reach zero gravity. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3650.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. Cool. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3660.68s)]
*  But here's the caption of what she wrote. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3664.04s)]
*  Hey, we're out. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3666.76s)]
*  Martha Stewart, in case you spaced out, in 2007, Martha has always been ahead of her game. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3671.32s)]
*  This was tweeted out underneath her Twitter account, which has got many millions in the [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3678.28s)]
*  followers. It's a complete troll because everyone's trolling them now. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3681.96s)]
*  And I've got to start with this. We played it the other day, but I love to hear your response [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3687.1600000000003s)]
*  because Gail King is getting very annoyed with the people who don't realize, number one, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3691.56s)]
*  she's an astronaut. And number two, she is inspirational. Watch. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3697.96s)]
*  Please don't call it a ride. That is not a frigging ride. Whenever a man goes up, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3702.6s)]
*  you have never said to an astronaut, boy, what a ride. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3707.32s)]
*  We duplicated the same trajectory that Alan Shepard did back in the day, pretty much. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3710.36s)]
*  No one called that a ride. It was called a flight. It was called a journey because a ride implies [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3715.7999999999997s)]
*  that it's something frivolous or something that's lighthearted. There was nothing frivolous about [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3721.24s)]
*  what we did and the machine that we were on and what it took for the people to get that machine [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3726.2s)]
*  up and running to get us up and get us back down safely. So, you know, I'm very disappointed and [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3732.9199999999996s)]
*  very saddened by it. And I also say this, the what it's doing to inspire other women and young girls, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3738.6s)]
*  please don't ignore that. I've had so many women and young girls reach out to me and men too, by [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3744.8399999999997s)]
*  the way, men too, that say, wow, I never thought I could do that. But I see you doing it at this [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3750.52s)]
*  stage of my life. Who would have thought it? Not me and how inspired they are. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3755.48s)]
*  Sure. Everyone now thinks that they can go up and Jeff Bezos is [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3761.96s)]
*  nipple shaped spacecraft because Gail did it. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3765.32s)]
*  It's still not going to make her anything less than Oprah's best friend. Number one. Number two, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3769.32s)]
*  journeys. It's not a ride. It's a journey. I mean, I thought journey was also now a diminution of [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3774.92s)]
*  sorts. Like isn't journey something we apply to and the new season of The Bachelor? It's like, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3780.76s)]
*  it's a journey. It's self-help. We're on a journey. Thirdly, my favorite thing is so her outrage [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3785.32s)]
*  is in direct disproportion to actual space flight, right? Which this is not, this is like [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3791.48s)]
*  a vanity project. And you know, it's bad when other celebrities come out and mock you. Like [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3797.6400000000003s)]
*  celebrity on celebrity violence almost never happens, but we're witnessing it right now. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3803.4s)]
*  She goes, I think she was talking to entertainment tonight on the red carpet and she, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3808.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, clapping back at her trolls and critics. She says, I mean, the unmitigated [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3813.16s)]
*  Galmick and she goes, when you go to space, when you take that, then you come back and you talk [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3818.36s)]
*  to me about it. You tell me the magnitude of it. Once you, once you, me, the little people like, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3823.64s)]
*  Oh, anybody can do this. Oh, all you have to do is be wealthy or famous enough to befriend Jeff [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3828.44s)]
*  Bezos and his sex doll blow up fiance. Make sure that when you go up there, you can have full glam [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3833.4s)]
*  that Gail's wig alleged is a fixed, that the fake eyelashes aren't falling off in zero gravity. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3841.2400000000002s)]
*  Enormously enhanced boobs don't float off on their own. Don't float off on their own. That [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3848.84s)]
*  Katy Perry, I read, spent more time looking at the camera with her Daisy for her daughter than [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3854.04s)]
*  outside at the moon. Would you please stop it? There was nothing frivolous about this flight, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3860.7599999999998s)]
*  this mission, this journey. Okay. Maureen nothing. Well, what about when, was it Lauren Sanchez? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3864.12s)]
*  They were, they were recording themselves going girl power girl. Like don't make me be ashamed of [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3870.2s)]
*  my gender. Okay. So cringe going, Oh my God, you guys look, we're seeing the moon. Like, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3874.7599999999998s)]
*  guess what? We all see the moon just fine down here. Have you seen the moon rise? Great. You've [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3879.96s)]
*  done it. I'm so special. Wait, we have some of that. Let's watch that. Got it. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3885.56s)]
*  This is not frivolous. This is just what Alan Shepard did. Katy Perry staring at the camera. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3893.64s)]
*  I got you Flynn. Got you. Proud of you. You guys, I will have to tell you, look at the moon. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3904.36s)]
*  That's amazing. Wow. Look at the blue line. Oh my God. The butterfly. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. That's amazing. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3913.88s)]
*  Did Katy Perry ever leave the lens? I don't think so. She's really trying to move tickets, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3928.28s)]
*  which is not happening. It's just like, it's like, this is like end times kind of like, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3933.4s)]
*  you know, the rich and the famous going up on a joy ride into space. Like space colonization is [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3941.0s)]
*  a really serious thing. You know, like it's the future of humanity. Like every visionary will [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3946.6800000000003s)]
*  tell you that every futurist will tell you that. And these three are up there taking selfies and [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3952.28s)]
*  spouting inanities such as take up space, something Meghan Markle would say, take up space, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3958.04s)]
*  but you're in outer space. Like, like comparing yourself to Alan Shepard, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3962.6s)]
*  comparing yourself to heroes who, when they first went into space, weren't sure they were going to [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3965.56s)]
*  like just disintegrate up there. You know, no, that's the thing. They actually use the a word [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3969.56s)]
*  astronaut. You're not an astronaut. You're not an astronaut. You cannot be anything you want, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3974.8399999999997s)]
*  despite what this culture tells you. Here's part of what you were talking about with Gail King [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3979.7999999999997s)]
*  responding to the haters. It's short. Have you been, if you've been, and you still feel that [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3985.32s)]
*  way after you come back, please let's have a conversation. Have you been, so you can't [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3992.76s)]
*  criticize her unless you have been to space for three minutes. It's not like going to Epcot center. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=3998.44s)]
*  Have you been to Epcot center? Give me your Yelp review. I did come back. Okay. So should we get [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4004.52s)]
*  some stripes? Should we get some like laurels for what the, I mean, I can't, I know like you can't [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4009.96s)]
*  understand the profundity of what I went through, but meanwhile, it's like no one really would have [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4015.48s)]
*  been mocking you if you hadn't been so foolish in your behavior up there, your outfit, you playing [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4019.8s)]
*  up your training of two days, learning how to put buckle your seatbelt literally and get in and out [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4025.4s)]
*  of the craft. And then your self-talk when you got back saying things like, I'm so proud of me [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4029.64s)]
*  and I'm an inspiration. I've inspired people, damn it. Men and women. That's the stuff that leads us [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4035.88s)]
*  to, to mock them. And she's on the air like, these are my friends. My friends are making fun of me. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4041.56s)]
*  Well, what does that tell you, Gail? Exactly. What does that tell you? And are they your friends? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4046.84s)]
*  And it doesn't help your sinking morning show, which is like circling the drain. Why are there [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4052.28s)]
*  no questions by the way, as to how an alleged journalist can be so close with one of our [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4058.04s)]
*  foremost billionaires and take a joyride into space and not ask any critical questions or do [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4064.44s)]
*  this in any way that resembles something approaching journalism. Something other than a vanity project. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4070.68s)]
*  Yeah. So she, speaking of that morning show, one of the reasons it's failing is because [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4075.4s)]
*  they have exchanges like this. They had on the actual first black female astronaut, Dr. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4079.24s)]
*  Mae Jemison. It didn't go well. Watch. You heard Amanda Wynn tell me in the interview that she's [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4085.08s)]
*  conducting science experiments on this voyage, which I don't think a lot of people knew. They [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4090.52s)]
*  thought it was just six women going up into space for a joyride. Wait, what do you mean just six [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4094.52s)]
*  women? Well, that's what I mean. That was the criticism. It's six women. That's right. Right. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4098.36s)]
*  But he's speaking to the perspective in some of the narratives that are out there that I was [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4103.16s)]
*  hoping to correct with this interview. And I'm glad that you're here to help me correct that [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4108.2s)]
*  narrative. So explain to our audience why even a trip like this one, all the trips that we take [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4111.88s)]
*  in the space benefit mankind. So it benefits humankind. And I'm going to keep correcting [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4118.6s)]
*  the mankind and the man made and the man missions, because this is exactly what this mission is about [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4125.0s)]
*  is expanding the perspective of who does space. Oh my God. Women have been in space. Men have [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4131.88s)]
*  been in space. Dogs have been in space. Monkeys have been in space. Much of this earth bounds. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4141.16s)]
*  William Shatner has been to space. I think he made less of a deal out of it. Like these people. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4148.44s)]
*  Martha Stewart's been to space. She's been to space. And I also thought like, I think Gail King [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4153.88s)]
*  is having some weird crisis because did you see those images of her before she got on? And she [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4160.04s)]
*  was so nervous. She was like in tears. That's why Oprah was so proud of her because she conquered [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4165.08s)]
*  her fear of flying. Because this is the same thing as flying, I guess. Fear of flying is when [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4169.08s)]
*  you're on the plane and it's making all sorts of weird motions and quick drops and you're scared [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4173.08s)]
*  shitless that your plane's going to fall out of the sky as does happen. In Jeff Bezos, the billionaires [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4178.2s)]
*  gazillion dollar craft that multiple people have gone up and down in with zero incident. I have to [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4184.28s)]
*  say even I would not be that afraid. I'd be like, okay. And I have a fear of flying. Really? Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4189.64s)]
*  But I would be less afraid in Jeff Bezos. Same way as like you're far less afraid when you're on the [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4193.72s)]
*  747 Boeing airliner than you are when you're on the tiny flights. Oh yeah. A little puddle jumpers [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4198.6s)]
*  or sometimes we'll fly private if whatever. I don't know the circumstances. It's not our norm [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4205.4800000000005s)]
*  like Bernie and AOC. Those flights scare me. They genuinely scare me. Every time my mom went, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4210.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm like, I'm never doing this again. Really? Anyway, but on Jeff Bezos' craft, that's really [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4215.64s)]
*  not, it's going up and it's coming right back down. But you're still in space and it's still [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4220.68s)]
*  a new form of travel. I often think of people who started traveling by airplane almost as soon [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4225.32s)]
*  as commercial aviation was invented. That's ballsy. That's ballsy, right? And I think this is kind of [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4230.679999999999s)]
*  ballsy. And I kind of think the demeanor and the behavior of these ridiculous people not withstanding, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4234.92s)]
*  I'm sure Oprah got that invite to go up with Gail because they're like this. And Oprah said no. Well, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4241.639999999999s)]
*  you know, she was there. She was on the ground. With the Kardashians. Right. With the Kardashians. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4245.88s)]
*  Nothing frivolous. Nothing frivolous about this. No. But I also suspect that Kris Jenner said no. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4251.08s)]
*  I think there were lesser tier known celebrities on that flight. And I often also wonder, like, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4257.32s)]
*  so Katy Perry's in this cohort, like what do she and Orlando Bloom have in common with Jeff Bezos? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4264.28s)]
*  Like what are those four getting up to together that has forged such tight knit because like, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4270.92s)]
*  it can't be intellect. Right. Right. Well, we know, I mean, isn't Lauren Sanchez friends with [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4277.32s)]
*  the Kardashians? So that makes sense to me. That makes sense to me. That's who she but naturally [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4282.36s)]
*  choosing to befriend. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. That's an interesting question about what the [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4287.16s)]
*  connections are between these women. And then you had like the also rants of like, somebody who [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4291.5599999999995s)]
*  actually does have some space connection, there was that woman. And then there was somebody else [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4295.5599999999995s)]
*  side who was like more serious person. But we don't know their names, because who cares? No, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4299.88s)]
*  we don't. Lauren Sanchez and Gail and Katie, who stole all the airtime and then kissed the ground [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4303.32s)]
*  when he came back like they had just gotten off like, you know, man, the challenger. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4309.4s)]
*  Okay, moving on from them. For now. I mentioned AOC and Bernie, we've got to spend a minute on them. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4314.5199999999995s)]
*  They're literally on a stop the oligarchy tour. And it turns out the free beacon reporting and [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4319.16s)]
*  others now confirming they're taking a private jet from place to place. It broke first within the I [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4323.639999999999s)]
*  think it was the post showing AOC was flying first class on one of the legs. I guess that was [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4329.4s)]
*  because she was leaving Bernie and the jet. But they have spent he spent I guess it now comes up [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4333.799999999999s)]
*  over a couple million dollars from his campaign in 2020 on private jets. And they spent like [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4339.879999999999s)]
*  $221,000 on private jets going from place to place to bash the rich Maureen. It's perfect. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4344.92s)]
*  I love it. I love the continued implosion, the hypocrisies. You know, apparently democracy is [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4353.72s)]
*  dying. But god damn it, AOC and Bernie are gonna fly private or first class. Don't you dare put [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4360.84s)]
*  them back in coach with the rest of us. I love these sort of self appointed for so I also just [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4369.24s)]
*  love that like, people are talking about AOC is the future of the Democratic Party. I really think [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4374.52s)]
*  it would happen by now. Like her message is very, it's very specific. It's very niche. It's not [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4378.44s)]
*  realistic. That's what James Carvel saying. He's like, we tried the Bernie thing twice and failed. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4384.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's not it's not gonna work. And then people see this and everybody who pays the slightest bit [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4389.32s)]
*  of attention knows that AOC origin story is completely false. She is a very well off girl [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4394.679999999999s)]
*  from like Westchester, New York, had a great education. This is the kind of stuff again, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4399.879999999999s)]
*  when people can barely make their weekly grocery runs without trying to rob Peter to pay Paul in [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4406.04s)]
*  their own bank accounts, you see this stuff, and you immediately tune out. I cannot believe [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4412.84s)]
*  what you're saying. You get already rich multimillionaire celebrities like Gail King [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4418.360000000001s)]
*  saying I'm inspirational. I am inspiring. Well, you know what, they don't feel inspired by you. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4422.360000000001s)]
*  They're worried about paying their bills. If you have to tell people that you're inspirational, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4427.320000000001s)]
*  Okay, so that's her. And then you've got AOC and Bernie bashing the rich as they clearly are them. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4431.16s)]
*  And yes, you're right, like actual people are looking at this and recoiling. But AOC's fake [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4437.24s)]
*  origin story came up recently. I got this from Adam Carolla on whose show I went recently. And [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4443.32s)]
*  he played the soundbite and my jaw dropped because listen to her talking about her own bio. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4448.28s)]
*  Because when the system is stacked against you, it's hard to feel like anything you do matters. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4453.24s)]
*  It's hard to feel like we matter in this democracy. And it is easy to give in to the despair. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4460.92s)]
*  And I can tell you, I know that when I was waitressing and struggling to put food on the [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4468.44s)]
*  table for a while there, I did. I tried to stop caring. I tried to just keep my head down, work [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4473.72s)]
*  my shifts and accept that this is just how things are. But that is no way to live, Arizona. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4483.0s)]
*  It's no way to live. What I do know is that we don't have to live like this. And in fact, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4492.28s)]
*  we cannot live like this anymore. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4502.04s)]
*  Okay. AOC grew up in Westchester, as you point out. She attended Boston University, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4506.2s)]
*  where she double majored in international relations and economics and graduated with [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4514.679999999999s)]
*  honors. She then moved back to the Bronx, reading here from Wikipedia, became an activist and worked [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4519.799999999999s)]
*  as a waitress and a bartender. So she wants us to believe that after she got her degree in honors, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4524.92s)]
*  double major at Boston University, she struggled to put food on the table, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4530.36s)]
*  leaving open the only question of whether she meant she actually physically struggled to put [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4535.0s)]
*  the food on the table as a waitress or whether she actually wants us to believe she couldn't eat, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4538.839999999999s)]
*  notwithstanding her well-off background. And somehow she dug up the tuition for BU, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4545.48s)]
*  which I'm going to gather was probably 40, 50 grand a year. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4550.28s)]
*  Well, we never hear her talk about student loans, do we? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4553.639999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4556.2s)]
*  So her parents clearly financed that four-year ride. The only thing that really shocks me about [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4556.68s)]
*  that little clip you played is that she didn't code switch into her working class, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4561.96s)]
*  Latina accent, which working people love nothing more than when you pander to them. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4566.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4570.84s)]
*  And I also think this is such a toxic, bad message for people. We live in a meritocracy. It's what [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4571.400000000001s)]
*  makes America great. You can start from nothing and build your way up through dint of hard work, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4577.72s)]
*  determination, fair amount of luck, but really you can do or become anything you want. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4584.2s)]
*  And she's spouting the message that this country is stacked against you and that you are fated [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4591.32s)]
*  to be nothing or to be less than the things to which you aspire. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4598.84s)]
*  I don't get why the Dems think that this is a winning message. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4603.32s)]
*  She talks about her time waitressing like she was poor and panhandling and, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4606.679999999999s)]
*  you know, was almost on skid row. There are a lot of us waitress. A lot of us did blue collar jobs [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4613.32s)]
*  when we were young and in our twenties, like she was. I was a telemarketer for like a year. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4618.92s)]
*  And by the way, I was amazing at it. I really had a career there. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4625.32s)]
*  Was that where you were like, I could do bragging? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4628.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. I know I was, I used a fake name. That's what made it easy. I called myself Rachel [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4630.2s)]
*  and I was really good. I did it for summer and then I kept it rolling for a while. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4635.08s)]
*  But I don't talk about it like I was in the dregs and almost didn't make it and couldn't eat. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4639.08s)]
*  I could barely put food on the table. I was poor. I was putting myself through school. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4644.76s)]
*  My mom helped me with my, sadly, my dad's insurance money after he died with college. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4649.8s)]
*  But I paid for my own law school and I paid for part of my college. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4654.04s)]
*  And I don't talk about it like I was like this lowly person who could barely pay her bills. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4657.0s)]
*  Yes, I was very much in debt and I was doing a blue collar job to pay the bill. Who cares? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4662.44s)]
*  Everybody's got that story. Doesn't make you special. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4667.24s)]
*  In her mind, it makes her special because she, that's the one thing that she, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4670.2s)]
*  I think that's the one part of her bio that she thinks gives her bona fides with the working class. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4674.44s)]
*  I waitress, she makes it sound like she was in some hell hole dive bar. It would be like you [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4679.96s)]
*  telling the telemarketer story. Like you're in a third world call center. You know what I mean? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4684.28s)]
*  Like I worked retail. Like I don't, it's not a badge of honor. It's like what you do when [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4689.08s)]
*  you're a certain age and you've only certain, you've no experience. You've got only certain [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4694.2s)]
*  jobs open to you. You take them. That's it. Literally our 15 year old son has been working [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4698.12s)]
*  as a bus boy, which you're allowed to do. And it would be like him who comes from an, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4703.16s)]
*  obviously a family of privilege going out there and being like, I struggled to put food on the [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4708.28s)]
*  table as a bus boy when I was working as a bus. It's like, okay, but who do you think you're [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4713.24s)]
*  kidding? And now it's good. We love that he's working as a bus boy. You know, we think it's [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4718.84s)]
*  teaching him a lot of important lessons, but he would never talk about it like this. And she [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4722.2s)]
*  should stop talking about it. And Bernie should stop railing on the rich as he boards his private [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4726.12s)]
*  bombardier, whatever jet that talks about how it's got extra wide, a mid cabin and long legs, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4731.4s)]
*  seating, leather seats, and probably some flight attendant on board it too. Waiting on him, hand [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4740.12s)]
*  and foot, please just stop it. Okay. Got to keep going. There's a lot to get to because we spent a [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4745.4s)]
*  lot of time on Megan was worth it. I really want to talk about, oh, okay. I have to take a quick [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4751.08s)]
*  break. And when we come back, we've got to talk about what happened in the Carmelo Anthony case [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4757.5599999999995s)]
*  yesterday, where this is the guy, the 17 year old who's been accused of killing this Austin Metcalf, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4760.92s)]
*  another 17 year old. He reportedly admitted it. I mean, they called him alleged. He said, it's not [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4766.44s)]
*  alleged. I did it. But he's reportedly getting ready to argue self-defense. Okay. That we all, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4770.92s)]
*  we knew all that. Then his family spoke at a depressor yesterday, which you know, if you [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4775.64s)]
*  listen to the AM update that we offer every morning on our feed, 15 minutes or less, you'll [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4779.64s)]

*  now is this is weirdly breaking down along racial lines because Carmelo is black. The kid he killed [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4933.96s)]

*  see what happens, something like that. And as he was doing it, he was reaching into a bag and [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=4996.919999999999s)]
*  Austin Metcalf did put hands on him and tried to make him get out of the seat. And he stabbed him [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5003.4s)]
*  through the heart with a knife that he had in that bag. It's absolute. It's just a depraved act. It's [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5009.08s)]
*  a depraved act. I don't know what's wrong with the family he grew up in or with him. His mother was [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5015.879999999999s)]
*  there yesterday and interestingly was saying that this is a close family, that it's a two parent [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5022.28s)]
*  family, that it's a God fearing family claiming he's a good boy. I don't know. I saw pictures of [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5027.96s)]
*  him online with the gun and middle finger and trying to look like a badass kind of tough guy. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5034.2s)]
*  So I'm not sure what this guy was going through, but there's no mystery who did this. It was, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5041.8s)]
*  it was him. So they hold this presser. And first of all, Maureen, they hire this guy who he's not [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5045.8s)]
*  their lawyer as near as I can understand. There's a different guy is a lawyer. He's a minister, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5051.8s)]
*  quote unquote, using that term generously, who's had a long list of trouble with the law in his [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5055.4s)]
*  own right, including the fact that we read this in AM update, but he was convicted of causing [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5062.04s)]
*  serious bodily injury to a two year old child. It was his girlfriend's son. He was babysitting. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5071.799999999999s)]
*  He called the girlfriend at 11 PM. This is a spokesperson for the family called the, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5079.5599999999995s)]
*  the girlfriend at 11 PM told her to get home now. Didn't tell her why when she arrived, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5084.12s)]
*  her child was unresponsive. He told the girlfriend he'd been watching a movie and her son [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5087.64s)]
*  just fell off the couch. He fell off and onto the carpet, but they brought him to the doctor, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5092.04s)]
*  to the emergency room. He wound up going to the ICU. The doctor said, these are lies that the son [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5098.36s)]
*  had a subdural hemorrhage between the two halves of his brain at the back of the brain. He also had [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5106.12s)]
*  retinal hemorrhages in both eyes. Quote, the severity of his injuries is not consistent [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5111.48s)]
*  with rolling off the couch. The investigative officer reported the doctor saying without more [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5116.36s)]
*  adequate history of trauma, complainants injuries are more consistent with abusive head trauma and [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5121.08s)]
*  child physical abuse. This guy again, still on the spokesperson, the prosecutor read two, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5125.4s)]
*  two statements from him. Dominique Alexander is his name. He signed the first one. He claimed the [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5130.759999999999s)]
*  child had fallen off the couch. The second he admitted to shaking the child. He was charged [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5135.5599999999995s)]
*  with a first degree felony and that resulted in a conviction. Then it went on from there. He also [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5139.4s)]
*  faced assault charges against the girlfriend, charged with one felony, one misdemeanor. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5147.24s)]
*  After he allegedly shoved and attempted to strangle his girlfriend, who accused him of pushing, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5153.0s)]
*  choking and headbutting her during several altercations, like so many women do, she ultimately [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5158.759999999999s)]
*  decided not to testify or participate in the case against him. And therefore it went away. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5164.12s)]
*  So this is the man we're about to listen to. So, you know, this is who the family has chosen to [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5169.4s)]
*  represent them to try to set the record straight on this horrific crime. And he went out there and [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5175.32s)]
*  the first thing he did was he saw Austin Metcalfe's dad, Jeff had shown up to the presser whose first [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5182.04s)]
*  reaction after his son was murdered was to say, I forgive him. I forgive the kid who did this. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5190.2s)]
*  And he went to hear what they had to say at this presser. And here's how [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5199.16s)]
*  Dominique Alexander, the man I just read you about, handled it. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5202.92s)]
*  What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5207.4s)]
*  of the father being at this press conference, is a disrespect to the dignity of his son. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5213.5599999999995s)]
*  Is that was disrespectful and just shows you all the character [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5221.0s)]
*  who was not invited. He knows that it's inappropriate to be near this family, but he did. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5231.8s)]
*  And so I say to people, actions speak louder than words. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5241.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. What he has failed into is the political operatives that want to make this thing [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5245.48s)]
*  a political thing of hate, yet bigotry and yet racism. We have conservative operatives [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5256.36s)]
*  that have been posting nonstop. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5266.12s)]
*  And he went on to say later that these political operatives are who led to the father being here, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5268.68s)]
*  political operatives motivating this family with hate. And the father was thrown out. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5277.72s)]
*  The cops had to come. He didn't want to leave. He wanted to hear what they had to say. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5286.360000000001s)]
*  Of course he did. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5289.56s)]
*  And they threw him out with cops. That's despicable. That man is despicable. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5290.200000000001s)]
*  And then the family running out there trying to make themselves the victims, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5296.6s)]
*  which is what they did. The mother got up and gave a big sob story about how hard this has been [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5299.64s)]
*  for her, are missing the point entirely. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5304.52s)]
*  Nobody had more right to be at that press conference than Austin's father. Okay. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5310.92s)]
*  You're holding a press conference. First amendment. Anybody can be there. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5317.96s)]
*  Tell me if I'm wrong. Secondly, this guy is a loss leader for this family who is doing themselves [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5325.24s)]
*  no favor talking on their own behalf. He said in that presser, actions speak louder than words. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5330.2s)]
*  Well, sir, the guy you're defending stabbed a 17 year old in the heart to death at a football game [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5337.24s)]
*  over a seat. So yeah, I guess actions do speak louder than words. Keep talking, keep talking. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5344.2s)]
*  And that this family doesn't have the foresight to cut this guy loose after knowing what we [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5349.96s)]
*  know about the serious and your fatal injuries to a small child. Are you kidding me? Yeah. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5354.04s)]
*  This is like the poor man's Al Sharpton. Yeah. Right. That's obviously what this is. They [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5360.04s)]
*  obviously couldn't even get Al Sharpton who that tells you a lot. Go to the opening of an envelope. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5364.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, he'll run toward any racialized crime you've got. Yeah. So obviously he turned this one down. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5369.48s)]
*  That's my suspicion. And they got this basement barrel version of the already rather low Al [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5374.36s)]
*  Sharpton just to represent them, I guess. And look, it's not that I want to see the mother, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5380.52s)]
*  either set of parents get harassed here because it's the kids. It's the kid who is accused of [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5386.84s)]
*  misbehaving, but she needs to keep some perspective on what Austin Metcalf's parents [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5392.76s)]
*  are going through. That's where my sympathy lays. Here's, here she is the mom of Carmelo Anthony. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5398.92s)]
*  In wake of this tragic incident, our family has been under attack. Whatever you think [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5405.48s)]
*  what happened between Carmelo and the Metcalf boys, my three younger children, my husband, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5412.2s)]
*  and I didn't do anything to deserve to be threatened, harassed, and lied about. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5419.24s)]
*  The lies and false accusations that have been said about us, especially over the past week, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5426.68s)]
*  has been overwhelming. The lies and their amplification put my family in danger. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5433.0s)]
*  My husband had to take a leave of absence because he's afraid what may happen to our family. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5439.24s)]
*  My, his mental health is deteriorating day by day. We have endured death threats. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5446.759999999999s)]
*  My 13 year old daughter is afraid to sleep in her own bedroom because she's fearful of what might [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5453.56s)]
*  happen to her. I'm sorry, but that is as a result of what her son did. The first thing out of her [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5465.88s)]
*  mouth should have been about the victim. Really, really should have been. I think the other thing [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5474.120000000001s)]
*  that struck me about that statement she gave was its passive language. This tragic incident, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5479.4s)]
*  it's not a tragic incident. It was an aggressive, fatal act taken by your son that took the life of [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5486.839999999999s)]
*  another 17 year old. You have to, like, it's all about owning stuff in this culture. Why can't you [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5494.28s)]
*  just own? I'm sorry. And also don't they live in a gated community right now? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5500.36s)]
*  Right now, yes. So they have reportedly, according to the Daily Mail, moved into a $900,000 home where [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5504.120000000001s)]
*  they're being allowed to stay by somebody in a gated community while they scream racism. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5510.68s)]
*  While they're waiting on 500 grand to become liquid from their GoFundMe or whatever? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5515.96s)]
*  Yes. And while their son, who the vast majority of defendants in Texas would be in jail without [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5519.96s)]
*  bond right now, but he's out on bond, got it lowered, some female judge lowered it and said, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5524.52s)]
*  okay, I'll let him stay at home on house arrest in his million dollar friend's home, I guess. I [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5531.32s)]
*  don't think it's theirs. And while they're screaming, we're all racists because that guy [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5535.88s)]
*  speaks for them, that Dominic Alexander guy. And he was out there, okay, the mom's talking about [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5539.799999999999s)]
*  poor me, poor us. And here's more of Alexander who blamed everybody. He blamed the weather, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5544.92s)]
*  the school should have canceled the track meet because of the weather. They were under tarps. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5549.799999999999s)]
*  He blamed Trump. Here, listen to him in slot 25. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5553.96s)]
*  Black people in America, while the current occupant sits at 1600 Pennsylvania, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5556.68s)]
*  black people in America don't have to pull the race car. It's what we live as a reality every [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5566.360000000001s)]
*  day. It's what we have to teach our children. We don't want to, but we have to. We don't like to, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5573.56s)]
*  but if we want to sleep at night, we got to. I ain't pulling no race car. I live it. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5584.12s)]
*  I'm reminded all the time that I'm a black man in America. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5592.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, but he's not playing the race card. If you look at that, say you have no context for what [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5597.639999999999s)]
*  happened. You just got off a plane from overseas and you're looking at that. I would assume that [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5602.2s)]
*  that couple lost their child in a violent act perpetrated by a white kid. That's what I would [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5608.36s)]
*  assume. Me too. The nerve of him to go out there and rail about racism in America. What are you [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5615.639999999999s)]
*  talking about? There is no dispute. There's no dispute that Carmelo Anthony stabbed Austin Metcalf [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5622.759999999999s)]
*  in the heart with a knife while not being threatened with any sort of weapon himself. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5631.48s)]
*  The worst Austin Metcalf did from every report we've seen, I haven't seen a thing from Carmelo [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5637.16s)]
*  Anthony's side saying differently was he laid hands on Austin Metcalf and the law of self-defense [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5641.88s)]
*  does not allow you to respond to non-lethal force with lethal force. That's just the law in all 50 [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5648.04s)]
*  states. If you pull a fist on me, I cannot pull a knife and plunge it into your heart. That's not [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5654.44s)]
*  what the law of self-defense allows. It has to be proportional. Megan, do you think? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5660.44s)]
*  That were the roles reversed and Carmelo was the one stabbed in the heart fatally and Austin [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5666.36s)]
*  had survived and was charged with this crime that he would get turfed out on house arrest with a much [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5673.5599999999995s)]
*  lower bail. Oh, Al Sharpton, Ben Crump, they'd all be down there. We'd be watching nonstop coverage [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5679.719999999999s)]
*  of what a racist country we are. They're already trying to turn Austin Metcalf with zero, zero, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5688.36s)]
*  evidence into a white supremacist down there to try to turn the tables. This guy, Carmelo Anthony, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5695.24s)]
*  has raised half a million dollars in this give, send, go account from people who have the most [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5699.72s)]
*  vicious anti-white comments you ever want to read on the internet, just somehow presuming it must [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5705.400000000001s)]
*  have been the fault of the victim. Meanwhile, look, I'm open-minded to what he may have done. Tell me, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5710.92s)]
*  what did he do? I've read the police report. Nothing. There's nothing even alleged in there [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5716.6s)]
*  by any eyewitness other than that he did place hands on him to eject him from the tent under [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5721.0s)]
*  which they were sitting. That sounds like teenage behavior to me that in no world is a justification [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5726.2s)]
*  for lethal force. And here is what a truth teller, this Dominique Alexander is, listen to him [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5731.96s)]
*  railing about the criticisms against them. He's mad. People are noticing that they have $500,000 [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5740.68s)]
*  that there, there was a report they used it to live in this $900,000 house, which apparently [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5746.68s)]
*  is not true, or at least he says it's not. But listen to the errors in this statement alone, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5751.0s)]
*  Sat 24. And now that the public knows exactly what is going on, I ask because these racist bigots [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5755.64s)]
*  try to prevent us from standing up for our baby, our boy, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5767.400000000001s)]
*  he should be afforded the same rights that Cal Riddenhouse had, Daniel Pena, and all of the people [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5771.32s)]
*  who have claimed whatever their defense was, he should be afforded the same right. Nobody in the [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5783.16s)]
*  public media has one video camera, but we got the video of Cal Riddenhouse with an AK-47 shooting [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5790.5199999999995s)]
*  three people in the back. We got that. And he raised more than $2 million publicly and nobody [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5797.0s)]
*  says anything. That didn't happen. Kyle Riddenhouse didn't shoot three men in the back and he didn't [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5804.36s)]
*  have an AK-47. This is not a truth teller. It's quite clear. And this family stood behind him [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5812.12s)]
*  as he railed about our racism, Trump, being black in America. That's where this case is going. And [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5818.76s)]
*  it's getting incendiary. I mean, people are very worked up over this. I see stuff like this and it [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5826.6s)]
*  makes me so sad. It really more than anything, it makes me angry and it makes me sad because [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5831.0s)]
*  it's pulling this country backwards. It's pulling us so backwards. Anytime. I don't know about you, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5835.96s)]
*  but like anytime I interact with somebody who doesn't look like me, I always wonder like, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5841.240000000001s)]
*  do you think I'm bad? Do you think I'm evil? Because of the rhetoric over the past few years [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5845.96s)]
*  has been going on. Like, can we connect as humans? Like, period. I think that if there were some [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5850.36s)]
*  precipitating event, we would know about it by now. He would have better rhetoric to throw at us [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5857.719999999999s)]
*  than this bullshit. And by the way, not for nothing, Daniel Penny escaped like by the skin [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5863.08s)]
*  of his teeth. It was not looking good. And it's because of race baiting like this that assumes [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5868.44s)]
*  that specifics be damned. If you're white, you are a homicidal maniac oppressor against anyone [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5874.12s)]
*  who is dark skinned. That is it. He's trying to OJ Simpson this case, you know, where he's got [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5881.96s)]
*  what appears to be a clear assailant and a clear victim, but the assailant is black. The victim is [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5887.72s)]
*  white and he's trying to play on old racial fears in the country about a racist police system. The [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5894.76s)]
*  police have nothing to do with this. This happened at a track meet in front of dozens, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5902.76s)]
*  if not more people. Carmelo Anthony is the one who took a knife to that event and responded to what [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5907.08s)]
*  otherwise looked like a normal, unfortunate teenage skirmish with lethal force. It's very dark [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5913.88s)]
*  and it's very serious. I do think there's something wrong with this kid, Carmelo Anthony. If he, if, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5921.08s)]
*  if what the facts alleged, if they're true, there's something wrong with him. That's just not a normal [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5926.92s)]
*  way to behave. There's something depraved about his heart and he should be in jail for the rest [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5932.52s)]
*  of his life. And the father, his father had every right to go there and hear what they were going [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5937.240000000001s)]
*  to say about this case and his son who cannot be there to represent himself because of Carmelo [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5941.56s)]
*  Anthony. This is just, you know, it's like, it just infuriates me because you would see the BLM crowd [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5948.280000000001s)]
*  out there exploiting this. And I don't say this in a provocative way, but I mean it. White lives [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5954.040000000001s)]
*  matter too. And Austin Metcalfe's life mattered. Yes. This is just, they're re-victimizing him all [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5959.32s)]
*  over again. They're making the victim, the perpetrator, the aggressor, they're going to [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5968.04s)]
*  racialize this and maybe there is a racial component. I don't know, but we never come at [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5973.08s)]
*  things truthfully anymore. There's zero proof of it. We know that. Listen, what an episode. We usually [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5978.5199999999995s)]
*  start hard and land soft. Today we did the reverse, but it was an amazing two hours. Love you lady. I [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5984.5199999999995s)]
*  love you too. Good luck with the nerd. Thank you. Don't forget to check it out. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Zfvh2GDDE&t=5988.84s)]
