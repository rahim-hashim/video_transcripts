# Media Deems LA Riots “Tiny”, Biles’ Tarnished Legacy, and “Desperate” Aging Celebs, w/Miranda Devine
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show. Anti-ice agitators taking to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=0.0s)]
*  the streets of Los Angeles for a fourth straight night as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth deploys [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=5.28s)]
*  700 Marines to protect federal buildings. Last night, looters were seen ransacking an Apple store, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=11.52s)]
*  a CVS, and the Adidas store you see on your screen right now. They even targeted a local [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=18.16s)]
*  sushi restaurant. Oh, okay. Nothing says, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=26.0s)]
*  F, the man, like targeting the local sushi restaurant. Watch. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=29.52s)]
*  Get them out. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=33.52s)]
*  Yo, stop that shit. Yo, stop that shit. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=35.52s)]
*  We don't do that shit. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=39.52s)]
*  Now we don't do that, bro. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=41.52s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=43.52s)]
*  Hey, hey, now we don't do that shit. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=45.52s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=47.52s)]
*  If you listen really carefully, you can hear them say, no MSG. Get me an ahi tuna. This is ridiculous. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=53.52s)]
*  Yes. Some of the crowd yelled for the looters to stop. Of course they didn't. I mean, LA loves [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=60.4s)]
*  rioting. Like, what is it? They love it. They love to riot. We don't exactly know who this is, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=66.4s)]
*  but we certainly saw a lot of Mexican flags and now Guatemalan too. The post-millennials, Andy [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=72.64s)]
*  Noh, he's been on this program before, reports they broke in, they carried out the cash box, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=78.72s)]
*  they removed the money, and then discarded the empty box in the street. Find upstanding citizens. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=83.44s)]
*  And look at this photo. That's the whole point. We don't know if they're citizens or not. We know [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=89.28s)]
*  many of them are not. Look at this photo. Look at this photo. You got to listen. Okay, listening [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=93.92s)]
*  audience, here's what we're seeing. It's a woman walking down the street in Los Angeles last night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=98.08s)]
*  She's carrying a Mexican flag in her hand while also displaying an American flag that's been sewn [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=102.0s)]
*  together with the flag of Guatemala. It's a half and half. Half Guatemalan, half American. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=107.44s)]
*  That's like a sacrilege. That's like when your Jewish pals get a Christmas tree, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=114.72s)]
*  even though they don't celebrate Christmas. The two don't necessarily jive together, given the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=122.08s)]
*  belief system. You don't take the American flag and sew it together with the Guatemalan flag, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=127.68s)]
*  but that's what we're dealing with out there. We have no idea who these people are. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=133.2s)]
*  Meantime, President Trump has also authorized another 2,000 National Guard troops to the city, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=137.44s)]
*  in addition to the 2,000 he announced over the weekend. California Governor Gavin Newsom, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=142.96s)]
*  still angry about all the help. He'd really prefer to let the city burn, as we saw, obviously, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  with the massive wildfires. He loves to see this city burn. With his state filing a lawsuit [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=156.0s)]
*  yesterday claiming President Trump exceeded his authority and unlawfully infringed on his role [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=161.84s)]
*  as Commander in Chief of the California Guard. Normally, it is the governors who deploy the Guard, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=168.24s)]
*  but it is within the president's purview. By the way, good luck with your lawsuit, because even [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  NPR is admitting that President Trump has this authority. NPR people. When NPR is on the side of [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=180.88s)]
*  Donald Trump, your lawsuit's going down, Gavin Newsom, although given the state of our judges, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=187.76000000000002s)]
*  who the hell knows? Newsom, not the only one opposing the deployment, the help that's being [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=194.16s)]
*  provided to him. You'd be shocked, shocked to learn that MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and Lawrence [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=200.0s)]
*  O'Donnell downplaying the need for the National Guard in the first place, describing the destruction [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=205.12s)]
*  and looting as isolated, affecting only a tiny area. But also, it wouldn't matter how big they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  actually get, no guard would ever be needed. Watch. You know this, but just how isolated and tiny a spot [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=215.76s)]
*  of Los Angeles we're talking about. Downtown Los Angeles, where in the areas where these office [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=223.6s)]
*  buildings are, very few people live anywhere near that. It's not a residential area. And so it is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=228.96s)]
*  this really isolated little spot. I mean, even if these protests were 100 times the size that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=234.88s)]
*  they are, there still wouldn't be an operational reason to bring in active duty troops or federalized [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=243.68s)]
*  National Guard. I mean, it's just, it's not, it's not that sort of thing. He's doing this because [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=250.0s)]
*  he's panicking and thinks that he looks weak and therefore he has to do something that seems strong. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=255.2s)]
*  And it's all because he has no freaking idea how to deal with this politically. And he's absolutely [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=261.36s)]
*  panicking about the, I think, trenchant and joyful and sustainable opposition against him. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=267.52s)]
*  Joining me now, the one and only Miranda Devine. She's a columnist for the New York [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=275.28s)]
*  Post and starting tomorrow, she will be a podcast host too. She's launching her own show called [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=278.72s)]

*  Thanks, Megan. Great to be with you. Great to see you. All right. So why, I mean, in leftist world, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=360.8s)]
*  why would the president be panicking about anything right now? Why would, why would he be in a panic [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=366.8s)]
*  over riots in the street as opposed to just being a law and order guy? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=374.24s)]
*  Well, he's not panicking at all. He's moving forward with purpose and confidence and doing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=379.76s)]
*  exactly what Californians would want apart from people like Rachel Maddile, who is incredible. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=385.76s)]
*  You just listen to her so confidently espousing her view. It's her fantasy imagination of what she [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=392.96s)]
*  thinks this gargoyle Donald Trump that she's conjured out of thin air would think or do. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=402.56s)]
*  It's all just fantasy and she spins it every night to her, you know, dwindling audience. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=409.76s)]
*  Actually, not every night. I think she does it once a week. That's right. Yeah. First 100 days, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  she was complaining because she had to do it every night. But he's not panicking at all. It should be [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=425.12s)]
*  Gavin Newsom who's panicking and he kind of is, you know, Gavin Newsom, daring Donald Trump and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=432.16s)]
*  Tom Homan to arrest him. That's desperate. He just wants to get some attention because [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=439.2s)]
*  his eye is on the prize of 2028. He thinks that he has a chance to become president. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  There's only one side that's in my view playing politics with this. Trump said he'd be in law [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=452.88s)]
*  and order president. He said he would be pro-law enforcement and protect American cities. That's [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=458.0s)]
*  what he's doing. But Gavin Newsom for some reason doesn't want to protect the people of his state [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=463.36s)]
*  neither does Karen Bass. Here's the latest. We played this on AM Update, but it's Harry Enton [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  over at CNN, their data guru, talking about how Trump is doing in the polls when it comes to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=474.48s)]
*  illegal immigration. By the way, you should know that Trump overall has the highest approval rating [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=479.36s)]
*  he's ever had in either term as president. He has no reason to manufacture a crisis or to be panicking. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=484.24s)]
*  He's sailing higher than ever at the moment. So he has zero reason to create drama. And here's [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=492.16s)]
*  further evidence of that, including on immigration. Here's Harry Enton, Stop 15. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  He is in positive territory at plus one point on his net approval rating. Some other polls even [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=522.16s)]
*  have it a little bit higher than that. There is no issue on which Trump is doing so much better [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  than he was in his first term, more than the issue of immigration. No wonder the Times has [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=532.9599999999999s)]
*  written it up the way that he is. Trump is begging for a fight on this because he knows what he's [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  doing so far is working with the American electorate. So are they playing right into his hands, Miranda? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  It just does seem like that. There are polls showing that 75% of Americans want these illegal [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=549.04s)]
*  alien criminals to be deported. And I would say after the last couple of days watching the arson [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=559.28s)]
*  and the riots and the looting in LA, that number will be up to 100%. So look, it's sort of baffling [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  why the Democrats keep doing this to themselves because the last four years of Joe Biden just [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=574.0s)]
*  flinging open the border and allowing millions of people over, including a whole lot of [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=580.8s)]
*  unvetted, unknown terrorists or criminals, allowing the cartels to take charge of the border, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=587.28s)]
*  was absolutely toxic politically for them at the 2024 election. And Donald Trump himself says that [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  that was the main reason that he won the election. And I think that's one reason why his poll numbers [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=603.36s)]
*  on immigration have gone up so much because he had the border under control, got no credit for it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=610.0s)]
*  And now he has a much tougher task because he has to, he's got the border under control. He did that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=616.64s)]
*  very quickly. But he's got all these millions of people that he needs to deport, at the very least, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=622.72s)]
*  tens of thousands of these criminal gangbangers and suspected terrorists that are a sort of ticking [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=629.92s)]
*  time bomb in the country. The local authorities there from Gavin Newsom to Karen Bass to California [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=636.88s)]
*  Assembly men and women are unified, it seems, against President Trump on this. It's amazing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=644.16s)]
*  They're like, let our city burn, let the looters loot. We're good. That's the way we like it out [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=650.56s)]
*  here. It's crazy to watch them. Here's the latest from Karen Bass, the mayor in South seven. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=655.52s)]
*  Karen Bass I just have to say that if you dial back time and go to Friday, if immigration raids [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=660.88s)]
*  had not happened here, we would not have the disorder that went on last night. People in the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=666.96s)]
*  city have a rapid response network. If they see ice, they go out and they protest. And so it's just [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=672.8s)]
*  a recipe for pandemonium that is completely unnecessary. Nothing was happening here. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=680.4000000000001s)]
*  Los Angeles was peaceful before Friday. The problem is that the feds are trying to enforce [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=686.32s)]
*  immigration law. That's the problem, Miranda. It is. I mean, I think what sparked the raid on Friday, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=695.0400000000001s)]
*  we've just found out was that ice was trying to enforce some warrants on some cartel members. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  So these are bad people. They're the worst of the worst. And Karen Bass is just a liar. She's [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=709.44s)]
*  trying to gaslight the public. And the problem is that she is a communist and the Democrats' [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  constituency that they seem to care about more than anyone else is illegal migrants. I guess [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=723.12s)]
*  that's why they brought them in. I guess they're hoping that they'll be voting. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's how it seems because she says outright, like the problem here is that the feds [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=732.96s)]
*  came, ice came to arrest people. And then you've got the LAPD police chief coming out. By the way, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=737.04s)]
*  now we're looking at, it looks like a Tesla Cybertruck with F-U-C-K spelled on it and a [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=744.4s)]
*  Mexican flag off the back. F-U-C-K ice. Yeah, spinning around and around. Anyway, so Karen Bass [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=750.8s)]
*  says the problem is they tried to enforce federal immigration law. And listen to what the LAPD chief [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=758.9599999999999s)]
*  admitted really was kind of the reason why this thing was more challenging than it needed to be [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=765.36s)]
*  for ICE, SOT 9. I also want to be unequivocally clear. The Los Angeles police department does not [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=771.04s)]
*  participate in or coordinate with immigration and customs enforcement on civil immigration enforcement. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=778.0s)]
*  We've said this over and over again, and I can't stress it enough for the people in our community [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=785.36s)]
*  who have high levels of anxiety about this issue that we want everybody to believe and be able to [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=791.12s)]
*  call the LAPD in time of need. If they've been a victim of a crime or a witness to a crime, we need [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=797.76s)]
*  that. So the LAPD won't cooperate with ICE. When ICE comes, they're treated like invaders who are [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=803.8399999999999s)]
*  inappropriately there to do some lawless work as opposed to the ones, Miranda, who are there to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=814.3199999999999s)]
*  enforce the laws duly enacted by Congress and the policy duly written into executive orders [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=820.24s)]
*  and affirmed by President Trump. Yeah, I mean, that's very weak of that police chief. And he's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=827.76s)]
*  like that, I guess, because his boss is Karen Bass and she could fire him any minute. So he just, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=835.44s)]
*  you know, goes along and reads out her prescriptions. It's the same. He has come around. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  That's the problem. That's how any LA or any police chief in any sanctuary city would sound. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=848.64s)]
*  And it has to go against the grain. If they're real cops, it really has to upset them because [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=853.8399999999999s)]
*  the LAPD is trying to deal with all the crime, the new crime, just as has happened in New York [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=859.1199999999999s)]
*  from these illegal alien gang bangers. You know, the pickpockets, the looting, the smash and grabs, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=867.3599999999999s)]
*  a lot of assaults and robbery. They're coming from these gangs and a lot of them are juveniles. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=875.52s)]
*  So the LAPD doesn't like it. And you can see there, they are being attacked and officers are [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=881.04s)]
*  being injured. And you know, if you show weakness, you're going to get what we had in the summer of [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=889.28s)]
*  love in 2020, where it just spreads across the country. People die. Cities and communities are [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=895.92s)]
*  burned. It was an awful period. And the Democrats obviously thought it worked for them politically [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=903.44s)]
*  in 2020 because it helped to get rid of Donald Trump. So I guess they don't have policies. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=911.12s)]
*  They don't have leaders. So this is what they're stuck with, trying to make Donald Trump look bad. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=917.36s)]
*  That's exactly right. It's like, well, how does Karen Bass know that all the citizens of Los [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=923.44s)]
*  Angeles want criminal illegal aliens to be roaming their streets? That's what they want. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=929.12s)]
*  And they object to Trump trying to keep law and order. I know for a fact, that's not true. I know [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=934.48s)]
*  people who are out there who would like to see the restoration of law and order. But to hear these [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=938.88s)]
*  people tell it, you would think the policy is as many immigrants as possible. Please loot our stores. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=943.52s)]
*  Please set cars, including police officers cars on fire. We encourage you to throw cinder blocks [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=952.1600000000001s)]
*  over overpasses onto civilian cars down below. This is the way we would like our city to be run. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=959.36s)]
*  And that's all in the name of this weird leftist ideology that loves illegals and that hates Trump. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=965.44s)]
*  So that's what we're seeing. And now, of course, you get, as we see the videotape of the chaos, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=970.96s)]
*  the old, it's not happening, but if it is happening, it's good. And here's some of the, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=976.08s)]
*  it's not happening. It's also peaceful. It's this is California representative Nanette [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=980.96s)]
*  Baraghan. She's a Democrat. You won't be surprised to hear. Sat 10. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=985.44s)]
*  We don't, we agree that if you're being violent, you should be arrested. You should be prosecuted. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  There is no disagreement on that. I think that's a effort that we can all say. But, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=994.48s)]
*  but this is not what's happening. We are having an administration that's targeting [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=999.2s)]
*  peaceful protests, people that are there to protest. The president is saying the national [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1003.44s)]
*  party. He doesn't like the scenes. He doesn't like the scenes of people peacefully protesting. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1007.68s)]
*  Tell it to the people who had their cars assaulted by cinder block rocks. I'll give you one more. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1014.64s)]
*  This is California representative Judy Chu, a Democrat, and take a listen to her take. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  You have outliers that throw things and looking at fires and cause damage. I believe that the LAPD [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1026.08s)]
*  has this under hand. We do not have to have an actual guard here. We certainly do not have to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1034.3200000000002s)]
*  have the Marines here. This is a manufactured crisis. By the way, Miranda, LAPD said that they [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1040.4s)]
*  were overwhelmed. So like, which is it? Well, look, I think maybe these Democrats are watching too [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1050.72s)]
*  much MSNBC or CNN. You know, it was extraordinary seeing those channels and how they described [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1058.96s)]
*  these violent protests as rallies. They were peaceful. There was nothing to see. And I think, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1068.56s)]
*  again, as it happened in the summer of 2020, it's those citizen journalists or photojournalists who [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1075.76s)]
*  wade into the crowd at great danger to themselves. I mean, we've seen some network journalists get [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1083.36s)]
*  hit with rubber bullets, which is painful, not lethal, but it hurts. But these guys, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1089.76s)]
*  mostly guys, I think, they go out and they post their videos, which are right in the thick of [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1097.1999999999998s)]
*  things. And they show you exactly what's going on. And then Fox is doing it with helicopters and [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  so on. But it is hard and dangerous to get into the thick of things. And MSNBC and CNN don't want [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1111.2s)]
*  to know. They are just quite happy to turn a blind eye, just as they have for the last four years to [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1117.68s)]
*  the crisis at the border and to Joe Biden's cognitive deficiencies. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1124.24s)]
*  Here's what jumps out at me. Even if you've only got, I don't know, 10 law enforcement cars and [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1129.44s)]
*  those self-driving cars burning, let's say, because we've seen LAPD police vehicles on fire, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1137.52s)]
*  let's say we have 10 burning. And we've seen with our own eyes, LAPD and ICE officers getting [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1143.6s)]
*  assaulted with rocks and so on. It doesn't matter because LAPD already said that they can't handle [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1149.52s)]
*  it. And on top of that, President Trump has an obligation to the country to enforce law and order, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1156.96s)]
*  because as you point out, these things have a tendency to spread. And yesterday we played [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1164.4s)]
*  soundbites of Democrats seeming to want them to spread. Chris Murphy was like, I mean, I want them [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1169.2800000000002s)]
*  to be peaceful, but we should be seeing this in every city. And he knows damn well, if they start [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1175.68s)]
*  in every city, they will not remain peaceful, just like they didn't in LA. And so my own take on it [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1180.0800000000002s)]
*  is, is this the worst LA riot we've ever seen? Oh, hell no. Hell no. But President Trump is a [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1185.6000000000001s)]
*  different kind of president who is trying to send a message to the people in Los Angeles and across [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1192.0s)]
*  the country. This shit will not be tolerated. We are done. The days where you can get away with this [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1196.72s)]
*  because of a feckless mayor or governor are over. Absolutely. And also, I mean, maybe they're not [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1202.16s)]
*  the biggest riots in LA history yet, but it's early days. It's only been three or four days. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1210.72s)]
*  You have to nip these in the bud so that they don't spread throughout LA and throughout the [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1217.36s)]
*  country. And you're absolutely right. I think the Democrats welcome this as some sort of a circuit [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1222.08s)]
*  breaker, chaos to interrupt Donald Trump's kind of good luck streak that he's on. And to take the [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1228.56s)]
*  attention away from him, he has completely commandeered the airwaves. Everything is Trump, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1239.1999999999998s)]
*  Trump, Trump. And he's always optimistic and upbeat about how things are going for him. And [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1245.36s)]
*  so I just think it's just like when Kamala Harris, during 2020, she said that these riots will not [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1251.9199999999998s)]
*  stop and they should not stop. Those were the George Floyd riots, which spread throughout the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1261.4399999999998s)]
*  country. I think two dozen people were killed, many injured, many officers badly injured. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1266.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, it was a disaster and it was a disaster for the poorest people [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1274.24s)]
*  in the poorest communities who were the hardest hit. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1278.8s)]
*  Yeah, so well said. You're exactly right. Why should he wait until it gets completely out of [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1282.48s)]
*  control and there's no chance of tamping it down without a massive federal presence? Why not nip [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1286.72s)]
*  it in the bud with a relatively modest number of federal officers? Michael Schellenberger, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1292.6399999999999s)]
*  who is a great independent journalist who ran for governor of California and has been in California, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1298.48s)]
*  I think for most of his life, did a great post on, I think it was his, so it's his substack where I [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1304.88s)]
*  saw it. In any event, it was called The Reason the Left Loves Riots is Because It Hates Civilization. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1310.48s)]
*  And he's of the left, people may remember. He worked for Greenpeace when he was young, this [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1317.2s)]
*  climate activist, and he was one of those people pushing the cylindra green energy programs under [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1322.6399999999999s)]
*  President Obama. And he came organically over to the right or independent center, right? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1329.28s)]
*  But just by seeing how these policies were such failures. Okay, so he knows California and he did [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1334.8799999999999s)]
*  a great, great documentary on the homelessness, the open air drug markets. Like he's been all [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1342.0s)]
*  over California's many problems. And I'm going to read you a little bit of what he wrote. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1347.44s)]
*  To fully appreciate their significance, it's important to understand that over the last [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1353.04s)]
*  several decades, the people who run California and its major cities came to a new consensus. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1356.8799999999999s)]
*  A large number of our laws were racist and oppressive. The idea took root that order [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1361.36s)]
*  itself was a facade, a way for the rich and comfortable to criminalize the marginalized. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1366.8s)]
*  So one by one, Democrats stopped enforcing and weakened laws against drug dealing, illegal [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1372.32s)]
*  camping, prostitution, public defecation, and drug use on sidewalks. Cities stopped enforcing [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1377.68s)]
*  anti-camping ordinances. I can speak to that myself, having stepped over some of these camps [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1384.48s)]
*  just to get from A to B when I was out there last year. State leaders directed prosecutors [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1389.44s)]
*  not to charge certain drug crimes. Federal immigration laws were nullified by city policy. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1395.3600000000001s)]
*  We just discussed that ourselves. In the name of compassion, progressives dismantled the foundations [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1400.48s)]
*  of public order. So well put. Just as I believe the government must obey the constitution, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1406.56s)]
*  I also believe people must obey the law and our leaders must enforce it. And yet California's [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1412.1599999999999s)]

*  neighborhoods, the law is still enforced, writes Schellenberger. In poor and working class neighborhoods, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1426.6399999999999s)]
*  it is not. If you torture a car in Beverly Hills, you are arrested. If you do it in East LA while [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1434.0s)]
*  shouting political slogans, you're engaging in protest. This two tiered enforcement is not [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1439.52s)]
*  progressive. It's segregation by another name. It creates one set of expectations for the politically [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1445.04s)]
*  connected and another for the disposable. And in that framework, working people, especially [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1450.8s)]
*  immigrants, families, and hourly wage earners are abandoned. They're the ones who walk their kids [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1456.64s)]
*  past open air drug markets. They're the ones whose shops are looted and whose cars are stolen. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1461.92s)]
*  They're the ones who call 911 and wait and wait and wait. People sometimes ask me how California [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1468.0800000000002s)]
*  can feel so anarchic and so authoritarian at the same time. The answer is simple. It's not a [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1472.88s)]
*  contradiction. California does not swing between chaos and control. It imposes both on purpose [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1478.16s)]
*  and at scale. As we saw when the leader of China comes to San Francisco, the city leaders end [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1485.04s)]

*  Democrats demanded people show proof of vaccination to enter coffee shops, but allowed addicts to [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1502.0s)]
*  smoke fentanyl on the sidewalk outside. They fined restaurant owners for trying to survive [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1506.96s)]
*  and shut down gyms trying to help people stay healthy. Meanwhile, they decriminalized theft, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1512.1599999999999s)]
*  refused to prosecute open drug dealing, and looked the other way as cartel run fentanyl networks [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1517.2s)]
*  took over entire neighborhoods. He's so right, Miranda. It's state sanctioned chaos [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1522.96s)]
*  and authoritarianism at the same time. So well pushed. And really, I think people on the left to [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1531.2800000000002s)]

*  I mean, I just don't understand the mentality, actually. I would have thought that being [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1555.92s)]
*  competent and showing that you're competent if you're a state or a city leader would be what you [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1562.0800000000002s)]
*  would want so that you could win election. But the problem is that Democrats are winning elections. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1567.92s)]
*  In these blue cities and blue states, they have a stranglehold. There's no opposition to speak of. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1575.04s)]
*  In New York, we've got the mayoral elections coming up. There's a dozen people on the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1582.5600000000002s)]
*  Democrat side all vying for left and left and further left. And there's one Republican, and [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1588.24s)]
*  he didn't do very well last time. And there's just no money for the other side. Once you have [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1596.1599999999999s)]
*  a one-party state, you entrench your power, and therefore you don't have to be competent. You [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1602.0s)]
*  don't have to do the right thing. And your citizens are disempowered and disenfranchised. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1608.24s)]
*  And this is what the Republican Party has learned about power. They control the media, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1614.7199999999998s)]
*  they control the narrative, and they have a sort of an iron control over, I guess, social ostracism. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1620.24s)]
*  Maybe that's because they can cancel people at whim. And Donald Trump is an existential threat [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1630.96s)]
*  to that control because it's the last ditch effort of the public, the populace, to say, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1636.64s)]
*  no, we don't want that. And Donald Trump, for all his flaws, for all the mud that they threw at him, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1643.04s)]
*  he won that election comprehensively, the popular vote, everything, defying all their expectations. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1650.48s)]
*  And that's, I guess, why they're so shocked. But what they should be doing is re-examining their own [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1659.28s)]
*  kind of worldview, as David Brooks put it, and retool. But they're just doubling down on [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1666.08s)]
*  what hasn't worked for them in the past. Sort of like, you know, the Einstein's theory of insanity [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1672.6399999999999s)]
*  doing the same thing over and over and hoping for a different result. That's the Democrats. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1679.44s)]
*  LESLIE KENDRICK It does feel like the soft bigotry of low expectations out there where, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1683.8400000000001s)]
*  you know, the people who live in the poor neighborhoods, minority dominant, you know what? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1688.16s)]
*  They're going to behave like this. You're just going to have to allow it. Like, they need to blow [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1693.76s)]
*  off steam every once in a while. And the ones who happen to be law-abiding, sorry that you live [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1697.04s)]
*  amongst these other people. But that's life, as opposed to Beverly Hills and Bel-Air, where [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1702.3200000000002s)]
*  now we expect more in these neighborhoods. We expect people to behave around our rules of [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1708.4s)]
*  royces. And we will hold anybody inclined to break the law to a much higher standard out there. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1713.68s)]
*  Schellenberger, as usual, nails it. Okay, let's move on. Abrego Garcia is back in the United [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1720.8000000000002s)]
*  States. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, his favorite criminal. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1726.5600000000002s)]
*  He's back. They went and had margaritas, and now he can have margaritas stateside with him [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  because he's back. But he is in federal custody and he is being charged with trafficking. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1737.6s)]
*  So the DOJ, Trump says this wasn't his thing. He says it was Pam Bondi. And she announced on [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1745.36s)]
*  Friday he's back in the US. He's facing federal human trafficking charges in the Middle District [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1750.56s)]
*  of Tennessee, which is Nashville, charged with one count of conspiracy to transport aliens [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1755.04s)]
*  and one count of unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. He faces 10 years in prison. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1759.6s)]
*  They say not only did he transport aliens, he transported children throughout the US in an [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1767.04s)]
*  unsafe manner. He allegedly abused undocumented alien females. He trafficked firearms and narcotics. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1770.8s)]
*  His lawyer says deny, and this is an abuse of power. You're just trying to cover your mistake [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1778.56s)]
*  and deporting him to El Salvador, the one country he could not be deported to. And then on top of [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1783.76s)]
*  this, the government moved to keep him behind bars before trial. And in their motion for [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1788.8s)]
*  pretrial detention, the feds allege that he, Abrego Garcia, Chris Van Hollen's buddy, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1795.84s)]
*  murdered a gang rival's mother in El Salvador. You may remember Miranda that he only got this [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1802.32s)]
*  withholding of removal order. They were deporting him. He had been found deportable, saying, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1812.72s)]
*  get out. But they said, all right, we won't deport you to El Salvador because you convinced [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1817.36s)]
*  the immigration judge that if you go back there, you could get killed. And the way he convinced [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1821.6799999999998s)]
*  the immigration judge of that is he said, I'm going to get killed by this gang. It's like, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1826.7199999999998s)]
*  I can't remember the name of it. It had something. It was the 18th Street gang. They're going to kill [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1831.6s)]
*  me. And the judge bought it. So that was the reason why we could deport him anywhere but not [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1836.6399999999999s)]
*  to El Salvador. And then when we deported him, he went to El Salvador, which by the way was fine [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1842.32s)]
*  because this 18th Street gang has apparently been dissipated. And when the condition of [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1846.48s)]
*  the danger is removed, you can be removed in any event. We've been fighting over this guy who's [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1852.24s)]
*  alleged to be a wife beater and a trafficker now. And what the feds are alleging, not as a claim [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1856.72s)]
*  against him, not as a count against him, but as a reason to detain him pending trial is that [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1862.64s)]
*  he, they say, according to a co-conspirator, the defendant stated on how he got into MS-13. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1868.96s)]
*  He participated in the murder of a rival gang member's mother in El Salvador, specifically [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1878.0s)]
*  the mother of an 18th Street gang member. Later, as part of his immigration proceedings, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1884.32s)]
*  the defendant claimed he could not return to El Salvador because he was in fear of retribution [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1889.76s)]
*  from the 18th Street gang. And he tried to spin this as being about his mother making some sort of [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1893.28s)]
*  food that the gang didn't want her to make because they had like a rival business to it. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1900.96s)]
*  No, what the feds are now saying is he killed one of their moms. That's why he was in fear of his [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1906.8s)]
*  life. This is insane. This is why you should really figure out these people's backgrounds before you [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1912.8799999999999s)]
*  go sip margaritas with them in El Salvador. Absolutely. And before judges go making these [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1917.6s)]
*  bleeding heart decisions. And, you know, also Pam Bondi mentioned that he was, they haven't [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1925.04s)]
*  charged him with this, but they're investigating the allegations that this guy solicited child [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1932.8799999999999s)]
*  porn. So not a nice person. And I think that this was a pyrrhic victory for the Democrats because [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1939.12s)]
*  yes, they did manage to force the Trump administration to underport him from El Salvador, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1946.88s)]
*  but he's now been slapped with all these charges and we can see who he is, who is the poster boy [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1953.7600000000002s)]
*  for the Democrats that they are willing to die in a ditch for. And it's this guy, the worst of the [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1961.5200000000002s)]
*  worst, you know, alleged murderer, alleged wife beater, alleged solicitor of child porn, you know, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1967.7600000000002s)]
*  gun trafficker, drug trafficker, human trafficker, abuser of women and children. I mean, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1975.76s)]
*  you know, does it get worse? So I just again think the Democrats have tied themselves [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1982.8s)]
*  selves to this man. And the more we see of him, the less sympathetic he looks. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1990.8799999999999s)]
*  It's truly, it's insane. Here's Senator Chris Van Hollen, the buddy of Abrego Garcia, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=1996.64s)]
*  on where he thinks all of this leaves us. This is CNN on Friday. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2003.6s)]
*  You know, I will never apologize for defending the Constitution. In fact, it's the Trump [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2007.6799999999998s)]
*  administration and all his cronies who should apologize to the country for putting us through [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2011.6799999999998s)]
*  this unnecessary situation and to Abrego Garcia for putting him through this situation and his [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2017.6799999999998s)]
*  family. All I have said from the beginning is that the Trump administration should respect [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2023.6799999999998s)]
*  the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States. So really, it's President Trump [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2029.9199999999998s)]
*  who should apologize to the country for violating his oath to the Constitution. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2035.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm glad in this moment, they're finally, finally doing what the Supreme Court said, [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2041.1999999999998s)]
*  but they continue Anderson to violate the Constitution in many, many other cases. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2046.8799999999999s)]
*  This. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2051.28s)]
*  Trump should apologize to Abrego Garcia, who apparently, if one word of this is true, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2053.6000000000004s)]
*  came here illegally, then lied to try to stay here illegally about the danger he was in due to [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2061.6800000000003s)]
*  his mother's food business and was rightfully deported back to El Salvador. Now is coming back [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2067.44s)]
*  to face criminal charges here. And Tom Homan said, as soon as that's done, if he serves time or not, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2074.88s)]
*  either way, not guilty or guilty and serves time, he's right back [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2080.88s)]
*  to El Salvador and this moron wants President Trump to apologize to him. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2084.0s)]
*  I know he really is a despicable person and so weak and so pandering and so vain. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2090.08s)]
*  He's there on television day after day, posing as this kind of virtuous, saintly person. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2097.12s)]
*  I guess there are people who believe it and he comforts himself on that. But again, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2104.8s)]
*  the Democrats are just on the wrong side of an issue that most Americans are against. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2111.12s)]
*  Most Americans don't want, in fact, a majority of Americans want deportation of illegal migrants [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2118.48s)]
*  and 75% want these gangbangers deported. So I don't know, their constituency [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2125.6s)]
*  I think what they're trying to do and they're being aided and abetted in this by the media, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2134.48s)]
*  by the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc. Day after day sob stories about these migrants. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2139.84s)]
*  They don't say illegal, they conflate illegal with legal migration and then make out as if [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2146.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is against migrants, which is ridiculous in a country of migrants. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2153.52s)]
*  So everyone's from somewhere and Donald Trump himself, I mean, he's married to an immigrant, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2159.04s)]
*  his mother was an immigrant. He's not anti-immigrant, he's anti-illegal migration [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2166.64s)]
*  that happened under Joe Biden, which was an absolute catastrophe for this country [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2175.2799999999997s)]
*  and is going to take decades to put right. That's so true. It's amazing. So now you've got, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2180.72s)]
*  he wants him to say he's sorry. Van Halen wants Trump to say he's sorry to a guy who [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2187.04s)]
*  now appears to be an illegal, he is an illegal immigrant here, who had a deportation order, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2192.88s)]
*  who staved it off with what appears to be a lie about danger because of his mother's food business, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2199.36s)]
*  who is now accused of trafficking people into the United States, untold numbers of illegals, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2204.8s)]
*  mistreating children in that process, allegedly into kiddie porn. We know from the wife's allegations [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2211.36s)]
*  for protective orders that he's an accused wife beater on top of everything, may have committed [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2217.52s)]
*  a murder in El Salvador of somebody's mother and now we're supposed to feel sorry for him. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2222.8s)]
*  He's the victim and be mad at Trump for deporting him. Got it. Good luck with that message on your [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2228.7200000000003s)]
*  next campaign, Democrats. Okay, let's keep going. The FBI speaking out again, Cash Patel went on [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2234.64s)]
*  Joe Rogan and Rogan really kind of pressed Cash Patel on Epstein. When are we getting the files? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2243.52s)]
*  Are there files? Are we going to see videos? Like, are there celebrities? What's there? Like, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2249.44s)]
*  what's there? And was referring to like the Epstein tapes. Do we have them? Are they a thing? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2255.3599999999997s)]
*  What's happening? And it was a very interesting exchange inside 24 watch. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2261.92s)]
*  But what about the video from the island? Again, we're going to give you [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2266.32s)]
*  everything we can and people have to remember, we're not going to re victimize women. We're not [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2271.6s)]
*  going to put that shit back out there. It's not happening because then he wins not doing it. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2277.12s)]
*  You want to hate me for it? Fine. Again, logical play out. If there was a video of some guy [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2281.28s)]
*  or gal committing felonies on an island, and I'm in charge, don't you think you'd see it? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2289.2000000000003s)]
*  If you have access to it? If I have it, period. If I have it, if I have it. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2297.28s)]
*  So where else would it be? Right. If you have it. Right. But you can't say that you have it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2303.28s)]
*  No, we're giving you everything we have so far. Everything we have so far is that you guys [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2310.88s)]
*  gone over all the video that's available? Yeah, that's what I'm telling you. That's what takes [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2316.72s)]
*  so much damn time. Right. And is there video from the island? Not of what you want. The people out [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2320.3999999999996s)]
*  there have filled the void with can't wait to see x, y or z. Right. Speculation. Now I understand [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2329.2799999999997s)]
*  that you would never re victimize these women and show this footage. But is there footage? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2336.56s)]
*  There's footage. Outside of the only thing I can say right now is [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2343.52s)]
*  if there was ever if there was footage of anyone doing anything else, we would have opened a case. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2352.8s)]
*  What do you make of it, Miranda? What's your takeaway watching that? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2359.52s)]
*  Look, I was baffled actually by that interview. I thought that Cash Patel did not cover himself [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2363.28s)]
*  with glory in a lot of departments, but that in particular was a baffling exchange. He seemed to [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2370.8s)]
*  contradict himself. And look, more importantly, he was contradicting Pam Bondi, the attorney general, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2377.92s)]
*  who has told us, you know, told reporters in a public press conference that there were hundreds [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2384.0800000000004s)]
*  of victims and thousands of hours of video. Let me just play that. Let me play that so they can [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2391.28s)]
*  hear from her directly. It's that 26. There are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2398.16s)]
*  children or child porn. And there are hundreds of victims and no one victim will ever get released. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2406.48s)]
*  It's just the volume. And that's what they're going through right now. The FBI is diligently [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2414.64s)]
*  going through that. Keep going. So there you go. A complete contradiction. And, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2419.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, one of them is wrong. And Pam Bondi seems pretty confident. And Cash Patel is hedging and [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2427.68s)]
*  umming and ah-ing. And sort of everything was framed in, you know, he's asked a direct question, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2434.24s)]
*  are there videos? And then he responds, you know, if there are, or he says, wouldn't I show it to you? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2440.64s)]
*  We're going to show everything. You're not asked whether you're going to show. We don't expect you [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  to show, you know, child porn to the public. But what we do expect is you tell us and say, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2451.84s)]
*  we found these videos. They exist. And we are now opening cases on, you know, multiple abusers. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2459.28s)]
*  I mean, Ghislaine Maxwell is in jail for trafficking. So who was she trafficking to? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2467.92s)]
*  Who were Epstein's clients? Why aren't they in the dock? It's very peculiar. And I don't think [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2475.92s)]
*  that Cash Patel has cleared anything up. All he's done with that Joe Rogan interview was fuel more [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2484.0s)]
*  conspiracy theories. You can see it online. People aren't trusting him. And I don't know how he [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2491.04s)]
*  resolves that. I don't, I mean, I'm not expecting him to tell us something that doesn't exist, but [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2497.6s)]
*  at least be straightforward and answer questions directly instead of all this sort of, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2504.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't know, semantic games. It just didn't ring true. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2512.2400000000002s)]
*  So I see exactly what you see, where he doesn't, he seems to be, we always talk about on the show, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2516.88s)]
*  like a truth teller runs toward the truth. They run toward the facts. They want to talk all about [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2523.6000000000004s)]
*  the facts because the facts are their ally. He's in a compromised position because he's the head of [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2527.6800000000003s)]
*  the FBI and we don't know what he's just not at liberty to reveal. I like, I don't know. So he [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2532.72s)]
*  almost necessarily might be fighting with one hand tied behind his back here. But I will say this [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2539.3599999999997s)]
*  about Pam Bondi. Yes, she sounds confident in that sought, but there's reason to doubt her because [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2543.6s)]
*  she, she's the one who released all those binders to those influencers at the White House. Like this [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2550.24s)]
*  is everything. And it was actually nothing. There was nothing new in there. And when I look at her [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2555.6s)]
*  soundbite, Miranda, I think, all right, she says tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2560.32s)]
*  or child porn. Now those are two different things. Child porn could just be disgusting videos or [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2568.8s)]
*  pictures they may have found on his computer. If that's on there, that's new. We didn't know [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2578.0s)]
*  about that. And that seems like something that they should, and I believe probably will reveal [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2583.44s)]
*  to us if there are actually tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children in sexual acts, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2589.92s)]
*  that is a next level reveal. It is huge. She needs to be really careful with saying that. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2598.08s)]
*  I, I, what I heard, I've told the audience that before I do have a source very close to this case [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2604.1600000000003s)]
*  who has told me that as far as what he did personally, like with his body, with his own [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2609.52s)]
*  sexual interactions, that it wasn't children, young children. It was, however, like the 17 year [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2615.36s)]
*  old who looked very young. And I'm not trying to make excuses here, believe me, at all for [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2622.48s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein. I'm just drawing a distinction. I think we can all agree there is a difference [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2627.92s)]
*  between 17 and seven. And so I just like, we need actual answers there because she's parsing her [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2631.76s)]
*  words carefully. He's parsing his words carefully. And this subject is just too hot to keep us in the [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2639.76s)]
*  dark. Now that Trump has taken over, you know, it's been, I think we'll get answers and I, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2645.6800000000003s)]
*  the sooner the better. Okay. Let's move on. We have not yet talked about the Simone Biles, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2649.76s)]
*  Riley Gaines, incredible assault by Simone Biles out of nowhere on Riley Gaines over the weekend. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2654.88s)]
*  Riley made a post about, I told the audience this last week that Minnesota girls softball [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2662.6400000000003s)]
*  team won the state championship thanks to their hard work and finally overcoming their [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2669.44s)]
*  inability to win it all these years. No, thanks to the fact that they put a boy as pitcher and he, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2674.48s)]
*  he's kept throwing all these shutouts. They basically got no runs off of him in something [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2681.6s)]
*  like 34 innings. It was really hard for the actual girls to compete against him, Miranda. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2685.84s)]
*  So Riley sends out a tweet saying, it's not so surprising when it's a, when it's a boy as your [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2690.96s)]
*  pitcher and Simone Biles comes after her like ripping on her. You're, you're inappropriate. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2695.6s)]
*  You're at a line. You're a bully. Oh, and by the way, pick on someone your own size, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2701.92s)]
*  which ironically would be a male. Simone Biles ripping on Riley Gaines is muscular nature. Riley's [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2706.08s)]
*  only five, five. So it can't be that she's like some six foot six man. So it's obviously Riley's [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2712.24s)]
*  muscular arms and body, which she looks amazing. And Simone Biles for years has been playing the [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2718.56s)]
*  victim because people she says have been ripping on her muscular body. She was body shamed about [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2726.16s)]
*  it. She was all about body positivity, except when she's on offense, in which case it's totally fine. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2734.08s)]
*  She hasn't apologized for it. She hasn't taken it down. Simone Biles is absolutely fine with body [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2740.7999999999997s)]
*  shaming. So long as it's of somebody who's of a different political persuasion than she is. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2746.88s)]
*  Your thoughts? Yeah, I mean, it's just terribly disappointing. She was America's sweetheart for a [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2753.36s)]
*  time. She just managed to destroy her reputation in a couple of days with these really, I mean, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2760.96s)]
*  vile Biles. That's the only way you can think of her now. She's shown her true colors. And she did [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2768.56s)]
*  this other stupid little video on social media after she and Riley got into these two and froze [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2775.6s)]
*  of just herself cackling in this malevolent way. I mean, it's as if she's lost her mind. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2782.96s)]
*  Everyone loved her and there is no reason for her to have attacked Riley Gaines like that. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2791.12s)]
*  And as you say, so hypocritical to the body positivity role model trying to shame Riley [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2796.96s)]
*  Gaines for, I don't know, some weird reason because as Riley Gaines showed, she did her own video [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2806.08s)]
*  showing how tall she is. And as you said, she's a petite woman. So certainly the swimmer, Leah [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2812.08s)]
*  Thomas, William Thomas that she competed against and lost to was like six foot tall, enormous. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2820.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. She tied him. That's what Riley was saying too. She was, everybody's always like you, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2828.96s)]
*  you're just bitter because you lost. Here's the Simone Biles tweet. She always points out she [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2833.76s)]
*  tied Leah Thomas. This is Simone Biles. You're truly sick. All of this campaigning because you [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2837.6s)]
*  lost a race. So again, she's wrong. Straight up sore loser. You should be uplifting the trans [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2844.16s)]
*  community and perhaps finding a way to make sports inclusive or creating a new avenue where [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2849.76s)]
*  trans feels safe in sports. Maybe a transgender category in all sports, but instead you bully [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2854.2400000000002s)]
*  them. One thing's for sure is no one in sports is safe with you around. Here's the other galling [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2859.6800000000003s)]
*  part of it. It is not Riley Gaines' responsibility to find a new lane for trans athletes. She is not [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2864.8s)]
*  an administrator of sport in any way, shape or form. She's been standing up for women's and girls [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2875.6s)]
*  rights. I love these people who look at anybody who objects and say, you solve it. Like Riley [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2882.4s)]
*  Gaines is the head of the IOC or the head of women's swimming. She would love, she would love, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2889.2s)]
*  I'm sure to create new rules. No one's empowered her to do that. Simone Biles hasn't taken the [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2894.64s)]
*  mantle at all. She just wants to rip on somebody who's pointing out a very real problem that's [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2899.36s)]
*  led to a lot of young girls getting hurt. Yes. I mean, she doesn't care, Simone Biles, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2905.04s)]
*  about other women. Riley Gaines has a young sister. She's concerned about her. We've seen [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2912.0s)]
*  numerous female athletes get hit in the face and suffer serious injury because they are competing [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2920.08s)]
*  against men who are stronger. It doesn't matter if you've taken some estrogen, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2928.72s)]
*  in the womb, your male hormones that you are washed with and your body soaked up have created [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2934.8799999999997s)]
*  stronger muscle mass, et cetera. We know that. It's not a mystery and you can't change it with [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2942.16s)]
*  cosmetic procedures and hormones. It's just cheating and it's going to obliterate female sport. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2949.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, revolution of Donald Trump is he just came in and so quickly the opposition [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2959.4399999999996s)]
*  melted away the whole, you know, trans activism. People were no longer afraid to speak up and they [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2966.3999999999996s)]
*  spoke up and, you know, he gave women and girls, he enacted, had an executive order that he signed [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2972.56s)]
*  to keep men out of women and girls sport. And that's sort of gone without a hitch. The American [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2979.7599999999998s)]
*  public was with him all along really. And there's just these few virtue signalers in the, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2985.76s)]
*  you know, in the public like Simone Biles. Simone Biles, I interviewed her when I was at NBC. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=2994.4s)]
*  We talked about the abuse she suffered at the hand of Dr. Larry Nassar. And I use that term [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3000.5600000000004s)]
*  doctor very loosely, who's now in prison for the rest of his life for what he did to our USA [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3005.5200000000004s)]
*  gymnastics team, molesting them over and over and over while he was supposedly just performing [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3010.1600000000003s)]
*  physical exams on another young girl. Yeah, exactly. Young girls who were confused and [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3015.04s)]
*  didn't understand what was happening to them. And Simone Biles was one of them. And many of [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3020.56s)]
*  us provided appropriately nothing but sympathy to her for her experience at the hands of a very [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3025.92s)]
*  pernicious man. But now she's totally fine with men going into women's locker rooms, watching them [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3032.16s)]
*  undress. And by the way, men like Will Thomas, who now goes by Leah, I strongly believe are [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3040.56s)]
*  autogynophiles. And the data show that the vast majority of these so-called trans women, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3047.7599999999998s)]
*  which are men pretending to be women, are autogynophiles, meaning they get off, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3052.32s)]
*  they get sexually aroused, undressing like a woman. So why should girls have to be around men [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3056.7999999999997s)]
*  who are getting off on putting a dress on or a female swimsuit on while they're taking off [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3063.52s)]
*  their clothes? Simone Biles, you know nothing. You know only about your own circumstances. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3069.2s)]
*  Take two minutes to do a little research or other little girls are going to get hurt, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3075.4399999999996s)]
*  just like you did. Shame on her. I'm ashamed of you, Simone Biles, ashamed of you. You have a [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3080.3999999999996s)]
*  chance to undo it by, as the left would say, educating yourself. But she won't because she's [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3086.3999999999996s)]
*  on the side of the virtue signalers. Miranda, she's been posting left and right about Pride Month. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3092.64s)]
*  I guess now that she's sufficiently past her prime, she wants everybody to know what a leftist [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3098.24s)]
*  woke person she is. And she can kiss the support she used to have from the entire country goodbye. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3103.9199999999996s)]
*  All right, let me just say one other thing and then I want to move on to Jennifer Lopez. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3111.12s)]
*  There's this nutcase named Nancy Armour, that's my opinion, over at USA Today. She's never seen a boy. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3115.68s)]
*  She doesn't want to play in girl sports or pretend to be a boy. Her article for USA Today, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3122.56s)]
*  which is a disgusting publication owned by Gannett, which allows this, Simone Biles shows her [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3128.24s)]
*  greatness again and standing up for transgender community. We looked up Nancy Armour. You'll be [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3133.2s)]
*  surprised not at all to learn she doesn't have any daughters of her own. She doesn't have any kids. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3138.32s)]
*  So she just wants my daughter to have to play against boys and everybody else's daughter, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3142.96s)]
*  but she doesn't actually have any skin in the game. Simone Biles, she writes in this piece, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3147.84s)]
*  is the goat in every sense of the word. Gaines replied that Biles' post was so disappointing, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3152.4s)]
*  which is just further proof that Riley Gaines needs to get out of her right wing bubble a bit more. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3158.32s)]
*  Anyone who's even slightly familiar with Biles knows she's an ally unabashedly of the LGBTQ [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3164.32s)]
*  community. She also has little use for anyone who punches down on others, which is Gaines' specialty. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3170.32s)]
*  You see Gaines is punching down and standing up for actual girls in these matches, in these games. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3177.28s)]
*  So like the girls who tried to hit off of that boy pitcher or had to stand there on the receiving [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3185.2000000000003s)]
*  end of a boy's power and speed behind the ball, they're not to be defended. If you defend them, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3190.88s)]
*  you're punching down by, I guess, suggesting the boy shouldn't be there. She goes on to say, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3197.84s)]
*  uh, Riley has become a MAGA media darling, but her grifting has done real harm to the trans community, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3204.08s)]
*  which is already at an elevated risk for suicide and self-harm. Again, with this, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3211.8399999999997s)]
*  okay, it's all about their mental problems, which are real, but not of our creation. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3217.2s)]
*  The reason they're trans in the first place is they have some mental issues. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3222.8799999999997s)]
*  Um, there is no scientific evidence that trans women athletes have a physical advantage over [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3227.2s)]
*  cisgender women athletes. No, no advantage for the boys posing as girls over the actual girls. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3234.3199999999997s)]
*  And then we get to this. Gaines has publicly lobbied for Simone Biles and Caitlin Clark to [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3240.24s)]
*  support her in her hate, which again is a laughable idea to anyone who's filed Biles in illustrious [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3246.08s)]
*  career. You don't accomplish what she has without being fearless. Okay. She was unable to compete [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3254.0s)]
*  her Olympic contest not so long ago, but fine. I think there are some fears and they have actually [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3259.6s)]
*  managed to capture her. Uh, and then she ends with this. Most of us could never do what Biles does [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3265.6s)]
*  as a gymnast, but we can do what she does as a human. Be kind, defend the most marginalized. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3270.4s)]
*  This is blatant propaganda. It is untrue bullshit all over USA Today. They let Nancy [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3277.84s)]
*  Armour do this every time. Why? What is it about Gannett that I don't know? Is it, is it run by some [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3283.36s)]
*  trans person? Is it a Pritzker's organization? How is this appearing without a counter piece either [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3290.1600000000003s)]
*  ever, ever in USA Today in one of the nation's major newspapers? Well, I mean, Gannett's apparently [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3296.0s)]
*  for sale. It's just ailing. And we're told always that it's because, uh, you know, people don't want [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3304.56s)]
*  to read local newspapers anymore. It's because they don't want to read propaganda like that [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3310.48s)]
*  in their local newspaper. Um, and that spread across the country as some sort of propaganda. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3316.0s)]
*  It's, it's, you know, the, the reason that, um, this issue took off and it was so, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3323.36s)]
*  so lacking in common sense, defying common sense was because of the media and people like this [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3331.36s)]
*  Nancy Armour woman who just write lies that what she wrote was untrue. It's factually wrong. And, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3337.76s)]
*  um, and, you know, just so banal talking about being kind to each other. There's nothing kind [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3346.7200000000003s)]
*  about giving a 13 year old girl, um, hormones to become a man, a boy, and to become infertile and [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3353.6800000000003s)]
*  then chop off her breasts. Um, and the same for little boys. There's nothing kind about it. It's [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3361.44s)]
*  the cruelest child abuse you could have. And their parents have been sucked into going along with it [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3366.72s)]
*  by really malevolent, evil medical people and the media and, uh, and these sort of, you know, they've, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3373.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, the LGBTQ allies situation has been co-opted and hijacked to commit this child abuse. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3382.3199999999997s)]
*  And there's plenty of LGBTs who aren't happy about it. Right on. Exactly. Right. And by the way, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3391.2s)]
*  plenty of geez, meaning gay boys who are just gay boys who do not need to be quote, turned into girls [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3397.7599999999998s)]
*  by some radical left trans activists who insists gay boys aren't really a thing. That if you're [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3406.08s)]
*  attracted to other boys, you are secretly a girl. You're not allowed to be like a femme boy anymore. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3411.92s)]
*  You just have to turn yourself into a girl by having body parts chopped off and your sexual [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3418.0s)]
*  function ruined by this weird hormone cocktail. They give them it's sick. And this in a major [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3422.4s)]
*  newspaper over and over, they let this, I don't know what Nancy armor has going on in her personal [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3428.96s)]
*  life. And frankly, I don't want to know. I bet it would be rather dark. That's my opinion. Um, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3434.08s)]
*  but they let her over and over proselytize for this bizarre ideology. Like it's the equivalent [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3439.52s)]
*  of getting in shape and eating well. Right. Well, look, you know, some people just looking for love [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3446.8s)]
*  and if you are committed to this propaganda, you'll get a lot of love from a small number [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3453.52s)]
*  of activists. And if you don't, you will get the most awful vile hatred. Uh, you know, I'm sure [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3460.0800000000004s)]
*  you've had it. Um, and certainly, um, what's the Harry Potter author? JK Rowling. JK Rowling. I mean, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3467.92s)]
*  you look at what the attacks that she's suffered, but she's been tough and wonderful, uh, come [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3475.44s)]
*  through. And I think she's been part of the reason that in the UK, they turned the corner even before [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3481.76s)]
*  we did. Um, when they, uh, you know, there was a, a commission looked into the medical facts and [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3487.52s)]
*  found that it was child abuse and that they should stop transitioning children. Um, thank goodness. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3495.44s)]
*  And that's changed everything around the world. And we, we still are not there. Okay. Let's move [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3501.76s)]
*  on because yes, we have to get to JLo. Here's the reason we have to get to JLo. It's you write about [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3508.1600000000003s)]
*  culture too. And there's, this is a, this is a serious problem in our culture. When you have a [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3513.44s)]
*  56 year old woman who performs on stage and, um, this was a pride event, of course, as JLo's also [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3518.5600000000004s)]
*  woke and thinks it's really important that she show her vagina to us. I mean, literally we're [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3527.04s)]
*  seeing the same thing that we saw in the Holly Berry dress at the Met Gala where you're seeing [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3534.16s)]
*  side pub. That's what you're seeing there. Clearly she's shaved or waxed, but this 56 year old woman [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3541.52s)]
*  as an attempt to be like empowered and show us how you can still be fierce at 56 really wanted us to [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3548.88s)]
*  see her vagina. And honestly, I'm legitimately asking you this, Miranda, why, why does she think [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3556.48s)]
*  that's important? Here's Holly Berry doing the same thing at the Met Gala. Why do these women think [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3562.56s)]
*  this is empowering? Well, I mean, it's not, it's so unseemly. It's so grotesque and disgusting. Um, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3568.4s)]
*  I look, they're obviously desperately trying to cling onto their youth and think that if they [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3578.32s)]
*  wear some arresting, uh, you know, half nude clothing that that's going to attract [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3585.3599999999997s)]
*  people to them. I don't know. It's, it's really, I mean, just act your age. No, no problem with [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3592.64s)]
*  looking attractive and, you know, keeping yourself fresh, but, um, just keep your body to yourself. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3598.96s)]
*  No one wants to say young or old. And, um, you know, men are attracted to young women who are [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3605.44s)]
*  fertile and that is not JLo. And so she should just, you know, accept the truth that she is a [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3613.44s)]
*  middle-aged woman and she can grow old gracefully and set an example for younger women instead of [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3621.84s)]
*  trying to compete with younger women for a small and shrinking number of kind of virile young men. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3628.8s)]
*  You know, it's, I think of somebody like Tina Turner, whose body blew doors on JLo's body [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3636.4s)]
*  and on all of our bodies. And she never did this. She wore the fun outfits that were saucy [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3642.56s)]
*  and showed off her incredible physique and her ripped arms. And like it was with hashtag goals, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3649.7599999999998s)]
*  even when Tina was in her sixties and seventies, but she never was running around showing off her [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3655.36s)]
*  vag. Like this is a new thing where people occur. Yeah. Halle Berry. Yes. JLo. We saw Christina, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3661.2799999999997s)]
*  not Christina Aguilera, Shakira do it with JLo at the super bowl a few years back. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3669.52s)]
*  More and more years. We saw Katy Perry doing very weird outfits that revealed too much. Like [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3676.08s)]
*  these older women who they look fine. It's not like they look terrible, but they feel the need to, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3682.3999999999996s)]
*  to over sexualize themselves for some reason. Like maybe you're right. They're holding onto [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3688.8799999999997s)]
*  like the younger, more fertile versions of themselves and they want you to see them. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3694.48s)]
*  For me, it's depressing. It's depressing because I really hope that as I head into [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3699.12s)]
*  this second phase, I'm already in the second phase of life, that I can feel, yeah, sexy in my own [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3706.08s)]
*  body. Sure. With my husband or, you know, on a trip, but that I don't feel the need to post like [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3713.12s)]
*  sex pot photos of myself so that others can tell me how hot and sexy and like what a turn on I am. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3719.6s)]
*  I really, really think at this point in my life, I'm past that. I know exactly who I am. I don't [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3729.2s)]
*  need outside adoration to affirm it. Yes. And I think you've pinpointed something there. I mean, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3735.68s)]
*  JLo's just split up with Ben Affleck. You know, that's a third or fourth, you know, serious [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3742.24s)]
*  husband or serious partner. She's searching for something. She hasn't found it. And she's probably [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3748.56s)]
*  fallen prey to a whole lot of sycophants around her who tell her she looks hot. Hey, wear this. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3756.48s)]
*  This will look sexy. People without any judgment. And she's fallen. And I think by your criticizing [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3763.04s)]
*  her, you are doing her a favor. We are doing her a favor because she needs to listen to women who, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3772.0s)]
*  I don't wish any harm on her. I hope that she finds love eventually. This is not the way to [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3777.6s)]
*  find it. You're not going to attract the right people. And you look ridiculous. You look trashy. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3784.24s)]
*  Thank you. That's the word. She looks trashy. And the thing is, she could have done that [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3792.08s)]
*  performance. I mean, her songs are terrible. The truth is JLo's career is over. All she has is [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3796.64s)]
*  her social media. That's really what she has. But her music career is over. She made some good music [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3802.08s)]
*  in the early aughts. And she's still riding that. But no one's going to her tour. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3806.64s)]
*  She's had empty seats everywhere. It's been a story. But the thing about JLo is she's making [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3813.3599999999997s)]
*  herself look ridiculous and desperate. Whereas if she had just worn, I mean, literally just [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3818.96s)]
*  an additional inch of coverage on the left and the right, that wouldn't be the story. The story [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3825.04s)]
*  would be, she looks great. She's defying all the rules about aging. That would have been the [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3830.8s)]
*  story. Instead, the story is you seem to be a desperate hoe wanting strangers to admire your [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3837.36s)]
*  vagina. That tells me you're incredibly insecure, small and petty, and don't have a strong id. You [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3844.0800000000004s)]
*  don't know who you are. Yes, absolutely. You said it perfectly. And it's sad, really. I do see these [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3850.6400000000003s)]
*  desperate women making fools of themselves. And I think it's unfortunate. And I hope that younger [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3860.08s)]
*  women don't look at that and see that as a role model as something to aspire to. Just being a [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3868.2400000000002s)]
*  little classy is much more attractive. Okay. Now I would be remiss if I did not show you this video [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3873.92s)]
*  from the American Music Awards. This is Debbie Murphy. No, this is number 30. I've got to show [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3881.28s)]
*  you this. This is her favorite clip for weeks. She's been asking me to get to this because J. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3886.64s)]
*  Lo performing at that event bends over with her ass to the crowd for the listening audience [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3891.68s)]
*  and wants to give a thumbs up. But because she's upside down, it's a thumbs down. Let's look at it. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3897.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a stop, number 30. She's again wearing no clothing. She bends over. She gives the thumbs [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3903.12s)]
*  up, but it's a thumbs down. That's perfect. That's her new thing. I'm telling you, the Beyoncé [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3914.8s)]
*  sensory thing, it caught on. For women, instead of being like, oh, she has no clothes on, they were [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3924.0800000000004s)]
*  like, I guess we don't wear clothes anymore. Okay. I won't wear clothes either. And you've got these [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3928.88s)]
*  young confused looking girls clapping like, I guess, is it good? I guess, okay, I'll clap. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3933.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm told she's a big star. I'm told that by her Instagram and by all the magazines that she, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3938.88s)]
*  and you know this as well, that she 100% is intentionally getting into there. When was the [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3944.4s)]
*  last time you saw Helen Mirren on camera doing something in her private life? Never, because she [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3952.1600000000003s)]
*  doesn't call the paparazzi to photograph her. Right? I can speak to this personally. The [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3961.6s)]
*  paparazzi gets interested in me when I have a massive controversy about something I've said. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3967.28s)]
*  Otherwise, they leave me alone. J.Lo, they document every trip to Starbucks, every trip to [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3971.68s)]
*  the gym, every trip out for a burger, because she eats just like you and I eat with that body. Sure. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3977.2s)]
*  And that's because she's orchestrating all of it, because all she is is one big ball of PR. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3984.16s)]
*  Like Meghan Markle. Same thing. Yes. You know, pretending she wants privacy and [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3990.56s)]
*  dialing up the paparazzi anytime she wants some publicity, which is all the time. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=3995.7599999999998s)]
*  Even like Jennifer Lawrence, let's go younger than Helen Mirren. Jennifer Lawrence is totally [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4002.08s)]
*  gorgeous. She's a big star. You don't see these photos of her all the time. She's not a desperate [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4006.72s)]
*  to be a thirst trap for people wanting her. And she'll do her thing on the big screen, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4014.96s)]
*  and then she lets her work speak for itself. J.Lo can't do that because her work is poor. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4019.44s)]
*  It's not being well received. And so she's just got to keep generating more controversial moments. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4024.08s)]
*  And I guess next it'll be just complete nudity. It'll be showing up at the VMAs, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4028.96s)]
*  just totally naked, bending over like that, like she's going to have a GYN exam on camera. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4034.56s)]
*  Then the pendulum will swing all the way the other way and we'll all be dressed up like, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4043.68s)]
*  you know, nuns or like- We'll be in pioneer dresses. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4047.68s)]
*  ... in burkas. Yeah. I always thought those pioneer [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4050.96s)]
*  dresses would be quite flattering because they like shove it, like, I don't know, they kind of [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4055.36s)]
*  give you some oomph off here, but you can be kind of at leisure down in the waist and the belly area, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4058.7200000000003s)]
*  which we all want to be. Thank you so much for being here. It's great to see you and good luck [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4064.6400000000003s)]
*  with the podcast. Tell us about your first guest. Thank you so much. It's Donald Trump. I very [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4068.6400000000003s)]
*  kindly agreed to do the podcast. And it's very hard to have a bad interview with him because he's [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4073.84s)]
*  so entertaining. And he told me some quite interesting, unusual things that no one's asked [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4079.6s)]
*  him before he said. Like when he was a child, he was rather naughty and rambunctious. And so [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4086.48s)]
*  his parents sent him off for aptitude testing and his father was very disappointed, Donald Trump said [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4093.36s)]
*  in the answer, because turns out that he's a musical genius and he could, like he did these tests and [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4099.36s)]
*  he would hear a note and then an hour later, they'd ask him to identify it and he did it every [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4106.88s)]
*  time. So, but his father didn't think that that was very useful. But, you know, his mother got him to [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4112.72s)]
*  to play the flute. He got flute lessons. Can you imagine? No, I cannot imagine. That's amazing. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4120.0s)]
*  There's probably some sort of the brain that has that ability that's linked with some of the [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4127.4400000000005s)]
*  traits that we do know of Donald Trump. But, you know, I love the people who can kind of tell you, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4132.400000000001s)]
*  like if you get languages, you can't do directions. If you, you know, whatever, there are definitely [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4136.16s)]
*  linkages there. I know his grandson, I think it is, Ivanka's son is playing the piano. She's posted [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4142.16s)]
*  a couple of videos and Trump is standing there admiringly. So I guess he's putting that musical [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4150.0s)]
*  ear to good use as a grandpa. I'm looking forward to listening to it. Okay, so they can get it for [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4155.599999999999s)]
*  free wherever they get their podcast or is this going to be a Fox Nation thing? Where can they get [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4161.44s)]
*  it? No, no, no, it's for free on Apple, Spotify, wherever you get your podcasts and you can get the [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4164.72s)]
*  link through the New York Post as well. Awesome. Okay, it's called Pod Force One with Miranda [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4170.4800000000005s)]
*  Devine. Thank you so much for being here. Thanks so much Megan, very kind of you. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4175.84s)]
*  Okay, and tomorrow we're going to do a deep dive into my thoughts on where the Diddy Combs trial [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4180.72s)]
*  is so far and on what just happened to Justin Baldoni. It was not good, but there is a silver [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4187.84s)]
*  lighting. So tune in for that. Let's be honest, America can still be a dangerous place and you [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4196.64s)]
*  cannot afford to wait should you need help. Sure, you could use a firearm, but in today's America, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4202.56s)]
*  defending yourself with deadly force could have some legal consequences. Unfortunately, according [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4208.400000000001s)]
*  to FBI data, 99.9% of all altercations do not require lethal force. And that's exactly why many [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4213.84s)]
*  are turning to Berna. Berna is proudly American, hand assembled in Fort Wayne, Indiana. These less [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4221.360000000001s)]
*  lethal self-defense launchers are trusted by hundreds of government agencies, law enforcement [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4227.92s)]
*  departments, and private security companies. Over 600,000 Berna pistols have been sold mostly [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4232.64s)]
*  to private citizens who refuse to be victims. Berna launchers fire rocket-hard kinetic rounds [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4238.64s)]
*  and powerful tear gas and pepper projectiles capable of stopping a threat from up to 60 feet away. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4244.88s)]
*  No background checks, no waiting periods, and Berna can ship straight to your door. Take responsibility, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPVu_riyQWY&t=4251.68s)]
