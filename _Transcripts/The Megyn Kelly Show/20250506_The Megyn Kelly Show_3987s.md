# Prince Harry's Hypocrisy in New BBC Interview, & Meghan's Fawning Podcast Appearance, w/ Dan Wootton
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show. This is an extra for you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=0.0s)]
*  After a years-long battle, Prince Harry lost his fight for government-funded security [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=4.8s)]
*  when he is in the UK. Following the legal ruling, Prince Harry ran to the media, shock, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=11.44s)]
*  and participated in a sit-down interview with the BBC claiming he does not see a world where [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=17.84s)]
*  he could bring Meghan and the kids back to the UK, alleging we know where the responsibility lies [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=23.68s)]
*  if something were to happen to his father's grandchildren, while admitting he doesn't know [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  how long his father, the King of England, has left. He's been battling an undisclosed form of cancer. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  Harry and Meghan continually reach new lows. Here to walk us through the latest is Dan Wooden, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=43.6s)]
*  host of Dan Wooden Unspoken. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=51.36s)]
*  Insta, Facebook, and X. There's a lot of talk about government debt, but another four years of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  inflation, another real crisis, is personal debt. Some people are working harder than ever, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=64.16s)]
*  and they're still drowning in credit card debt and overdue bills. Maybe you're one of them. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=69.52s)]
*  But that is something that is solvable. And for this, you can turn to Done With Debt. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=72.88s)]
*  Done With Debt has unique escape strategies to help end your debt fast so you keep more of your [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=77.67999999999999s)]

*  negotiators go one-on-one with your credit card and loan companies with one goal, to drastically [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=87.36s)]
*  reduce your bills, eliminate interest, and erase penalties. Most clients end up with more money in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  their pocket month one, and they don't stop until they break you free from debt permanently. Take a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=97.67999999999999s)]

*  DoneWithDebt.com. That's DoneWithDebt.com. Dan, great to see you again. Welcome back. And of course, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=111.6s)]
*  it's on a note like this, sour, embittered, and woe is me. Put it in perspective for us. What's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  he doing here? Always, always. I mean, this is a shocking new low, Megan, because amidst all of that, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=126.0s)]
*  he also went as far to suggest that the royal family actually wanted him dead. So let's just [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=133.84s)]
*  step back and think about that for one moment, because on the one hand, he's saying, I want [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=141.6s)]
*  reconciliation. I want to have a relationship with my brother again, even though he never wants to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=147.2s)]
*  speak to me again. I want to speak to my dad again. Yeah, he's probably dying, so I feel a [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=152.24s)]
*  little bit bad about that. Then in the same breath, he's saying, these guys want me to be unsafe. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=157.36s)]
*  Let me just show that. I have that little bit from the BBC interview. We have a bunch of sides. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=166.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, let me show that last one that he believes they want him dead. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=170.72s)]
*  This disclosure process, I've discovered that some people want history to repeat itself, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=182.8s)]
*  which is pretty dark. That's quite a statement. Who do you think that is? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to share it at this point. I know all the names of the people that were involved in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=192.72s)]
*  this process. And again, you have to question, why wasn't I put through the same risk management [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  board that everybody else was put through? So the reason they won't pay for his ongoing [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=203.68s)]
*  security when he visits the UK is because they want him dead, Dan. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=210.16s)]
*  I know. This is now paranoia and delusion on an actual terrifying scale. Because, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=214.4s)]
*  Megan, what he is suggesting is that the royal family is conspiring with the British government [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  to make him unsafe, to see him die in an accident like his mother, Princess Diana, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=228.72s)]
*  all because actually, this is where his argument gets really weird, they secretly wanted to force [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=237.84s)]
*  him into returning to the UK. Trust me, Megan. Trust me. You know I've covered this story up [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=243.76s)]
*  close for many years. No member of the royal family, not one, not one member of the British [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  royal family wants him back in the United Kingdom. And as for reconciliation, my sources very close [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=256.24s)]
*  to Prince William say that his words were, over my dead body. It's done. It's over. There were red [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=263.36s)]
*  lines, Harry crossed them. And the fact that he is now trying to suggest that the royal family [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=272.8s)]
*  actually want him to die like Diana, well, it's just another step too far. Like, why on earth would [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=278.24s)]
*  they reconcile at the same time as he's putting out actually arguably the most crazy and explosive [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  accusation yet? Yes, yes. And why would he want to reconcile with people who literally want him [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=291.84s)]
*  dead? I mean, it doesn't make any sense. And so it isn't true. That's basically the rule. He, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  unfortunately, it looks like we're going to be stuck with him because he said the following in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=305.84s)]
*  stop 42. I can't see a world in which I would be bringing my wife and children back to the UK at [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=309.84s)]
*  this point. And the things that they the things that they're going to miss is, well, everything. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=317.92s)]
*  You know, I love my country. I always have done. Despite what some people in that country have done. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=324.16s)]
*  So, you know, I miss the UK. I miss parts of the UK. Of course I do. And I think that it's really [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=333.44s)]
*  quite sad that I won't be able to show, you know, my children, my homeland. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=339.44s)]
*  Oh, stomach turning down. And I love my country, you know, despite what some people there have done. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=343.92s)]
*  He's got so much anger. I mean, all I can think is that we reported the truth, right? We reported [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=352.32s)]
*  the truth about the behavior of his wife, his narcissistic wife, Meghan Markle. Now, Meghan, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  remember at the time, the idea was that people like me were actually somehow racist because we [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=370.32s)]
*  reported the fact that she was a bully, for example, reported the fact that the late queen Elizabeth [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  the second had called her out for her disgusting behavior, that Catherine had actually confronted [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=381.04s)]
*  her at Kensington Palace about the way that she spoke to staff. That was all racism. There was [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  something about us Brits. We just didn't understand the American way. Well, how on earth does Prince [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=391.52s)]
*  Harry now explain the fact that actually the bullying accusations are piling up from Americans, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=397.2s)]
*  from the woke Californians working at Archwell, that they're reported in establishment pro-royal [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=404.4s)]
*  magazines like Vanity Fair or The Hollywood Reporter. None of this makes sense. And the [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=412.08s)]
*  problem is Harry is now so isolated. He has ignored so many people for so long. There's only one person [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=418.08s)]
*  who advises him, his wife. And she only cares about trying to protect her own reputation. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=425.12s)]
*  So all of this is crazy. But the idea that he thinks there is a way back by giving another interview [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  is what's nuts. Because I will say, Meghan, King Charles doesn't feel the same as Prince William. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=439.12s)]
*  There is a split between father and son on this. So William, when he is on the throne, and very [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=445.04s)]
*  sadly, that will probably be sooner rather than later, given Charles is suffering from cancer, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=452.48s)]
*  which I believe to be incurable, although Buckingham Palace are saying that he's fighting on and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=460.24s)]
*  things are pretty good. And obviously we know with medical advances, you can stay alive with incurable [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=469.36s)]
*  cancer for some time. But the long term or even the medium term prognosis is not good. And by the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=475.92s)]
*  time William is on the throne, there is no way back. Meghan, he doesn't even want Harry at his own [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=482.32s)]
*  coronation. So it's finished. But Charles is a different type of guy. He feels a lot of guilt [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  for Harry's upbringing. He knows that the war of the whales, which was obviously Diana versus Charles [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=497.76s)]
*  and all of those TV interviews and tampon gate and then the death of Princess Diana, he knows [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=505.28s)]
*  that did screw Harry up in a lot of ways. So Charles still feels this inherent guilt as a dad [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  and was open to some sort of reproach mon. But then Harry went and gave the interview to the BBC [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  and it is back to square one. Right. So the thing he's whining about now is that when he [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=527.12s)]
*  left the royal family and his official role, they said, we're not going to be paying for your [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=535.2s)]
*  security when you come over here. You're no longer working royal, so you're not going to get the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=542.8s)]
*  police force around you when you pay visits here. And Harry's argument to the BBC and in court was, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=549.04s)]
*  I can never leave the royal family. I could leave as a working royal, but I am part of the royal [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=556.0s)]
*  family and therefore I'm in danger and that they never did a review of my security status. They [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=560.56s)]
*  just yanked it to try to force me. And you were saying this couldn't possibly be, but try to force [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=567.8399999999999s)]
*  me to stay as a working royal because he said my threat level was the highest of anybody back in [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=573.04s)]
*  like 2020. And then they revoked all my protection without even doing an additional security [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  assessment, proving in his mind, they knew I was at risk. And while I left as a working royal, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=585.92s)]
*  I never can leave being a royal because as he said to the BBC, I am who I am. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=592.24s)]
*  A hundred percent. And he wants to be treated like a former prime minister who will receive lifetime [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=598.16s)]
*  security rights. So even Liz Trash, she was prime minister for six weeks. She receives [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  security for the rest of her life. He believes that that's what he deserves. Now, Megan, in the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=611.2s)]
*  negotiations after Meg's at this thing called the Sandrinum summit, where all of the senior [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=617.5200000000001s)]
*  royals, the late Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles William and their senior staff gathered, Harry was [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=623.9200000000001s)]
*  told point blank, you will lose your security if you leave in this way. Yes, that is why the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  royals tried to come to some type of arrangement with Harry. There were loads of ideas thrown [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=637.6s)]
*  around. At one point it was like, could we maybe move you to South Africa, a Commonwealth country [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=642.16s)]
*  for six months of the year? What about making you the governor general of Australia? Is there some [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=648.0s)]
*  type of role for you in Canada? But as soon as Meghan Markle made it absolutely clear that it [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  was all about the mullah, it was all about the big bucks, it was all about trading off the royal name. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=658.16s)]
*  And you've got to remember, she was lining up these deals, Megan, when she was still the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=663.2s)]
*  Duchess of Sussex. She was in talks with Disney, she was in talks with the publishing companies, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=667.5200000000001s)]
*  in talks with Netflix. So at that point, the late Queen Elizabeth II, quite rightly in my opinion, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=672.88s)]
*  said, no, there is no half in half out. So you can go, you go without blessing, but you lose everything [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=678.4000000000001s)]
*  and you do lose your security. And you can imagine the difficulty for the British government, because [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=686.0s)]
*  if they were to fund Prince Harry's security, that would also mean that there would be pressure [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=691.36s)]
*  for them to provide security to other high net worth famous individuals who come to the United [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=697.6s)]
*  Kingdom. Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and that doesn't happen in this country. Now, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=702.8000000000001s)]
*  Harry has been very intellectually dishonest, though, to suggest that there is no security for [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  him. Every time he has come, King Charles has offered him a lodging at, wait for it, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=714.88s)]
*  Buckingham Palace. And guess what, Megan, Buckingham Palace is empty at the moment, right? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=721.52s)]
*  Charles is at Clarence House, William is in Windsor. So he could have the rum of Buckingham Palace. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=726.32s)]
*  And if he was at Buckingham Palace, he would receive full security. Guess what? Harry said no. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=733.52s)]
*  He went to say with a posh, rich friend and an eight million pound flat, it has been revealed, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=740.24s)]
*  Megan, that he ordered Deliveroo. You know Deliveroo, it's like a food order, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=746.32s)]
*  for food ordering service here, like Uber Eats, whatever. Now that goes against every [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=750.24s)]
*  form of security, if you're a member of the royal family. So he doesn't really care. This is just [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=756.96s)]
*  something for Harry to do. He needs to have a battle. He needs to have a mission. It's actually [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=763.52s)]
*  deeply sad, but I have zero sympathy for him because the fact that he is putting his father [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=769.44s)]
*  through this in the final years of his life has a very, very sinister mirroring of exactly what [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=775.0400000000001s)]
*  he did with Prince Philip. Do you remember that? The Oprah interview and all of that when Prince [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=783.44s)]
*  Philip was on his deathbed. And then the late Queen Elizabeth II, because all of the drama around [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  Spare and the Netflix documentary and all of their other terrible slights happened when the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=794.0s)]
*  late Queen Elizabeth II was dying of blood cancer. It's like, you're never going to learn. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=800.7199999999999s)]
*  And there's no turning back. And Megan, there are members of the royal family [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=806.24s)]
*  who believe that Harry's behavior hastened the death of the late Queen Elizabeth II. That is [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=811.68s)]
*  something that they will easily forgive and forget. I believe that too. That's what I say. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=819.04s)]
*  Those two killed the Queen. That's my opinion. They killed the Queen. Yeah. She would have lived [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=823.6s)]
*  longer had they not ruined her last two years on earth with their selfishness. So much stress. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=827.84s)]
*  He lost at the trial court level on this push to make the British royal family pay for his security [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=834.64s)]
*  when he goes to the UK. And then he appealed it and he's just lost the appeal. And now he runs [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=840.24s)]
*  to the BBC. He's totally forlorn. He's like, can't believe I lost this. And now he's got this warning [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=845.52s)]
*  for his cancer stricken father in SOP 43. Once they realized that, you know, myself, my wife, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=851.84s)]
*  my kids are happier outside of the institution, then please just look at the facts. Look at the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=859.76s)]
*  risks. Look at the threat. Look at the impact. But if anything was to happen to me, my wife or [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  my father's grandchildren, if anything was to happen to them, look where the responsibility lies. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=872.48s)]
*  You know? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=878.64s)]
*  I mean, what a manipulation. My father's grandchildren, they're going to die and it [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=881.6s)]
*  will be his fault. That's what he was saying there. It's gaslighting on a grand scale. But Megan, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=888.16s)]
*  you know how when the palaces usually brief about these types of stories, right, are quite buttoned [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=893.28s)]
*  up and, you know, they try and keep the language that the tone quite controlled. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=900.64s)]
*  That's all out the window after this interview. They are raging. They have had enough. So the [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=908.3199999999999s)]
*  accusations now against Harry are you're gaslighting. They've literally used that term. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=915.04s)]
*  And they've also described their behavior and especially the behavior of Meghan Markle, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  by the way, who after that interview posted a picture of Harry on his own, sort of looking [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=925.04s)]
*  for lawn with the two children, although of course you don't see the faces of the children [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=930.0s)]
*  and it looks like their bodies have been manipulated. So that's all really weird. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=934.64s)]
*  In their garden in Montecito. That's it. That's it. Walking away. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=938.96s)]
*  Do you know what the palace briefed? That is Meghan Markle giving us a giant F-U. Now that is [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=943.28s)]
*  not the sort of language usually used by the royal family. But they'll get up. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=951.36s)]
*  I thought it was usually bugger off. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=954.96s)]
*  Yes, that's true. They definitely want them to bugger off. It's just like, leave us alone, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=957.84s)]
*  go and do your own thing. Enjoy your millions. What is this all about? And you can understand [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=965.12s)]
*  from Charles's point of view, it's like we've offered you Buckingham Palace. You'd get royal [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=970.88s)]
*  security if there was a risk or if you were here for any type of formal event. But if you're at [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=975.04s)]
*  Buckingham Palace, you're protected anyway, because of all of the natural security that is provided [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=979.84s)]
*  at Buckingham Palace. What's your problem? The problem is he wants to be able to swan [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=985.92s)]
*  into the country whenever he wants, not tell anyone and receive state funded security. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=990.8s)]
*  It just isn't going to happen. But the problem is he's surrounded by yes men. He's surrounded [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=996.4s)]
*  by people who have created this delusion in his head. And actually he is now a pathetic man, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1002.24s)]
*  really on so many levels, because you also remember Meghan, and I was more personally [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1008.8s)]
*  involved in this one because I was actually going to give evidence against Harry. And he said it [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1012.88s)]
*  was the fight of his life. He was going to take Rupert Murdoch and the tabloid newspapers to court, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1017.36s)]
*  and he was going to be the first man to do it. He was never going to settle. And this was the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1024.24s)]
*  battle of his life versus the sun and news of the world. And he was going to be the guy to bring [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1028.08s)]
*  down Rupert Murdoch. Well, guess what? The day the trial was meant to start, he folded and he [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1033.36s)]
*  folded for a big sum. He settled. So then he says this security case is the fight of my life. This [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1038.56s)]
*  is the battle of my life. But he's lost. So what now? What now? The problem is there is nothing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1044.88s)]
*  He has no focus. He has no job. He's trapped in a very unhappy marriage with a narcissistic woman [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1051.92s)]
*  who is now wearing the trousers in the relationship because she's the moneymaker. Harry isn't making [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1059.2s)]
*  any money. She's the one that is now going to commercialize the children, pimp them out on [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1065.76s)]
*  social media, even though Prince Harry has said that social media is a killing ground for children. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1070.48s)]
*  And so he's just got nothing. It's really sad that someone who on the surface has everything. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1076.0s)]
*  He's like a bored housewife who's looking for drama because he's not busy enough. And he's not [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1083.76s)]
*  obviously spending enough time with his children or he might find that fulfilling. But yeah, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1090.0s)]
*  he's looking to create drama. You can see it in the fights that he's picking. He went on to say [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1094.0s)]
*  that he could forgive the race allegations that he made, he and his wife, Meghan, made both to Oprah [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1099.92s)]
*  and in their Netflix documentary. I use that term very loosely, documentary. He can forgive what [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1110.24s)]
*  happened on the racial front, but this thing about taking his security away and trying in his view [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1116.48s)]
*  to have him killed, that's a bridge too far. Here he is in stop 44. There are decisions that [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1121.36s)]
*  have been made. There are things that have happened since 2016, especially throughout my whole life, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1126.9599999999998s)]
*  but let's just stick since 2016. There are things that have happened that I can now forgive. I have [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1132.56s)]
*  moved past that. I can forgive my family's involvement and my father, my brother and my [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1136.6399999999999s)]
*  stepmother. I can forgive the press to a large extent as well for so many things that have happened. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1142.6399999999999s)]
*  What I'm struggling to forgive and what I will probably always struggle to forgive [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1150.24s)]
*  is that a decision that was made in 2020 that affects my every single day [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1156.32s)]
*  and that is knowingly putting me and my family in harm's way. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1163.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay, Dan, how does it affect his every single day? We've seen his home, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1169.52s)]
*  we've seen his garden, we've seen their extravagant lifestyle. They want us to believe [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1176.96s)]
*  they're living their best lives out there. How does him not having exactly the security he wants [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1182.4s)]
*  in the UK, when he goes to the UK, affect his every single day to where this is unforgivable, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1188.16s)]
*  but his family allegedly being a bunch of racists against his babies, that's fine. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1194.8s)]
*  Totally. It's completely insane. The fact that he is asking for forgiveness is the most [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1200.48s)]
*  hilarious thing because actually the people who he needs to apologize to, Megan, are the British [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1206.48s)]
*  people who he claimed were all racist, remember, post-Brexit in the Netflix documentary. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1214.56s)]
*  He did, 100%. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1219.84s)]
*  And specifically King Charles and Catherine the Princess of Wales, who he claimed were the royal [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1220.56s)]
*  racists. Do you remember that after the Oprah Winfrey interview, this witch hunt began, then they [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1228.64s)]
*  leaked the names to that very odd little guy, Omer Scoby, who sort of looks a bit like Michael [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1233.12s)]
*  Jackson. And he put out there that they were the royal racists. And then Prince Harry goes [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1239.28s)]
*  and does an interview with his best mate, Tom Bradby, on Woke High TV, as I call it. And Tom [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1245.6799999999998s)]
*  Bradby says, well, what about these racism allegations? And Harry says, what racism allegations? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1250.9599999999998s)]
*  That was just made up by the media. So it's like the guy is living in actually quite [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1256.32s)]
*  a concerning dream world. There is no sense that he is anchored to any type of reality. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1262.88s)]
*  And the fact that he's sort of saying, I can forgive you, I can forgive the British media, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1270.72s)]
*  for what? You are the one that needs to apologize. And actually that interview could have been very [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1275.5200000000002s)]
*  different. As I say, not with William. William's done. William and Catherine are done with Harry. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1280.0800000000002s)]
*  There's no going back there. But the interview could have been very different if Harry had [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1285.0400000000002s)]
*  offered some type of apology in that interview to Charles and the stress that he put him through [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1289.12s)]
*  and said, look, I'm just going to take this out of the media and I want to reconcile privately. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  But you know, Meghan, the distrust now between the royal family and Prince Harry and Meghan is [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1300.9599999999998s)]
*  off the scale. Like there are serious suspicions that they were actually trying to record [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1306.56s)]
*  conversations even when they returned to the United Kingdom for the late Queen's funeral. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1313.6s)]
*  And I know for a fact that King Charles and Prince William spoke about this and decided that they [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1319.52s)]
*  would not ever be in any type of confined space on their own with Prince Harry without the other [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1326.24s)]
*  royal in attendance because William and Charles were so nervous that Harry would create some type [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1334.16s)]
*  of lie that would become a case of their word versus his. And so what they thought is at least [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1340.96s)]
*  if we're both there, we're both there, we can back the other one up. But come on, that's a relationship [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1347.2s)]
*  that is just completely broken down, completely broken down. You do have to worry that he's just [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1353.1200000000001s)]
*  taping them or if he's not taping them, just going to use it as fodder for his next book, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1358.8s)]
*  Spare 2 or his next Netflix special or his next Spotify deal once the current Spigot runs out. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1364.96s)]
*  So yeah, understandably, they don't have any desire to talk to him one on one. He's made it [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1372.8000000000002s)]
*  so that it's not possible, which is why this next soundbite is just so cynical. He knows [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1378.5600000000002s)]
*  exactly the position he's put them in. Here it is, Sot 45. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1384.72s)]
*  There have been so many disagreements, differences between me and some of my family. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1388.16s)]
*  This current situation that has been ongoing for five years with regard to human life and safety [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1400.4s)]
*  is the sticking point. It is the only thing that's left. Of course, some members of my family will [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1408.0s)]
*  never forgive me for writing a book. Of course, they will never forgive me for lots of things. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1415.6s)]
*  I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point in continuing to fight anymore. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1429.4399999999998s)]
*  As I said, life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1436.96s)]
*  He won't speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1445.44s)]
*  Oh, how about that, Dan? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1455.3600000000001s)]
*  It's delusional. It's totally delusional because what you have to think, Megan, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1457.04s)]
*  is that there were loads of points along the way where there could have been a full reconciliation, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1466.3999999999999s)]
*  but there were particular red lines that Harry was warned about very directly. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1473.36s)]
*  So from King Charles's perspective, it was, don't come for Camilla. Just leave Camilla alone. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1478.08s)]
*  From William's perspective, it was, don't come for my wife. Do not come for Catherine. You'll [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1485.52s)]
*  be making a big mistake. What did he do? He went for Camilla and Catherine in spare. Actually, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1492.72s)]
*  he even released private WhatsApp messages between Meghan Markle and Catherine in the book to try [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1499.12s)]
*  and prove that Catherine is some type of bully, which is a ludicrous claim. If you know anything [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1504.48s)]
*  about Catherine, it's like she's a very sweet, softly-soaked person. She doesn't like getting [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1511.04s)]
*  into rows with anyone. And Megan, just look at the track record, right? We've seen Catherine [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1516.6399999999999s)]
*  in public life now for two decades. Have you ever heard about her fallout with anyone? Like anyone? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1521.36s)]
*  She's the picture of class. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1527.2s)]
*  Yeah. There's this long list of people who she falls out with from her own family to her personal [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1529.28s)]
*  assistants. So Harry had all of these warnings. There were ways for him to still come back, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1536.48s)]
*  but unfortunately he's right when he says that William will, well, he's talking about William, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1542.48s)]
*  that William will never forgive him for writing the book. And that's not a surprise because [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1548.16s)]
*  remember, it wasn't just Catherine that he came for. He also made William out to be some type of [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1552.64s)]
*  violent bully. So it is unfathomable. And unfortunately, Harry now has to deal with [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1558.08s)]
*  the consequences of his action. You made a lot of money. That money was meant to give you the [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1564.4s)]
*  freedom. So go and live your life. Go and live your life in your 16-bathroom Montecito mansion. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1570.96s)]
*  But you just know that actually he's yearning to find a reason to be back in the United Kingdom, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1578.72s)]
*  Megan. And one of the issues is that he is now so ostracized from every single friendship group [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1584.5600000000002s)]
*  that had nothing to do with Megan Markle. And she is a manipulative person. So while I [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1590.8s)]
*  don't, I'm not one of these people who says, oh, woe is me, poor Harry, because actually he [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1595.68s)]
*  allowed himself to be manipulated. But what she has done is taken away any of the people [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1602.3999999999999s)]
*  who he could have trusted to confide in at a time like this. So his school friends, his army mates, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1610.0s)]
*  the old courtiers. It's like what they say, like coercive control. If this were a man doing it to [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1616.96s)]
*  a woman, we'd see it very clearly where if you have an abusive husband, suddenly the wife is [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1623.12s)]
*  detached from all of her family and is sending emails saying, I don't want to see you anymore. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1628.96s)]
*  Don't bother me. And then also detached from all of her friends. And he isolates her to the point [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1632.8s)]
*  where he can control her. I mean, really, just look at the reverse. That's what she effectively [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1638.8s)]
*  got him to do to alienate his entire family, all his friends. Yeah. And then just to add one other [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1643.52s)]
*  point to it, you watch her and you watch him. I mean, I didn't really know this until this whole [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1650.08s)]
*  past few years. He's not smart. This is not a smart young man. And she is smart. She is very smart [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1655.2s)]
*  and she's cunning. And the more I've seen of her, the more I've seen of him, I feel like it was [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1662.24s)]
*  shooting fish in a barrel for her. Oh my God. He stood no chance when this woman put her designs [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1666.24s)]
*  on him. She had him from the word. Hello. Well, Megan, you obviously revealed that to the world, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1671.68s)]
*  didn't you? With the fact that she had the mood board, the mood board with Prince Harry on. And [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1677.52s)]
*  we know that she was so desperate to snare Harry. And yes, remember it was Princess Diana who [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1682.72s)]
*  described Harry as not being a particularly smart guy. And so this is the problem he likes to think [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1690.0800000000002s)]
*  he is, but actually he doesn't really have the intellectual capability to deal with all of this. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1696.56s)]
*  And he was very well protected in the royal family for a long time. He had a load of good [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1702.24s)]
*  people around him who made sure that he got through these scrapes. And all of a sudden [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1707.12s)]
*  he doesn't. He's totally ostracized, totally isolated, totally on his own. His only friends [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1712.0s)]
*  now, Megan, are the joint friends, the showbiz friends who Meghan Markle controls. So I'm not [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1718.1599999999999s)]
*  disagreeing with the fact I absolutely believe there is a degree of coercive control. There is [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1725.76s)]
*  a degree of emotional abuse and what is particularly shocking at the moment. And if you just juxtapose [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1730.0s)]
*  how she looks in these interviews, like the cat who's got the cream, you know, my confession, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1735.92s)]
*  my confession is that I'm the happiest I've ever been. I'm the happiest I've ever been. Life is so [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1743.28s)]
*  good. Cut to Harry on the BBC, totally devastated. And there was actually an amazing moment, you know, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1747.92s)]
*  when he turned up at the Time 100. It wasn't the party that you were at, Megan, you know, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1756.16s)]
*  the summit during the day. And he was her bag carrier, right? He was her bag carrier. She had [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1762.88s)]
*  forced him to attend with her as her bag carrier, yet she didn't go with him to the Legends of [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1767.8400000000001s)]
*  Aviation event that he was at the next night because it's one way traffic in their relationship. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1776.24s)]
*  But there's a key moment when he leaves the car and she walks in front of him, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1781.04s)]
*  almost pushes him out the way, goes to shake the hand of the person who was coming to greet them. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1789.76s)]
*  Now, if you were following royal protocol, which is obviously the protocol that Harry followed for [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1794.56s)]
*  his entire life, as the blood royal, he would be the person who got to shake the hand first. Now, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1799.04s)]
*  I understand as Americans, you can say that's all stupid and everything. And in lots of ways it is, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1805.6s)]
*  but that was the life that Harry was brought up in. And you just see his face, the color drain from [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1810.32s)]
*  his face. And it's like this moment of realization. I'm now the spare to Meghan Markle. Oh my God, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1816.1599999999999s)]
*  you're right. I was so worried about being the spare to Prince Harry, to Prince William, but now [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1823.84s)]
*  I'm the spare to my own wife. I had never considered that, but you are 100% right. That's [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1828.16s)]
*  exactly what he's done. It's like he needed to repeat the same pathology somehow. And she is, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1836.0800000000002s)]
*  meanwhile, trying to have her cake and eat it too, because she's putting out this perfectly curated [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1842.8000000000002s)]
*  life on her stupid Netflix special, you know, with her, oh, you know, I just had like just the perfect [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1848.64s)]
*  bath salts and just the perfect tea and just the perfect pretzel and, you know, the fruit spread [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1855.2s)]
*  that takes eight hours to prepare. That's just what I do before school. It's kind of mom I am. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1861.8400000000001s)]
*  Then she meanders over to this podcast of this woman who created It Cosmetics, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1867.28s)]
*  Jamie Kern Lima. And I knew there was something weird about this woman. I interviewed her, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1872.0s)]
*  Dan, when I was at NBC about creating IT Cosmetics. And she did have the height, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1876.96s)]
*  I can't even do it. My voice is too low, but she had the high squeaky voice a little, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1882.88s)]
*  but she's really leaning in now in her little podcast. She's gone next octave up. And the two [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1887.5200000000002s)]
*  of them have the weirdest dynamic. And so in this podcast, Megan does her perfectly curated life [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1896.88s)]
*  thing, but she's allegedly wearing no makeup. Meanwhile, she's got like the perfect blowout, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1902.5600000000002s)]
*  you know, and like she's completely camera ready, except she didn't put eye makeup on. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1908.32s)]
*  And she also is pretending that she she's crying. And we did a zero in like we zoomed in just to see [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1912.96s)]
*  there isn't a tear in sight. Dan, look, look at this. I invite the viewers to take a close [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1920.1599999999999s)]
*  up look at this. Where's the tear? There's nothing there. Look, she just it's an actor's trick. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1927.36s)]
*  She just keeps wiping and wiping and wiping. So we think she has a heart. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1934.96s)]
*  Oh my god, Megan, she has this really famous thing where she says one tap left eye, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1942.96s)]
*  and she can make herself cry on demand. And it's a really good thing to have as an actress. But [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1950.4s)]
*  you're completely right. There were no tears there. And this podcast with Jamie Kern, Lima was [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1956.16s)]
*  absolutely car crash. I mean, Jamie Kern Lima is actually a very successful woman, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1962.48s)]
*  self made billionaire. However, she is a fame whore. Because you know, she first found [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1966.88s)]
*  by appearing on the first series of Big Brother in the United States. But she said that totally [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1974.24s)]
*  scrubbed from the internet. Because now she believes that she's the new Oprah Winfrey. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1979.52s)]
*  And the problem is, realize these are the types of people Megan Markle is surrounding herself with. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1985.44s)]
*  And none of them are prepared to ever give her a dose of reality. Like I fought my sins, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1990.4s)]
*  listen to the new episode today of confessions of a female family. You know, she calls everyone [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=1996.96s)]
*  female founders. And I know you find that very, very ridiculous. And it's with this British woman [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2002.3200000000002s)]
*  called Hannah Mendoza, who actually created a brand called Clever Blends and Megan invested in [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2007.68s)]
*  her company. But the podcast is meant to be Hannah Mendoza's story, right. But Megan spends the entire [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2014.0s)]
*  time talking about what it was like for her to invest in this with Hannah Mendoza. She only has [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2020.08s)]
*  on people who she gave money to so they can say how amazing she is. It's like she's her boss. So [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2027.6799999999998s)]
*  Megan is Hannah Mendoza's boss, effectively. So clearly she's keeping to the script. But there's [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2033.9199999999998s)]
*  this really awful moment where Megan turns into the mean girl that we know she all is. And she [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2039.6s)]
*  mocks Hannah Mendoza, who's a bit of an earth mother type, for turning up to this interview, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2045.2s)]
*  this first interview when she gave her money in Birkenstocks and a satin jumpsuit. And it's like [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2051.68s)]
*  Megan's laughing at her about it. It's very, very bizarre. And unfortunately, Megan is now, well, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2058.56s)]
*  maybe it's fortunate for us because Megan is now the executive producer of all of these works. So [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2065.04s)]
*  we see the real her. It's like, and oh my God, you made me laugh so much with Maureen in your [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2070.64s)]
*  version of this thing, which is absolutely fantastic. You know the moment with Mindy [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2076.8799999999997s)]
*  Carling when like Mindy Carling is clearly terrified of Megan Markle. And so this is the [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2080.7999999999997s)]
*  thing. Megan Markle is only now surrounded by people who will tell her what she wants to hear. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2090.72s)]
*  And so again, the level of delusion is off the scale. But just remember, Jamie Kern-Lima [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2098.24s)]
*  sits down with Megan Markle for 90 minutes, 90 minutes, talks about what a wonderful businesswoman [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2105.04s)]
*  she is, what a wonderful friend she is. Not one question, Megan, about what about these bullying [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2110.64s)]
*  allegations, right? Surely there now must be something in it. The fact that your staff in [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2118.08s)]
*  Hollywood are also questioning this. At the very least, I mean, I know she's her friend and I know [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2123.92s)]
*  it's a different type of format, but at the very least she could have said, look, were they just [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2129.44s)]
*  lies? Were they people who were coming for you unfairly? But remember, we now live in this sort [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2133.2799999999997s)]
*  of dual world, don't we? Where there is the truth and there is what celebrities can put out to be [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2139.92s)]
*  the truth via their chosen platforms. And obviously there are great things about that in the independent [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2146.72s)]
*  space because we can also immediately analyze and that's what we do and point out. This is not true. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2152.48s)]
*  This is not true. This is not true. But I do just want to remind people, Megan, for all of the times [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2157.36s)]
*  that Megan Markle says that she's happy in her relationship with Prince Harry. And there's this [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2163.04s)]
*  moment where Jamie Kern-Lima says, will you stay with Prince Harry forever? Will you be married to [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2168.32s)]
*  him forever? And her voice goes up two octaves and she says, yes, because she's lying. Because Megan, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2172.64s)]
*  and this is something I'd reported for years. I think we spoke about it, but she is shopping the [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2179.68s)]
*  post divorce book to publishers already. And if people thought that was some type of conspiracy [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2185.3599999999997s)]
*  theory, though I always believe conspiracy theories come true these days, Vanity Fair confirmed that [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2191.44s)]
*  in their big profile. Wait, that she's shopping her post divorce memoir? What? Yes, 100%. 100%. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2197.9199999999996s)]
*  And in the Jamie Kern-Lima interview, she asks, will you write another book? She doesn't say, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2205.12s)]
*  will you write a memoir? She says, will you write another book? And Megan says, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2210.4s)]
*  a lot of people ask if I want to write my memoir, but I haven't lived enough life yet. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2215.6s)]
*  And what is going on there is that Megan doesn't want to have to write a book now, which would [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2220.56s)]
*  obviously include loads and loads of positive stuff about Prince Harry, because she is preparing [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2226.8s)]
*  for the big payday, which she knows will be a massive payout to keep her going for years and [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2234.08s)]
*  years. I mean, Harry, remember, got well over 20 million for his three book deal. And that is what [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2240.56s)]
*  she is proposing to do. And as I say, this is something I had reported for years and years and [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2247.92s)]
*  years, but Vanity Fair included it in their recent profile of Megan Markle. Katie Nicholl, who is [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2251.68s)]
*  the royal correspondent for Vanity Fair, is very clear that they weren't coming into the profile. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2259.92s)]
*  The editor of Vanity Fair didn't have some type of agenda. Remember, they'd previously put Megan [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2264.64s)]
*  Markle on that famous cover, wild about Harry. There was no agenda going into this profile. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2269.04s)]
*  What they discovered was pretty horrifying. So Harry has been warned. It's like, mate, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2274.64s)]
*  get out. Seriously, Vanity Fair is reporting that your wife is shopping to publishes a post-divorce [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2282.08s)]
*  book where she's going to throw you under the bus. Get out. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2290.0s)]
*  Why would she be doing that? Because that would really show the crack in the facade. I have trouble [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2295.92s)]
*  believing that because she right now wants to maintain the facade and wants us all to believe [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2303.36s)]
*  that it's perfect in Montecito. Welcome to Montecito time where we have champagne with fruit [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2307.6800000000003s)]
*  dollops inside of it at all hours of the day. But anyway, so why would she risk that news coming [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2313.36s)]
*  out by actively shopping? It doesn't make sense to me. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2319.92s)]
*  Well, she's a deeply manipulative woman, number one, and what she always has is a number of business [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2323.84s)]
*  contacts who are working on her behalf and just sizing up the potential future scene. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2329.44s)]
*  Certainly, there have been real bumps in the road when it comes to the marriage over the past couple [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2336.88s)]
*  of years. And remember, there was also a time when it didn't necessarily look as if Netflix was [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2342.0s)]
*  going to stand by her. They already lost the Spotify deal where she was described as effing [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2347.36s)]
*  grifters. And yet, totally. I mean, this is the problem, Megan. Sometimes these things that I end [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2352.16s)]
*  up reporting about, Megan, Michael, they do sound too crazy to be true. And there was that moment [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2357.84s)]
*  when it appeared within the Vanity Fair profile. I was absolutely delighted because I was like, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2364.88s)]
*  okay, this is good. It's not that I believe in the mainstream media necessarily, but I'm like, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2369.52s)]
*  no, this is good because they did not come into this with an agenda. I think it's absolutely fair [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2376.96s)]
*  to say now that I do have an agenda where I'm not pro-Harry and Megan. They totally tried to [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2382.08s)]
*  ruin my life and destroy me because I revealed the truth about their exit from the royal family. And [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2387.68s)]
*  that's something we've gone into previously. We don't have to do it again today. But I think it's [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2393.7599999999998s)]
*  absolutely fair to say, you know, I'm not a fan of these two, right? But Vanity Fair, they went [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2398.24s)]
*  in with a completely clean slate just to find out what the state of their relationship was like. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2403.6s)]
*  Now, in fairness, Vanity Fair also reported that for the moment, the marriage is on track and are [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2408.4799999999996s)]
*  still very physically attracted to each other. I think that is something that doesn't quite tell [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2414.56s)]
*  the full story, which is that Harry knows that this marriage is all he has. And he also knows [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2421.12s)]
*  that if the marriage were to end while the children were still young, because of the way [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2430.64s)]
*  the law works in California is he would not be able to take those children back to California. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2437.04s)]
*  So of course he is going to try and make the marriage work. But the idea that this is some [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2441.12s)]
*  sort of happy union, yeah, back to the UK, sorry. But the idea that this is some sort of happy union [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2445.92s)]
*  is for the birds. He's a very troubled guy. He's a very troubled soul. People are very worried [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2451.2000000000003s)]
*  about him. But the problem is the idea that his brother is going to run in and save him this time [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2456.8s)]
*  is just unfortunately not going to happen. Not true. Okay, two things here. Indeed, is the piece [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2464.0s)]
*  from the Vanity Fair cover story from February 2025 inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's big [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2470.88s)]
*  business ambitions five years after their royal exit quote, a few years ago, a rumor began [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2475.6800000000003s)]
*  circulating around the book world about another perspective project for Meghan. This story, which [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2480.0s)]
*  a person with knowledge confirms the broad details of was that Meghan's team had a conversation with [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2485.44s)]
*  a publishing house to gauge interest in the idea for a potential book. The concept for which there [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2490.16s)]
*  was no written or formal proposal was post divorce, not a general book on life after marital dissolution [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2495.44s)]
*  or one about Meghan's past experience. This book, this notion of a book really might center on a [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2502.56s)]
*  post Harry divorce, not that there was actually one in the works, just if this, if this a, a [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2508.48s)]
*  priority divorce ever came to be, would this publisher theoretically be interested in a book [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2517.04s)]
*  that took place in its aftermath? Unbelievable. I totally miss this. Another source with knowledge [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2522.88s)]
*  says if that's true to any degree, she would have been approached and not vice versa. No offer was [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2527.36s)]
*  ever made and no manuscript was produced. After all, there was no divorce, but that doesn't mean [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2533.52s)]
*  they didn't shop the interest on what, you know, there would be in a book. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2540.0s)]
*  Absolutely true. And actually Vanity Fair sums up pretty well how it works. You know, it's like, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2543.6s)]
*  would you be interested in this? Maybe. But you know, Meghan screwed it all up now anyway, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2549.7599999999998s)]
*  because she had Ari Emanuel at WME trying to save her career. And he got so frustrated because she [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2554.56s)]
*  was not listening to his advice. So this is the problem. You know, it's a long, long line of [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2560.56s)]
*  disappointed Meghan Markle, helpers, fans, friends, staff, et cetera here. So contrast all of that [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2565.92s)]
*  with the way she talks about H and their relationship here is it, is it, is it 46 or 47? Lauren, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2573.44s)]
*  you choose, go for it. 47. Are you in love now more than ever more than you've ever been? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2582.56s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you have to imagine at the beginning, everyone is like butterflies and, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2589.6s)]
*  and then we immediately went into the trenches together. Yeah. Right out of the gate, like six [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2595.04s)]
*  months into dating. So now seven years later, when you have a little bit of breathing space, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2602.72s)]
*  you can just enjoy each other in a new way. And that's why I feel like it's more of a honeymoon [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2609.68s)]
*  period for us now. Do you think you'll be married forever? Yes. I have a letter. He's also a fox. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2613.92s)]
*  If you haven't noticed, my husband's very, very handsome, but he's, his heart is even more beautiful. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2624.32s)]
*  I love that your eyes are sparkling right now. Oh, oh my God. Dan, I threw up in my mouth. Yes. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2631.12s)]
*  Dan, when you do interviews on your show, do you do the Jamie Kern Lima reactions? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2639.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes. Oh my God. There's something wrong with her. What communicates like that? She's that. She's the [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2647.28s)]
*  only thing saving Meghan Markle because between the two, she's even weirder. But Meghan Markle, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2653.12s)]
*  this, this is a tell. Okay. This is a tell. It's the same way on Valentine's day. You see people [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2658.6400000000003s)]
*  post like my rock, my life, my life partner, the person who saved me, guarantee that guy is cheating [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2665.36s)]
*  on her and she knows it. Like nobody does those over the top, like crazy, right? It's like, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2673.44s)]
*  maybe here or there, but like this is how she always tries to sound and talking like, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2679.44s)]
*  and he's a fox. Like there's something wrong. That seems obvious. Oh, totally. I mean, there was [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2684.2400000000002s)]
*  nothing at all genuine about her response to Prince Harry then she's someone who very much [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2690.56s)]
*  reacts to what's in the media. I mean, that was another big life in the interview. She claims [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2697.36s)]
*  she didn't look at the media or social media, but everything she does, everything she shows [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2701.04s)]
*  is in direct reaction. So for example, even the new birthday poach post with Archie in his pajamas, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2706.16s)]
*  which is all a bit odd, makes the point that we held the birthday party a week ago. And that's [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2713.12s)]
*  because people like me are saying, what the hell Prince Harry is going to Vegas on the day of his [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2719.6s)]
*  son's birthday. What's that about? But I did just want to pick up on one thing that she said in that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2726.0s)]
*  interview, in that clip that we just saw, because I think it is the thing that has really shocked [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2731.2799999999997s)]
*  Royal sources. Did you hear her say that when she was first with Harry and she's talking about her [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2736.4s)]
*  time in the Royal family, we were in the trenches. Now, remember we just celebrated the 80th [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2741.68s)]
*  anniversary of VE Day in the United Kingdom. Now in the trenches, that's obviously not referring [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2747.84s)]
*  to World War II, it's referring to World War I. And when you think about what those soldiers [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2753.6800000000003s)]
*  went through, my great grandfather was in the trenches in World War I, he did survive, but his [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2759.36s)]
*  life was ruined, Megan, because they were gassed. They lived in the most unimaginable conditions. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2764.8s)]
*  And the fact that this woman is so narcissistic that she can genuinely compare living in Kensington [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2773.36s)]
*  Palace, right, then moving to Windsor Castle after a multi-million dollar renovation to being in the [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2781.92s)]
*  trenches. I'm sorry, you're a sick human being. There's no way you can be helped because it's the [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2791.1200000000003s)]
*  opposite of what someone who cares about public service or what someone who wants to be Royal [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2799.28s)]
*  should do. And I just compare and contrast with the members of the Royal family who we've seen [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2805.6800000000003s)]
*  over the past couple of days be with these veterans of World War II because knowing full well, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2809.84s)]
*  they're not going to be there, Megan, for the next big celebration of VE Day, 10 years, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2815.92s)]
*  because all of these veterans are now in their late 90s or early 100s. And we saw Prince George [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2822.2400000000002s)]
*  and King Charles. I saw that. Prince William brought Prince George and Prince George was asking [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2827.04s)]
*  situationally appropriate questions of the veterans. They were thoughtful and sensitive. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2832.4s)]
*  They were wise not to bring Prince Louis, but the next in line after Prince William was [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2838.56s)]
*  so appropriate and thoughtful and caring. They look great as they always do. They seem like [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2845.36s)]
*  genuinely good people. And she looks like the narcissist that she obviously is. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2850.16s)]
*  Yeah. And it's don't you think it's odd? I mean, Megan, I know you are very careful with your [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2855.6s)]
*  children, but don't you think it's odd that Megan Markle talks this big game and Prince Harry talks [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2861.4399999999996s)]
*  this big game about the evils of social media and then they've decided to post Prince Archie [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2866.8799999999997s)]
*  in his pajamas? I mean, to me, that's really weird. It's a really odd decision. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2872.0s)]
*  She really needs to make a decision. It's like she wants, she loves being the mother of a prince [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2878.8799999999997s)]
*  and a princess. She loves that so much. And she knows that people in the UK, especially, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2883.76s)]
*  would love to see them. They have a connection to the royal family. They don't like her, but I don't [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2890.1600000000003s)]
*  think anybody would hold it against her children. They'd like to see the lineage and they're [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2895.36s)]
*  technically, I guess, in the line of succession if many, many bad things would happen. So she just [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2898.88s)]
*  teases them. It's like, here's just the back of his head, even though she's making public figures [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2904.6400000000003s)]
*  out of them because she talks about them all the time and Harry uses them, my father's [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2909.84s)]
*  grandchildren, as a cudgel. So they're happy to use these children at every turn, whether it's to [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2915.6800000000003s)]
*  make money or to make threats, but just to tease, you know, because what, I guess we can't see their [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2920.7200000000003s)]
*  face unless it's on Netflix, in which case it's fine. Because they do put out pictures of them [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2925.6800000000003s)]
*  once in a while. I mean, it's really bizarre. They've shown their faces before. So, yeah, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2930.32s)]
*  exactly. And this is actually going to end up becoming a political issue in the United Kingdom [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2935.6s)]
*  Mayhem because there is now overwhelming public support for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to be [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2941.92s)]
*  stripped of their HRH titles. And there are also serious question marks about how on earth can [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2949.36s)]
*  Prince Archie and Princess Eliebette remain in the line of succession? They are there. Now, remember, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2956.08s)]
*  the late Queen Elizabeth II, she used to hate Prince William, driving around with his family [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2961.44s)]
*  in helicopters because he'd do it. He'd go to one of the castles because, you know, he was a pilot [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2967.6s)]
*  and he loved it. So he'd go to one of the castles and he would pick up all three children and [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2972.96s)]
*  Catherine in a helicopter or they would fly together on the same plane. The late Queen [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2978.64s)]
*  Elizabeth II was infuriated by it for good reason, Meghan, because actually we are only one tragic [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2984.08s)]
*  accident away from the end of the monarchy because the British public simply would not accept [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2990.4s)]
*  King Harry and Queen Meghan. But that is where, you know, when Prince William takes us, and look, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=2996.48s)]
*  I'm a big fan of Prince William, right? I, on the whole, think he's doing a really good job. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3004.7200000000003s)]
*  He is highly irresponsible, allowing his entire family to continue traveling on the same plane [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3009.6800000000003s)]
*  because King Harry, because remember, once William is on the throne and before George has children, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3017.28s)]
*  you know, it is, it's William, George, Charlotte, Louis, then Prince Harry. So the whole idea and [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3026.88s)]
*  why the late Queen Elizabeth II would never be on a plane with Charles is to protect the line of [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3035.44s)]
*  succession. Now there are loads of other reasons why Archie and Lilybeth should not be in the line [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3041.84s)]
*  of succession. Obviously we love our American cousins, but you've got to admit it's pretty weird [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3049.5200000000004s)]
*  there being a potential future Queen of England who has this hugely American accent, if you were to [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3055.0400000000004s)]
*  believe Meghan's very odd Instagram videos, which I'm not sure I do, but if you do believe that is [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3061.0400000000004s)]
*  Lilybeth's real voice, she has a broad American accent. She has a father who says that he's, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3067.28s)]
*  she's never going to be able to come to the country at all. And she hasn't met her grandfather, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3073.0400000000004s)]
*  the King. Why on earth should that person be in the line of succession? So this is potentially [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3080.32s)]
*  going to become a political hot potato. Politicians in the United Kingdom have avoided talking about [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3086.6400000000003s)]
*  this for some time, but for example, Nigel Farage just yesterday at the VE Day celebrations, and [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3091.84s)]
*  you'll know Meghan, he is now the bookie's favorite to be the next Prime Minister of the United [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3097.6000000000004s)]
*  Kingdom. And he was highly critical of Prince Harry and that interview. So I think increasingly, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3103.52s)]
*  there is going to be more pressure put on the King to do something about this. The problem is there [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3110.48s)]
*  has to be an act of parliament to actually remove the titles from Harry and move Harry and the [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3116.08s)]
*  children from the line of succession would have to go to parliament. Well, what about the use of [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3122.16s)]
*  HRH? Because we saw in her interview with this Jamie Kern Lima, that they were celebrating what [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3126.64s)]
*  what a thoughtful person Meghan was, that she had sent this Jamie a gift basket. And we saw in the [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3133.44s)]
*  picture of it, her stationery, it says, Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex, and it's got a [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3141.2s)]
*  little crown insignia. She loves being a royal. She just doesn't want to do any of the work. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3149.04s)]
*  I mean, this is disgusting, right? This is truly disgusting, because the San Gennem summit was an [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3157.8399999999997s)]
*  agreement with Queen Elizabeth II. So you would think if nothing else, given all of their public [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3163.6s)]
*  posturing over how brilliant the late queen was, you would think Harry and Meghan would respect [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3169.44s)]
*  that agreement, right? And that agreement was very clear. What the late queen wanted to avoid was [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3173.6s)]
*  that situation. Do you remember before Diana died after her divorce, she was stripped of her HRH [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3178.96s)]
*  title, and she lost her security. And after Diana's death, there was a massive backlash. It was the [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3185.92s)]
*  closest that the late queen had come to ever losing the support of the public, because it all just [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3192.88s)]
*  felt a bit cruel, right? Why did Diana have to lose her HRH title when she was still the mother [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3197.76s)]
*  of a future king? And so in this case, the late queen thought, well, maybe we can do this differently. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3205.1200000000003s)]
*  We won't strip Harry and Meghan of HRH, but we will have a hard and fast agreement where they will [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3212.4s)]
*  just never use the titles. They will never use them. And it wasn't just that they would not use [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3218.7200000000003s)]
*  them for commercial purposes. The agreement, and I've gone back, it's still on the Buckingham Palace [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3223.2000000000003s)]
*  website, was that they would never use the titles at all. Yeah, because that's what they're claiming. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3227.12s)]
*  Oh, no, the agreement was that we wouldn't use them professionally. Yeah, that's a personal gift. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3232.48s)]
*  That's a lie. The agreement was they would never use the titles at all. Also, though, Meghan, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3237.44s)]
*  don't you have to be a really messed up individual to send your mate, by the way, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3243.2s)]
*  she literally just sent you punnets of ice cream, right? I mean, nice thought. I'd appreciate you [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3249.2s)]
*  sending me some punnets of ice cream. Very nice. But how weird to send a few punnets of ice cream [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3254.32s)]
*  and sign it off HRH. I mean, look, she's a messed up human being. You've got to have that. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3260.48s)]
*  I'm going to send you ice cream and I'm going to sign it. The Time 100s, Dr. Meghan Kelly, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3266.96s)]
*  thanks to my Jewish doctor. That's just how I sign my things. I just want to make sure my titles are [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3274.4s)]
*  all properly accounted. It's so self-aggrandizing. But at the same time, if anything they've said [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3280.16s)]
*  about the royal family is true, anything, you wouldn't want those titles. You wouldn't want [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3287.6s)]
*  the link. The people who didn't care that I was suicidal wanted to kill myself and basically [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3291.2799999999997s)]
*  wanted me to do it. The people who tried to have my husband killed, who my husband is now saying [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3295.68s)]
*  would like history to repeat itself so that we could die. The people who were too racist to love [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3300.4s)]
*  my baby and really concerned about how dark his skin was going to be. I used a huge platform with [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3305.44s)]
*  Oprah Winfrey to tell the world about the people who live in the country that I think is racist [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3311.04s)]
*  because of Brexit. Those are the people to whom I am HRH, Duchess of Sussex. You'd want nothing to [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3315.84s)]
*  do with these titles. Totally. This is the problem. I think William has always been very conscious of [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3321.52s)]
*  this because you know William's a little bit woke. He's a little bit woke. He's into some of those [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3326.8s)]
*  woke things and he knows that you can only ever go so far down that path because if you really start [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3332.08s)]
*  turning into an activist when you're a member of the royal family, what you are basically suggesting [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3341.92s)]
*  is that the whole organization has to go and that also means you lose your whole fortune. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3347.12s)]
*  Harry, for example, has opened up the conversation of slavery reparations. Okay, then Harry, you [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3352.96s)]
*  give your fortune away because you are currently living off Princess Diana's money and the Queen [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3359.36s)]
*  Mother's money fundamentally, right? And lots of money that your dad's given you over the years. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3365.52s)]
*  So just be very careful what you wish for. But the fact that Meghan continues to use the crown [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3369.7599999999998s)]
*  and continues to use the HRH title is truly nuts. I mean, it does not add up apart from to say this [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3375.36s)]
*  is a deeply troubled narcissistic person who is manipulative and isn't particularly well [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3382.96s)]
*  and she has no sense of what she could do to actually win the public over again. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3390.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think we saw that throughout the show as well because it's like this is a great opportunity. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3396.96s)]
*  You know, Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive of Netflix, has decided to stand by Meghan. Now, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3403.6s)]
*  that is a really odd decision. I have my own suspicions about this, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3408.72s)]
*  Meghan, because Meghan Markle has befriended Ted Sarandos' wife. They are in a mixed race [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3412.3999999999996s)]
*  relationship. So there is some type of suggestion that Meghan was a little bit manipulative in terms [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3420.3999999999996s)]
*  of how she wormed her way into the personal life of Ted Sarandos because there's lots of other [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3426.56s)]
*  people at Netflix who look at Ted Sarandos and like, what are you doing? Like, these shows aren't [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3432.56s)]
*  even a success. Why are you- How to put pretzels in a bag. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3438.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And you're selling jam, which is not going to make you a lot of money, right? Even if [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3443.28s)]
*  you sell multiple, multiple, multiple jars of jam, that's not a big moneymaker for Netflix. So [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3451.04s)]
*  there's a suggestion that it's this personal relationship that Meghan has managed to sort [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3457.2s)]
*  out with Ted Sarandos via his wife. You know, they went to the Beyonce concert together at all. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3461.44s)]
*  It's sort of how Meghan plays things. That's the reason Netflix is standing by her. But without [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3466.08s)]
*  Netflix now, there really is nothing. And that is obviously a huge issue. Authenticity is everything, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3474.08s)]
*  as you well know, in this new world of independent media. And her podcast, Meghan, has dropped out [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3482.7200000000003s)]
*  of the top 100 within weeks, despite being the most publicized podcast in the world. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3488.56s)]
*  It's completely irrelevant. And listen, she's irrelevant too. The only reason we talk about [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3496.8s)]
*  her is because they continue to create this drama around the royal family, about which we do care. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3501.2s)]
*  Some of us in America really love following the royals and think they're fun and exciting. And [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3506.96s)]
*  it's not that we want to be ruled by them, but I love following the royal family. They're just fun [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3511.44s)]
*  and the history is interesting and they're beautiful. And it's just sort of like an escape [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3516.16s)]
*  of sorts. And we're still so proud of our royal family. And that's a big thing. You know, given [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3520.48s)]
*  the divisive nature of politics today, and I think we can all agree, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3528.16s)]
*  agree, sorry, that politics has never been more divided. Don't you think it's pretty incredible [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3532.64s)]
*  that in the United Kingdom, such an overwhelming majority of the country still supports the idea [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3537.2s)]
*  of this monarchy. It means a lot to us. And that's the reason. Because it's not political. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3543.12s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? That's why it's so important. It's not political. And it's like, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3550.96s)]
*  you came in, you stole the prince who actually was in our hearts because we saw him walk behind [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3554.88s)]
*  Diana's coffin as a young boy. And actually his popularity rating at one point was higher than [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3562.7999999999997s)]
*  the queen. Like we loved this boy. You came in, you turned them into a woke muppet, and then you [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3568.08s)]
*  tried to trash our royal family. So there is, you know, she is going to go down in history, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3576.64s)]
*  but for all the wrong reasons, exactly the same reason that Wallace Simpson went down in history [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3581.6s)]
*  for destroying another senior member of the royal family. I know these American women, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3586.48s)]
*  they don't have a great track record when they start to date the English princes and kings. It's [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3591.2799999999997s)]
*  sorry. But you know what? We are paying more than our fair share of the penance having these two [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3595.44s)]
*  stuck over here. And I have to say, I think this is probably another thing that Harry doesn't like [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3599.36s)]
*  about living in California is sure, you know, I'm sure when people first meet him, they're like, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3603.6000000000004s)]
*  oh, Harry, cool. But Americans are used to big celebrities, especially in California. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3608.1600000000003s)]
*  And they're not going to treat him the way the average Brit would if one of the princes of [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3613.76s)]
*  England came in. You know, it's just different here. We don't really love royalty. And I'm sure [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3619.44s)]
*  he misses the cache that comes with being Prince Harry and part of the royal family as you walk [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3624.08s)]
*  around Great Britain. It's not the same in Montecito. And by the way, there are people [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3631.84s)]
*  who are far richer and more famous than those two all over, especially that state. And I'm sure [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3635.92s)]
*  he doesn't love that. Well, no. And look at Taylor Swift, who you would argue is probably [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3642.56s)]
*  the biggest celebrity in the world today. Despite her botched endorsement of Carmel Harris, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3648.08s)]
*  she had a very clear choice and she chose William because Taylor Swift doesn't need to be friends [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3658.0s)]
*  with just another. Oh, yeah. Can you explain that again? I vaguely recall this, but I don't [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3665.28s)]
*  remember the specifics. So there was a moment when Taylor Swift had to make a very clear choice [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3670.96s)]
*  between Harry and Meghan and William and Catherine. So Meghan approached her. Do you [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3675.44s)]
*  remember when she was launching the archetypes podcast? That was her first podcast. And this is [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3681.36s)]
*  when not everyone had really turned. And Meghan actually wrote her a handwritten note in her [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3685.44s)]
*  calligraphy, really begging and pleading to be on the podcast. Right. And this was at a time when [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3690.8s)]
*  she was getting some decent names on the podcast, but Taylor Swift made a very clear decision that [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3697.6s)]
*  she had built up this relationship with Prince William and she stayed loyal to William. And quite [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3703.04s)]
*  recently in the midst of William's cancer battle, sorry, with Catherine's cancer battle, William [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3709.44s)]
*  took George and Charlotte to Taylor Swift's concert. They posed with selfies backstage. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3715.7599999999998s)]
*  Taylor wants nothing to do with Meghan Markle. And it's because people have had to make a choice. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3722.0s)]
*  And even this is the most interesting one to me, not a celebrity, but an awful woke politician. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3728.56s)]
*  I actually think this woman is evil by the way. Don't get me started on her. Jacinda Ardern, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3733.2s)]
*  the former prime minister of New Zealand, the country of my birth, who locked me out of the [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3737.04s)]
*  country of my birth for three years over COVID. But Jacinda Ardern, who Harry and Meghan had [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3742.56s)]
*  desperately tried to covet and formed a close relationship with, she also chose William over [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3748.16s)]
*  Meghan and Harry. Because as you say, people are always going to, you know, people who are [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3755.2s)]
*  either celebrities or senior politicians are always going to go for real royalty rather than [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3762.0s)]
*  fake royalty that comes with all of these other risks, which are like Beyonce, for example, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3769.3599999999997s)]
*  who at one point was very supportive of Meghan, furious that Meghan, I don't know if you remember [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3775.2799999999997s)]
*  in the Netflix series, read out the text message, the really cringe-worthy text message. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3779.84s)]
*  Yeah. And so Beyonce has turned down all of the offers to appear with Meghan or be on any of her [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3785.6800000000003s)]
*  shows. So I think they are really, really struggling. I mean, some rapper called Meghan [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3794.88s)]
*  the Stallion, who I have to say, I have never heard of, but apparently she's a big, big, big deal. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3800.88s)]
*  Dirty bird. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3805.36s)]
*  Dirty bird. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3806.08s)]
*  But she turned down being on Meghan's podcast because I think celebrities now actually know [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3808.4s)]
*  that there's no cache to being linked with Meghan Markle. In fact, it's probably only going to drag [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3814.16s)]
*  you down. And whereas being connected to William, you know, the future king and pictured with [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3820.4s)]
*  Catherine and having them at your concert or going to an event with them, that actually means [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3827.2s)]
*  something. So all of the A-listers, and there's a lot of them, I mean, Lady Gaga is another one, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3832.64s)]
*  they have all chosen to keep their loyalty actually with the real royalty. And I think even [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3837.6s)]
*  Oprah Winfrey is regretting her decision now to align closely with Meghan. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3844.3199999999997s)]
*  I hope they don't forgive her. I really hope William and Catherine remember what she did. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3850.24s)]
*  Again, when their grandfather was dying, she was terrible. And that was more terrible acting, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3855.7599999999998s)]
*  almost as bad as Meghan's fake tears were the Oprah Winfrey. What? What? What? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3861.36s)]
*  And it was all planned. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3867.84s)]
*  It was awful. Anyway, it's so fun to cover them because they're just ridiculous people and they're [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3869.28s)]
*  so easy to see through. So we have to do it when they give us this fodder. We have to go with it. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3874.7200000000003s)]
*  When they give us the ingredients, we bake the cake and nobody does it like you, Dan Wooden. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3879.36s)]
*  It's a pleasure. And you got to check them out. Check out his podcast. It's Dan Wooden [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3883.1200000000003s)]
*  outspoken. He's on his own now and he is outspoken and can be in a way that he never [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3887.2s)]
*  could when controlled by corporate media. And we support it. So good for Dan. Check [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3892.7999999999997s)]
*  them out wherever you get your podcasts for free. We'll see you next time. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3896.16s)]
*  The Riverbend Ranch is a two-mile walk from West Yellowstone. Unlike most ranches, Riverbend Ranch [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3917.2s)]
*  never uses growth hormones or antibiotics. They treat their animals humanely and with respect. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3921.68s)]
*  There are advantages of buying directly from the ranch. They can track the health of every animal [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3927.7599999999998s)]
*  from the day it is born and can guarantee that it has been healthy every day of its life. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3931.9199999999996s)]
*  Riverbend Ranch has its own state-of-the-art processing facility on the ranch that has [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3937.68s)]
*  received several national awards as one of the best in the U.S. But most importantly is the quality [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3942.4s)]
*  of the beef. They age their beef to perfection for 21 days. You simply cannot buy beef like this in a [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3948.1600000000003s)]
*  grocery store. You cannot ship directly from the ranch to your home. You get a much better price [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3954.4s)]
*  than going through the middlemen. Order directly from riverbendranch.com and use promo code Megan to [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta2VNlnDD6M&t=3959.52s)]
