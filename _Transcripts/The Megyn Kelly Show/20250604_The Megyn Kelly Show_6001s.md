# KJP Pretends to Be Independent, Elon Slams Trump's Big Bill, w/ Mark Halperin, Spicer & Turrentine
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Stay tuned because we have a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=0.0s)]
*  packed show for you today. Elon Musk publicly slamming president Trump's big beautiful bill, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4.24s)]
*  but the white house is sticking to its guns as the legislation makes its way through the Senate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=9.36s)]
*  Plus Jim Acosta holds a town hall in Washington DC that's so bad. It has to be seen to believe to be [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=14.0s)]
*  believed. Unfortunately, no one did see it because no one showed up. What happens when you throw a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=22.0s)]
*  party and no one comes? It's basically his high school experience relived all over again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=25.92s)]
*  We're going to get to all the news today with Mark Halpern, host of Next Up with Mark Halpern [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=32.32s)]
*  on the MK Media Podcast Network, which is crushing it, along with former White House Press Secretary [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=37.44s)]
*  Sean Spicer and former Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine. Together they are the hosts of Morning [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=42.88s)]

*  on in the world, politics, chaos, breaking news, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. But you know who's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  completely unbothered? Your cat. While we are stressing over headlines, they're plotting their [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=66.48s)]
*  next nap or next meal. And if that meal is not up to their standards, well prepare for a full blown [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=72.56s)]
*  feline protest probably on your favorite chair. I want to tell you about Smalls Cat Food made with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=78.48s)]

*  Guys, welcome back. All right. So we're going to talk about the big beautiful bill and the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Elon meltdown and all that. Well, we got to start with the news that just hit on Corrine Jean-Pierre [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=142.08s)]
*  reinventing herself as an independent. This from it's everywhere, but this is just from the New [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  York Post right up that she claims she's no longer a Democrat. She's coming out with a book, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=156.4s)]
*  a memoir, hyping says the New York Post, a quote, broken Biden administration. They go on to say [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=163.36s)]
*  that it's a tell all she's working on now. And it's going to be a look inside independent is the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=171.6s)]
*  name of it. A look inside a broken white house outside the party lines due in October has shed, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=177.52s)]
*  which is publishing it says she didn't jump here. Did not come to her decision to be an independent [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=185.04s)]
*  lightly. Uh, in this book, she may focus on her, her focus, her ire on figures aside from Biden [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=189.44s)]
*  quote. She has served two American presidents, Obama and Biden. She takes us through the three [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=197.76s)]
*  weeks that led to Biden's abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democrat party [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=202.0s)]
*  that led to his decision. The tease goes, and she's going to regale us with a hard hitting, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=209.44000000000003s)]
*  yet hopeful critique, defining what it means to be part of the growing percentage of our [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  fractured electorate that is independent, why it can be worthwhile to craft to carve a political [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=221.76000000000002s)]
*  space more loyal to personal beliefs than a party affiliation. And what questions you need to ask [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=226.96s)]
*  yourself to determine where you fit politically. You've got to be kidding me guys, Mark thoughts [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=231.68s)]
*  on this. Well, this could go any number of ways. Thank you. Thank you for having us back. I think, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=238.0s)]
*  I think I'm not sure how interested people are going to be on her view of being an independent. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=243.92s)]
*  I didn't see much independence from her as a spokesperson, but as Sean well knows, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=248.48s)]
*  in that job, you do need to say what the boss wants you to say. There's a lot of story to be [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=252.96s)]
*  told. Uh, you know, there's, I've got some information about, about what happened during [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=258.08s)]
*  those three weeks, but the no insider has really told the story. And a number of the people who [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=263.04s)]
*  were central to the cover up, and I don't think she was, or the attempted cover up have never [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=269.44s)]
*  really been held accountable. No one's really gotten to any of them to, to respond to what they [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=273.92s)]
*  did. So it's possible that this could be the next big beat in the question of the attempt to cover [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=278.24s)]
*  up Joe Biden's cognitive decline and the effort to keep the nomination, which is, you know, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  went on for several weeks until Nancy Pelosi forced his hand. So color me curious about her [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=291.12s)]
*  insider details, less interested in her view of what it means to be an independent. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=296.88s)]
*  What a lie. She's, I mean, Dan, you're a Democrat. She's, she's going to tell us what it's like to be [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=301.92s)]
*  an independent. Why don't you talk to the Megan Kelly's of the world who have literally voted [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=308.72s)]
*  until this last election, which put me over the edge on voting more for Republicans, but literally [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=312.8s)]
*  now I've done, I voted in nine presidential elections. God, I'm getting old. And I voted, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=317.76s)]
*  it was four and four, four Dems, four Republican votes up until I voted for Trump again this last [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=323.12s)]
*  time. So it was five now five Republicans, four Dems. I've been a registered Democrat. I've been [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=328.48s)]
*  a registered Republican, and now I've been a registered independent for 17 years. That's what [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=332.96s)]
*  an actual political independent looks like. Not like somebody who worked for two Democrat [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=337.36s)]
*  administrations until they got the stank of desperation all over them. And she ran for the [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=342.32s)]
*  hills trying to pretend she knows what independence is. Yeah. You know, just when I was hoping maybe [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=347.2s)]
*  we wouldn't have to talk about Joe Biden in the fall. Now I think we're going to be talking again [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=354.0s)]
*  about Joe Biden in the fall and what was going on. I assume she's becoming an independent because [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=358.0s)]
*  she thinks the party's too moderate. I mean, I'd be surprised if she comes out and says the party's [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=363.36s)]
*  become too liberal, which in my opinion it has. So I'll be curious kind of what her angle is. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=369.2s)]
*  But you know, you're right. I mean, it'll be interesting because as you and your viewers may [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=375.12s)]
*  know, she was in a lot of hand-to-hand combat with people within the White House who didn't [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=380.4s)]
*  think she was qualified, who didn't think that her performance was very good. They basically said she [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=385.52s)]
*  often had to read from the briefing book and struggled to answer on her feet. And you know, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=390.72s)]
*  she took a lot of pot shots. And so is she going to attempt to, you know, settle scores with people [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=396.64s)]
*  that she thought were not supportive of her performance? Obviously, she's going to talk [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=402.56s)]
*  about, you know, those three weeks and what they were doing. But to Mark's point, I mean, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=407.44s)]
*  I'm going to be very curious which direction she goes. And of course, this is just going to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=412.64s)]
*  bring it back to the center as the party heads into the midterms and tries to move past the debacle [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=416.8s)]
*  of Joe Biden and have to re-litigate what was going on inside. It certainly sounds, Sean Spicer, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=422.48s)]
*  like she's going to stick a knife in the people that helped push Biden out from this line, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=429.36s)]
*  again from Hachette. She takes us through the three weeks that led to Biden's abandoning his [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=435.12s)]
*  bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic Party that led to his decision. It [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=440.8s)]
*  certainly sounds like she's still on Team Biden. And I guess we're going to get a bunch of nonsense [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=448.32s)]
*  about how he could have done it. Yeah, no, no, no particular order, but a few points on this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=452.16s)]
*  When you've lost Cringyump here as a Democratic Party, you're in big, big trouble. I mean, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=458.48s)]
*  it should not be this easy for us because I can't believe if she doesn't stick with them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't know who that leaves you with, David Hogg. This is a problem. By the way, just for the record, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=469.20000000000005s)]
*  this is her second memoir. I was just Googling this. She's only 50. I didn't think you could [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=474.72s)]
*  write two memoirs that quick back to back. Look, here's the deal. I'll just put this out there. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=479.44s)]
*  If you buy this book, then you should take singing lessons from me. And if you saw me dance, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=485.52s)]
*  the singing's way worse. Because if you are dumb enough to believe that she's giving you any insight [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=492.08s)]
*  into what was really going on, then you really should turn to me for singing lessons. It's not [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=497.12s)]
*  good. I mean, she was literally the most epically unqualified person to hold that position. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=501.84s)]
*  So if you are looking for her for any kind of insight or understanding as to what was going on [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=508.96s)]
*  considering how unqualified and lack of access that she'd gotten, that's on you for wasting the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=513.68s)]
*  $27.99. The way they pitch this is like, it's incredible how they're talking about her. I don't [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=519.04s)]
*  recognize the person they're describing. They write from the promo from Hachette on this, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=527.04s)]
*  a hard-hitting yet hopeful critique. She defines what it means to be part of the growing percentage [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  of our fractured electorate that is independent. And then she says, they say, as a history maker, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=539.92s)]
*  veteran public servant, political analyst, and independent theaker. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=547.52s)]
*  By the way, the pitch went something like this. All right. If Jake Tapper can sell a book about [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=555.8399999999999s)]
*  the original sin, then why can't I be independent? I mean, that's how that went down, just to be [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=562.0s)]
*  clear, because there's no way that anybody thinks she's any of those things. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=567.92s)]
*  You have had press secretaries, yourself included, Dana Perino, Kayleigh McEnany, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=574.9599999999999s)]
*  Tony Snow back in the day, who are smart people. Ari Fleischer, who are not really, let's face it, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=580.56s)]
*  utter morons who are just out there as mouthpiece. Obviously, Caroline Levitt, too, very smart person. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=588.7199999999999s)]
*  But, Karine Jean-Pierre is not on the list. All right. Even Jen Psaki, she's not a moron. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=595.2s)]
*  But Karine Jean-Pierre is a total moron. You only need to have watched her for two days to have picked [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=599.76s)]
*  that up. Any random days throughout the entire four years of Joe Biden. Pick your days. It doesn't [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=604.96s)]
*  matter. You will see a complete moron up there. So there is literally nobody in the country who [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=609.44s)]
*  wants to hear her political analysis on anything. And just in case you doubt me, we just put, this [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=615.2s)]
*  is a short little clip just to remind you of what we were subjected to during those very, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=622.32s)]
*  very painful four years. Watch. The NORAD is part of like a part of a, it's a, it's a, what you call [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  a coalition, a course of nation. So it's a pact. Exactly. We did it in, in, in clearly in, in, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=633.44s)]
*  in step with the Canadian. Three US winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize, who won the Nobel Prize in [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=640.08s)]
*  Chemistry, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics, and who won the Nobel Prize. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=647.6s)]
*  Noble. She thought it was noble. She said it so many times, you know, and she thinks Canada is [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=654.08s)]
*  called Canadia. Go ahead, Mark. Well, two things. One is it's really unfortunate that they gave her [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=658.16s)]
*  the job because she did make history. A black woman as press secretary makes history. They gave it to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=664.96s)]
*  someone who wasn't qualified for the job. And that's not a denigration of anything but her [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=671.84s)]
*  and the people who gave her the job. It's really, really unfortunate. They, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=676.4s)]
*  she should have been smart enough to turn it down. They should have not given it to her. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=680.4s)]
*  And, and so it's going to be interesting to see how she explains. And we've talked about this in [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=685.12s)]
*  the morning meeting. Sean's been particularly pointed on it is what was her role because she's [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=690.9599999999999s)]
*  the one who said Joe Biden talked to a dead Congresswoman at an event because quote, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=695.6s)]
*  she was top of mind, top of mind, right? So I'll be curious to see how she [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=701.76s)]
*  addresses her role in standing at the podium and not telling the truth to the American people, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=706.0s)]
*  who by the way, didn't need her to tell the truth because they could see with their own eyes, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=710.24s)]
*  his cognitive decline, the pub date September, right? Yeah, October, they said October. So I [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=713.68s)]
*  wonder if it's done because most publishers demand this ridiculous three months in the can [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=720.32s)]
*  before they can publish a book. So clearly she's been working on it for a while. And, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=725.68s)]
*  and I wonder if she had a ghostwriter, but I know for a fact that there are lots of people in the [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=730.72s)]
*  White House who will be worried about this because they recognize that it was a mistake to give her [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=736.88s)]
*  the job. They tried to work around it. They wanted John Kirby, the national security spokesperson, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=741.92s)]
*  to do more briefing. She was very territorial about that. So there are people who did not [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=747.12s)]
*  treat her great. And I suspect that there may well be a correlation between who comes off poorly in [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=751.84s)]
*  the book and who didn't give her the respect she thought she deserved. 100%. Megan, real quick, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=757.04s)]
*  to Mark's point, I just, I just want to say this. If you are a person, look, I will admit, I made [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=763.12s)]
*  several mistakes during my tenure. I've been very open about that. You and I actually had a very [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=768.16s)]
*  frank discussion back when, when I published my first book about this, but I'll say this, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=772.56s)]
*  if you are concerned about how I describe certain things and then don't share equal criticism about [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=778.0s)]
*  her complicity in covering up the cognitive decline about Joe Biden and lying about it, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=786.08s)]
*  then your priorities are backwards. And the idea that all these people that, when I left the White [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=791.76s)]
*  House, talked about banning me and canceling me, and then are now trying to figure out what [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=796.64s)]
*  opportunities to give her after she blatantly lied about his cognitive abilities and his physical [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=800.96s)]
*  abilities. Because remember, one of the quotes was, he runs circles around me. He tires me out. I [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=807.76s)]
*  actually think maybe she should get some like checked by a doctor, because if that's the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=812.8s)]
*  problem, then she's got some serious health issues. Not Joe Biden's doctor though. No, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=816.56s)]
*  think about that. Let me just stay with you for a second on this, Sean. After the Trump administration, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=821.04s)]
*  Trump 1.0, they put Trump's staffers through hell. They had more subpoenas dropped on them. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=825.5999999999999s)]
*  They were dragged into these phony criminal cases. Look what happened to poor Hope Hicks. They made [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=834.8s)]
*  her take the stand at that ridiculous show trial in New York City. Made his former staffers testify [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=840.4s)]
*  against him, not to mention just all the subpoenas around January 6th. They got dragged in front of [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=848.0s)]
*  Congress, all these hearings. Where are the congressional hearings on the cover-up of the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=852.0s)]
*  Biden mental decline and the subpoena and the shunning of Corrine Jean-Pierre? Mark clearly [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=856.48s)]
*  wants to weigh in, then I'll go back to you Sean. Well, just they may be, those subpoenas may be [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=862.0s)]
*  coming, but the thing that's not on your list is employers in Washington and in New York were told, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=865.6s)]
*  do not hire these people. If you hire these people, you will be in trouble. People wanted to give [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=871.52s)]
*  people with Trump 1.0 experience positions at universities and they were told no, you cannot [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=877.28s)]
*  work at a university. And now it's a totally different story. I got protested everywhere I [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  went when I did get one or it was like, hey, can we run this agreement through a shell company, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=889.52s)]
*  in Abu Dhabi and then we'll allow you to do it after you sign the NDA. And they're openly not [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=894.48s)]
*  even asking the questions of her and Saki. They both lied to our face. They lied about his abilities. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=898.96s)]
*  They continue to lie and nobody says a word. It's one thing, by the way, they're not even saying, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=905.6s)]
*  well, we kind of saw it now. They're sticking by those lies. And Mark pointed this out earlier. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=910.0s)]
*  These are things that we all saw for ourselves. So they're not even trying to come clean now and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=914.88s)]
*  play it, do a tapper, which is, oh, but I didn't realize the extent of it before, right? They're [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=920.32s)]
*  not even trying to make excuses. They're sticking by the lies that they told then. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=924.72s)]
*  And that's going to be the headache in October. She got the same problem, Dan, that Pete Buttigieg [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=929.2s)]
*  and others who were in the Obama cabinet, sorry, the Biden cabinet are going to be facing where [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=935.7600000000001s)]
*  she's going to have to answer for the lies she told. We just pulled one. I mean, we could be [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=940.4000000000001s)]
*  here all day with her defense of Biden. He runs circles around me. We can barely keep up with him. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=943.7600000000001s)]
*  But here's just one of the ones late in the tenure on cheap fakes. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=948.96s)]
*  They are cheap fakes video. They are done in bad faith. And some of your news organization [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=957.0s)]
*  have been very clear, have stressed that these right wing, the right wing critics of the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=964.96s)]
*  president have a credibility problem because of the fact checkers have repeatedly caught them [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=969.36s)]
*  pushing misinformation, disinformation. Unbelievable. I say the same thing, though, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=975.04s)]
*  that I said about the Tapper Thompson book. Her job is to lie for the president. It's unfortunate, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=982.7199999999999s)]
*  but that's her job. The reporters in that room should have said, no, our colleagues running those [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=987.5999999999999s)]
*  videos are not running cheap fakes or deep fakes. They're running footage. But look, it's not like, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=993.36s)]
*  you know, Sean Spicer, I've never heard Sean Spicer come out and be like, every word I spoke [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1001.0400000000001s)]
*  as the as the press secretary for Trump was heartfelt and 100% accurate. I have not heard [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1005.36s)]
*  him try to spin us like that. He understands what that job was. And so do we. Her trying to come out [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  now and be like, I am a political independent and I see the corruption, Dan, of both parties. And I [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1017.44s)]
*  will be your leader to the promised land of owning your own personal beliefs as opposed to just blind [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1023.76s)]
*  loyalty to these liars in office. Yeah, I mean, you know, it has been cringe inducing on so many [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1029.12s)]
*  levels the last month or so. Once Jake Tapper's book came out and you had Elizabeth Warren, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1035.52s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, all these people who when asked, what did you know? What did you see? Literally, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1041.04s)]
*  and they tried to change the subject. And moving forward. Exactly. When everybody knows and knew [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1050.08s)]
*  what was going on now, this is going to come back up in October. I think, Mark, you make a smart [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1057.04s)]
*  point if she already wrote this and it was before all the kind of media dust up that we've had now [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1063.12s)]
*  the last month, it'll be very interesting if she does dig in and try to convince people like Joe [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1069.04s)]
*  Biden still that all was well, he should have never gotten out this ludicrous idea that he [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1075.2s)]
*  might have won. I mean, I think we might have lost 47, 48 states. I mean, the Senate would probably be [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1081.44s)]
*  63 to, you know, 37 or something of that nature. So Dan, Dan, who's this book for then? Like who [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1088.4s)]
*  you always have to think like who's the constituency. I mean, look, there's always a few, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1096.56s)]
*  you know, Japanese soldiers on the island after the war ended that kept going there. There are some [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1101.92s)]
*  in the Democratic base that, you know, want to never give an inch who think this is why are we [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1106.8s)]
*  talking about Joe Biden should all be about Trump and, you know, his mental capabilities. And [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1112.24s)]
*  I don't know. I think maybe she hopes she can, you know, buy a beach house or something if she [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1117.12s)]
*  sells enough books. But to Sean's point, who would buy this? I don't think. And that's the thing. I [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1122.56s)]
*  will tell you, I predict now that she doesn't hit five thousand in sales. Yeah, I don't think anybody [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1129.44s)]
*  buys this. No, because she doesn't have the access to know what really happened. Well, I mean, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1134.32s)]
*  she might sell a few copies if she if she does name names and dimes and people have. But I asked [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1139.2s)]
*  the same question about this book that I asked about most books, including ones by my friend. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1144.1599999999999s)]
*  What was the advance and how big is the first printing? Because if they bet big on this, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1147.76s)]
*  I think they're going to be disappointed. Oh, well, I will say this. I've done a book with [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1152.1599999999999s)]
*  Hachette. So I know this process. And I will say I exactly I agree with everything that Mark just [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1157.04s)]
*  said. They look at numbers very clearly on past sales. They were very clear. I mean, like I'm not [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1162.4s)]
*  going to get into what my advance was. But again, that's that's all predicated on that. And I just [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1168.16s)]
*  don't see her being able to say I can sell this to to these people because I don't know that people [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1172.5600000000002s)]
*  who are pissed in the Democratic Party want to buy a book that goes after John Kirby or Anita Dunn. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1178.96s)]
*  And that to me, that's inside baseball. That's that's a book club, not a chance. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1184.88s)]
*  Share screen and put up your book contract. Yeah, which one? I've done four. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1189.6s)]
*  She's never been an effective communicator. That was the irony of her being chosen for this role. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1197.12s)]
*  She never ever in the four years was able to get up there without reading, just reading whatever [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1202.08s)]
*  she'd written down before she got out there. She doesn't have the ability to speak off the top of [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1208.3999999999999s)]
*  her head extemporaneously. She's going to be a disaster on this book tour. If anybody even [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1213.68s)]
*  mildly presses her, it's going to be really uncomfortable. Hachette, you made a big mistake. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1219.2s)]
*  You could probably still get out of it. I don't know. But I remember when I wrote my book, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1224.0800000000002s)]
*  it came out in November of 2016. And the final changes had to be made by early August. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1227.68s)]
*  So that was a little bit of a window. And if hers is coming out early October, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1234.88s)]
*  she probably still can make some changes in the month of June to it. And she should write down a [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1238.96s)]
*  bunch of changes, which read as follows. Surprise. I'm actually not an independent. I'm still lying [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1244.16s)]
*  to you. I'm still the same old Democrat partisan hack. I've always been yours truly. Kareen, jump [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1249.44s)]
*  here. Okay, let's move on to the big, beautiful bill, which now the Democrats have come out with [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1254.96s)]
*  their own name for the big ugly bill, which is not clever. And it doesn't work in an alliteration way. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1259.5200000000002s)]
*  You've got to try harder. Dan, tell them they have to try harder. But what's happening around this [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1266.0800000000002s)]
*  bill is interesting because Elon came out and said this is an abomination and he's going after it [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1270.72s)]
*  hard. He said, I can't hold it in any longer. I've got to say how I feel. It's awful. It's full of [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1276.88s)]
*  pork. I hate it. And the White House is saying, we know he doesn't like it. And really Trump doesn't [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1283.3600000000001s)]
*  care is really what they're saying. It's passed. It's gotten through the house. It hasn't yet [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1291.04s)]
*  passed the Senate. But here's exactly what Musk posted yesterday. I'm sorry, but I just can't [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1297.68s)]
*  stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1304.24s)]
*  abomination. Shame on those who voted for it. You know you did wrong. You know it. It will massively [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1309.2s)]
*  increase the already gigantic budget deficit to 2.5 trillion, triple exclamation point, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1315.04s)]
*  and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt. Congress is making America [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1320.32s)]
*  bankrupt. In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1326.08s)]
*  which in this particular case would mean virtually every single Republican in the house. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1332.0s)]
*  And so far we believe virtually every single one in the Senate who are likely prepared to [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1336.96s)]
*  pass this thing, though that's slightly uncertain. So what happens to the BBB? Who would like to take [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1343.6s)]
*  that one? I'll go. No, I think it passes. I mean, look, in the Senate, look, there's two camps in [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1350.8s)]
*  the Senate right now. You've got the spend more types, the Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, who want [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1358.8799999999999s)]
*  more assurances, especially on the Medicaid front. And then you've got the sort of deficit debt group, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1363.1999999999998s)]
*  which is four or five. I mean, notably Ron Johnson, Rand Paul, Rick Scott. I think, look, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1369.28s)]
*  I think that this thing squeaks it out like it's supposed to, and then it goes back to the house. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1377.12s)]
*  So far what I've found been comforting in it is the Freedom Caucus, led by Andy Harris and several [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1382.24s)]
*  of those members, have not drawn a big line in the sand unless it's, hey, if you add more spending, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1387.84s)]
*  we're going to have a problem. So right now I think we're in a pretty good place. The bottom [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1393.28s)]
*  line is we have to extend those tax cuts and that's what's costing, quote unquote, a lot of money. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1397.36s)]
*  The way Washington works is that they say tax cuts cost money. So by extending the 2017 tax cuts, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1402.0s)]
*  that is scored as a cost. The second thing is, and we played this on the morning meeting this morning, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1408.8s)]
*  right now, and I have the exact numbers here, that we spend $695 billion as a country on Medicare, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1413.9199999999998s)]
*  $695 billion. If we keep going down the path with the reconciliation, we're going to spend $835 billion. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1421.2s)]
*  That's a lot more. In Washington, though, if you don't get as much as you want, that's called a cut. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1429.3600000000001s)]
*  The bottom line is $150 billion more in Medicaid is going to be spent under the House bill. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1434.88s)]
*  There is no cut in the bill and Republicans need to do a better job of articulating the importance [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1442.64s)]
*  of extending the tax cuts so that we don't have a tax increase. And secondly, what we're doing to [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1449.12s)]
*  reduce control spending and hopefully reduce the deficit. There's a bigger part of this with what [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1454.4799999999998s)]
*  they call the rescissions package, which is $9.5 billion in cuts. But these guys, they need to... [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1459.52s)]
*  That's... But rescissions package, forget the name, but basically it just says so far only $9.4 billion [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1466.1599999999999s)]
*  of the Doge cuts are being codified. But that's a pathetic amount. He was supposed to cut $1 trillion. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1473.36s)]
*  Doge and Elon said they'd be cutting $1 trillion. $9.4 billion? Please, Congress spends that in the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1480.32s)]
*  lunch hour. Go ahead, Mark. Yeah. Look, Musk is mostly right on the merits. And I get why [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1485.6799999999998s)]
*  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid fighting is a great story. It's interesting and understanding [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1492.32s)]
*  their relationship is interesting. But unless Musk does more and a lot more, three realities that [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1496.6399999999999s)]
*  were true before he spoke out are still true. The bill must pass. He can't fail. Failure's not an [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1502.72s)]
*  option or the Trump presidency is in huge trouble. So it will pass. The two is that there's very few [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1508.56s)]
*  Republicans in the House and the Senate who might possibly vote no. We're talking about in both bodies, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1515.6000000000001s)]
*  maybe 20. And this Musk didn't increase the number. And so they still have to round up most of those [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1520.48s)]
*  20. And then lastly, the bill is not perfect. They'll have to sell it as the best thing ever. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1526.8s)]
*  But it's not perfect. Some of Musk's criticisms are true. There's other things that are wrong [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1532.32s)]
*  with the bill from a public policy point of view. But they can't make it much better. If they did [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1536.32s)]
*  what Elon said, it wouldn't pass because the votes aren't there to do what he wants to do. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1541.04s)]
*  Because what he wants to do is interrupt the delicate balance that got it passed through the [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1545.4399999999998s)]
*  House and has it on track to pass the Senate. Yeah. What he also wants to do is get his EV [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1550.3999999999999s)]
*  mandates put back in. I mean, let's not forget the personal part of this, which is I'm not happy [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1554.96s)]
*  because you guys screwed me. Yeah. We're cutting all these green energy incentives that were very [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1560.56s)]
*  popular under Democrats and Trump is not into green energy at all. Go ahead, Dan. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1569.52s)]
*  Yeah. And he was very angry about this AI deal that was signed in the Middle East with Sam Altman [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1574.0s)]
*  as the lead, his kind of arch rival. So he's got some grievances. And I think so far, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1580.32s)]
*  Megan, no one has gone to war with Donald Trump in a primary in one. So unless Musk thinks that he [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1587.68s)]
*  can kind of square off with Donald Trump and defeat him in terms of proxies and primaries, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1594.3200000000002s)]
*  we talked about this earlier this morning. I don't see any way that he actually moves the needle to [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1600.5600000000002s)]
*  have somebody say, I'm with Musk and not with Trump. And I think you have the CBO score just [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1605.76s)]
*  came out that 10.9 million people would lose Medicaid. So if you do what Musk wants, that [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1612.24s)]
*  number goes higher. And one card's out, the whole pile collapses. So I just don't see how it stopped. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1617.92s)]
*  The thing about the Elon threats politically, like when before last November was they had the [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1626.48s)]
*  implicit backing of Big Daddy. What was scary about that pairing was Elon's money and Trump's [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1632.72s)]
*  political might. But now if forced to choose as these Republicans in the House and or Senate [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1640.88s)]
*  maybe have to, they're going to listen to what Trump says, not what Elon says. Trump is the one [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1646.3200000000002s)]
*  who can really hurt them, not Elon. 100%. What we know now is Musk is good at business. When he [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1654.0s)]
*  teams with Trump, he's good at politics, but there's no indication he's good at politics by himself. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1661.2800000000002s)]
*  Well, he's good at politics. He funds it. He pays for it. I mean, that's like saying, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1668.24s)]
*  like he's not even, it's like going to dinner. He funded the Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1672.48s)]
*  and he lost. He's just not that good at politics. He's good at a lot of stuff, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1678.72s)]
*  but there's no indication he's particularly good at this. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1682.72s)]
*  That's right. That's the thing. So it's like, and what he's really threatening here clearly is to [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1685.52s)]
*  vote against all of these. These are all Republicans. The Democrats are all going to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1689.76s)]
*  vote against this. So he's voting. He's when he's saying like they all need to be voted out. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1692.48s)]
*  He's talking about Republicans. So does he really want to spend all of his money getting [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1696.24s)]
*  Republicans out of the Senate and out of the house? He hasn't gone that far around the bend. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1700.64s)]
*  So I think that's an empty threat. And even if it's not, it's not going to scare these guys, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1705.04s)]
*  because when Trump wants them to vote for this BBB, I think they're going to do it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1709.04s)]
*  I will say this from Stephen Miller, who works for the president, deputy assistant. He says, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1714.56s)]
*  the BBB is not an appropriations bill. No, no, sorry. This is not the part I wanted to read. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  He writes the following. The lefty CBO says extending the 2017 tax cuts, preventing their [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1723.28s)]
*  expiration increases the deficit. Some critics have seen this figure and claimed or implied the [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1728.8s)]
*  bill increases spending. Even according to the CBO, the bill cuts spending over $1.6 trillion. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1734.08s)]
*  So when a libertarian, E.G. Rand Paul attacks the deficit impact of the bill, they're attacking the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1742.08s)]
*  tax cut. Honestly, accounted extending current tax rates has zero deficit impact, which is why the [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1747.68s)]
*  bill because of its spending cuts reduces the deficit. The bill has three principal sections, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1754.3200000000002s)]
*  tax cuts, welfare reform, and immigration and border security. It is a dream bill. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1758.48s)]
*  And really that piece of the border security is what is getting a lot of people on board because [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  Tom Holman has been jumping up and down saying, I need more money. If you really want me to start [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1770.3200000000002s)]
*  deporting people at the rates you're saying, I need more money. And that's in here. So I think [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1774.96s)]
*  that piece of it will be very popular. I still don't think it's going to change the deportation [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1779.28s)]
*  numbers dramatically. Does anybody disagree with me? Not dramatically, but incrementally and [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  consistently. I mean, this is a four year project and there's still lots of people they'd like to [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1791.6000000000001s)]
*  deport. They haven't gotten yet to the sort of the tougher choices of categories in a mass way that [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1796.64s)]
*  they'll have to make, but they certainly could deport more people with more resources. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1801.52s)]
*  I mean, that's true. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1807.6s)]
*  The bottom line is, by the way, on this, it's a philosophy, right? I mean, what Joe Biden did [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1808.32s)]
*  was say, come into the country, don't come. But if you do come, you're going to get a free hotel, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1813.36s)]
*  free gift cards, free phone, a ton of money, right? It was a way of life. What Trump has done is send [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1818.24s)]
*  a very strong signal that not only don't come, but if you come, we'll send you back. And that has [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1823.36s)]
*  acted as a massive deterrent for further legal aid. It's hindered the cartels and a lot of the [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1828.24s)]
*  other groups that had sort of persuaded people to pay hefty fees to come into, to try to come [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1834.64s)]
*  to America. And so Trump has really shifted the entire tone and turner of immigration so that [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1840.88s)]
*  people know that our country does not have open borders. We will not tolerate you coming over into [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1846.32s)]
*  our country. There will be no opportunity and you will be sent back. All right. So let me stay on [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1851.44s)]
*  the subject of immigration, illegal immigration, because there's a stunner of a story via The Daily [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1856.56s)]
*  Wire today. It's amazing when you think back, and Sean, you were there, but you think back on [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1861.6s)]
*  the amount of coverage the Trump administration got, 1.0, on the family separation problem that [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1867.52s)]
*  was happening, how some families were being separated. And that took up so much ink in 2017, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1873.84s)]
*  2018. Less covered was the Biden administration's separation program. And their reporting brings it [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1879.44s)]
*  down to one example, but this is happening all over the country, sadly. A 37-year-old illegal [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1889.28s)]
*  named Wilson Manfredo Lopez Carrillo was arrested by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office in [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1895.68s)]
*  Florida on May 22nd. What did this guy, Wilson Manfredo Lopez Carrillo, allegedly do? He took in [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1901.2s)]
*  at least one 16-year-old girl who herself was here illegally. She was a so-called unaccompanied [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1909.2s)]
*  minor who came across the border without a parent. And the Biden administration, rather than turning [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1917.28s)]
*  these children around or doing something to make sure that they were protected once here, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1924.72s)]
*  and they were here because of the open border and the invitation that you just outlined, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1931.04s)]
*  decided to place them with, quote, loosely vetted sponsors who had absolutely no relation to them. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1934.3999999999999s)]
*  They were literally taking young girls and putting them in the homes of single, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1942.6399999999999s)]
*  illegal immigrant men without vetting them. What could possibly go wrong? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1948.32s)]
*  Police said in the charging documents the victim arrived in the U.S. in August of 2023 as a 16-year-old. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1954.32s)]
*  Health and Human Services was in charge of these kids, and they put her in this guy's home. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1959.84s)]
*  The victim, quote, reported three instances of sexual battery, all occurring in February of 2024. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1967.36s)]
*  They go on to say that the suspect, Lopez Carrillo, grabbed her, took her into his bedroom, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1974.48s)]
*  removed her pants and underwear, proceeded to sexually batter her. Right? Police. A second [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1980.8799999999999s)]
*  incident unfolded similarly with the man offering her $100 to keep quiet, which she refused. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1985.52s)]
*  She did not report the incidents to police initially due to fear of retribution from the [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1991.12s)]
*  guy, of course. Redacted police statements suggest the adult woman who was in the house became [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1995.2s)]
*  suspicious and confronted Lopez Carrillo. The victim was given three days to leave the house [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=1999.12s)]
*  and sought refuge with a friend from the church. Police say they recorded a call where the victim [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2003.28s)]
*  called Lopez Carrillo and asked why he had assaulted her when she'd been a minor. He responded by [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2009.36s)]
*  attempting to justify his actions. He did not deny the incidents. He tried to downplay their [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2014.96s)]
*  significance. It sounds like they've got this guy dead to rights. And then even she confronted [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2018.48s)]
*  about the possibility of a pregnancy, and he mentioned giving her a pill. So it's, I mean, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2023.68s)]
*  this guy is, he looks guilty to high heaven. So now he's in jail and a judge has determined he is [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2028.4s)]
*  an illegal himself. And the Daily Wire reporting that more than 120,000 of these unaccompanied [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2034.48s)]
*  alien children entered the country annually during the Biden administration. 120,000 as part [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2041.28s)]
*  of a loophole that let illegal immigrants stay in the country if they said they were under 18 and [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2047.68s)]
*  not with their parents. They write there was, there were no safe homes waiting to take in [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2052.56s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of children. So the Biden administration began sending them to live in the [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2057.12s)]
*  homes of illegal immigrant adults who often were not related to them. It was impossible to vet them [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2060.88s)]
*  since the sponsors were illegal themselves. And since HHS is not a law enforcement agency. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2066.4s)]
*  Then they go on to say that HHS officials used makeshift vetting, such as having sponsors just [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2074.4s)]
*  text a picture of a foreign passport into HHS, but there was no way of knowing anything about them. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2081.84s)]
*  And most of them had never even been seen by a government official prior to the young girl or [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2089.84s)]
*  young boy being dropped off to them. Alejandro Mayorkas said after the children were delivered [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2095.6s)]
*  to these so-called sponsors, the federal government was no longer responsible for them. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2101.12s)]
*  He claimed that stopping the trafficking of children for labor was outside of my responsibility as the [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2104.64s)]
*  head of DHS. This is horrifying. And I don't see the wall to wall coverage now of the consequences [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2110.7999999999997s)]
*  of doing this, nor at the time when we knew it was a problem. And by the way, the Democrat party got [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2119.92s)]
*  behind it as part of their platform. They thought this was such a grand idea. Tell it to this 16 [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2125.84s)]
*  year old girl whose life has been changed forever. Here's why this is infuriating for two reasons. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2132.0s)]
*  First of all, every administration's policies that impact people, particularly kids, need to be [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2136.32s)]
*  scrutinized. And as you suggested, there was excessive coverage of the Trump policy in Trump [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2142.4s)]
*  1.0, but there needed to be a lot and there was. Infuriation, number one, the policy continued. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2148.88s)]
*  The policy continued and no one in the administration resigned over it. In fact, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2156.0s)]
*  the resignations were largely people who thought they were too draconian in how they were treating [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2160.1600000000003s)]
*  immigrant people coming to the country illegally. And the media is infuriating because it's obvious [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2164.48s)]
*  that this is one example, but an important one, of the inhumanity of the Biden immigration policy. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2171.52s)]
*  Having the open border, people dying on the way to get here because the border was open, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2177.52s)]
*  the way these kids were treated, it was an inhumane policy. And yet it was constantly said by the press, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2181.28s)]
*  well, the Biden policy may be flawed, but at least it's not inhumane the way the Trump policy. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2187.04s)]
*  They said it was affirmatively humane. And that was his stated goal in his executive orders, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2191.44s)]
*  undoing the Trump immigration policies on day one, that we want a more humane immigration policy. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2196.64s)]
*  Again, tell it to the young girls who are getting raped by their so-called sponsors. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2201.92s)]
*  Correct. And just say real quick, there's many other examples on the face of it. You don't need [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2205.92s)]
*  lots of facts to know that the Biden immigration policy was inhumane. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2211.52s)]
*  The fact is, when we talk about family separation in Trump 1, the reason that families were separated [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2217.1200000000003s)]
*  is that as young children, particularly women, girls, were brought over the border, if the two [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2223.0400000000004s)]
*  adults or single adult couldn't identify them in a positive way as being their child, then they were [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2229.76s)]
*  separated to ensure that that person wasn't trafficking the young girl in particular. That's [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2235.36s)]
*  happening so many times. That was literally the reason why this was occurring, because we couldn't [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2240.88s)]
*  confirm that an individual, a young child, was who they said they were or that who the parent or the [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  guardian said they said they were. So part of it was for their exact safety. This is the opposite of [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2251.36s)]
*  what Biden did. Allow them to come in and say whoever they wanted to say they were. When you [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2256.24s)]
*  meet with border officials, as I've done that in Arizona, they'll tell you stories of these young [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2261.04s)]
*  individuals. And not just kids, by the way, it's actually adults as well. They are brought into [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2266.0s)]
*  this country through a variety of restaurants and other hospitality organizations, check cashing, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2270.24s)]
*  whatever, where they're saying that there's this funnel. They get brought up, brought to cities and [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2275.6s)]
*  towns all over the country to perform these services, to work in different industries and [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2279.8399999999997s)]
*  different businesses that are run by cartels. This is well known. And what we were doing in [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2284.88s)]
*  the first Trump administration was trying to ensure that these people weren't brought in for [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2290.4s)]
*  nefarious purposes. Quite the opposite happened as you described. The Biden administration knew the [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2295.2000000000003s)]
*  same thing and said, let's take the guard rails off and just assume that they're all here for the [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2299.44s)]
*  right reasons, which we know by the very nature of how they're coming into the country isn't. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2304.56s)]
*  So what we're seeing right now, Dan, as Trump tries to clean up these messes that Joe Biden [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2308.48s)]
*  made is the Democrats are out on the street, the left out on the street, trying now to actively [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2315.76s)]
*  stop ICE as it goes from city to city and make arrests of people like this Lopez Carrillo, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2322.64s)]
*  trying to get them out of our country. And we saw some extraordinary videotape [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2331.84s)]
*  yesterday out of Minneapolis. It's South Minneapolis. It was just before noon. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2335.36s)]
*  This is near Bloomington Avenue and East Lake Street, which is near the whole George Floyd [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2341.1200000000003s)]
*  a Palooza problem where ICE officers and DEA and Minneapolis police, not to mention local sheriff [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2346.32s)]
*  and FBI were there looking for illegal immigrants and protesters came out. Witnesses had called for [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2352.48s)]
*  people to show up and they tried creating a human barrier. The crowd grew within minutes. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2360.48s)]
*  They tossed traffic cones and trash cans in the way of law enforcement vehicles. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2365.28s)]
*  They shouted at the officers to go home. We could see them laying hands on the cops and some of the [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2368.96s)]
*  videotape. Let's watch some of what we saw. A group right here trying to block the police [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2373.84s)]
*  from leaving. Once again, they threw out a bunch of garbage. Now people are trying to create a line [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2379.92s)]
*  out here to stop ICE and FBI. That's your city. So get the fuck out. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2384.72s)]
*  So that's what happened. The mayor actually came out after the fact. Jacob Fry, same guy who was [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2403.04s)]
*  kneeling at George Floyd's coffin with a mask on his face, said, by the way, this actually wasn't [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2409.36s)]
*  related to immigration enforcement. It was related to a criminal search warrant for drugs and money [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2415.52s)]
*  laundering. So why don't you just calm down? He was telling his own people, but this is how they [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2420.56s)]
*  responded. And we're seeing in other cities too, as ICE tries to go in there and do the job again [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2426.0s)]
*  of cleaning up the Biden mess. Your thoughts on it, Dan? Yeah, two things come to mind. The first is [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2431.36s)]
*  what you guys were talking about earlier in terms of the Biden administration and the press, kind of [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2437.28s)]
*  the Biden administration not accounting for these children, their terrible policy, the press not [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2442.32s)]
*  wanting to talk about it. The thought was that it was helping Democrats to push this under the rug, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2447.28s)]
*  to not give it oxygen, when in fact it was hurting us. Voters knew it. Voters were hearing about it [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2452.48s)]
*  because there's alternative ways, you know, alternative media platforms like your own that [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2458.8s)]
*  are immensely popular. So it wasn't being hidden. It was actually festering and becoming a huge [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2462.8s)]
*  political problem until the party realized too late. The second now is, you know, Democrats are [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2467.76s)]
*  all, all the rage right now in the party. If you're in, you know, K Street or you're going to all [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2473.44s)]
*  these compabs they're holding about how do we win again, is we have to make changes. We have to have [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2477.84s)]
*  ideas and we have to be bold. The thing that's missing is nobody wants to take the first step. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2484.6400000000003s)]
*  This is not even 80-20, it's 90-10, right? The public is overwhelmingly supportive of cracking [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2491.44s)]
*  down on drug dealers, of bad hombres, let's call them, and dealing with people who are here illegally. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2498.16s)]
*  It's one thing to say I object, you know, in terms of like just say you're on the Senate floor. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2505.04s)]
*  It's another thing to get in their way and stop federal agents from executing the law. Like that's [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2509.92s)]
*  politically insane. And I think this is where some, yeah, somebody needs to step forward. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2515.92s)]
*  There's a whole host of issues this applies for and say enough. We were wrong. They are right and [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2521.28s)]
*  support cleaning up the broken illegal immigration system. Yes, let's help. Let's help. I just want [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2528.32s)]
*  to give credit to the independent reporter, Nick Shirley, who was on the scene in Minnesota during [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2534.16s)]
*  that protest and was doing the reporting there. So good for him. Sorry, Mark, you were going to say? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2538.96s)]
*  Just some young reporter should put that video on an iPad and walk around Capitol Hill with a camera [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2544.16s)]
*  person and show that video to every Democratic member of Congress and say, what do you think? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2548.48s)]
*  Wouldn't that be telling? So you could go, you should definitely go to Hakeem Jeffries and ask [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2554.72s)]
*  him because he's out there right now trying to demand that ICE agents who are now some, in some [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2559.6s)]
*  cases, wearing masks, that they be identified. He wants them to be unmasked that they are masking [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2567.36s)]
*  to protect themselves and their families, which we'll get to in a second. And Hakeem Jeffries [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2575.6s)]
*  well knows it and nonetheless comes out and says this in Sot9. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2581.2000000000003s)]
*  This is America. This is not the Soviet Union. We're not behind the Iron Curtain. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2586.56s)]
*  This is not the 1930s. And every single one of them, no matter what it takes, no matter how long [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2591.68s)]
*  it takes, will of course be identified. And here is what the Homeland Security had said. Acting ICE [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2601.3599999999997s)]
*  director Todd Lyons had said 24 hours earlier, which made news everywhere. It was on our AM [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2609.3599999999997s)]
*  update. It was everywhere. He knew, he knew. He's objecting to the rationale that Todd Lyons provided [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2614.0s)]
*  acting ICE director in this sound bite. Here it is Sot10. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2619.28s)]
*  A lot of agencies were invited to come out two weeks ago in Los Angeles where we ran an operation [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2622.8s)]
*  where ICE officers were doxxed. So let's just say that again. People are out there taking photos [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2628.48s)]
*  of the names, their faces, and posting them online with death threats to their family and themselves. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2634.96s)]
*  So I'm sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I'm not going to let my [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2642.2400000000002s)]
*  officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line and their family on the line [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2646.72s)]
*  because people don't like what immigration enforcement is. They are wearing those masks [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2651.4399999999996s)]
*  because we ran an operation with the Secret Service where we arrested someone that was going [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2655.52s)]
*  online, taking their photos, posting their families, their kids' Instagram, their kids' Facebooks, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2660.08s)]
*  and targeting them. So let me ask, is that the issue here that we're just upset about the masks [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2666.7999999999997s)]
*  or is anyone upset with the fact that ICE officers' families were labeled terrorists? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2673.12s)]
*  DHS adding today, Sean, ICE officers now facing a 413% increase in assaults. That's why they're [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2680.72s)]
*  wearing the masks. Hakeem Jeffries, well aware of that fact. Well, wait a second. I thought that [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2687.7599999999998s)]
*  the Democrats love people who wore masks. They've been arguing for the last five years that everyone [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2693.92s)]
*  should be wearing a mask and now they're anti-mask. I didn't know that. Secondly, they didn't seem [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  to have a problem when all of the Antifa folks were running around vandalizing cities, destroying [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2703.04s)]
*  property, attacking folks. They didn't seem to be concerned that the criminals were wearing masks, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2707.92s)]
*  did they? And I think the last thing is, and this is what you talked to Dan about, at the end of the [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2712.16s)]
*  day, why are they not siding with law enforcement? This is so interesting to me. When I started in [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2716.56s)]
*  politics, the big differences were philosophical in parties and policy. We supported less government, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2722.48s)]
*  lower taxes. The Democrats were more government, higher taxes, right? Different approaches to [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2729.52s)]
*  different policies. Now they're basically saying, we're on the side of criminals. And I know that [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2734.08s)]
*  that sounds harsh to say, but at the end of the day, these people are in the country illegally. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2738.24s)]
*  So A, they broke the law and in many cases have broken another law. They're a member of a gang, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2743.7599999999998s)]
*  they're selling drugs, they're accused of something else. And the Democrats' concern [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2747.84s)]
*  is for the criminal, not the law enforcement individuals and their families who are putting [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2754.0800000000004s)]
*  their lives on the line to protect us and whose families are dealing with the consequences. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2759.36s)]
*  I never thought I'd come to a place in politics where one party would be for law and order and [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2765.6000000000004s)]
*  for protecting the country and the other side would be for open borders and the criminals. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2771.44s)]
*  And for doxing the children of ICE agents? I mean, Dan, these guys don't make a lot of money. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2776.48s)]
*  They don't have the kind of dough that would allow them to go out on the streets of America [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2780.3999999999996s)]
*  and protect us and also have a paid security guard back at home protecting their children [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2785.9199999999996s)]
*  because some lunatic leftist has doxed the family. That's why they're wearing the masks. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2791.8399999999997s)]
*  And yet they still offer identification to anybody when they're doing the arrest. They make clear that [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2796.9599999999996s)]
*  they say who they are, what agency they're with. It's not like they're trying to fool people [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2803.6s)]
*  that they're not ICE agents. They're just not showing their individual identities because of [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2807.6s)]
*  this. Yeah, look, it's complete insanity. I mean, I think you can have the political argument about [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2811.36s)]
*  how are we going to treat the 20 million people who are here, right? I think everyone, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2820.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump deserves tremendous credit for stopping the inflow at the southern border, right? It started [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2825.7599999999998s)]
*  at the end of the Biden administration. It did. Trump accelerated and has gotten it almost down [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2830.64s)]
*  to zero. So now the question is, what do you do with the 20 million people here, right? And I think [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2834.8s)]
*  some of them are truly like good citizens whose kids are in Little League and they own the local [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2840.0800000000004s)]
*  pizza stand or whatever. What do you do with those people? And then there are the people who are bad [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2845.1200000000003s)]
*  actors that we need to deal with. That's a public policy conversation that should be having on the [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2849.84s)]
*  airwaves and in newspapers. To get in the way of federal law enforcement is insane, right? I support [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2854.6400000000003s)]
*  the New York NYPD. They are trying to clean up New York City, right? Are all of them perfect? No, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2863.44s)]
*  okay? But as a rule, they're doing their job and they're trying their best. You want to debate [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2868.56s)]
*  Donald Trump on it, fine, but don't touch the agents. Don't try to interfere with what they're [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2873.76s)]
*  doing. Just as we said on January 6th, Capitol police were trying to protect the Capitol. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2878.64s)]
*  We can't turn around and say, go after these people. It's insanity. No. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2884.2400000000002s)]
*  Can I just say, politically speaking, politically though, Keem Jeffries is the leader of House [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2889.12s)]
*  Democrats. He's putting them in a box. It's one thing of AOC spouting off. She does that all the [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2894.64s)]
*  time and not everyone has to care. She's not in a position of leadership. But when Keem Jeffries [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2899.36s)]
*  says what he said about law enforcement, every rank and file Democrat, every candidate for office [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2903.7599999999998s)]
*  that they're trying to get to run has to answer for that and has to understand where the position [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2909.6s)]
*  of the party is. He's really screwing his own caucus when he does stuff like that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2915.44s)]
*  Well, and that's, you know, I'll just say this quickly, Megan. The problem Hakeem has is he's [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2918.96s)]
*  terrified of the base. Nancy Pelosi was of the base. The base trusted her. They gave her rope [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2923.36s)]
*  to kind of move the party to the middle and try to win elections. Hakeem's problem is he does not [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2928.96s)]
*  have the base. And so Sean, to your point, I bet in that caucus meeting, the majority of the party [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2934.48s)]
*  is saying WTF, Hakeem. Like, what are you doing to us? Because now we have to go home. That is a [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2941.92s)]
*  fringe element, thank God, I believe, in our party. But he makes it seem like they're the majority. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2948.16s)]
*  Right. So you're saying the base is still, that the base is normal or the base is not? I can't [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2953.36s)]
*  figure out within the Democrat party whether they're still normies or they've been completely [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2959.12s)]
*  taken over by the radical left. Unfortunately, it may be the latter, but we're working on changing [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2962.96s)]
*  that. We got a new sink tank. All right. There's one man who may be ready to take up that mantle. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2968.64s)]
*  You guys all know him. His name is Rahm Emanuel. We'll talk about what his plans seem to be [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2976.56s)]
*  after this quick break. More with Mark, Sean, and Dan. Don't go anywhere. And we've got to [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2980.8799999999997s)]
*  get to the Jim Acosta party, to which no one came. Let's talk about that car you own, but don't use. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2984.64s)]
*  The one you're paying to keep registered and insured that's taking up space out front and [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2992.72s)]
*  it's just sitting there doing no one any good. You have a choice. You can give Cars for Kids, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=2996.96s)]
*  that's Cars with a K, a call and have them take care of it for you. Just give them the info and [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3002.96s)]
*  they will come to you as soon as the next day and take that car off your hands at no cost to you. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3008.08s)]
*  Even better, they will turn that car into funds to help kids. So visit carsforkids.org.mk. That's [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3013.28s)]

*  They've been around for 30 years and they've done this over a million times. Call now or head on over [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3033.1200000000003s)]

*  although not, story involving some Chinese nationals here in the United States in the [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3050.7200000000003s)]
*  press today. You know, you hear this stuff, it's like straight out of a spy movie. You can't really [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3055.6s)]
*  believe this crap goes on, but it does. And the FBI is weighing in on it, Cash Patel in particular. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3059.84s)]
*  Here's the story, citing here the information from the New York Times and the Department of Justice. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3065.76s)]
*  Two people, Youngquin Jian, 33, and Zunyang Lu, 34, who are Chinese citizens, have been charged [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3071.04s)]
*  in a criminal complaint with conspiracy smuggling goods into the U.S., false statements, and visa [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3079.04s)]
*  fraud, according to the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3084.24s)]
*  It appears that the male half of this, Mr. Lu, has fled back to China, so he's probably not going [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3090.48s)]
*  to be facing justice anytime soon. But the female half of this couple, Youngquin Jian, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3096.08s)]
*  is in a whole lot of trouble. The FBI arrested her in connection with allegations related to [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3101.68s)]
*  the pair's smuggling into America a fungus called Fusarium graminarium, which scientific literature [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3106.56s)]
*  classifies as a potential agro-terrorism weapon. Ms. Jian was arrested and booked in the Federal [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3119.04s)]
*  Courthouse in Detroit. They were in a romantic relationship. She's 33, he's 34. The U.S. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3124.8s)]
*  authorities say when he arrived in the country carrying small bags of the fungus, which causes [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3130.8s)]
*  a disease that can cripple wheat, barley, maize, and rice, not to mention make animals and humans [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3137.36s)]
*  extremely ill, they were getting it on. And he tried to lie. A sharp-eyed customs agent at the [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3142.96s)]
*  Detroit Metropolitan Airport found the baggies, so right on, sir or madam. And Mr. Lu first denied [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3151.36s)]
*  that they were his. That's Vanessa, that's not mine. And eventually admitted to smuggling them [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3159.2000000000003s)]
*  so that he could conduct research on his little baggies at the University of Michigan laboratory [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3165.36s)]
*  where his gal pal, Ms. Jian, was working. According to the criminal complaint, he stated that while [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3171.6s)]
*  he was in the U.S., quote, he would have free access to the lab at the University of Michigan [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3177.44s)]
*  on some days. Other days, his girlfriend would give him access to the lab to conduct his research. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3182.0s)]
*  The complaint also offers evidence of another instance, an earlier one in which the pair may [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3187.44s)]
*  have smuggled material. Messages exchanged, listen to this, between the two indicate she may have [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3191.28s)]
*  successfully hidden material in her shoe on a 2022 trip, according to the complaint. Other messages [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3197.36s)]
*  cited in the complaint suggest that in early 2024, Ms. Jian arranged for another associate in China [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3205.6s)]
*  to mail a book with a plastic baggie hidden inside. They also say they have a written pledge they [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3211.2799999999997s)]
*  found of hers, pledging loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. This fungus can be not only very [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3218.72s)]
*  damaging to winter wheat crops, but can cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3226.4s)]
*  in humans and livestock. Cash Patel, head of the FBI, saying, on X, this case is a sobering reminder [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3231.04s)]
*  that the CCP is working around the clock to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate American [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3237.2799999999997s)]
*  institutions and target our food supply, which would have grave consequences. Putting American [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3242.32s)]
*  lives and our economy at serious risk, your FBI will continue working tirelessly to be on guard [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3247.36s)]
*  against it. I mean, I feel about this like the way I feel about a lot of women in my Connecticut town [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3252.48s)]
*  where they talk endlessly about their fellow female friends, more like their frenemies than [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3266.48s)]
*  that their friends. And we seem to want a relationship with China. We seem not to want [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3272.4s)]
*  to recognize that they are out to undermine us at every turn and they're buying up our agro [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3279.12s)]
*  and they've taken over our moviemaking industry, that they bought large portions of big sports [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3283.7599999999998s)]
*  like the NBA. And we want to pretend that this is fine, but they actually are out to get us, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3289.6s)]
*  Sean, and not just out to like take advantage of us, but like potentially to kill us and poison [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3295.3599999999997s)]
*  our food supply, which is a problem. Yeah. Well, look, that's the fundamental thing. China is in [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3301.8399999999997s)]
*  existential threat to our military and economic wellbeing. Full stop. They do it with TikTok. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3308.72s)]
*  You mentioned our agribusiness, our tech transfers, stealing our IP. I don't know why anybody needs [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3314.3999999999996s)]
*  to be reminded of this. They are our enemy and I'll give them credit. They stepped up their game, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3320.72s)]
*  right? With COVID, it was like, Hey, let's develop this in a Wuhan lab and send it over. This time [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3325.2s)]
*  they're like, Hey, let's just bring the fungus straight to America. Right? I just, this is [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3329.4399999999996s)]
*  unbelievable that we're still trying to figure out how to have a dialogue with them. They are [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3334.32s)]
*  our enemy. Now on a funny side, on a lighter note, Megan, I do, when I see stories like this, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3339.44s)]
*  I just imagine having to go in and brief the president on this and just having to be like, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3344.4s)]
*  Sean, you got to make it clear. There will not be a fungus among us. Like that would be the, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3348.48s)]
*  if there was a light part of it, but there's a serious, there's a serious piece of this that I, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3353.36s)]
*  I just, we keep trying to have this discussion about them being a responsible stakeholder [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3359.1200000000003s)]
*  and a win-win solution. They don't want to have that. They're, they want world domination. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3364.32s)]
*  We stand in our way. Like, just to be clear, this fungus was coming over to take out our ag [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3371.1200000000003s)]
*  industry, to wipe out our crops. If this doesn't come through at some point after COVID, nothing [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3376.2400000000002s)]
*  will. And I'm also thinking guys about the Marco Rubio policy of you're out of here. You're over [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3383.04s)]
*  here on a student foreign visa and I have any reason to suspect your interests are not consistent [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3388.8s)]
*  with those of us foreign policy. You're out. And he got all sorts of blowback for that, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3393.76s)]
*  Mark. But you look at these examples, like the university of Michigan, one of our best universities [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3398.96s)]
*  wide open to these Chinese nationals. Like come on in and bring your fungus. Why don't you smuggle [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3403.5200000000004s)]
*  it in your shoe? Terrific. And bring your boyfriend too. I love living in the freest country in the [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3407.76s)]
*  history of the planet. And I think it's important to understand and have relationships even with our [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3413.44s)]
*  most bitter rivals. But they must just laugh at us in Beijing. You talk about comic relief. They [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3419.6s)]
*  must just say, wait, wait, we just sent them over and the university of Michigan sent them up in a [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3426.56s)]
*  lab and they brought the fungus there and they're going to be able to, I mean, they just must laugh [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3430.64s)]
*  at us. And the balance between our security and freedom is, it goes back to the founding of the [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3434.3199999999997s)]
*  country. It's, it's super complicated, but there has to be a re-evaluation of the ease with which [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3440.56s)]
*  we're allowing Chinese nationals with loyalty to the communist party and spies to just waltz right [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3446.88s)]
*  into the United States, travel around the country, do whatever they want. If we try to spend spies to [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3452.48s)]
*  China, which we do, they make it a lot tougher for them. Yeah. Well, you even just look at the [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3457.76s)]
*  student visas. And this has come up down in the context of Trump's war with Harvard at the moment, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3462.4s)]
*  where he says he's trying to crack down on anti-Semitism. But we had a guest on recently [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3466.32s)]
*  pointing out that Harvard's, you know, it's at war, yes, with Jewish students, but it's a war with [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3470.7200000000003s)]
*  the West, with Western ideals. And we were talking about that, you know, how they're cracking down on [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3475.52s)]
*  foreign nationals at Harvard, which now are almost 30% of the student body, because they'll pay top [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3481.52s)]
*  dollar and Harvard loves it. So we're taking in half of China, educating them at our most elite [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3488.32s)]
*  universities. I mean, truly University of Michigan, Harvard, I'm sure the list looks very much the same [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3495.84s)]
*  at all of these top schools. And then saying, thanks so much for being here while we cash their [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3500.64s)]
*  checks, not wondering or monitoring whether they're hardcore anti-Semitic, whether they're [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3505.28s)]
*  part of the Muslim Brotherhood, whether they're smuggling deadly fungi into the country that [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3512.2400000000002s)]
*  they're going to use to cripple American farmers. Like our vetting program doesn't seem to be all [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3517.44s)]
*  that great. Yeah. And of course there was this story, I think it was over the winter about the [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3521.28s)]
*  student, the Chinese students at the University of Minnesota who were caught with drones around [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3526.4s)]
*  Norfolk Naval Base flying them over at night and said they got lost. It's a long way from Minnesota [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3530.48s)]
*  to Norfolk with what they were doing. I've actually kind of come around on this. When the Trump [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3536.96s)]
*  administration first started, my thought was like, okay, there may be a few bad actors, but you know, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3542.56s)]
*  we are an open country and shutting off students from around the world to come here. You know, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3547.28s)]
*  they start businesses, et cetera. It has really become apparent that the volume of Chinese students [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3552.16s)]
*  who are tied to the Communist Party, who are the children of members of the Communist Party, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3557.44s)]
*  who have to go back and serve in the government, it is concerning. And to Mark's point, and Sean [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3562.6400000000003s)]
*  said it too, the way they steal intellectual property, the way they've been accused of [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3569.04s)]
*  working with universities and harvesting some of the nascent technologies that are being incubated [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3574.88s)]
*  in those universities, something has to be done. I mean, they are a threat to us. We are trying to [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3580.96s)]
*  decouple our businesses from there, and we need to do something about this. And I think there's [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3587.2s)]
*  bipartisan support for it, by the way. You know, Obama tried it. Trump in his first term. Biden [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3593.28s)]
*  all talked about this pivot. If Trump were to really say like, this is going to be the main focus [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3599.84s)]
*  of my next three years, I think he'd get a lot of Democrats that would completely agree with him. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3605.52s)]
*  Wow. You know what? Let's make America American again. That's the push. I want to say one thing [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3610.0s)]
*  on the deportations while we're on the subject of student visas and other visas. On that Mohammed [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3616.08s)]
*  Suleiman case that we've been covering out of Boulder, Colorado, where that guy lit a bunch of [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3621.76s)]
*  Jewish people and others supporting the American and Israeli hostages that had been taken by Hamas. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3627.6s)]
*  He's in for a world of hurt in the criminal justice system. He's facing federal hate crime [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3634.56s)]
*  charge. He's facing 16 state charges, including attempted murder. And now after Marco Rubio said, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3639.28s)]
*  by the way, if you're here and you're not legal and you've got a family that's here on visas, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3645.92s)]
*  you commit some sort of act of terrorism, everyone's going, you're all out. And that's [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3651.28s)]
*  what they're doing. They arrested, ICE did all of his family members and they're in federal [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3654.88s)]
*  custody right now and facing expedited removal. It's not clear to me that they're here illegally. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3660.1600000000003s)]
*  I can't tell whether, but the Trump administration doesn't care. Your family member is a terrorist [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3664.7999999999997s)]
*  who tried to kill a bunch of people. You're here on a temporary permission slip at best. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3670.8799999999997s)]
*  You're out. Go ahead, Sean. No, I just, I think that I said this earlier, but I just don't, to me, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3675.6s)]
*  whether it's the anti-Semitism that's run rampant on college campuses and now is manifesting itself [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3682.0s)]
*  in the horrible incident that happened in Washington, DC and now in Colorado, whether it's [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3688.56s)]
*  how we're handling China, there's an element which it's not ideological. This isn't a conservative [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3693.28s)]
*  thing or a liberal thing. There's common sense. The idea that you have to go, gosh, is it a good [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3698.7200000000003s)]
*  policy or a bad policy to let your sworn enemies into your country? Is it a good idea or a bad [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3703.36s)]
*  policy to let people who are trafficking women and children into the country? Is it a good idea [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3709.36s)]
*  to let people who are trafficking drugs into the country or to back law enforcement or to stamp out [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3714.6400000000003s)]
*  anti-Semitism? It should not be ideological. This is common sense. And when Trump talks about this [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3720.24s)]
*  and says, I'm for common sense, he's right. I cannot believe that there are ideological breakdowns [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3726.64s)]
*  on these issues. The notion that our sworn enemy post COVID is literally saying, oh, I just happen [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3732.24s)]
*  to bring a fungus into my shoe. And we're like, guys, let's not jump to conclusions here. I feel [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3739.2799999999997s)]
*  like that moment after Wuhan where everyone's like, how could you possibly think it came from [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3743.7599999999998s)]
*  a virology lab in Wuhan that makes these kind of COVID? I mean, how dumb are we that we have not [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3748.16s)]
*  learned our lesson? There's two kinds of Americans now. There's one that says, this guy's got four [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3754.8799999999997s)]
*  kids and a wife in the United States. Get him out. And then there's a kind that says, what's their [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3759.2799999999997s)]
*  immigration status? What's the law say? What's the precedent? When's their due process? When's their [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3764.3199999999997s)]
*  hearing? The poor kids, right? That's a division. That is. You're right. But our side, which is the [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3769.3599999999997s)]
*  former, is winning. I mean, the more and more examples we get of these radicals in our country, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3777.52s)]
*  whether they're lighting people on fire or they're smuggling in fungi to take down our agriculture, [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3781.7599999999998s)]
*  I think people have just had it. They've had it. So those people who are out there harassing the [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3788.64s)]
*  ICE agents are in a distinct minority. One other point on foreign policy now, Trump, of course, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3792.72s)]
*  ran for office saying he could settle the Ukraine war in 24 hours. He now says he was being facetious. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3798.88s)]
*  It hasn't happened, and it seems near intractable. I mean, Trump is learning the hard way that Putin [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3803.8399999999997s)]
*  is just a very stubborn actor, and he wants what he wants. And he's not easily manipulated, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3809.44s)]
*  not with flattery, not with praise, not really with anything. And you can sense Trump's frustration [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3814.72s)]
*  because he thought maybe we can make a deal that works for him economically that will get him off [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3820.72s)]
*  of his rabid focus on expanding Mother Russia. And he's learning that it just doesn't work that way [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3824.64s)]
*  in Russia. It's just they're very different minded people. At the same time, he's trying to [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3830.08s)]
*  strike this deal with Iran, where he thinks he can get them to agree not to pursue a nuclear weapon [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3835.36s)]
*  in exchange for us, well, like not bombing them and potentially cooperating with them on some [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3841.04s)]
*  things. And he just posted the following on True Social. I just finished speaking by telephone [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3845.12s)]
*  with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The call lasted approximately one hour 15 minutes. We [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3851.6s)]
*  discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes by Ukraine and also various other attacks that [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3856.0s)]
*  have been taking place by both sides. It was a good conversation, but not one that will lead [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3860.88s)]
*  to immediate peace. President Putin did say and very strongly, he will have to respond to the [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3864.88s)]
*  recent attack on the airfields. We also discussed Iran and the fact that time is running out on [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3869.2s)]
*  Iran's decision pertaining to nuclear weapons, which must be made quickly. I stated to President [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3873.92s)]
*  Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And on this, I believe we were in agreement. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3878.8s)]
*  President Putin suggested he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could perhaps [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3883.12s)]
*  be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion. It's my opinion that Iran has been [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3887.44s)]
*  slow walking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3891.2799999999997s)]
*  very short period of time. Look, I don't know what's going to happen on Ukraine, but if Putin will [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3894.88s)]
*  help us on the Iran problem, that's a plus. And we should be finding some areas where we can [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3899.52s)]
*  cooperate with Russia as opposed to just treating them like they are enemy number one, which they [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3907.6s)]
*  really have never, well, not never, but haven't recently been to the United States. What do you [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3913.04s)]
*  make of the truth, Sean? Look, I appreciate, I really do. President Trump is so sincere when [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3918.4s)]
*  he talks about getting peace. I've seen him up close, he means it, and I appreciate that about [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3926.0s)]
*  him. I really like how he wants that state back. He was so proud and rightly so over the four years [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3931.52s)]
*  that he had an office initially where we really had a steady state around the world. Russia hadn't [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3937.8399999999997s)]
*  annexed or attacked any land in four years, which wasn't the case prior. North Korea had settled down, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3944.0s)]
*  China, Hamas wasn't going the way it was now after Israel. So I appreciate everything he's doing, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3950.24s)]
*  but Iran is a sworn enemy. Just listen to what they say, death to America. Like, I get everyone [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3956.88s)]
*  wants to get a deal with them, but they can't be trusted and they want to kill us. So they'll kind [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3963.28s)]
*  of, for those, you know, like as they would say at Shark Tank, for those reasons, I'm out. I do think [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3967.6800000000003s)]
*  that on the Russia thing, again, I appreciate what President Trump's trying to do here, but Putin [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3972.7200000000003s)]
*  isn't just stubborn, he's evil. And the man wants to do bad things. And I think we've said, hey, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3977.84s)]
*  the clock is out, we've given you some time, we're trying to get there. At some point, we have no [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3982.4s)]
*  choice but to really isolate you and feel the consequences of this. Really start putting economic [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3987.52s)]
*  sanctions, not just on Russia, but on those that they do business with. He doesn't seem worried [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3991.6s)]
*  about those, Sean. I get it, but I'm just telling you. Trump's already said we might drop secondary [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3995.12s)]
*  sanctions, meaning we're going to sanction all the countries that stay in business with you. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=3999.68s)]
*  And Putin seems to be like, I'm good. Yeah, but we'll see what happens if he really does. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4003.04s)]
*  I just think that Putin has shown his cards. He's not interested in a deal. The best deal that he [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4008.72s)]
*  ever was going to get was offered by Donald Trump to achieve a lasting peace, and he didn't take [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4013.36s)]
*  that. So at some point, you walk away and say, all right, now I'm going to show you what we're [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4017.44s)]
*  willing to do. But on Iran, I'm sorry. What does that look like? Walk away is a win for Putin [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4021.84s)]
*  if it's walk away from Ukraine. Go ahead, Mark. No, no, walk away with sanctions. I'm sorry, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4026.8s)]
*  just to be clear. I want full and secondary sanctions on them to isolate them, to really [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4030.4s)]
*  sort of make him sweat it. Because his people, the only way he'll feel this is if his own people [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4035.92s)]
*  start rising up, and they will feel the economic consequences of full sanctions. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4041.2000000000003s)]
*  I've got a new program you may or may not have heard of it, Megan, called Next Up. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4046.16s)]
*  It's amazing. Everyone loves it. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4049.7599999999998s)]
*  Thank you. I did an interview with David Ignatius, The Washington Post, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4052.0s)]
*  columnist who knows as much about this war, I think as anybody on the planet. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4054.64s)]
*  And he's been to Ukraine many times, and he's very pessimistic about what could possibly happen. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4058.48s)]
*  Right? We can talk about scenarios, but there really doesn't seem to be a positive scenario. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4064.08s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be a best case for Ukraine or for the West, because right now, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4069.12s)]
*  Putin's not feeling the heat on the economy. He's not feeling the heat from public opinion. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4073.44s)]
*  He's not feeling the heat for a shortage of men to send to the war. And those were the three areas [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4077.68s)]
*  that were the West theory of the case was Putin will eventually start to feel the heat in one [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4083.04s)]
*  or more of those. He's not. And they can talk about sanctions, but Putin doesn't want to settle. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4088.08s)]
*  Putin wants to win. Putin wants Ukraine to be a vassal state to him. So I don't know where it's [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4094.32s)]
*  going to go. I do know that it's troubling for people can still that Donald Trump is friendly [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4101.6s)]
*  to Vladimir Putin. And I get his posture. He'll talk to anyone. He'll talk to North Koreans. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4107.4400000000005s)]
*  He'll talk to Iranians. I think that's the only rational posture. But there's a lack of leverage [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4112.96s)]
*  now, which is frustrating for all Americans, I think, and for Europeans. And it's particularly [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4118.4800000000005s)]
*  frustrating for some that the president talks in a favorable way about Putin. I know it's a tactical [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4123.76s)]
*  thing, at least in part. But right now, I don't see what his next play is. And it's troubling [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4129.68s)]
*  because there's a real possibility that between now and the fall, Putin will do substantial damage, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4134.56s)]
*  substantial damage to Ukraine as if he hasn't already done a lot. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4142.4800000000005s)]
*  And then there's the question, Dan, about whether if he's leaning into having Putin help him settle [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4146.56s)]
*  an Iran deal, whether he's prepared to sanction Putin at all on the non-cooperation when it comes [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4151.52s)]
*  to settling Ukraine. Yeah. And I wonder if Putin didn't preview what his response is. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4157.84s)]
*  And there's an agreement like, hey, don't overreact, United States. And I'll be curious. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4163.04s)]
*  I mean, to Mark's point, what leverage we have over Putin is really not very much. I think other [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4169.6s)]
*  than I don't think sanctions would make a difference. I think the only thing that would [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4176.96s)]
*  really make a difference is to fully arm Ukraine with hundreds of billions of dollars more of [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4179.76s)]
*  weaponry. But there's little appetite in our country for that. I'm not sure the Europeans [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4185.92s)]
*  are capable of it. It's what I personally would love to see. But I don't think Trump will go there. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4192.32s)]
*  And then the question is, do you let Ukraine disappear on your watch? That's a tough pill [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4199.04s)]
*  to swallow. But Dan, what you just said, though, that response thing, Megan, you read the truth. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4204.24s)]
*  That's critical. They've already, I mean, basically Trump's acknowledging that Putin's [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4209.28s)]
*  saying, I got to do something. I got to fight back. And the breadth and depth of that response [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4214.32s)]
*  is going to be critical. Because Dan's right. What was telegraphed? Did Trump say, here are the red [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4219.84s)]
*  lines. You cannot go after civilians. You can't go. I mean, where is that line that hopefully was [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4226.16s)]
*  put in place? Because I get it. Everybody cheered the strike the other day. And I get it. I was [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4230.799999999999s)]
*  excited to see Ukraine show some prowess, some strategic insight into the long-term planning [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4236.16s)]
*  that they're capable of. But there was no way that Putin wasn't going to fight back. He can't. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4243.68s)]
*  He'd be humiliated if he didn't. We know that. And so how he responds and what he hits, Dan's [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4249.280000000001s)]
*  absolutely right. This is going to be, to me, we may have just taken a big step backwards, unfortunately. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4256.16s)]
*  You can feel it. It's like Trump has good faith and really thinks that he's the ultimate deal [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4262.8s)]
*  maker. But this is just, I mean, it's Vladimir Putin. I feel like I know the guy. And I actually [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4268.0s)]
*  disagree with you, Sean. I don't think he's evil. I'm not defending his character. But I do think [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4273.52s)]
*  he's just very strategic. And he's got one goal. And that really is to restore Mother Russia to her [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4277.280000000001s)]
*  former glory and a mass territory. And he doesn't view it in terms of good and bad and innocence and [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4281.92s)]
*  non-innocence. He views it in terms of what's best for his people, his country, which I do. I mean, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4289.92s)]
*  I see it's like splitting hairs in some ways. And I'm fully cognizant of the damage that he's done to [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4296.56s)]
*  women and children and civilians in Ukraine. I just think if you ask me what I think is in his head, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4301.36s)]
*  it's not some maniacal joy of killing or sociopathic absence of care. He's goal oriented [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4306.5599999999995s)]
*  in a way that he thinks is very justified and will restore something wonderful and important to his [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4316.799999999999s)]
*  own people who he's singularly focused on in any event. I mean, maybe you could make the same kind [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4322.24s)]
*  of arguments about Adolf Hitler. But I just see the mistake. I'll respectfully go with murder [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4327.12s)]
*  sociopath. Well, again, I don't disagree with the goal part of it. But I will say that when you [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4332.96s)]
*  kill innocent people in the way that he has done it and to the extent that he's done it, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4338.72s)]
*  I just think that you've got to have an element of just raw evil in you that you think that that's a [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4346.72s)]
*  way to achieve your goal. Okay, so we're not going to solve that one. But I do have something fun [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4351.92s)]
*  for us to go back to. Guess who just weighed in on her own book? Karin Jean-Pierre. She's apparently [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4358.72s)]
*  watching the Megyn Kelly show live on SiriusXM, Triumph channel listening. And she- [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4364.64s)]
*  Well, by the way, you better have her on after what you did after that interview with Tapper. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4368.72s)]
*  Please, I will just say this. I want this so bad. I'm endorsing the Megyn Kelly interview with Karin [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4373.2s)]
*  Jean-Pierre. I just asked her to be a special pay-per-view episode. Yeah. I mean, at least [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4381.04s)]

*  enough, but she's welcome any time. Here is what she is saying now on Instagram. Watch. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4391.04s)]
*  But since I have left, the people that come up to me, strangers that come up to me just across [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4397.36s)]
*  the country as I'm traveling and sometimes right in my neighborhood at a grocery store, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4403.76s)]
*  supermarket, airport, my daughter's school, the number one question they ask me is, Karin, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4408.88s)]
*  how do we get out of this? How do we protect our democracy? How do we protect vulnerable [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4413.84s)]
*  communities among us? What do we do next? Because we don't have answers here. That's what they ask [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4418.64s)]
*  me. And this is my answer. And what I mean by that is in an era of misinformation, disinformation, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4425.04s)]
*  the regressiveness of social policy, what we're seeing currently right now- [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4432.400000000001s)]
*  Fake book or the actual book? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4436.64s)]
*  What I have decided to do, and I really have thought long and hard about this, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4437.6s)]
*  is to follow my own compass. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4441.92s)]
*  Oh, Lord. I wonder if she's going to run for office. I wonder if this is all teed up for the [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4446.400000000001s)]
*  fall to get into a primary. Is she a DC resident or does she live in Maryland? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4451.360000000001s)]
*  I thought New York. Somebody better bring me the smelling salts. What? What did you just say, Dan? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4455.52s)]
*  I do. I mean, hearing that message, it makes me think she is thinking of running for office. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4462.400000000001s)]
*  This book is her launch. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4469.76s)]
*  But did she leave the Democratic Party? Because if she did, she'd have to run for [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4470.96s)]
*  office as an independent. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4474.16s)]
*  This is a big one, Elizabeth. This is the big one. Elizabeth, I'm coming home. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4475.280000000001s)]
*  By the way, if you are looking for answers, if you're looking for answers to anything in Karin [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4480.72s)]
*  Jean-Pierre's book, it's the equivalent of looking for medical advice at a Home Depot. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4487.12s)]
*  You will not find it. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4492.72s)]
*  Okay, but was she holding a fake book with empty pages on the cover or is that- [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4494.16s)]
*  She's used to that. She knows how to do that well. Fake book with no pages. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4498.32s)]
*  She lives in Queens. You're right. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4501.5199999999995s)]
*  Good point. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4503.36s)]
*  New York president. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4503.76s)]
*  But yeah, you raise a good point. Why would she leave the Democratic Party to run as an independent? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4506.16s)]
*  Because Mayor Adams is looking at the Eric Adams political strategy. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4511.36s)]
*  Karin Jean-Pierre, I mean, I realize we have like Jasmine Crockett and Maisie Hirono and other [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4517.84s)]
*  absolute morons in our Congress, but she is too dumb to hold office. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4523.28s)]
*  We cannot keep playing down to the lowest common denominator. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4530.32s)]
*  These people actually do have a little bit of power. They must be stopped. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4534.72s)]
*  The candidacy must die in its crib. That's all that there is to say. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4539.04s)]
*  Maybe she primary- [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4542.5599999999995s)]
*  Karin Jean-Pierre. But she cannot have a political career. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4543.5199999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4546.08s)]
*  Or AOC. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4546.5599999999995s)]
*  She could primary AOC. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4547.599999999999s)]
*  I was just looking to see because AOC is part of Queens. I was just looking up here quickly [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4547.92s)]
*  who else represents part of that district. Stay tuned. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4552.48s)]
*  Oh my God. That would be spectacular. Actually, I would love to watch those two. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4555.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, AOC can run circles around Karin Jean-Pierre when it comes to her oratory, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4560.799999999999s)]
*  her rhetorical skills. And she's actually tried to do some things as a congresswoman. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4565.36s)]
*  Karin Jean-Pierre is just, all she's going to do is get up there and say, I'm a first. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4569.759999999999s)]
*  I'm a first. The first black and the first lesbian and the first woman ever to hold [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4573.36s)]
*  this job or ever to run against AOC in this particular district. I don't know. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4577.92s)]
*  That only gets you so far. Good luck with that, madam. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4582.0s)]
*  Okay. Somebody who does appear qualified to run for president. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4585.04s)]
*  I don't know that he's going to do it and I don't know that he could win, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4590.96s)]
*  but he's the first one who's possibly raising his hand who has interested yours truly. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4594.32s)]
*  I don't care about any of the rest of them. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4600.24s)]
*  But I do think Rahm Emanuel is an interesting name to have in the mix. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4603.04s)]
*  And I'll tell you what I find interesting about him. He's strong. He's not one of those [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4607.36s)]
*  wussy, pathetic, soy boy Democrats who you're like, ew, what is that? That's not even a man. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4613.5199999999995s)]
*  He's tough. You know, Hannity used to call him Rahm dead fish Emanuel. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4620.0s)]
*  He's a ball buster. He's not somebody like Chris Murphy, who's got to be like, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4624.4s)]
*  and I fucking mean it. Rahm Emanuel can swear. He knows how. It comes naturally. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4629.280000000001s)]
*  He is kind of a bully, which is okay. I mean, that's fine. You can get some shit done being [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4636.08s)]
*  that way. So I got to tell you guys, he's not woke. He seems interesting to me. And if I were [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4640.8s)]
*  Democrat, I'd be feeling somewhat hopeful about him. Dan, where am I going wrong? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4647.360000000001s)]
*  Well, I think everything you said is right. I think he's serious. I think the fact that [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4652.72s)]
*  he's a bully, his biggest problem would be getting through a primary because about half [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4658.08s)]
*  the party despises him. And you know, this is this is over 30 years of being in the trenches. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4663.2s)]
*  Some of it is from when he was mayor of Chicago. There was a young boy that was [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4669.92s)]
*  murdered or killed by a police officer. He would not find McDonald. Yeah, he would not release the [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4674.8s)]
*  video camera. So there's some that have not forgiven him. But you go back to 2005 when he [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4681.76s)]
*  took over the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. We had just lost 2004 to George W. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4687.92s)]
*  Bush. We didn't control the Senate. We didn't control the House. One of the first things Rahm [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4692.8s)]
*  Emanuel did when he took over the D triple C is as it's known was full of all these contracts that [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4697.360000000001s)]
*  were just complete political patronage. Right. There was a black firm and a Latino firm and like [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4703.6s)]
*  money was handed out all over not because of your performance, but to take care of constituencies. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4709.2s)]
*  Rahm fired all of them. He said, we're all about winning. I'm going to hire the best and the [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4714.32s)]
*  brightest. If they're all one gender, one race, whatever, I don't care. It's about winning. Now, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4719.28s)]
*  he ran an excellent set of campaigns. We won. But he's made enemies with that type of, you know, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4725.84s)]
*  damn the torpedoes. I'm going to do what I think is right. I think he's one of the smartest people [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4732.4s)]
*  there is in the party. I think what he's saying that we don't have any agenda that will call the [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4736.88s)]
*  culturally disconnected that we need to not just be anti-Trump. He's a hundred percent right. I [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4741.36s)]
*  haven't heard what it is that Rahm is going to focus on. I imagine it's coming, but his biggest [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4746.88s)]
*  challenge is going to be getting through a Democratic primary. Hundred percent. Just wait, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4751.84s)]
*  I'll give you the floor. I just want to tell people why I'm talking about him. It's not just [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4757.52s)]
*  an admiration society. He gave an interview to the Wall Street Journal last week and teased a [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4760.56s)]
*  possible White House run. They pointed out he's secured contracts with CNN and the Washington [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4766.48s)]
*  Post to provide commentary. He's been on the speaking circuit. He appears to be laying the [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4771.759999999999s)]
*  groundwork for a presidential bid. He'll be a headliner at a September fish fry for Democrats [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4776.16s)]
*  in everyone altogether, Iowa. Yeah. He calls the party's brand toxic, weak and woke, a nod to [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4781.28s)]
*  culture issues that he thinks the Democrats have been losing. He's positioning himself as a savior [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4789.759999999999s)]
*  for the party. He's playing the populist card. The American dreams become unaffordable and [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4794.96s)]
*  accessible. The system's rigged. It's corrupt. And on the subject of whether he might potentially [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4799.76s)]
*  have to take on a friend of his, JB Pritzker, who's the current governor of Illinois in a [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4806.72s)]
*  possible run for the Democratic nomination, they say, let's see, they'll have a real debate. Voters [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4811.6s)]
*  will be lucky. We'll have a debate that we didn't have in 2024. So he certainly doesn't like tamp it [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4819.52s)]
*  down. By the way, if the Democrats nominate JB Pritzker for their nominee, I'll be thrilled. Do it. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4824.72s)]
*  I can't wait to talk about the Pritzkers and their love of transing children. We will talk about it [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4833.360000000001s)]
*  ad nauseam on the show and his weird, I think it's first cousin who's a man pretending to be a woman [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4840.400000000001s)]
*  and really wants your little boy to be female too. So good luck with that. Keep going. You were [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4846.4800000000005s)]
*  going to say, Sean, your thoughts on Ram. Oh, I agree with Dan's assessment. He's a political [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4851.84s)]
*  animal. I've known Ram a long time. He was on the budget committee when I was the comms director [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4856.08s)]
*  there 20 something years, 20 years ago. The guy is an animal. He's a fighter and he, none of this [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4860.72s)]
*  woke crap would be in his lexicon. He understands what it takes. And for all of those reasons, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4866.08s)]
*  they will never get him through a primary. He's he, I mean, and I also think the other issue is [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4871.92s)]
*  he's too far now. You know, he's the opposite of Elizabeth Warren. He's hung out with all the [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4877.04s)]
*  private equity guys. He hangs out with the wrong people, to put it bluntly. And for those reasons, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4882.64s)]
*  he won't be able to get through a democratic primary. He's not woken up. He's not progressive [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4887.84s)]
*  enough. But look, I judge candidates on the democratic side is do they make, do they worry [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4892.16s)]
*  me? He's got the political gravitas, the instincts, the messaging to do well. But if I ever thought [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4896.88s)]
*  that he'd get through there, I'd be a little bit more worried. He will not make it through a primary [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4903.2s)]
*  full stop. So it's a very weak, it's a very, it's a very weak field. So anyone who's got any strength, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4906.96s)]
*  you can't dismiss. And the other, the other thing about Ron that hasn't come up is one way it's a [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4912.4800000000005s)]
*  very weak field is most of them cannot raise $20 million. Ron can raise, I think it would be [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4918.56s)]
*  exception of Pritzker, so his brother, his brother, Ari, could write it to it. Ari could write a $200 [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4923.6s)]
*  million check and might. So you can't, you can't discount Ron because of what's been said and [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4929.36s)]
*  because of money. However, in addition to his record as mayor, in addition to how much the [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4935.6s)]
*  base hates him, he's got no narrative that's compelling. As Sean said, he's hanging out with [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4940.64s)]

*  story to tell that's, you know, you know, Barack Obama's origin story or Donald Trump's origin [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4951.280000000001s)]
*  story. He was born to privilege. He's lived in privilege. He's a, he's a, he's a multimillionaire. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4957.200000000001s)]
*  And I just think it's going to be difficult for him to find something to say to Democrats, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4962.56s)]
*  except vote for me because I can win a general election. And I don't believe that that's enough [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4967.6s)]
*  right now for him to overcome the way the base feels about him. And by the way, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4972.72s)]
*  we know a lot about his record in Chicago. Most Democrats do not. If he's a serious threat, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4977.6s)]
*  some smart candidate on the left of Ron will make everyone in the Democratic Party well aware of his [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4983.68s)]
*  record as mayor. And it goes far beyond a few high profile cases of things that will not be appealing [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4989.84s)]
*  to the left. Yep. A hundred percent. Is it, they're in a tough position because, you know, he is [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=4996.16s)]

*  they won't let him make it through the primary process. Maybe we'll see, but it's, it's interesting [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5007.2s)]
*  to see some people starting to raise their hands, starting to say, maybe, maybe me consider me going [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5011.52s)]
*  to Iowa. I can't like, we just got through this, but it's starting already. Okay. We've got to take [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5016.96s)]
*  a break. We're going to come back and then we're going to have some fun at Jim Acosta's expense. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5021.12s)]
*  I mean, who doesn't want to do that? We'll be right back. These days, personal safety is not [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5025.2s)]

*  use. It provides the confidence to act in any situation. Berna uses non-lethal rounds, tear gas, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5044.96s)]
*  pepper, and kinetic projectiles to effectively stop a threat from a safe distance. And the best part, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5051.12s)]
*  Berna can be shipped directly to your door and it's legal in all 50 states. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5056.8s)]

*  a tour of sorts where he's going to have people come watch him or so he thought. The Free Beacon [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5166.24s)]
*  with an amazing piece on how it's going. Andrew Stiles wrote the piece. Jim Acosta throws lamest [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5172.16s)]

*  Okay. This guy wrote a great piece. I'm going to read some from part of it. There are some [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5185.04s)]
*  tickets left. Jim Acosta told his sub-stack followers a few hours before taking the stage [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5189.599999999999s)]

*  started after his voluntary exit from CNN earlier this year. He wasn't kidding. The lineup for the [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5199.12s)]
*  first and apparently only stop on the fire within tour would struggle to draw a crowd almost anywhere [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5206.0s)]
*  else in the country. Rosie O'Donnell, Jasmine Crockett, an assortment of professional Trump [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5214.08s)]
*  haters whose names you would not recognize unless you're the sort of mentally deranged liberal [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5219.2s)]
*  who owns an Anthony Fauci prayer candle and refuses to watch CNN because it's right-wing propaganda. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5223.12s)]
*  Only the most delirious of hyper online partisans could stomach the pretentious tagline, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5229.44s)]
*  fueling courage, defending freedom, igniting truth. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5234.4s)]
*  Yeah. Shockingly, people weren't drawn to it, guys, and didn't show up. Venue staff informed [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5239.84s)]
*  the free beacon that the upper balcony comprising nearly half of the venue's 1200 seats was closed [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5248.16s)]
*  for reasons that were soon obvious. Generously estimated the lower section was roughly three [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5253.76s)]
*  quarters full, about 500 people. As the night were on, it became clear that a significant portion of [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5257.92s)]
*  them were either members of a federal employee union invited to denounce Trump or had personal [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5262.88s)]
*  or professional connections to one of the quote performers. First up, Michael Fanon. This was the [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5267.52s)]
*  guy we were told we were not allowed to criticize because he was a cop on J6 and you were not a [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5273.92s)]
*  patriot and you hated cops if you noticed that he was a rabid partisan who was suffering from [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5278.96s)]
*  very serious TDS. You weren't, you were a cop hater if you said, I don't really believe him. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5284.160000000001s)]
*  He sounds deranged. So he gets up there and do we have a, okay, okay. And I'll just tell you what he [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5289.360000000001s)]
*  says. Okay. Setting the tone for the show, Fanon laments, we're in a tough fucking spot. Acosta [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5297.28s)]
*  agrees. We are, we are. He's not afraid to express his feelings with expletives. House Speaker Mike [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5305.5199999999995s)]
*  Johnson is a petty bitch surrounded by cock sucking colleagues, not to be confused with the [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5310.32s)]
*  unelected Trump supporters who are dick sucking ass clouds. Forgive me. This is dirty even for me. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5316.16s)]
*  Then came someone named Olivia Troy. I don't know her, but she was a, okay. Thank you, Troy. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5323.12s)]
*  She's a former Republican who spoke at the democratic national convention. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5330.8s)]
*  She's lamenting the loss of the federal bureaucrats who got fired thanks to Doge and Trump saying, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5334.64s)]
*  it's super upsetting. And I have to say to you that the American people, they may not recognize [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5340.96s)]
*  it right now, but they will realize it in time. The incredible treasure that they've lost. Okay. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5346.0s)]
*  That wasn't it. Jim Acosta welcomed from across the pond, Rosie O'Donnell, who has moved to Ireland [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5352.24s)]
*  to flee Trump and all of his supporters. And here's a little bit of how that went. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5360.639999999999s)]
*  This is going to feel like, like it's right out of the Jim Acosta show on Substack. We're bringing [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5366.24s)]
*  in a live guest, my friend, your friend. It is the wonderful and talented Rosie O'Donnell. There she [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5370.8s)]
*  is. How you doing, Jim? I'm doing great. Rosie, how are you? I'm well. Everybody showed up. How [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5378.4s)]
*  did it house the crowd? Not too bad. It's looking good. There's one person in Washington who's [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5385.44s)]
*  probably not pleased that Rosie O'Donnell is being beamed into the Lincoln theater just down the street [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5390.08s)]
*  from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I can't imagine what's going through his mind right now. The Irish [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5396.16s)]
*  have taken you in there. Top of the morning to you, Rosie. Oh my God. Yes. I'm sure Trump was [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5400.16s)]
*  very upset, guys, to see Rosie O'Donnell appearing in front of a couple hundred people at a Jim [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5408.08s)]
*  Acosta town hall. What is he doing? And you tell me why so few people want to help him in his quest [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5414.5599999999995s)]
*  to fuel courage, defend freedom and ignite truth. Do we know what the ticket price was? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5423.12s)]
*  Free. We must have it somewhere. It's not in front of me. It was probably free because usually at [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5431.04s)]
*  those events when they can't put butts in seats, they run around trying to find people who will [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5436.0s)]
*  just possibly sit there. I'd be curious what the VIP seats went for. There weren't. Let me just say [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5440.08s)]
*  that there weren't any. Why are you laughing? That's a serious question. I want to know. Who's a VIP [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5448.0s)]
*  at a Jim Acosta town hall? She says, by the way, she loves living abroad. She loves living abroad [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5452.72s)]
*  and she points out that she loves it in part because the only people who like Donald Trump [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5458.32s)]
*  are taxi drivers, those disgusting losers who have to drive cars for a living, unlike Rosie, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5461.84s)]
*  who's on record saying that she got so famous she didn't think any laws or rules applied to her. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5466.8s)]
*  So she's not like a loser taxi driver. That's Rosie, woman of the people. Go ahead, Sean. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5470.400000000001s)]
*  So I know something about crowd size. And let me tell you, that was not worrying Donald Trump. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5475.2s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to tell you right now that that is not even getting on his radar. Number two, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5480.88s)]
*  I will just help him for the next one. And I'm just thinking of how we can connect the dots in [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5488.080000000001s)]
*  some of these segments. What if he leads Corinne Jean-Pierre's book launch? Because I think that [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5493.4400000000005s)]
*  together that would be a huge audience for her. So I mean, I know it's not a lot at all, but like, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5499.52s)]
*  that's probably as many books as she'll sell total. That's a good point. That'd be a great [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5505.84s)]
*  way for her to launch. Right. You could go on Chuck Todd's podcast or streaming show, which has [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5509.68s)]
*  fewer viewers than are present as guests on this show right now. They gave out awards. They gave [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5516.72s)]
*  out awards to Miles Taylor, the mid-level bureaucrat who wrote the anonymous op-ed in [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5524.16s)]
*  the New York Times about being part of the resistance. He got an award. Tara Setmire, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5529.4400000000005s)]
*  the former Lincoln Project advisor, got a defender of woman award. Aaron Parnas, a 26 year old TikTok [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5533.84s)]
*  influencer, recognized as a defender of Gen Z and announced members of the media, including Jake [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5539.52s)]
*  Tapper for being more focused on selling books about a former president than they are about telling [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5545.84s)]
*  the truth. And Jim Acosta really wanted people to lean in on the taco messaging around Trump, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5550.160000000001s)]
*  which is the lamest attempt to take him down. It stands for Trump Always Chickens Out. And they're [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5557.6s)]
*  trying to make this a thing. Acosta attempted some jokes and this is in part how he started [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5565.92s)]
*  the night in SOT24. Let's know this, but it's taco night here at the Lincoln Theater in Washington, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5571.68s)]
*  D.C. There's a taco right there. This gentleman's wearing a taco on his head. What is going on? My [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5578.08s)]
*  God. The tacos only come in one flavor. That would be chicken. That's right. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5584.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. That is so cringy, Dan. I insist you take responsibility for him as a fellow Democrat. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5591.76s)]
*  Yeah. You know, what's hard about it is for all those who want to say that he and others during [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5600.08s)]
*  the first Trump term were serious journalists and that they had no partisan bent, it's really hard [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5606.400000000001s)]
*  when they turn around and start doing this and have people like Rosie O'Donnell and, you know, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5611.360000000001s)]
*  the like. I don't know what he's doing. I guess he's trying to make some money and he lost his job [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5617.12s)]
*  and I can't imagine he's going to make a lot of money doing this. But, you know, this is not [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5622.8s)]
*  helping the Democratic Party move forward. I'll just leave it at that. Here he is trying to get [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5629.28s)]
*  a rock concert thing going with the lights. Okay. Just like when you know you're dying on the vine, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5635.36s)]
*  just wrap it. You can just wrap it. You don't have to do cell phone lights, but he did. Here it is, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5640.0s)]
*  slot 27. It may feel like we are surrounded in darkness right now, but I think what you just [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5644.72s)]
*  heard here from these gentlemen up here, from Tara, from Aaron, from Miles, is that there's still a [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5653.92s)]
*  lot of light left in all of us. And it would mean something to me if you carry that message with you [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5660.400000000001s)]
*  as we leave this theater here tonight, that this is not a country that is being plunged into [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5669.36s)]
*  darkness. This is a country that can find its way back to the light. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5675.28s)]
*  Do you know a few months ago, that guy was the host of a news program on a network that claims [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5680.0s)]
*  to be objective. And he should be aware that Trump's approval ratings are at record highs [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5687.28s)]
*  right now. No one's buying this nonsense anymore. We're in darkness. Remember the light. We have to [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5693.44s)]
*  stick together. All the terrible expletives from Fanon, whatever. You cut that short though, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5699.04s)]
*  because then he led them in a full-on version of the Macarena, which really got them excited. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5705.12s)]
*  I think that's where he wowed the crowd, his moves there. So I think that this one is so- [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5711.76s)]
*  Wait, just to give you actually how it went down, here's a little bit more between Rosie and [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5719.5199999999995s)]
*  Acosta, it's not 26. It's like, what's wrong with your voice? Why can't you say you're making no [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5723.84s)]
*  sense, Mr. President? Do you not know what the Declaration of Independence is? Good point. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5731.04s)]
*  Well, maybe because they saw that I used to do that and then you saw what happened to me. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5737.92s)]
*  I have to ask me, is this whole thing AI generated? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5744.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm messing with you. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5748.56s)]
*  I must ask, as a journalist, I must ask, because I see indications in there [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5750.88s)]
*  that it's not plausible that that's a real video. So I'll ask. I'll ask correctly. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5755.4400000000005s)]
*  He's trying to say, Mark, that the press is not more aggressive because they're worried about [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5759.2s)]
*  getting Jim Acosta'd by Trump. That's why they're giving Trump this pass. Go ahead, guys. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5764.32s)]
*  No, what would you have to ask ChatGPT for it to come up with something that stupid? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5770.08s)]
*  Because I feel like whenever you're entering into a search term- [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5774.4800000000005s)]
*  Come up with Jim Acosta, acting like Jim Acosta. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5776.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. Well, maybe it is that simple then. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5779.76s)]
*  Here's how it ended. Here's how it ended because continuing his theme, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5782.8s)]
*  primacy and recency, he really wanted them to remember it. Saw 28. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5787.6s)]
*  I forgot to recognize. Interns, take a taco hat. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5791.360000000001s)]
*  We're going to pay it forward. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5793.76s)]
*  Interns, taco hat. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5794.88s)]
*  Taco hat. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5797.28s)]
*  We're going to recognize them and thank them. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5798.08s)]
*  Take a taco hat. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5799.68s)]
*  I'm like Oprah. You get a taco hat and you get a taco hat. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5802.24s)]
*  No, you're not like Oprah. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5805.84s)]
*  See, if you look closely, he's got six fingers in that shot. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5808.08s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5813.44s)]
*  It can't be. Sadly, it's real. Get used to it. Guys, thank you. A pleasure as always. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5815.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5821.36s)]
*  Good to see you. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5821.92s)]
*  See you soon. Okay. I want to tell you before we go, first of all, subscribe to Next Up with [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5823.04s)]
*  Mark Halperin on YouTube and wherever you get your podcasts. But I wanted to give a shout out [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5827.5199999999995s)]
*  to my friend Justin Wells, new season of Art of the Surge. He's been behind the scenes with Trump [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5831.92s)]
*  since before Butler, like on the campaign trail, getting incredible exclusive footage of our now [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5839.04s)]
*  president. And he was airing this over on Tucker's network. Now, this next season, the first three [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5844.4s)]
*  episodes just dropped on Fox Nation. And I know that the first couple of episodes focus on the [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5850.72s)]
*  night before the election where he was with Trump. And I know that because I saw him when [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5857.68s)]
*  we went to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and I spoke for Trump. So he got some of the behind the scenes [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5864.16s)]
*  moments on cam. And I'll show you a couple of those that he sent to us. Here is the moment I [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5869.6s)]
*  was backstage greeting Trump as he arrived at the venue. And you will hear the music playing in the [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5875.52s)]
*  background that Trump has playing wherever he shows up. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5881.36s)]
*  It was very cool. I have to say he pulls up in the beast. And well, it wasn't officially the beast [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5901.5199999999995s)]
*  because he wasn't yet president, but like the big motorcade and you're backstage and you can hear [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5905.679999999999s)]
*  the crowd going wild waiting for him to come and you know, he comes in could not have been more [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5909.76s)]
*  gracious, of course. And then a little bit more with between yours truly and Justin Wells before [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5914.24s)]
*  I was about to go out and speak at this exchange was with one of Trump's guys, but about what to [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5920.24s)]
*  expect because I had no idea whether I was going to speak alone was Trump. They were like, he might [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5925.68s)]
*  call you up. Like, what does that mean? Here's a little bit of that. I've never done this before. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5930.8s)]
*  So like when I get up there, should I keep it tight? Should I like do how long should I go for? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5935.92s)]
*  Keep it somewhat tight, but trust me, he'll kind of lead you in the right direction. I'm sure he's [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5941.92s)]
*  going to throw things at you and you guys are probably going to communicate. I'll get some more [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5945.36s)]
*  clarification. Will it be like a co-bit? Like, it very well might be. Okay. I'll be right back. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5948.8s)]
*  Thank you guys. Thank you. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5954.8s)]
*  You. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5956.32s)]
*  It was fun. I for part of that, I had my family backstage with me and they were super excited. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5960.719999999999s)]
*  And then they went out into the venue and you know, in those moments before, you don't know. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5966.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I, I too can get, I don't know, not totally nervous, but like a little like it was [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5970.48s)]
*  unfamiliar. So I didn't know what to expect. And I didn't want to let the president down. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5975.92s)]
*  The then candidate, Trump down. And you know what? It wound up going very well. And most of [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5979.759999999999s)]
*  importantly, it wound up going very well for him the next day. And as a result for all of us. So [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5986.24s)]
*  good luck to Justin Wells with the art of the surge now airing on Fox nation. Check it out. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHAgA4qgs4s&t=5991.36s)]
