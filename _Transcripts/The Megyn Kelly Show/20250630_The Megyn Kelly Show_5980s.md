Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Walter Kirn, editor of the "Unbound" Substack, to discuss Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez’s flashy and tacky Venice wedding, the PR-curated guest list full of celebrities who have no actual connection to the couple, why the public has turned against this gross display in our culture, the hypocrisy of leftist celeb flying private to the Bezos–Sanchez wedding, the critiques about the "oligarchy" while they celebrate oligarch Bezos, the ridiculous "pajama party" that happened, NYC Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s revolutionary socialist posturing despite his elitist upbringing, his new comment that there should be "no billionaires," his racially divisive messaging and Communist comments in the past, the growing and disturbing appeal of socialism among young Americans, the broken promises of higher education and massive increases in student debt, AOC falsely claiming she grew up in the Bronx despite being raised in affluent Westchester, her rebranding from Sandy Cortez to AOC, graphic and inappropriate displays at Pride parades in New York and beyond, whether the LGB community is hurt by these ongoing antics, and more.

# Tacky Celeb-Filled Bezos-Sanchez Wedding, and Zohran Mamdani's Fake Origin Story, with Walter Kirn
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Monday. It's the week we celebrate our nation's independence day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=0.0s)]
*  Hence the American flag on my sweater. I'm getting in the mood. Hope you are too. Next year is gonna be the big one [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=8.64s)]
*  250 years I cannot wait but 249 is pretty good too. I'd be feeling pretty good if I were 249 years old [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=16.64s)]
*  I mean, it's really kind of crazy like not a week goes by that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  We don't mention one of the founding fathers on this show. Think about it. Think about the legacy that those men left behind [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=26.52s)]
*  It's just we're still living it and we're still fighting for it and thank God we have a Supreme Court that's fighting right along with us these days [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=32.52s)]
*  In less important but somewhat interesting news Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez have officially tied the knot out in Venice Italy in front of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=40.52s)]
*  200 of their dearest closest lifelong family friends like Gail and Oprah [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=48.2s)]
*  Just kidding it was a random assortment of celebrities who would help them get headlines [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=54.16s)]
*  Protesters describing themselves as the no space for Bezos movement. That's actually not so clever people [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=59.92s)]
*  They were there trying to disrupt the festivities [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Don't they know that there were astronauts present? I mean the disrespect [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=70.52s)]
*  We will get into that plus some more serious matters. We're on verdict watch now officially in the Diddy case. The jury has the case [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=75.24s)]
*  I mean honestly this could go either way [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=82.32s)]
*  I believe he should be convicted if I had to put money on it. I would say he will be convicted [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=84.72s)]
*  He absolutely [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=90.83999999999999s)]
*  Should be convicted of at least the prostitution charges [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=92.8s)]
*  And if he's not as I said last week that will be the tell that there was total jury nullification [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  on the basis of his celebrity and the jury being wooed by the fact that they were getting to pass judgment on Sean Diddy Combs [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  But what I think is gonna happen is gonna be found guilty probably on all three counts [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=108.6s)]
*  It's five counts, but it's really three, you know causes of action against him [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=112.72s)]
*  so the jury has the case they were charged this morning and [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=116.92s)]
*  Wouldn't you love to be a fly on that wall just to hear the first go-around like the first vote? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=119.96s)]
*  Where they go around and say what'd you think? What'd you think? What'd you think? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=124.72s)]
*  And there are such different personalities in these juries. I have to tell you [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=127.32s)]
*  I've both served as a juror and I've tried cases and I've watched as a legal court watcher [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=130.84s)]
*  You know in my journalism role for many many years now [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=135.84s)]
*  You as a lawyer sometimes intentionally select somebody, you know will be a follower [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  because maybe you've already [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=144.24s)]
*  intentionally selected the one you think will be your leader and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=146.4s)]
*  Somebody who's more, you know oriented your way whether you're the prosecution of the defense and it's it would just be such an interesting [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=149.28s)]
*  Study for any lawyer to be able to see whether they were right [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  Did they call this person right as a follower this person right as a leader a funny story for you when I served in a jury [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  God, I think it was [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=165.68s)]
*  2006 I don't think Doug and I were married it was 2006 or 2007. So going on, you know 20 years ago now [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  Really interesting case really enjoyed doing it bonded with my fellow jurors and just [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=177.44000000000003s)]
*  six months ago, I was down in DC for on business and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  There was a guy with me in the elevator and he's kind of looking at me and you know [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  I never know whether it's just somebody who knows me from [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=193.1s)]
*  Whatever television or the show or whether it's just a person who's curious [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  Anyway, the guy comes up to me after we get an elevator and he goes are you Megyn Kelly? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=201.54s)]
*  I said, yeah [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=205.54s)]
*  It was a guy I had served on the jury with all those years earlier [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=206.14s)]
*  And we reminisced a bit in any event long-winded way of saying that jury's together and for the first time is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  Getting to talk about these seven weeks of testimony [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=217.74s)]
*  34 witnesses in a trial that has dominated the news now for weeks [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=221.82s)]
*  We're on it for you. Also, we're watching this nutcase. So ran my mommy [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=228.38s)]

*  I'm really happy to be here [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=322.74s)]
*  Okay, so let's just start I know this is a curve ball [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=326.24s)]
*  but let's just start with this ridiculous wedding that took place over this weekend because [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=330.36s)]
*  This is these two were behaving like they thought they were royalty [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  They were you know, she did the balcony wave like she's a Maryland figure or or a genuine [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=341.48s)]
*  British royal, you know blowing the kisses and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  They had the ship their yacht which has its own yacht carting them around with their massive amounts of foam [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=352.08s)]
*  Dripping in in the Mediterranean which I'm sure is not eco-friendly too bad because Leonardo Leonardo DiCaprio was there [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=359.24s)]
*  I'm sure he didn't approve of the amount being spent on the foam into the med [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=366.24s)]
*  And from what I can tell Walter almost no actual friends. They don't know Gail King [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=371.12s)]
*  She they invited Gail on that ridiculous space flight so they could get some news coverage on CBS and now because she did it [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=378.56s)]
*  She's at the wedding [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=386.24s)]
*  Oprah they don't know Oprah. That's a lie to [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=387.92s)]
*  Oprah went and watched Gail go up in this thing. So now she gets an invite why because she's a celebrity [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=391.6s)]
*  Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm sure they're really tight with Leonardo [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=398.92s)]
*  I'm sure it's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=402.08s)]
*  Sydney Sweeney the new toast of the town out there because she's got these enormous breasts that everybody's obsessed with [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=403.52s)]
*  How does she wind up there if you told me it was like Lauren Sanchez's colleagues from the first news station [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  She worked at sure. That's normal [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=416.24s)]
*  That's what a true friend would do invite their lifelong friends or Jeff Bezos when he first opened Amazon [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=419.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. I get it. Even Bill Gates was there. I'll give him that one huge fellow tech titan [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  But this was meant to generate headlines and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=431.18s)]
*  fawning coverage and [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=436.26000000000005s)]
*  accolades and nothing better [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=438.42s)]
*  Encapsulates that then the moment they got married. She wiped her Instagram clean and [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=441.06s)]
*  Repopulated it with her Vogue [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=448.14000000000004s)]
*  magazine spread photographs and just the one post of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=450.90000000000003s)]
*  Lauren Sanchez [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=455.98s)]
*  Bezos and their picture from Vogue. Give me a break. What does this say about us if anything? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, it was a Las Vegas wedding held against the backdrop of a civilized European city [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=466.1s)]
*  And it should have probably been held in the Las Vegas version of Venice rather than the real version [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=472.38s)]
*  Venice is a city of great commercial enterprise [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=478.7s)]
*  It was a very rich city all the ships of the world went out from Venice and the banking of the world was centered there [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=482.34s)]
*  So this is an attempt to take over with the new class the sort of old world [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=488.42s)]
*  Charisma of this wonderful place [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=494.82s)]
*  Everybody looked tacky as you say the guest list seemed to have been chosen by a PR firm [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=497.82s)]
*  Where was his little key league coach his favorite professional? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=503.46s)]
*  His favorite professor, you know the guy who stuck with him [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=507.3s)]
*  Like you say in the early days of business when nobody thought he was gonna be a big deal. It was impersonal [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=511.14s)]
*  It was tacky. It was expensive. It made a lot of money strangely for his [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=517.14s)]
*  nemesis Elon Musk because most people used X to [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=523.5s)]
*  You know tune into this thing. So he spent 50 million and I think Elon made 50 [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=528.18s)]
*  By the great I the great irony and it's only known to somebody [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=534.2199999999999s)]
*  over-educated like me is that the the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=539.98s)]
*  Ruler of Venice and the great palace of Venice was called the Doge [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=544.4599999999999s)]
*  Remember that the Doge Palace the Doge of Venice where have we heard that word? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=550.62s)]
*  It's I think that Elon and Jeff are as they are in space engaged in a coded [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=556.94s)]

*  Marry or date her way into fame a fame [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=615.2800000000001s)]

*  Well, she might trade it out from that Patrick White cell into Jeff Bezos [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=659.24s)]
*  And that of course was widely reported to be an extramarital affair by both Sanchez and Bezos whether both married to other people [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=663.52s)]
*  and this is just a long-winded way of saying I [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=670.76s)]
*  Think something's happened to her. Like she just kept wanting to trade up when it came to money and [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=674.72s)]
*  power and fame and [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=681.76s)]

*  It's my second marriage. So I didn't meet Doug until I was 35 and we got married when I was 37 [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=855.66s)]
*  Who's there all my friends from Fox News some of my lawyer friends, you know some friends from my childhood [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=860.3399999999999s)]
*  That's who you invite like I [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=867.54s)]
*  What is the point of inviting all these Hollywood celebrities if it's not just an attention grab? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=870.26s)]
*  At a wedding you're supposed to have people who've known you for a long time who can tell jokes about the time your [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=875.7s)]
*  swim trunks fell off when you dived into the pond and [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=881.5s)]
*  Embarrassing stories from when you were young, but none of those people were there [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=885.78s)]
*  I'm sure they had a maybe they had a viewing party for the actual friends back in some bar and Poughkeepsie or something [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=889.9s)]
*  but [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=898.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was a brand awareness wedding, you know people brought their brands [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=899.26s)]
*  The only disappointment for me in the wedding was that when they stepped gingerly down into those gondolas [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=904.2199999999999s)]
*  That were floating in the canals nobody wiped out [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=910.54s)]

*  But there just wasn't there wasn't enough schadenfreude [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=920.18s)]
*  I mean, there's plenty of schadenfreude in the sense that we hope all of them [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=923.54s)]
*  You know have [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=928.9s)]

*  It's it's a kind of arrogance that you see in the movie Citizen Kane or something like that [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=964.82s)]
*  And I think its message ultimately is you can't touch this you can't that's right [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=970.5s)]
*  Well, that's how it feels [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=977.1800000000001s)]
*  It's a very very let them eat cake a kind of moment at a time when half of these people [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=978.38s)]
*  Are members of a party probably all of them are members of a party that's lecturing us on how we have to get rid of [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=984.38s)]

*  That's not the point if the point is the picture and to see our names in the headlines [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1610.42s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm a novelist [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1615.42s)]
*  That's really what I do and I write books and screenplays and so on and Amazon started as a company that sold books [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1617.7800000000002s)]
*  You know, it's it's America's bookstore. There was no literary content whatsoever at these things [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1625.46s)]
*  The people were barely literate. I didn't see any of them reading and there was a hundred percent showbiz and [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1631.7800000000002s)]
*  What's strange is Hollywood isn't really doing that well these days [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1639.54s)]
*  But they acted as though it was a glorious golden age and I think it was really the swan song for celebrity [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1643.46s)]
*  Culture I really do people like you Megan and others have started in this new media and soon movies will be [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1651.46s)]
*  Much cheaper and made by AI and we'll be rid of these folks in many ways [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1659.02s)]
*  Okay. Now I want to tell you that [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1665.38s)]
*  This morning on AM update we ended the podcast by saying that when they finished their vows they had their [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1667.38s)]
*  friends [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1675.1000000000001s)]
*  Sing Whitney Houston's higher love to them [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1676.3400000000001s)]
*  And that is indeed what they did along with a gospel choir that led it and Doug my husband goes didn't Steve Winwood sing higher love [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1679.5800000000002s)]
*  He is he is right the Steve Winwood did sing higher higher love [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1686.8600000000001s)]
*  He co-wrote and originally released it in 1986 [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1691.1000000000001s)]
*  But Whitney covered the song in 1990 for her album [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1694.14s)]
*  I'm your baby tonight, and that was the version that [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1699.42s)]
*  Lauren and Jeff wanted sung to them by their attendees and the gospel choir [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1703.98s)]
*  So it was Whitney Houston's version of higher love and by that they mean love you find while you're married to two other people [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1710.42s)]
*  Surreptitiously behind their backs when they're not looking or looking at your phone [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1718.02s)]
*  That's the higher love that they found that they wanted us to sing about and think about as we celebrate their union [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1722.04s)]
*  No, this was a celebration of lower love the lowest love that exists and that song in fact is about [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1730.04s)]
*  seeking a transcendent spiritual love above mere human love [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1737.44s)]
*  So they got it wrong in every way [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1742.3999999999999s)]
*  wrong [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1746.28s)]
*  attribution to Whitney [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1747.6399999999999s)]
*  Wrong song for a place that was for a wedding that was a celebration of jewels [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1749.48s)]
*  20 million dollar [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1757.52s)]
*  Outfits, I just hope they took all of these wardrobes packed them into a [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1760.28s)]
*  Giant trunk and have given them to a food bank in Newark, New Jersey because they could keep it running forever [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1766.32s)]
*  It's not that I think they spent too much money [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1772.76s)]
*  It's just that I now think they should give away what's left over [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1775.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, okay. I have a sweet story to tell you now a palate cleanser before the next story speaking of giving clothes away [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1780.08s)]

*  They really don't know he had had both kovat and two Pfizer shots [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1809.76s)]
*  but they don't know the point is they lost their son and their dear friends of ours and [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1813.48s)]
*  They started a charity in their son's name [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1819.48s)]

*  this guy take his next steps and I don't know just as you see like the [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1873.08s)]
*  Just the banality of people like Sanchez and Bezos you you're reminded of the goodness of your fellow man by the family [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1878.12s)]
*  Barclay and the stories like that where it's like one small good deed, you know, you see it manifesting out on the road and you think [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1885.4399999999998s)]
*  Right on you know right on that's that's the kind of human most of us actually spend our days with [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1893.08s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't an inspiring [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1899.4399999999998s)]
*  Example of human giving or human empathy. That's for sure [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1903.08s)]
*  I don't expect to see a homeless person on the streets of San Francisco [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1907.1999999999998s)]
*  Robed in one of these five million dollar pajama bejeweled pajama outfits [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1910.86s)]
*  But you know what the final takeaway is is that Donald Trump thought to be the most garish gauche [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1918.3799999999999s)]
*  And vulgar American rich person is now now looks like Prince Edward or Cary Grant compared to these people [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1925.46s)]
*  I mean [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1933.1399999999999s)]
*  They have outdone him in the vulgar department by a factor of ten [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1934.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. It does feel vulgar but that's you know [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1940.82s)]
*  It's so interesting because truly all these people are Democrats guaranteed. They're Democrats [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1943.86s)]
*  I'm Jeff Bezos showed up at the Trump inauguration because he wanted access to power [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1947.9399999999998s)]
*  I don't think there's any realistic chance. He voted for Trump or wanted Trump or is voted Republican [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1951.6599999999999s)]
*  He runs the Washington Post for God's sake [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1957.46s)]
*  Yeah, no, right exactly [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1960.46s)]
*  but I mean he owns the Washington Post if he actually cared about changing America in Trump's image or [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1961.7s)]
*  Consistent with Trump's policies would we have the Washington Post we have no we would not [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1967.66s)]
*  So it's you know, it's whatever it it's false [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1972.58s)]
*  However, the Democrats his party I guarantee you that's his party and the others who are there from Leo to Oprah to Gail [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1976.34s)]
*  They're the ones who are telling us stop the oligarchy [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1984.26s)]
*  They're the ones who just elected this nutcase is their nominee in New York, right? This Zoran mandami [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1987.1399999999999s)]
*  They're the ones who are out there every day lecturing us about how wealth is bad and it needs to be taxed or the latest [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=1995.1000000000001s)]
*  Message by this mom Dami that has emerged is he said on the Sunday shows? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2000.14s)]
*  I don't think there should be any billionaires while literally saying for the entire campaign that he just ran and won [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2004.5s)]
*  We're gonna tax all the billionaires. That's what's gonna pay for my plan [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2011.7s)]
*  I'm gonna give all these free giveaways to all of New Yorkers by taxing the billionaires [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2015.22s)]
*  And then he tells the CB or the Sunday shows [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2019.38s)]
*  Which one is it Deb that he doesn't believe there should be it was meet the press on NBC South one [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2022.12s)]
*  You are a self-described democratic socialist. Do you think that billionaires have a right to exist? I [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2026.9199999999998s)]
*  Don't think that we should have billionaires because frankly it is so much money in a moment of such inequality and [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2034.52s)]
*  Ultimately what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country and I look forward [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2041.36s)]
*  To work with everyone including billionaires to make a city that is fairer for all of them [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2048.08s)]
*  So there you have it well, well there aren't going to be many billionaires left in your city Zoran [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2054.2000000000003s)]
*  So you're you're solving the problem merely by trying to get elected a lot of them are moving to [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2060.08s)]
*  Palm Beach or wherever they can get out of reach of your tax man [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2066.56s)]
*  Does he mean by them not existing that they shouldn't be alive or that they shouldn't have a billion dollars? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2071.6800000000003s)]
*  right and I [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2078.44s)]
*  Finally the the problem with Zoran is that he doesn't look like a guy who grew up on the street [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2080.6s)]
*  They didn't his parents are rich [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2088.8s)]
*  Yeah, his mom's a film director [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2091.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure he's gotten the best acting coaching since age three and that is part of his appeal [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2093.48s)]
*  his you know, his father's a tenured professor at Columbia University and [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2099.52s)]
*  He just he skipped the whole [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  You know remember when leckoy lecklessa overthrew the communists. He was a working man. He worked in his shipyard [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2108.08s)]
*  Back when in the days american [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2115.6800000000003s)]
*  socialism was based in the labor movement and it came from really rough guys who worked in factories and you know [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2118.54s)]
*  Did that kind of thing now it's [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2126.96s)]
*  Socialism from the top he might not be an oligarch, but he's been to many of their parties. I promise you [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2129.5s)]
*  Yes, and look he's so his mom has she's a relatively well-known film director who according to him [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2136.1200000000003s)]
*  Was given the opportunity to direct according to her she says was given the opportunity to direct one of the Harry Potter films [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2143.84s)]
*  Which is made something like I don't know [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2150.8s)]
*  900 million dollars and he talked her out of doing it in favor of directing something that was more akin with like their values and [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2152.88s)]
*  That made 20 million so he like this was his this is the guy who's gonna be our economic steward in America's greatest city [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2161.68s)]
*  Like you know what? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2169.12s)]
*  Why don't you forgo the billion dollar film for the 20 million dollar film because it'll make me feel good about myself [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2170.4399999999996s)]
*  He's out there [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2176.72s)]
*  Cosplaying like a third world person because he lived in Uganda for the first seven years and then moved here [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2178.2799999999997s)]
*  He's 33 this video of him eating with his fingers is [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2185.68s)]
*  Circulating well, he's talking about how he understands the third world. I mean literally his mother's I think got millions here. Watch this [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2191.08s)]
*  So the third holy grail of taboos in American politics you have socialism you have Islam and then you have Palestine and you are really [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2200.24s)]
*  Going for the trifecta. Let's go. Let's go. Tell me why is Palestine a part of your politics when you grow up as [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2207.92s)]
*  Someone especially in the third world you have a very different understanding of the Palestinian struggle [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2216.32s)]
*  So I don't know what's happening there but [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2224.2000000000003s)]
*  Somebody was defending him saying he was using a piece of bread [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2228.0s)]
*  He certainly looks like he's scooping his fingers into his food and shoving it into his mouth [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2230.76s)]
*  And I actually don't really care if he if there was bread or not, but it's even worse if it's not bread [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2235.4s)]
*  That's not how somebody who's an American eats [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2239.88s)]
*  But it's him cosplaying third world person and [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2243.4s)]
*  Understanding third world even though his mother is this multi-millionaire film director and his father is a chaired professor at Columbia [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2247.5200000000004s)]
*  Well Americans always want their cake and eat it too [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2257.84s)]
*  They want to you know lose weight without eating less they want to learn in their sleep and they want everything [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2261.0s)]
*  You know in its impossible form and now we want socialism from the point of view of a [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2267.96s)]
*  Nepo baby, which is the only way you could still believe in it at this point [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2274.92s)]
*  Because if you've actually lived it like many of the refugees and migrants to America [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2279.88s)]
*  he's the kind of politician that has caused people to [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2285.5600000000004s)]
*  emigrate to America because [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2290.4s)]
*  Leaders like him have impoverished the countries that they come from they must be like looking at each other and going [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2292.4s)]
*  Oh, no, not this again [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2299.2400000000002s)]
*  so he is [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2302.36s)]
*  Running when he was running he just won the Democratic nomination as a reminder the actual general election is four months away in November [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2305.44s)]
*  For the mayor of New York, but while running [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2310.92s)]
*  He made clear that he wanted to divide the city in terms of race that that's how he was going to determine [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2313.7200000000003s)]
*  Who'd attacks more who was advantaged and who wasn't and he was asked about this and his focus on [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2320.34s)]
*  whiteness when he went on meet the press he's got a campaign platform that calls for the city's [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2327.9s)]
*  notoriously skewed [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2334.02s)]
*  Property tax system in which ritzy brownstones are hit at lower rates than homes and rentals in lower income neighborhoods [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2335.5800000000004s)]
*  Which even some of his Republican competitors have acknowledged could be a problem like they're not [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2343.5s)]
*  It's it got this way through some wackadoodle policies [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2348.92s)]
*  but even those who have been talking about this talk about it in terms of [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2352.04s)]
*  People who make a bunch of money shouldn't have a lower property tax than people who don't right? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2356.2799999999997s)]
*  But what here's how he talks about it on his website shift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2360.32s)]
*  to more expensive homes in richer wait for it and [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2367.72s)]
*  whiter [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2371.7599999999998s)]
*  neighborhoods [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2373.12s)]
*  Now what does white have to do with it? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2374.2799999999997s)]
*  Why didn't richer get it done this came up when he went on meet the press this weekend and here's how that went [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2378.4399999999996s)]
*  Explain why you are bringing race into your tax proposal. That is just a [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2385.7999999999997s)]
*  Description of what we see right now. It's not driven by race [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2391.2s)]
*  It's more of an assessment of what neighborhoods are being under tax versus overtaxed [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2394.24s)]
*  And I understand you're saying we're simply describing the types of neighborhoods that would see these increase in taxes [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2397.8399999999997s)]
*  And yet by invoking race, do you run the risk of potentially alienating key constituents? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2404.12s)]
*  I think I'm just naming things as they are and ultimately my [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2409.52s)]
*  The the thing that motivates me in this is to create a system of fairness [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2413.44s)]
*  So no plans to change that language on your website [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2417.08s)]
*  The focus here is to actually ensure a fair property tax system and that the use of that language is an assessment of the neighbor [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2421.0s)]
*  If I have to demonize whitey along the way then so be it that's just [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2428.88s)]
*  Where he stands [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2434.12s)]
*  It's a it's a bonus. It's a fringe benefit [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2435.8399999999997s)]
*  You know if whiteness itself confirmed into wealth albinos would be the richest among us [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2440.4s)]
*  But they aren't and the truth is that if you look at statistics across the board in America [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2446.7599999999998s)]
*  per person [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2454.4s)]
*  White people are not the richest [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2455.8399999999997s)]
*  demographic [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2458.8399999999997s)]
*  They really aren't and I challenge your listeners to do some research on that [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2459.92s)]
*  He's he's trying in all kinds of ways to be a mischievous [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2466.56s)]
*  Revolutionary who we can love and hug and relate to [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2473.56s)]
*  But he wants to signal at all times his absolute the most [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2479.08s)]
*  venomous and aggressive [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2484.8s)]
*  Radical base the other thing that he's been doing is [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2487.5600000000004s)]

*  Which are even more horrifying than the ones he's holding presently [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2499.32s)]
*  And I think the strategy there is to make himself look like he's moderated somewhat, you know, he he's [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2504.04s)]

*  But to win socialism and obviously raising class consciousness is a critical part of that [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2543.38s)]
*  But making sure that we have candidates that both understand that and are willing [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2546.7000000000003s)]

*  We are unapologetic about our socialism. There are also other issues that we firmly believe in whether it's BDS, right? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2562.78s)]

*  Kristen Welker about his refusal to condemn the term globalize the Intifada [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2821.38s)]
*  Not gonna do it wasn't interested in standing down from that at all. Here's that soundbite [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2827.7s)]
*  You were recently asked about the term globalized the Intifada [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2833.2599999999998s)]
*  If it makes you uncomfortable in that moment, you did not condemn the phrase now [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2837.98s)]
*  Do you condemn that phrase globalize the Intifada? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2843.3s)]
*  That's not language that I use the language that I use and the language that I will continue to use to lead the city [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2846.98s)]
*  Is that which speaks clearly to my intent which is an intent grounded in a belief in universal human rights [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2852.46s)]
*  Do you condemn that phase globalize the Intifada which a lot of people here is a call to violence against Jews [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2858.64s)]
*  I've heard from many Jewish New Yorkers who have shared their concerns with me and I've heard those fears and I've had those [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2864.02s)]
*  conversations and ultimately what I think I need to show is [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2870.46s)]
*  The ability to not only talk about something but to tackle it and to make clear that there's no room for anti-semitism in this [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2873.78s)]
*  city, why not just condemn it my [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2879.46s)]
*  concern is [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2882.98s)]
*  to start to walk down the line of [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2885.5s)]
*  Language and making clear what language I believe is permissible or impermissible [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2888.38s)]
*  Takes me into a place similar to that of the president who is looking to do those very kinds of things putting people in jail [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2892.7799999999997s)]
*  For writing an op-ed putting them in jail for protesting ultimately. It's not language that I use its language. I understand there are concerns about [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2899.38s)]
*  Okay, let me say something Walter I'm not into making people say X Y or Z at all [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2907.54s)]
*  But the reason this guy won't say that is because he's in favor of it [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2912.2599999999998s)]
*  100% I have zero doubt in my mind the real reason he won't condemn that phrase is because he agrees with it [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2916.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, you know he's said to be a very eloquent and well-spoken guy, but that was word salad, you know [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2925.3799999999997s)]
*  That was a word Waldorf salad. It had everything chopped up in it and it meant nothing and frankly [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2932.2599999999998s)]
*  When you go to those lengths not to say something it's because you want to say it [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=2939.2599999999998s)]

*  We created effectively a system where we gave unrestricted access to capital which inflated the cost of education [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3120.66s)]
*  people could go to school like Zoran and major in African studies and graduate with [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3127.82s)]
*  $200,000 of debt and then never get a job [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3133.1s)]
*  The guy has not had a real job and this is the truth for 32 million young Americans [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3135.46s)]
*  They all have what is called negative capital. They have debt and they will never be able to get out of that cycle [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3140.34s)]
*  So where do you turn in that moment? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3146.1s)]
*  You don't go turn to corporations to solve your problems you turn to the voting booth and you hear a guy like Zoran show [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3147.46s)]
*  Up and say there can be a better path forward [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3154.12s)]
*  the better path forward is the government can and should do more to help and this becomes a tipping point when the majority of the [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3156.46s)]
*  voter base ends up in that situation where they're that deeply in need where they have negative capital and that is the situation America finds [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3163.2400000000002s)]
*  Itself in today. There is no easy answer and there is no easy solution out of this or ran one [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3170.1s)]
*  61 to 39 with college educated at the end of the day young [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3175.2599999999998s)]
*  college educated white people elected this guy and [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3179.8999999999996s)]
*  That is the beginning of a wave that will sweep over America and I really do worry about where this takes us. I [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3182.74s)]
*  Think that is so smart and [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3190.54s)]
*  It really does the way we just keep upping the amount of loans you can get from the government [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3193.06s)]
*  To go to college and then the colleges keep upping their tuition [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3198.5s)]
*  So that they're the only beneficiaries of all that and then giving these useless degrees [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3203.38s)]
*  That people like mom Dami get like majoring in African Studies or women's studies that will not lead to gainful employment [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3208.94s)]
*  but will lead to a bunch of navel gazing and [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3216.66s)]
*  Growing hatred for oneself and possibly one's government and country that then leads you to emerge by saying [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3219.7000000000003s)]
*  Actually government is the answer but as long as I'm at the top of it private industry is the problem [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3227.18s)]
*  Republicans are the problem and what really needs to happen is seizure of [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3233.5s)]
*  industries and me in charge so that people like me can finally make a living and [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3238.3s)]
*  Have the American dream available to them as it as it isn't right now because they were sold a bill of goods [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3244.74s)]
*  By these colleges by the federal government that funds them to the nth degree and by everybody who pretends that these useless degrees [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3250.5s)]
*  These people get are actually going to take them someplace or open certain doors your thoughts. I [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3257.9s)]
*  Have two recent college graduate children who live in two of the most expensive cities in the US [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3264.6200000000003s)]
*  New York City in Los Angeles [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3272.1800000000003s)]
*  They are wonderful kids who studied hard and are working hard and good jobs [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3274.7s)]
*  Those jobs are barely capable of supporting them in these cities [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3283.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, they live with roommates their expenditures and their incomes [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3289.3399999999997s)]
*  Pretty much match [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3296.54s)]
*  Because they've got a dad who told them not to spend more than they make they don't [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3298.06s)]
*  But if they even [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3302.82s)]
*  Skimp and save it really doesn't go very far [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3306.1400000000003s)]
*  These are real problems. They definitely are or rents [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3310.1800000000003s)]
*  Underemployment I suppose [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3316.7000000000003s)]
*  But most of them can be traced to government policies and programs in the first place [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3319.3s)]
*  The wonderful perpetual motion machine of certain kinds of democratic politics are that the government creates the problem and then it sells you the solution [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3326.66s)]
*  And the same people make money on both ends of the proposition [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3336.06s)]
*  Yeah, yep, it's this is very connected to the woke DEI problem that we're dealing with in schools and colleges across the country where [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3341.18s)]
*  Heather McDonald's has documented this brilliantly you if you take [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3349.58s)]
*  A lot of these young men and women who get into these elite universities so-called elite [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3353.58s)]
*  You know the Ivy League who get in thanks to skin color DEI related things and [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3359.66s)]
*  And you removed those preferences and just let them go to the colleges that their SAT scores and their [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3366.34s)]
*  Non-inflated grades because now they're coming out of high schools that also inflate their grades based on skin color [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3372.74s)]
*  But let's go back to the day where they were graded on what they actually did [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3377.2999999999997s)]
*  And the SAT was whatever it was and then they either got into a school or didn't irrespective of skin color [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3380.7799999999997s)]
*  They would go to those schools those so-called lesser schools and they would become [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3386.8599999999997s)]
*  engineers and [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3391.8999999999996s)]
*  Mathematicians and maybe be on their way to doing like quant work that actually pays a lot [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3393.9399999999996s)]
*  But what's happening instead is they're going to Harvard [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3401.5s)]
*  They're going to Yale where their test is going to be done in the same way that they're going to Yale [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3404.62s)]
*  Where their test scores are two standard deviations at least below the average student there who is Indian [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3409.74s)]
*  Asian or white and [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3417.74s)]
*  They're winding up in the African Studies Department or the Women's Studies Department [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3420.2599999999998s)]
*  because those are the only places where they can get an easy grade and still graduate and a [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3424.1s)]
*  Totally useless degree that will not pay any of their bills go ahead I [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3430.02s)]
*  I beg to differ slightly a lot of the people who are coming into those schools now [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3435.26s)]
*  And I went to one myself Princeton University who are coming from [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3441.14s)]
*  You know new to college backgrounds are studying things like engineering. They're filling the computer science [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3447.26s)]
*  programs at places like Harvard [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3454.58s)]
*  In some ways the liberal arts at those colleges the English departments and so on [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3457.1s)]
*  are [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3463.98s)]
*  Starving for applicants these colleges are filled with people who are attempting to join major [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3466.14s)]
*  corporations and so on the problem is two things one that [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3472.7s)]
*  That we live in an incredibly competitive industrial world in which even these good jobs [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3478.18s)]
*  Though they are high-paying by some you know [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3486.02s)]
*  Absolute standard Oh [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3490.1s)]
*  $150,000 well that won't get you much in New York City [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3493.42s)]
*  It has given the taxes given the you know cost of living and so on [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3497.62s)]
*  But a lot of those problems have to do with how expensive New York is [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3503.42s)]
*  to do business in [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3510.58s)]
*  And those are government programs a lot of the high prices of New York and the high cost of New York [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3512.58s)]
*  are the result of [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3518.42s)]
*  Programs like Zoran's which aren't even as aggressive as the ones he's proposing [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3521.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. So look at Boston and San Francisco same problem [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3526.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3530.7000000000003s)]
*  being a young person in America is a [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3531.2200000000003s)]
*  Really tough proposition these days because even when you do do the practical thing even when you seek the [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3533.86s)]
*  Professions that supposedly pay you're in competition [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3540.62s)]
*  For housing and other things in a way that just doesn't allow you to get a leg up and [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3544.3s)]
*  The solution to this that he proposes which is a socialistic solution [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3551.78s)]
*  Higher taxes on those who have and so on the problem with higher taxes [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3556.78s)]
*  Is that you end up with less to tax because the people move away [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3561.34s)]
*  The things you're taxing become less valuable and it's kind of a vicious cycle [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3566.38s)]
*  It's kind of a vicious cycle. It's like burning the furniture to stay warm [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3572.06s)]
*  Eventually you run out of other people's money. Yeah, you run out of other people's money [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3576.34s)]
*  you run out of furniture and I have a lot of empathy for [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3580.2599999999998s)]
*  the sensible young people of America [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3585.38s)]
*  Also those who have put themselves into huge debt and one of the problems with student loans always has been that you [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3588.78s)]
*  You all that money goes to the university [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3596.46s)]
*  They're able to charge higher and higher prices Megan I had I had a student [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3599.1s)]
*  You know an Ivy League college during kovat who we were paying [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3604.34s)]
*  You know [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3609.58s)]
*  $80,000 a year for and he was getting [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3611.26s)]
*  He was getting the zoom classes that were recorded because the you know, the college was closed for a year [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3614.3s)]
*  these these places are raking it in and [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3621.94s)]
*  Their students are [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3626.02s)]
*  Given these high expectations and that's the other problem. They come out with [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3628.1s)]
*  incredibly high expectations [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3633.42s)]
*  They think that somehow having graduated from these places and having good initial salaries and so on [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3635.26s)]
*  They're going to be able to save but their inability to save has something to do with [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3641.3s)]
*  factors that aren't [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3647.2200000000003s)]
*  Aren't [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3650.34s)]
*  adjustable by taxation and [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3652.1800000000003s)]
*  The problem he's addressing is a real one in the sense that there are people struggling [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3654.74s)]
*  even those who shouldn't be struggling given, you know their aptitude and their [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3660.2599999999998s)]
*  accomplishment, but [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3666.8599999999997s)]
*  He is gonna make it worse. That's what I see and he's [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3669.66s)]
*  Says free free Berg thinks that the solution in part should be the government should get out of the business of [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3674.3799999999997s)]
*  Providing loans for college the free market would take over now [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3681.74s)]
*  you've got Wall Street evaluating whether you are a good risk or a bad risk and they will necessarily start defunding schools that don't take anybody anywhere and [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3686.1s)]
*  degrees that don't take anybody anywhere and [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3697.14s)]
*  They'll be a lot more discriminating and figuring out who is a good bet and which program and which major is a good bet [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3700.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean that'll raise a whole host of other problems [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3707.46s)]
*  But I see his point what happens every time is the government just keeps increasing the number of loans you can get then [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3709.7400000000002s)]
*  The colleges increase the tuition that they're gonna charge you you get absolutely no additional benefit [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3714.82s)]
*  But you have to pay back all those loans [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3721.34s)]
*  eventually the university gets richer and richer and [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3723.7000000000003s)]
*  Then the university feels good about itself in some of these cases because they led in a DEI [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3726.2200000000003s)]
*  Candidate who otherwise couldn't have gotten in and they don't really give a shit whether you wind up with a job or not [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3731.1s)]
*  They get paid either way [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3736.02s)]
*  Right, right and and and and so many jobs in America are basically make work these days [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3738.22s)]
*  You know and a lot of these universities they have more administrators than they do students [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3744.5s)]
*  and then at a lot of corporations that the human resources department and the other sort of [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3750.1s)]

*  It appears to be productive but a lot of it's being sucked into a black hole of [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3780.7s)]
*  rulemaking and rule administering and [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3786.38s)]

*  Um, it makes it very hard to compete when when half of the you know [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3824.32s)]
*  Apartments are being rented as short-term housing or Airbnb. It makes it hard to get a [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3828.8s)]

*  When it comes to housing [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3875.1200000000003s)]

*  Sometimes go to jobs that they can't stand because they're responsible and they wouldn't dream of letting somebody else much less the government [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3890.88s)]
*  Cover for their bills, but they get stuck paying the bills of these other freeloaders who aren't even supposed to be here [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3898.4s)]
*  Well, I made I made a joke to a young new yorker the other day was complaining about you know [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3904.56s)]
*  Whether he would be able to afford to live there under mom. Donnie [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3909.68s)]
*  I said you might not be poor enough to live in new york city [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3913.2799999999997s)]
*  In other words at some point [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3916.72s)]
*  At some point it will be the poor who have the advantage of all sorts of uh payments [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3919.2s)]
*  Discounts programs and so on and that'll be a wonderful two days [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3925.18s)]
*  Yeah, exactly, you know and then we know exactly what'll happen it will implode just like everybody else who's tried communism [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3930.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but but but chasing employers out of the city is really it may cause rents to go down [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3938.32s)]
*  But it will cause a lot of other things to go down with them [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3946.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, because he's like not only am I going to tax the businesses [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3949.92s)]
*  He wants to raise the corporate income tax [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3952.6400000000003s)]
*  But even if if a company moves out of new york and moves to texas or florida [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3954.56s)]
*  I'm going to hike their taxes for doing business in new york [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3960.32s)]
*  So I will get them one way or another great way to chase them out of doing business in new york altogether [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3963.68s)]
*  Like the ones who can not everybody will be forced to do that some some will say fu new york [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3968.32s)]
*  They ever get try to order something through the mail and they say does not ship to whatever state [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3972.72s)]
*  It's because there's some policy in that state that makes it difficult or unpleasant or impossible for them to do business there [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3977.52s)]
*  New york state just thinks it's above that I would beg to differ [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3983.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, and there's a tax that isn't financial [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3987.28s)]
*  Let's call it the stress tax or the quality of life tax [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3989.6000000000004s)]
*  I visit new york every few weeks as I have for years for business [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3992.88s)]
*  So I get to see it, you know in a staggered way [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=3996.88s)]
*  And the quality of life has deteriorated there the street scenes are rougher are rougher and more volatile [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4000.5600000000004s)]
*  um the expectations about [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4009.2000000000003s)]
*  Crime and so on have uh have have fallen, you know, you just don't expect the safe [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4012.32s)]
*  Uh civilized city that you did in the past and if you're willing to go through all the struggles financial and [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4018.7200000000003s)]
*  Career wise to stay and make it in new york, but you add this extra layer of just [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4026.48s)]
*  hassles and dirt and [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4033.02s)]
*  Pot smelling on every corner and rats more rats than they've ever seen in a city [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4036.0s)]
*  and after a while you go the mental tax is [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4042.4s)]
*  Too much and under mom donnie. I have a feeling it's going to be a more chaotic a dirtier [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4047.52s)]
*  a less [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4054.0s)]
*  pleasing and less peaceful city and that could be the difference [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4055.18s)]
*  Yeah the um [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4061.6s)]
*  Just to zoom out for a second new york, which we're talking about has five boroughs [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4063.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, i'm trying to remember the song that they taught my kids in preschool when they were little new york children. It was like [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4067.6s)]
*  the bronx brooklyn [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4074.56s)]
*  The bronx brooklyn [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4077.36s)]
*  In manhattan don't forget statin island. Anyway, whatever there's five boroughs of new york city the five boroughs of new york city, okay [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4079.12s)]
*  The bronx is part of new york no question. It is one of the five boroughs [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4088.08s)]
*  west chester [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4093.52s)]
*  Is a tony community just north of new york city in between new york city and connecticut [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4095.04s)]
*  west chester has got a lot of very well-heeled communities like [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4103.4400000000005s)]
*  bronxville that's where um, well, I guess I shouldn't say but somebody very famous who runs a very big sports organization [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4109.02s)]
*  Lives and has raised his children [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4115.12s)]
*  Um all sorts of lovely little pockets there one half of it is on the water the hudson river and overlooks [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4117.12s)]
*  Um that and then on the other side you kind of walk up and there's more water [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4123.599999999999s)]
*  anyway [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4128.08s)]
*  There's a beautiful little town called yorktown heights in west chester. It's not the fanciest of west chester towns [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4129.599999999999s)]
*  But it ain't the bronx by any measure [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4136.48s)]
*  and the reason this is relevant is because a congresswoman who you may know as [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4140.08s)]
*  Alexandria ocasio cortez has been telling us for years that she is from the bronx [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4144.94s)]
*  And recently she had a fight with president trump over tweet text truth, whatever [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4151.92s)]
*  And she played tough and said oh, don't you mess with me? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4157.599999999999s)]
*  I'm a bronx girl and we eat queens boys for breakfast because that's where trump was raised in the queens [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4161.36s)]
*  and uh respectfully aoc well [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4167.92s)]
*  That's real cute except she only lived in the bronx until she was age five [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4171.200000000001s)]
*  When at best you're in usually kindergarten, maybe first grade and she spent the rest of her childhood [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4176.56s)]
*  one through 12th grade [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4184.64s)]
*  In yorktown heights, which is west chester and by any measure it is richer [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4187.04s)]
*  nicer and more [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4193.6s)]
*  White-collar than the bronx with all due respect to my friends in the bronx [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4196.400000000001s)]
*  She's pretending to be a be a bronx girl because she wants this to be part of her origin story [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4201.52s)]
*  The same way as she wants now to be called alexandria ocasio cortez [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4207.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, everyone knew her as sandy cortez when she was growing up [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4212.8s)]
*  and her lies are [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4216.8s)]
*  coming to the fore so [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4219.200000000001s)]
*  Among other things benny johnson who's hilarious and he's a great twitter follow and has a great show [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4221.76s)]
*  Went to yorktown heights [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4228.08s)]
*  Just to take a look and to talk to some folks there about aoc and what yorktown is like and so on [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4230.48s)]
*  And now some of her schoolmates separate apart from benny are weighing in on her claims [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  I'll get to the benny thing in one second, but there was a piece in the new york post [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4242.32s)]
*  talking about how uh [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4247.28s)]
*  Uh [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4249.599999999999s)]
*  She's embarrassing herself. She's embarrassing her herself now with this bronx girl claim [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4250.8s)]
*  They went and tracked down assemblyman matt slater who's a republican from yorktown new york state assembly [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4256.639999999999s)]
*  And said he said quote she's embarrassing herself for doing everything possible to avoid saying she grew up in the suburbs [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4264.16s)]
*  Instead of the bronx what she said now that people are starting to look at whether she's a bronx girl, which she's not [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4270.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh is quote i'm proud of how I grew up and I talk about it all the time [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4277.52s)]
*  My mom cleaned houses and I helped we cleaned tutors homes in exchange for sat prep [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4282.0s)]
*  She went to boston university again. She she's like mom. Dami. She wants to like [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4287.92s)]
*  He's picturing himself eating with his hands like he's fresh off the boat from someplace [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4292.16s)]
*  And she's talking about how she's been cleaning houses her whole life. Meanwhile, she grew up in yorktown [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4296.4s)]
*  Then she writes she says growing up between the bronx and yorktown [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4300.96s)]
*  Deeply shaped my views of inequality and it's a big reason. I believe the things I do today now back to matt slater who says [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4306.660000000001s)]
*  first she said she has [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4315.14s)]
*  visited extended family [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4317.9400000000005s)]
*  Then she said she had commuted [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4320.660000000001s)]
*  Between the bronx and york. I was just visiting yorktown heights [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4323.3s)]
*  Oh, I was just commuting and now she's said she grew up in between the two like back and forth back and forth [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4327.700000000001s)]
*  No, she lived in the bronx and she was five then they moved to yorktown heights. He says it's clearly desperate attempts to protect the lie [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4333.62s)]
*  That she is from [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4340.9s)]
*  the bronx [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4342.5s)]

*  This looks like an awesome place to be from get out of the car and you find something like this [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4360.18s)]

*  Why identify with the place that her parents worked hard to get her out of? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4535.62s)]
*  Rather than the place that the parents worked hard to get her to [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4540.42s)]
*  um [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4544.42s)]
*  It's it's cosplay and it's fake [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4545.3s)]
*  But what it really does is it obscures the fact that she's the product [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4548.26s)]
*  Of people who are able to work save buy a home and give their child an education [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4552.820000000001s)]

*  Anyone can do this what she's doing you look at your circumstances and [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4573.14s)]
*  Talk about them in the most dire terms possible to make yourself sound tougher than you are to make it sound like you overcame [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4577.860000000001s)]
*  More than you did [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4585.860000000001s)]
*  And in her case to make it sound like you have street cred [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4587.3s)]
*  When you try to fight the oligarchy, I mean honestly I could I could sit here and say [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4590.58s)]
*  I was raised by a single mom who was a nurse [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4594.66s)]
*  Who put me through college with their own blood sweat and tears? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4598.02s)]
*  It's true. It's [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4601.860000000001s)]
*  All of that is true except there's some context for the first 15 years of my life [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4603.86s)]
*  I had an intact family [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4608.58s)]
*  My dad was alive and well and was a college professor first at syracuse and then at the state university of new york at albany [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4610.259999999999s)]
*  And we were a double income family and my mom was within nine credits of getting her phd and was [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4617.299999999999s)]
*  Eventually a nursing manager [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4623.78s)]
*  And then my dad died suddenly and my mom did have to put me through college with my dad's insurance money [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4626.0199999999995s)]
*  So yeah, we had some knocks but you see what i'm saying like leaving out the other part would lead you to think I had [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4631.78s)]
*  A much tougher childhood than I really did [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4638.42s)]
*  And what she wants to do is the she wants to inflate [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4641.54s)]
*  The bronx the five years of bronx living when she was a toddler [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4644.66s)]
*  Into her actual origin story. Here's another example. I could tell you [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4649.7s)]
*  Walter I had to wait tables to put myself through school [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4653.62s)]
*  I worked day and night which is true to make sure I could pay the bill so that I could go to law school [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4657.379999999999s)]
*  And make something of myself there's never been a doctor or a lawyer in any of my family [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4662.9s)]
*  My my nana answered phones for the phone company. My pop-up worked at a paper mill. These were not rich people [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4668.66s)]
*  Okay, all of that would be true [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4675.62s)]
*  but the truth is I was [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4677.7s)]
*  Waiting tables in between my summers at syracuse university which cost [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4679.7s)]
*  15 000 a year back then it's probably a lot more now. I know it's a lot more now [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4684.34s)]
*  Here's how aoc who went to boston university, which I think is more expensive than syracuse talks about her very much more [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4689.14s)]
*  Yes talks about her stint during that same period of her life. Well, listen to this. Uh, it's sought 10 [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4696.58s)]
*  Because when the system is stacked against you [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4703.06s)]
*  It's hard to feel like anything you do matters [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4706.34s)]
*  It's hard to feel like we matter in this democracy [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4710.66s)]
*  And it is easy to give in to the despair [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4715.139999999999s)]
*  And I can tell you I know that when I was waitressing and struggling to put food on the table for a while there [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4718.26s)]
*  I did [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4725.7s)]
*  I tried to stop caring [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4727.3s)]
*  I tried to just keep my head down work my shifts and accept and accept that this is just how things are [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4730.099999999999s)]
*  But that is no way to live arizona it's no way to live [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4736.66s)]
*  What I do know [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4744.42s)]
*  Is that we don't have to live like this and in fact we cannot live like this anymore [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4747.14s)]
*  This is ridiculous walter what in god's name is she talking about did she want to outlaw waitressing? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4756.74s)]
*  This is the party also at the same time that's saying who's going to pick the crops if we don't have migrants [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4763.14s)]
*  Who's going to wipe your ass? That's what they literally said [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4768.900000000001s)]
*  Is this the party of the dignity of labor or the party that's trying to you know [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4773.9400000000005s)]
*  Get us all into office jobs. I I can't tell who they're speaking to or what they're talking about anymore [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4778.900000000001s)]
*  If I wanted to list some of the worst jobs i've done and act as though [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4785.780000000001s)]
*  I was trapped in them. I could tell a story of even harder knocks than she [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4789.94s)]
*  Right, but it's called being a young person [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4795.94s)]
*  Yes, the fact is she's a u.s. Congressman now who who who apparently spent the first few years in the bronx [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4799.38s)]
*  It wasn't her money that got them out of the bronx. I don't think it was her lemonade stand that did it [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4806.98s)]
*  It was her parents working hard. They left new york city [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4811.78s)]
*  The most important thing that happens is you leave the tax district of new york city [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4814.9s)]
*  And and so they went to a you know, nicer neighborhood [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4819.219999999999s)]
*  Their child went to a private school in the capital of american east coast academe boston [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4823.139999999999s)]
*  And she's now a congressman [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4829.86s)]
*  Can't she be honest about her arc and her narrative which is that of? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4832.0199999999995s)]
*  A congressman can't she be honest about her arc and her narrative which is that of? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4837.46s)]
*  Being lifted on the backs of hard-working parents who obviously saved [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4845.7s)]
*  Obviously wanted the best for their child and then using education and other things [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4851.04s)]
*  Her maybe her natural talents, let's say [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4857.14s)]
*  And even doing a little waitressing she ended up the u.s [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4860.02s)]
*  Congressperson that is not a condom that is not a [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4863.22s)]
*  indictment of the american system that should lead to a [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4868.26s)]
*  Celebration of it and we should be looking to make sure that the system that allowed that for her will allow that for others [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4871.84s)]
*  meanwhile, it's like [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4879.3s)]
*  who picks their [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4881.3s)]
*  their lowest time economically [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4883.38s)]
*  And tries to blow that up into the story of their existence like I and I I was struggling to put food on the table [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4886.1s)]
*  You know I joke with this with adam carolla at the time [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4892.58s)]
*  We were like does she mean literally as a waitress or does she mean back at home in her in her house? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4894.5s)]
*  She couldn't afford food because waitresses in america can afford food. They can afford food [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4899.62s)]
*  It's it's not that lowly a job though. She wants to portray it that way [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4904.82s)]
*  She also wants all this credit. She's a bartender. You know what I I was a cocktail waitress [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4908.58s)]
*  You know what aoc the bartenders made a lot more money at that bar than the cocktail waitresses [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4913.62s)]
*  She was above me so technically i'm the one with despair in my in my past [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4917.94s)]
*  I'm the one people should feel sorry for i'm the one who got screwed by this is this is an absurd way of looking [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4922.98s)]
*  At being a young person [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4928.42s)]
*  That's what she's calling back on everyone's poor in their 20s unless they came from a family with privilege [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4931.139999999999s)]
*  And that's a very very small percentage of americans [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4936.66s)]
*  I taught english as a second language to new migrants in a time square business school for ten dollars an hour [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4940.98s)]
*  Yeah out of princeton university, okay? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4948.259999999999s)]
*  Ten bucks an hour in the globe school of business teaching central american migrants to speak english [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4951.54s)]
*  um [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hj1yAA3Dqo&t=4958.5s)]
