*  We have an alive president and he's actually doing stuff on behalf of the country who it's this is what it's like [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=38.82s)]
*  Who knew it's been so long [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  We kind of forgot what it's like to have somebody actually advocating for us treating us [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=45.74s)]
*  Like we are the superpower that we are not getting pushed around [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=50.46s)]
*  By these lesser countries that think they can dump all their criminal illegals in America and not have us push back [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=55.14s)]
*  It's a thing of beauty [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so let me just start further back before we get to that Pete Hegseth is officially now our defense secretary [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=64.66s)]

*  Congratulations and boo effing who for all of his detractors who tried to stop it [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=75.9s)]
*  Senator Mitch McConnell opened his latest front in his war with MAGA by not voting for Pete [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=81.9s)]
*  Did not see that coming that we of course always thought that McConnell [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=88.62s)]
*  Murkowski and Collins and then maybe Ernst were the ones to look at and that we were inching closer to the vote and people thought that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=92.78s)]
*  Maybe those three would come on board and maybe just McConnell would come on board as it happened [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=99.98s)]
*  McConnell said no to Pete with a statement ripping him [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=105.18s)]
*  And Ernst made all the difference and then JD Vance cast the deciding vote because it was 50-50 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=108.54s)]
*  President Trump had a public standoff with the country of Colombia, not the university [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=113.82000000000001s)]

*  Allow the ice agents into the city jail to pick up the bad hombres that are there [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=489.02s)]

*  Like for instance the catholic church if the catholic church bishops are going to come here and throw down say that hey [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=812.8s)]
*  Start rolling up the bishops if it's going to be catholic charities, which to me is a criminal organization and this weekend [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=819.52s)]

*  We don't have to be empathetic and we do not have to be charitable about the people that made money [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=838.88s)]
*  On a basically human trafficking to get these people here and destroy the country. That's all these ngo's [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=844.4s)]
*  It's the lutheran church the catholic church [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=849.52s)]

*  They cannot stay because of the destroying other citizens in this country [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1083.36s)]
*  They have to go home because you're here on cnbc all the economic reasons. They got to stay is going to be inflationary [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1087.6s)]
*  It's this it's that it costs too much money all of it bottom line if we're a constitutional republic [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1093.36s)]
*  You can't be invaded. We have this is about our sovereignty [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1098.9599999999998s)]
*  They all must go home [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1101.84s)]
*  And I believe you have to have a massive investigation a criminal investigation with a grand jury and a special prosecutor [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1103.36s)]
*  About how this happened how this happened and people have to be held accountable if we cannot hold those in [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1109.76s)]
*  That responsible accountable then we're going to lose our sovereignty that way [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1116.24s)]
*  You know what the the idea of an investigation is really interesting because just today it hit that among those joe biden [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1120.72s)]
*  Pardoned with his massive, you know wand wave of a wand [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1127.9s)]
*  was a killer of two people in connecticut, uh a mother and child and [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1131.44s)]
*  Dick blumenthal the democrat senator from from connecticut is out there saying that was this was a massive mistake [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1138.4s)]
*  That he doesn't believe biden intended to do this that that this person this killer was represented by the aclu to biden to be a non [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1143.68s)]
*  violent drug offender [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's why he got lumped in [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1152.32s)]
*  and there are already some on x calling for an investigation into how [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1154.32s)]
*  This and all the other pardons were made and whether joe biden was compass mentis [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1158.8s)]
*  In in order to grant the clemency and the pardons that he granted and whether some of these things can be undone whether [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1163.2s)]
*  Whether even the president himself intended to actually allow some of these people out of jail [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1169.76s)]
*  They could definitely be undone and I say this about the january 6 as you know [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1175.6s)]
*  It has to be because they did it so late [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1179.6799999999998s)]
*  They did it. It was his justice department. It has to be pam bondy and the justice department that has to do this and remember, uh [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1182.24s)]
*  email email emmo bovi [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1190.1599999999999s)]
*  The number three guy in the justice department was actually on the raids with homin over the weekend [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1192.8s)]
*  We actually did a sidebar interview with him my guy ben burquam. He said he was outraged outraged by what he saw as obstruction [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1197.28s)]
*  By officials government officials in chicago to stop this so that's what i'm saying [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1205.2s)]
*  We have to adjudicate all this and and these pardons all of the pardons are calling for chaining all of them [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1210.16s)]
*  Actually had to be executed by the justice department because biden waited too late [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1215.92s)]
*  And so I think that all of those ought to be in play tom finton [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1220.16s)]
*  Is adamant about this tom finton doesn't think any of these pardons and we got to look at these ones the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1223.8400000000001s)]
*  The pardon process is so detailed takes so many years [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1229.28s)]
*  It is impossible in this situation in canton in connecticut for that to happen, right? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1232.56s)]
*  It's just because you have every piece of record that's there. You don't know what they're slipping into the deck [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1237.1200000000001s)]
*  To have biden just sign off on so this whole thing the whole pardon thing but tied back to also [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1242.4s)]
*  Illegal immigration has to be fully investigated and we got to get to the bottom and I would tell pan bondi [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1248.24s)]
*  Do not execute on any of the pardons for anybody until we get to the bottom of it [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1254.48s)]
*  It's so disturbing. I it's like I don't have no idea whether joe biden knew what he was doing [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  Uh, but that is something we should be assured of because like it's one thing to do a controversial pardon [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  It's quite another to have the aclu sneak one past [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1270.0s)]

*  This really was a vicious murder that changed our laws said bloomenthal [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1346.08s)]
*  It also highlights how we need to take a look at the pardon system to see how it can be improved [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1349.2s)]
*  Well, why don't we first take a look to see whether it was even intended? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1353.1200000000001s)]

*  It's it's shocking [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1663.56s)]
*  You know margaret brennan just not at this at the level that you can be [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1664.84s)]
*  To run these sunday shows and martha rattes right there. It's just it's just hectoring [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1669.0s)]
*  And you saw last night they got the two new anchors at cbs during the during the championship game [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1673.32s)]
*  They I think it was the afc playoffs. I said man if that's uh, you know, donnell was bad enough [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1677.56s)]
*  Is this an upgrade? This another disaster [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1682.28s)]
*  These guys and this is why that remember the audience is only four and a half million. It's not that big an audience anymore [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1684.68s)]
*  You you were doing that at fox and you're bigger on your podcast, you know when you count everything so [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1690.12s)]
*  It's it shows you that the mainstream media and they're gonna be they're gonna have nothing but deportation porn, right from here on in [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1694.84s)]
*  Because this is where they're going [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1702.28s)]
*  But I think the american people have had a belly full of it and they understand has something has to be done [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1703.56s)]
*  And I love the way that in a very professional [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1707.3999999999999s)]
*  Even-handed way that people like homin and jd are kind of the tip of the spear [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1709.96s)]
*  But I think you're gonna see this across the board with everybody. I think you're gonna see secretary [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1713.96s)]
*  Uh rubio and and and uh and pete hexes across the board pan bondy [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1718.2s)]
*  They just we're not gonna not gonna count them. They're not looking to go to cocktail parties in georgetown [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1722.76s)]
*  They're there to save this country and return it to her greatness under president trump's leadership [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1727.08s)]
*  And I think that's what you're seeing [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1731.8s)]
*  It's so amazing. We've never seen this before where they don't give one inch [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1733.56s)]
*  They don't need to be liked they don't need the invitation to the jury. They'll have their own parties [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1738.04s)]
*  They don't need to go to these and you just never see it [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1742.44s)]
*  You oh my entire history in the media if they go on these sunday shows [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1744.6s)]
*  They do a little ass kissing and then they kind of pivot off to make their final point as like their parting shot of like [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1748.04s)]
*  Well, but we kind of believe this after they totally seed the main points the anchor is raising in part one of his or her argument [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1753.56s)]
*  So it's great to see somebody just fight like completely disavow the premise of the question [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1760.12s)]
*  Here's the the longer version of jd vance with margaret brennan [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1764.92s)]
*  I am convinced like jd is very smart to go on with margaret brennan because some people said why is he going to cbs? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1768.52s)]
*  It's the enemy look what they did to him in the vice presidential debate and I thought no [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1774.84s)]
*  He's very smart because she's adversarial. She's going to try to punch him and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1778.6s)]
*  She's nowhere near his intellectual equal so he knows he can just slice and dice her with ease [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1783.16s)]
*  and [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1788.76s)]
*  Do it as behaving as a gentleman, but leave everybody with the same impression [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1789.88s)]
*  Which is she is no match for him her arguments are no match for his here's thought 13 [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1793.5600000000002s)]
*  There are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks on our country that happened during the campaign [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1798.0400000000002s)]
*  If you may remember so clearly not all of these foreign nationals have been properly vetted in the pipeline [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1806.1200000000001s)]
*  afghan refugees [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1811.88s)]
*  But my primary concern as the vice president margaret is to look after the american people [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1812.6000000000001s)]
*  And now that we know that we have vetting problems with a lot of these refugee programs. We absolutely cannot unleash [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1817.56s)]
*  Thousands of unvetted people into our country. These people are good [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1824.4199999999998s)]
*  These people are vetted just like the guy who played a terrorist attack in oklahoma a few months ago [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1827.8799999999999s)]
*  He was allegedly properly vetted and many people in the media and the democratic party said that he was properly vetted [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1831.72s)]
*  Clearly he wasn't I don't want my children to share a neighborhood with people who are not properly vetted [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1837.72s)]
*  And because I don't want it for my kids i'm not going to force any other american citizens kids to do that either [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1843.64s)]
*  No, and and that was a very particular case [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1848.92s)]
*  It wasn't clear if he was radicalized when he got here or while he was living here. I don't really care margaret [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1850.68s)]
*  I don't want that person in my country and I think most americans agree with me [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1855.64s)]
*  Right on I don't really care margaret. He's right [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1861.0s)]
*  Well, he does it. He does it such a gentleman [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1865.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean he's finally the exasperation when they're just going to continue on and continue on and continue on [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1867.72s)]
*  All of them and I think this is why they've lost the backing of the american people [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1873.8000000000002s)]
*  It's why the ratings are a disaster why the cost of these things they're going through and cutting a very salary [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1876.76s)]
*  Uh, the salaries are outrageous in the first place cutting salaries you see right there in jd [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1881.5600000000002s)]
*  He tries he makes an argument puts the facts out. It just continues on continues on I mean, it's it's not a interview [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1885.3200000000002s)]
*  It's a debate, right? And finally he just says look I don't care and the american people don't care next question [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1890.76s)]
*  Which I think is right [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1895.96s)]
*  Who cares like this guy who he was referencing? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1897.48s)]
*  Uh, his name is 27 year old nashar nazir amad [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1901.26s)]
*  tahedi [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1906.3s)]
*  and uh [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  Per court documents he planned to liquidate his assets repatriate his family to afghanistan purchase assault rifles and stage a violent attack on election day [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1908.9399999999998s)]
*  He entered the u.s [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1915.82s)]
*  On a special immigrant visa on september 9th 2021 days after biden's catastrophic u.s withdrawal from afghanistan who? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1916.54s)]
*  That had a family member die in this planned [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1923.34s)]
*  Violent attack on election day would care when he was radicalized. Why was he here? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1927.34s)]
*  It wasn't lawful. He needed to go. He wasn't vetted. That's the point that he was that he was making [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1933.82s)]
*  Um, and and you know you times that by 20 million [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1938.78s)]
*  So here's another piece because the birthright citizenship has made a lot of uh, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1942.3799999999999s)]
*  Is rough a lot of feathers even on the republican side because trump now was standing what's written in the constitution is saying he's getting rid [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1946.1399999999999s)]
*  Of it and there is a legal argument to be made there [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1951.26s)]
*  Trust me. I researched it in depth before I sat with trump in september 23 because I went into it saying this is a [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1953.5s)]
*  Preposterous proposal it's in the constitution. You can't withdraw it and the more I looked at it the more I realized [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1959.1599999999999s)]
*  Very smart legal scholars actually have made the credible argument that you actually the constitution is not as clear [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1964.06s)]
*  As its defenders argue and you can get rid of birthright citizenship [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1969.6599999999999s)]
*  There's it's because of this clause that means you have to be born in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1972.9399999999998s)]
*  And there's a question there. Anyway, um [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1978.3799999999999s)]
*  The media will not allow for any of that possibility nuance or other legal arguments [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1980.94s)]
*  Margaret brennan brought that up too with jd vans and here's how that went [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1986.3000000000002s)]
*  Temporary residents people who come in here whether legally or illegally and don't plan to stay [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1991.0800000000002s)]
*  Their children shouldn't become american citizens. I don't know any country that does that or why we would be different [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=1997.0200000000002s)]
*  Well, this is a country founded by immigrants. Well, this is a country founded by a country [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2001.5s)]
*  This is a very unique country and it was founded by some immigrants and some settlers [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2005.82s)]
*  But just because we were founded by immigrants doesn't mean that 240 years later that we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2010.6999999999998s)]
*  By the way, it wasn't founded by illegal immigrants and we don't keep the door open [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2019.58s)]
*  To more and more criminals because of what happened 250 years ago steve. It's amazing [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2023.4199999999998s)]
*  Is that stupidity on her part or just liberal bias? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2027.8999999999999s)]
*  I think it's just laziness [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2031.4199999999998s)]
*  I think they've controlled the apparatus for so long. I mean you see this, you know these people they've they've gotten lazy [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2033.18s)]
*  That's one of the reasons they were caught by surprise on 5 november. One of the reasons that msnbc's ratings dropped by two-thirds [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2037.8200000000002s)]
*  Is that? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2045.1000000000001s)]
*  They lied to their audience [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2046.14s)]
*  Their problem is credibility with their audience half that audience is never coming back because they felt they were lied to all the way up until [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2048.14s)]
*  Pennsylvania was called and even that night on the broadcast because i've gone back and studied the arc of the broadcast [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2053.56s)]
*  They lied to their people they all thought camila harris was a historic night camila harris [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2059.5s)]
*  That's where they had the huge crowd at howard university these people lied to people and then later said well [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2063.1s)]
*  You know, you know, we actually knew the polling wasn't that great till the end they outright lie and they will lie [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2068.54s)]
*  Because they've controlled they control every institution they control [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2074.22s)]
*  uh the institutional power in the country and they got very lazy they never thought a uh, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2077.98s)]
*  A a startup group like magga these kind of populist nationalists with with no money and really no [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2082.54s)]
*  Institutional power could getting back on someone like president trump is the reason they treated trump so badly remember the the the [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2088.04s)]
*  The felonies that he was charged with just on on on j on insurrection and j6 [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2094.14s)]
*  Would let left him in prison for 300 years. They wanted him to die in prison [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2098.86s)]
*  Until you embrace that fact that they wanted him to die in prison a man that looks like [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2103.9s)]
*  Look what's happened the last seven days [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2108.54s)]
*  I mean when he went to notredame cathedral, I he looked like charlomane walking in there [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2110.78s)]
*  He is now in the world stage as the most powerful individual and really driving [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2115.02s)]
*  Driving all the action right of everything the american government's doing in every different aspect like 30 different verticals simultaneously [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2120.54s)]
*  He's the most powerful, you know president I think for even more so than reagan [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2128.14s)]
*  I think you gotta go back to fdr and I I put him in the category with general washington and actual uh, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2133.18s)]
*  Abraham lincoln as the age of trump and what he's doing here. They wanted him to die in prison [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2138.06s)]
*  Until you understand that they never thought we were coming back. That's why was it j monahan could lie at davos on the stage [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2143.58s)]
*  So we never debanked anybody go. What are you talking about? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2149.3399999999997s)]
*  We were all backed our credit cards were taken [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2151.74s)]
*  We were debanked the insurance policies were canceled because they never thought we would be back in a billion years [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2154.2999999999997s)]
*  They said this at davos graham alison said beforehand he gave on one of these panels before trump came [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2159.9s)]
*  He said this guy was dead and he says I mean dead he resurrected himself in his movement resurrected [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2165.74s)]
*  He says graham alison said we sat here and mocked those guys for the last four years [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2171.82s)]
*  They never thought we were coming back and now that's why it has to be I think you said the beginning [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2176.38s)]

*  Because what happened with columbia this weekend was a thing of beauty [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2368.62s)]
*  It was a thing of beauty steve and all while trump was on the golf course [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2371.1s)]

*  As trump points out, these are not good guys [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2390.06s)]
*  The face tattoo does not suggest in trump's words. You're going to be president of a bank when you get here and [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2392.14s)]
*  We we get two planes worth of them at least and this is only one weekend and send them back down there [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2398.2999999999997s)]

*  Bad hombres. Yes. They're his countrymen though. They're not they shouldn't be our problem [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2407.8999999999996s)]
*  And trump within about two minutes [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2412.9399999999996s)]
*  Says that's how you want to play we're going to slap a 25 tariff on all of your goods and in a week [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2416.06s)]
*  It's going to go up to 50 and we're [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2421.18s)]
*  Disassociating disassociating ties with all of your embassy officials here and it's going to get more and more painful as the days go on [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2423.72s)]

*  This is what's going to happen and aoc was saying the coffee the coffee prices are just about to go up 25 [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2443.5800000000004s)]
*  A tariff on them is a tariff on americans and then the coffee here will be up 50 you have anna navarro saying [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2449.1800000000003s)]
*  We have poured most a lot of our flowers from columbia there goes valentine's day within I think it was 60 maybe 90 minutes [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2454.6200000000003s)]
*  total [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2462.0600000000004s)]
*  Complete reversal the president of columbia fell on his sword. Not only did he say we'll take him [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2463.0800000000004s)]
*  He said i'm going to send my presidential plane to go pick them up [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2467.5s)]
*  And it was a complete victory before trump had gotten to the next hole steve [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2471.58s)]
*  Um, this is how it's done and I don't even think the leftist can argue that he did anything wrong here [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2476.38s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2481.1s)]
*  This also gets back to the new economic model where he talks about [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2483.2599999999998s)]
*  External revenue service and and and actually not just looking at tariff as a punitive tariff against a mexican tomato for 25 [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2486.86s)]
*  percent but a whole new way you look at the economy of the united states inside the golden door [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2493.5s)]
*  The operating leverage we have as the united states over technology and sanctions and cash flow and capital markets and all of it [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2498.46s)]
*  Including tariffs is enormous and president trump only brought he said tariffs and and and then sanctions [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2505.66s)]
*  He only brought about 50 of the toolbox [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2511.98s)]
*  Our power is almost unlimited about what we can do in a non-kinetic way [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2514.78s)]
*  But it's just never been used. We're always we're just a sap and president trump like he said between between between holes [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2520.3s)]
*  And around that he had he was on a roll on he just said here's what I want to do bang bang bang [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2526.22s)]
*  You know, uh the state and and treasury go out with that an announcement [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2530.78s)]
*  90 minutes enough time that they get to write a press release as you know, they they full surrendered [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2535.1s)]
*  so [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2541.1s)]
*  This is very important for what it shows about the power of the united states [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2542.06s)]
*  In dealing with both our friends and our enemies the one thing I and I have been an advocate for this behind the scenes [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2547.42s)]

*  Trump doesn't give two fucks. Okay, this is what you're saying. He doesn't care. He didn't care what they think about him [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2765.96s)]
*  He doesn't care what the media think they've going to put him in prison. He knows this [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2771.64s)]
*  He was in prison going to be in prison for 300 years on the phony charges of the insurrection [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2775.32s)]
*  Emil bovey was one of his great attorneys for many of those years [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2780.6s)]
*  That's why emil's out there and sees the madness that's going on right now of officials doing it people [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2783.88s)]
*  We don't care about the performance art of the left anymore [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2789.32s)]
*  It's come very close to destroying this country and destroying the citizens of this country and finally [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2793.32s)]
*  Finally through divine providence. We have a leader with all his imperfections [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2799.32s)]
*  Who is going to stand up for the american people and the american citizens and quite frankly the citizens that were [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2804.2s)]
*  Invited in here by this illegitimate biden regime that now have to go back and president trump [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2810.52s)]

*  So that's why I couldn't be prouder of president trump and how he's handling this entire thing [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2821.0s)]
*  I gotta ask you quickly about both tulsi and rfkj getting their confirmation hearings this week tulsis will happen [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2825.08s)]

*  I think bobby i think bobby kennedy rfk jr is going to be fine [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2884.12s)]
*  His command of material. I think he also may pull in a democrat or two. So I think that'll be fine [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2888.6s)]
*  I think cash battelle which of all these this week. They're all important. I think is the most important [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2893.64s)]
*  I think cash gets through I think am gets through I think tulsi's an issue [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2898.8399999999997s)]
*  And I think tulsi's an issue not for previous [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2903.3199999999997s)]
*  I think they're all over her right now of her command of the material [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2906.12s)]
*  And that's why I think the behind the scenes is going to be more important than the upfront [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2910.04s)]
*  Remember what what they're trying to do and this is why they had no no pushback [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2913.8799999999997s)]

*  Nobody else asks a tough question [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2984.28s)]
*  So my recommendation to pam and to all of them when they come after you [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=2986.28s)]

*  Made their case that they could not possibly return to school to teach the children [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3291.96s)]
*  They allegedly love so much and the way they wanted to express it was through my very favorite video of all time [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3295.56s)]
*  Interpretive dance here it is [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3301.7s)]

*  Why do you not care about the students of yours who have been totally? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3383.94s)]
*  Short-changed by the millions and millions of dollars that are going into esl [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3389.6s)]
*  To educate students who are not american citizens [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3395.14s)]
*  Where is the compassion and the empathy? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3398.66s)]
*  For the black students who are paying the highest price because of course they always drop these kids in the [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3401.8s)]

*  And of course, you know, we talk about this a lot on your show megan like these people [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3425.1600000000003s)]
*  Are enforcing their open borders woke agenda [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3430.2s)]
*  Because they are not themselves paying the price [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3435.48s)]
*  It's the opposite the elites have been lining their pockets [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3438.12s)]
*  With the proceeds of this mass migration because it is not them who have to pay for it [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3442.12s)]

*  To jump the line and take that american dream from them and it is just so unbelievably amazing [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3478.44s)]
*  To see a president show up and say [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3485.4s)]

*  Is this person good or evil? They are evil and she is weeping for them [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3701.42s)]
*  It's so sad megan. This woman is the victim of on the one hand mass misinformation [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3707.5s)]
*  By the way, the only people left watching the mainstream media reading the new york times and watching msnbc and cnn [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3713.5s)]
*  Are rich people like her who are totally out of touch and don't have a single working-class person to tell them actually [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3719.8199999999997s)]

*  If my maga family comes to me for help if they're starving in the street, I won't help them. That's the combination of [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3740.54s)]
*  mass psychosis from misinformation from the mainstream liberal media and and a mental health crisis [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3747.56s)]

*  I mean to weep over murderers and rapists it really my heart goes out to her because this person is so [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3761.5s)]

*  I think you should quickly move on and recover [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3791.82s)]
*  But I don't understand the person who works it and tries to squeeze out more tears to make themselves look extra sad [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3794.54s)]
*  I'm really sad. I know I have hundreds of millions, but I hate this country [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3801.34s)]

*  We have done a lot and there have been a number of executive orders that have caused [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3841.3399999999997s)]
*  Already jobs to start coming back into our country, which is a core part of lowering prices [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3846.62s)]
*  More capital investment more job creation in our economy is one of the things that's going to drive down prices for all consumers [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3851.74s)]
*  But also raise wages so that people can afford to buy the things that they need [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3858.22s)]
*  If you look at our slate of executive orders, no no margaret prices are going to come down [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3862.62s)]
*  But it's going to take a little bit of time right the the president has been president for all of five days [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3868.22s)]
*  I think that in those five days, he's accomplished more than joe biden did in four years [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3873.58s)]
*  I like i'm I have to be honest. I'm shocked at the level of stupidity that is masquerading as some tough anchor [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=3879.8199999999997s)]

*  This is all stuff that is invisible to rich people and is unbelievably important to working class people [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4021.52s)]

*  There was a reason he was having these people come up to the microphone and tell their stories [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4220.52s)]
*  Personally and you know, I look at these folks and I see a ton of folks [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4226.42s)]

*  Thanks to donald trump and honestly steve bannon who played a huge role in this [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4537.84s)]
*  In in explaining to people what was happening here that this is not white nationalism. This is [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4542.4s)]
*  Nationalism, this is love of country. This is regular folks not fancy folks [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4549.5s)]

*  When they lie about him, they are lying about the american people and the american people know that [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4586.46s)]
*  So they just can't get away with it anymore. We're really about to enter a glorious new golden era [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4592.219999999999s)]

*  Common-sense values that this country was built on the idea that you owe something to your neighbor [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4602.44s)]
*  First that we owe something to our citizens. It has to mean something to be an american [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4609.5s)]
*  You can't just give that away to rapists and murderers from columbia [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4616.46s)]
*  And expect the american people to just take that we're done with that [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4621.58s)]
*  So it's so good and and unlike the left [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4626.38s)]
*  President trump's party does include the well-off [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4630.22s)]
*  He did go then to the pacific phallus aids and the malibu and and work hard [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4634.06s)]
*  To try to figure out how to help those people too unlike the left which demonizes one side or the other, right? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4639.58s)]
*  It's either like a bunch of country bumpkin losers who just live in flyover country and are too dumb to understand [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4645.26s)]
*  What's best for them or they the rich don't pay their fair share and we need more from them like the aocs [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4651.0199999999995s)]
*  Trump is finding a way to just bring everyone together [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4658.7s)]
*  The only people not in his coalition are the people who refuse to be in it because of their far left [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4662.219999999999s)]
*  woke ideology that won't let them see what's what's [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4668.379999999999s)]

*  Not everybody felt about trump's visit to north carolina the way we did not everybody was inspired by what he did this past week [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4677.98s)]
*  Um, one of the things he said was he's got questions about whether fema should continue as an ongoing concern [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4684.78s)]
*  And whether states should be encouraged to [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4691.0199999999995s)]
*  Save and somehow find a way to address disaster management on a more local level [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4694.7s)]
*  And here is how was it margaret brennan? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4700.78s)]
*  uh responding [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4703.879999999999s)]

*  You know fema has specialized expertise that some of these states just don't have [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4710.86s)]
*  And in their arsenal and I wish that they states who are [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4714.78s)]
*  Who are lower income states the mississippi's the kentuckies the alabamas? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4718.46s)]
*  Be able to do this for themselves without federal help well the president to be clear is not saying we're gonna leave anybody behind [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4723.74s)]
*  He's saying that in the way that we administer these resources some of which is coming from the federal level [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4729.5s)]
*  Some of which is coming from the state level [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4734.46s)]
*  We've got to get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4736.46s)]
*  But they're just they're too dumb and too poor mr vice president to fend for themselves [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4743.58s)]
*  And it's so backwards of course you look at the people at that press conference in north carolina [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4751.26s)]
*  These are the kind of people who help their neighbors who have been helping their neighbors keeping people afloat [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4755.26s)]
*  When the government didn't step in and do it for them [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4760.62s)]
*  Um, you know, i've been obviously super critical of certain aspects of elon musk and doge and what have you [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4763.179999999999s)]
*  But the idea that some massive government bureaucracy that has failed time and again to [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4769.099999999999s)]
*  Equitably distribute aid to the people who most need it knows better [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4774.759999999999s)]
*  What's good for these people than they do themselves is just laughable and you saw in [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4778.7s)]
*  California how exactly like you said megan donald trump was speaking up for people who? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4784.28s)]
*  Just wanted to go home and use their own money [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4789.82s)]
*  And try to find their precious belongings that they could salvage try to clear whatever it is [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4794.14s)]
*  They want to use their own money to do it and the government was literally getting involved in carron bass not giving them [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4799.66s)]
*  Permits to do this and all donald trump said was [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4805.26s)]
*  Why can't they do it and she goes? Oh, well, they can do it in a week. Well a week is a very long time [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4809.1s)]
*  I mean, this is just this is what he's doing [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4814.14s)]
*  He is showing up and saying exactly what you wish you could say [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4816.38s)]
*  But you can't because you have not been given a voice and you have not been given the right to do that [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4821.1s)]
*  The most obvious common sensical thing to help people who are suffering [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4825.74s)]
*  There you've got the mississippi governor [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4831.82s)]
*  tate reeves coming out on x saying hilarious elitism by margaret brennan and cbs news claiming that [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4834.62s)]
*  Mississippians know less about emergency management than dc [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4842.04s)]
*  bureaucrats all because her favorite democrats in california and north carolina have failed their constituents very interesting [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4847.08s)]

*  that these [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4861.0199999999995s)]
*  The locals down in places like mississippi could ever help themselves. That's how she sees them [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4862.94s)]
*  That's honestly, I guarantee you that's how she sees them and she thinks that's what makes her a good person [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4868.94s)]
*  She thinks like her inability to see them as capable [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4874.46s)]
*  Of managing money of managing an emergency is what makes her their benevolent [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4878.62s)]
*  Saint right she's going to pressure jd vance to keep the fema federal bureaucrats in charge of their wellness [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4884.3s)]
*  Because they're too dumb to do it themselves. It's like it's dripping out of her pores [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4891.0199999999995s)]

*  Six foreign languages, but the new york times dismissed her as a mannequin [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4961.66s)]
*  Anyway, they go out there and trump picks a fight with mayor karen bass, which was absolutely [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4965.5s)]
*  Beautiful this soundbite is a little long but watch it play out [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4972.5199999999995s)]

*  So just so people can get back on their properties and get what might still be there [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=4983.259999999999s)]

*  It doesn't cost a lot. You should let them do it because by the time you hire contractors, it's going to be [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5010.46s)]
*  Two years you can do some of it. But a lot of these people I know that guy right there that's talking [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5016.3s)]

*  It's the most [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5282.46s)]
*  Radical thing and it's so obvious and so simple, you know [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5283.74s)]
*  If that is all he accomplishes, of course, we know he's doing much much more than that [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5288.54s)]
*  But to just show up and say I am going to be the accountability here. This is utterly unacceptable [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5292.38s)]

*  Trump is governing like a man who has been shot indicted [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5338.38s)]
*  Investigated and impeached and has zero fucks left to give it's glorious. That's exactly right [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5342.599999999999s)]
*  He's just he's saying it all so then bacha he gets in into a back and forth with this [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5349.82s)]
*  Um california lawmaker named brad sherman a dem who'd been giving him a hard time because trump said you know what? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5356.54s)]
*  We want to give you federal relief [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5363.58s)]
*  But I want two conditions met before you get it and that is number one [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5365.58s)]
*  Allow the water to flow to southern california like i've been saying for years so we can be [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5369.34s)]
*  Ensured that this this isn't going to happen again and number two [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5374.2s)]
*  You should require voter id in this state where they seem to have an allergy to voter id [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5378.38s)]
*  So he's getting all this blowback like how can you condition, you know the the aid on voter id [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5383.179999999999s)]
*  It's not fair and brad gave him some guff about that earlier in the meeting and then this exchange happens where [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5387.9s)]
*  trump had thoughts for brad [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5394.7s)]

*  California that's why you have no insurance because you made it so impossible people that think like you made it so impossible [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5412.360000000001s)]
*  And and and brad me [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5419.820000000001s)]

*  Where almost nobody has insurance? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5428.38s)]
*  Here's a lamora in sought eight they continue [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5431.9800000000005s)]
*  There will be more fires until [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5435.02s)]
*  We include in any disaster relief [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5438.22s)]
*  Items which will prevent it or at least mitigate it from happening again. So you're going to see us proposing [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5441.42s)]
*  both of those like like [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5447.9s)]

*  Back to brad, but yeah [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5464.22s)]
*  It that's we keep hearing that the party of common sense and bacha [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5466.3s)]
*  Like it's for me that really resonates because that's kind of how I i've seen myself in media for a while like I don't i'm not [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5471.42s)]

*  Common-sensical that's what that makes me right like trump's leaning into this and he's a hundred percent right [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5486.2s)]
*  Which is why he's got majority support on the immigration policies on the trans policies [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5491.82s)]
*  Who the hell would disagree with we need water to fight fires? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5496.46s)]
*  Absolutely, you're totally right megan [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5501.48s)]
*  Um the common sense theme is such an important one here in terms of understanding where trump is coming from [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5503.9s)]
*  I will disagree with that tweet just a little bit. I don't think he's he's [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5510.139999999999s)]
*  Governing like he has no f's to give. I think he's governing like an assassin [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgZ3_RW7NM0&t=5513.96s)]
