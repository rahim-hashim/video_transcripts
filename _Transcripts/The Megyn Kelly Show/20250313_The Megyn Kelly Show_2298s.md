# Alternate Theories, Alarming Details - Part 4 of Megyn Kelly Investigates: Baby Lisa's Disappearance
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY)
*  I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to The Megyn Kelly Show and episode four of our special series, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=0.0s)]
*  Megyn Kelly Investigates. We're tackling the disappearance of Baby Lisa. She vanished from [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=5.04s)]
*  her crib in the middle of the night in October of 2011. Today she'd be a teenager, but where is she? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  And who took her? Someone knows. A case like this generates a ton of interest and theories, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  some as we will explore in this episode, very dark and disturbing. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=26.0s)]
*  So many people these days are focusing on getting healthy. And speaking of health, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=32.24s)]
*  let me tell you about Jacob and Kristen, the founders of We Heart Nutrition. They are raising [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=36.72s)]
*  five kids while running a company that's helping hardworking Americans live the American dream. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=41.92s)]
*  We Heart Nutrition makes high quality research-backed supplements for women and men [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=47.2s)]
*  at every stage of life, helping you stay strong, energized and hitting your wellness goals. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=52.48s)]
*  But this is not just another supplement company. They are proudly pro-life, donating 10% of every [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=57.36s)]
*  sale to pregnancy care centers, supporting moms and babies in need. They have over 1,000 five-star [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  reviews from real people seeing real results. Go to weheartnutrition.com and take their quick [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=68.56s)]
*  20-second quiz to get your personalized supplement subscription recommendation delivered right to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=74.64s)]
*  your door each month. And right now they're giving you 20% off your first order with the code [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=79.2s)]
*  MEGAN. Invest in your health and go to weheartnutrition.com. Use the code MEGAN to get [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  20% off. That's weheartnutrition.com code MEGAN. The Kansas City police have stiff-armed the press, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=88.64s)]
*  saying next to nothing about this case publicly. Neither Kansas City PD nor the FBI would talk to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=97.04s)]
*  and philanthropist Christy Haas-Schiller's offer of a $100,000 reward for any information that could [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=103.12s)]
*  lead to the return of Lisa remains unclaimed. If you could write that $100,000 check, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=109.68s)]
*  it'd probably be the most delightful money you ever spent in your life. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=116.64s)]
*  While 42-year-old John Tanko, known as Jersey, may seem to have been the best suspect given his [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  criminal history and that mysterious call from the Irwin's stolen phone to the phone of Tanko's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=128.56s)]
*  ex-girlfriend Megan Wright on the night baby Lisa went missing, no arrests were ever made. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=135.2s)]
*  In 2011, police said they'd moved on from Tanko, and there appears to have been little to no [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=141.52s)]
*  movement on this case in the nearly 13 years since it started. Jeremy and Deborah have been left [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=147.28s)]
*  in limbo. There were yearly vigils. Please, God, keep her safe until she is home with us. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=154.24s)]
*  And occasional interviews, including one with me that aired in January 2014. When I interviewed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=161.44s)]
*  you a couple years ago, Deborah, you said even back then you were looking in the crowd whenever [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=167.36s)]
*  you passed a child who would be Lisa's age. Yeah, we actually, I did it all day today when we were [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=171.44s)]
*  walking around before we came here to see you. And I just said to Jeremy, I'm really tired. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=176.88s)]
*  Of looking at everybody else's kid open, it's mine. This has to be its own form of torture. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=184.24s)]
*  Jeremy Irwin. I think about her every day. It doesn't go away and the pain is still there and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  just feel like you're not complete. Do you ever feel bitter, Jeremy? I would feel, I think I'd [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=200.96s)]
*  feel bitter that my child was taken, that I didn't get this time, that if she's still out there, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=207.36s)]
*  I've missed so much. Yeah, there's a lot of that. And I mean, it's pretty frustrating and [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=213.12s)]
*  you have a lot of hate and anger on aspects like that. But there's nothing you can do about it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=220.72s)]
*  And that's not going to help get Lisa home any faster. So I mean, it's frustrating that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  everybody's still out living their life and going to the grocery store and doing whatever [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=233.6s)]
*  they want to do. And meanwhile, we're just left to sit in the ashes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=238.4s)]
*  Deborah Bradley. You know, it's really hard as she gets older and still not having her home [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=244.4s)]
*  and thinking about all the things I continue to miss out on. And it's like, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=251.44s)]
*  all of us have been robbed of that. And that is really hard to accept. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=256.72s)]
*  I just started reading stuff and just writing down a name here and a name here. And then I [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=261.92s)]
*  started doing my own searches. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=269.28s)]
*  Deborah's aunt, Cindy Lorette, has been relentless, constantly searching for clues, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  trying to piece together what may have happened. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=276.08s)]
*  I've done my own thing because there isn't anybody to help. I have sat in courtrooms, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=278.56s)]
*  I have done my own surveillances. I visited people in jail that I didn't know. I don't really want [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  to tell you everything I did, but I did a lot of stuff. But everything that I was reading [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=289.92s)]
*  throughout the internet, it just kept leading me back to the area that I was living at. So I got [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  a job at this little convenience store and I didn't tell anybody who I was. I just listened. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=301.44000000000005s)]
*  I wanted to know things I wanted to and I did. I started to de-hunt myself. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=306.88s)]
*  I wanted to and I started to hear things. I mean, people talk. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=311.6s)]
*  Kansas City moms, Missy Rasmussen and Jackie Heller, who are writing a book about this case, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=315.92s)]
*  have spent more than a decade looking for leads. Where did that take you? What did you find? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  It led us down some bad places, some bad neighborhoods, talking to some bad people. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=325.92s)]
*  Was your theory starting to develop in a different direction from where the mainstream [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=334.0s)]
*  narrative was going, Missy? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=337.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, definitely the mainstream narrative here is either Jersey or the mom. It is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=339.52s)]
*  overwhelming how many people think that Deborah had something to do with it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=347.84s)]
*  Nobody in this town is looking for her because they think her mother killed her [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=353.2s)]
*  and she got away with it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=358.96s)]
*  Much of what they've heard is secondhand and goes to some very dark places, to drug dens, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=360.88s)]
*  to baby brokers, to terrible conclusions. My understanding is that you guys have spoken to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=367.12s)]
*  at least five people about this theory that some criminal element somehow connected to the family [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=374.64s)]
*  was responsible for this and that at least three of them mentioned the sale, the sale of a baby. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=380.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=387.52s)]
*  Correct. Right. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  In 2021, Deborah said much the same to a local reporter. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=389.36s)]
*  What are you sure of, Deborah? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=393.36s)]
*  If the tips are right and the information we were given is right, she was sold. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=395.76s)]
*  You believe she was sold? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=403.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=404.88s)]
*  To add to that theory, one month after Lisa went missing, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=406.0s)]
*  Deborah and Jeremy found a charge on a debit card, $69.04, paid to a British company that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  called itself a name-changing service. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  This is one of the theories that, of course, puzzles me. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=420.8s)]
*  How would the person wanting to steal baby Lisa think that they were going to get away [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=425.04s)]
*  with stealing baby Lisa on this night where the mother is at home? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  There is nothing about walking into someone's house and taking their baby that makes any sense [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  to me, but I don't know that the person doing that was a logical, rational person the way that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=443.36s)]
*  you and I are. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=454.24s)]
*  So if it has to do with drugs, in other words, they might've been out of their minds. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=455.04s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. I would guess for sure. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  If we think that there might've been a criminal drug element involved in this [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=463.6s)]
*  and you guys have been out there investigating this for all this time, pretty publicly, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=468.56s)]
*  is there any fear on your part about your safety? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=480.64s)]
*  Yes. We've had people tell us, we'll tell them, there's a $100,000 reward. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=481.67999999999995s)]
*  And they said, well, what good is the reward if I'm not alive to spend it? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=487.84s)]
*  Do you ever do your own investigation and start talking to people about [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=492.32s)]
*  what they know, what they saw? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=495.84s)]
*  Jeremy Irwin. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=497.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, we did for a long, long time. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=498.4s)]
*  And I mean, most of the stuff that we've gotten is stories that people have heard from other people. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=501.44s)]
*  So it's a lot of it's third person stories. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=508.88s)]
*  And I think there's real merit in a group of individuals that operate in that area that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=511.36s)]
*  get rid of kids and illegally adopt or whatever you want to phrase it, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=519.2s)]
*  but take in children that they're not supposed to have and redistribute them. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=524.48s)]
*  That's definitely going on up here. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=530.08s)]
*  And at least at the time when I was talking with the investigators about it, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=532.64s)]
*  they laughed in my face about it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=540.32s)]
*  So. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=542.0s)]
*  Other storylines that have circulated amongst the locals involve Debra interacting with the drug [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=542.5s)]
*  underworld, possible urban myths with no proof, including one that Baby Lisa was handed off [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=548.08s)]
*  to pay a drug debt. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=554.8s)]
*  Was there anything that you looking back may have done to bring any of that cast of characters into [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=556.4s)]
*  your life? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, certainly, certainly not us, but we had people nearby that were into that lifestyle. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=563.12s)]
*  And you and Debra never went there, scored drugs, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=571.52s)]
*  called for anything from anybody connected to that place? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=575.6s)]
*  Oh, no, no, never. Well, not 100%. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=579.04s)]
*  Did they ever accuse you or Jeremy of being on drugs or having a connection to this house? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=581.28s)]
*  Debra Bradley. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=588.24s)]
*  No, because we offered samples of our hair so they can test hair and find out anything [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=589.28s)]
*  and everything you've done. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=593.92s)]
*  Some drugs, including methamphetamine, can be detected this way. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  And so they were able to tell that I was telling the truth about that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=598.88s)]
*  As far as that, if there was a connection and that was it, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=602.8s)]
*  that's null and void. That's just not even an option. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=605.92s)]
*  So I ask you for the record, have you been on drugs? Were you on drugs around the time Lisa [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  went missing? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=614.88s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=615.92s)]
*  And how about Jeremy? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  It just wasn't your thing. You were not somebody who partook. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  No, I watched in high school, watched friends suffer from addiction and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=625.92s)]
*  I didn't want to be that way. I just seen so much suffering. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=633.68s)]
*  Aside from the fact that it's just not appealing to me. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=639.04s)]
*  And as a parent, that would be the last thing on my mind. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=642.16s)]
*  You don't do crystal meth and you didn't do crystal meth at the time she disappeared? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=646.16s)]
*  Oh, God, no. No. No. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=651.1199999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=653.76s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm sure you've heard that some people theorize you or Jeremy had a connection to [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  this drug den and brought this cast of nefarious characters into your life and one of them took [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=660.0s)]
*  her. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=666.4s)]
*  But those people should ask the cops about the DNA analysis on our hair and the drug [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=666.88s)]
*  test analysis on our hair. It's not there for a reason because it doesn't exist. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=673.4399999999999s)]
*  So at least I have proof of that. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=678.08s)]
*  Reporter Jim Spellman covered the case for weeks after the story broke. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=680.72s)]
*  I have seen not one bit of information to indicate that Deborah Bradley, Jeremy Erwin, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=684.56s)]
*  or anybody in their family was involved in some sort of drug thing. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=691.68s)]
*  And I'll tell you, Megan, I'm a drug addict in recovery. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=695.68s)]
*  I've been clean for 21 years now and I'm pretty good at figuring out drug addicts. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=698.56s)]
*  The idea that Deborah Bradley or Jeremy Erwin were some sort of drug addicts in deep to dealers [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=704.16s)]
*  or something like that is ridiculous. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=710.56s)]
*  I put, you know, as close to certainty that that is not the case as I can come, not, you know, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=713.04s)]
*  not blood testing people. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  And now you are going to hear the absolute worst, darkest versions. Again, these are most likely [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=720.88s)]
*  urban myths. We just don't know about what may have happened to Lisa. And we do need to warn you, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=729.12s)]
*  they come with awful, grisly details. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=736.0s)]
*  Author Jackie Heller. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=739.12s)]
*  And this is what really breaks my heart about this whole thing, is the one consistent narrative [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=740.4s)]
*  that we have found in this story is that Lisa is no longer with us. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=746.16s)]
*  What you're saying is you've talked to people who think they know what happened and who say [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=751.04s)]
*  the baby was killed. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=756.32s)]
*  Yes. We had someone tell us that Lisa is in the bottom of Smithville Lake and they put her body [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=758.08s)]
*  in a duffel bag and made sure that the blocks weighed more than she did. So there was no chance [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=766.32s)]
*  of her body coming up. Those are the kind of things that we've heard about this. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=771.84s)]
*  Cindy Lorette, Deborah's aunt, heard something even darker. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=777.04s)]
*  Somebody had Lisa and they got scared because the media, it became such a big deal. That person got [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=782.9599999999999s)]
*  scared and he chopped Lisa up. He took her to this house and one of the people that was in the house [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=791.04s)]
*  told me this story that she was brought to the house and they were at the edge, the end of the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  bed and she was crying and they said to get the fucking baby out of the house. I still don't know [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=804.96s)]
*  what to believe. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=816.96s)]
*  We managed to get our hands on police documents with equally dark testimonials. These are [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=818.64s)]
*  supplemental interview reports that police do not make public. They reflect interviews with two [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=824.0s)]
*  different men who claim to know something about the baby Lisa case. We have confirmed the case [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=830.24s)]
*  file numbers on these reports and we've spoken with both men, Chad Huber and the second man [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=835.76s)]
*  interviewed who asked us not to use his name. They confirmed their conversations with Kansas [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=843.12s)]
*  City police officer Michael Wells, the very same name that appears in these documents. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=848.4s)]
*  It appears that officer Wells was investigating a car theft ring, among other things. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=854.32s)]
*  We discussed these police interviews with co-authors Missy Rasmussen and Jackie Heller. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=859.92s)]
*  These are follow-up interviews with people who have been charged with unrelated petty crimes, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=865.28s)]
*  theft crimes and so on just a few months after baby Lisa disappeared. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=869.76s)]
*  And this is a police interview with someone named Chad Huber. Do you guys know that name? Have you [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=873.28s)]
*  heard of Chad Huber? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=877.28s)]
*  No. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=878.64s)]
*  Okay. So back in 2012, Chad Huber apparently had thoughts on baby Lisa and named three new people [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=879.8399999999999s)]
*  with a possible connection to this case. Three new names we have not discussed in this series. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=888.08s)]
*  Matt Shaver, Boris Dubinsky and Cody Allnut. Huber also mentions one that you'll be familiar [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=895.0400000000001s)]
*  with, Dane Greathouse. This is complicated and a lot to follow. Bear with me. According to the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=902.88s)]
*  interviews, Chad Huber, car thief suspect, tells cops that Cody Allnut, an 18-year-old who, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=909.36s)]
*  according to his father, was hanging out with a bad crowd, wanted to talk to Chad about baby Lisa. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=917.44s)]
*  Chad Huber tells police, presumably based on that conversation with Cody Allnut, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=924.8000000000001s)]
*  that baby Lisa is dead. And while the documents do not reveal anything about how, Chad Huber says [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=930.0s)]
*  several people are involved. Dane Greathouse, the same guy who allegedly had the phone, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=936.32s)]
*  called by the Irwin's stolen cell phone, the night Lisa went missing, was paid to move Lisa's [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=942.24s)]
*  deceased body, says Huber, from one grave site to another. Who? Who paid him? According to Huber, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=949.28s)]
*  it was convicted criminal Boris Dubinsky. Huber tells police, as reflected in these documents, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=958.96s)]
*  Dubinsky paid $15,000 for the transfer. Why would he do that? And where would this guy possibly get [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=965.52s)]
*  15 grand? What's more, according to a 2012 police interview, Huber tells cops that Matt Shaver, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=972.72s)]
*  the owner of that house in which Megan Wright was doing drugs on the night Lisa went missing, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=981.12s)]
*  had pictures, pictures the cops might want to see. First, can I just ask you for your reaction [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=986.0s)]
*  to that excerpt? Interesting. Very, very interesting. What is interesting about it to you? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=992.0s)]
*  The names, the Shaver name and Cody are names that we've heard. What is interesting to me is that it [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  parallels an experience that we had. We spoke with someone who, Cody had approached her, her story, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1004.8800000000001s)]
*  her words. Cody had approached her, seemingly really needing to get this off his chest. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1015.6s)]
*  And this name, Dane Greathouse, of course, is very relevant. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1023.84s)]
*  That's who we think that call was intended for. I think it was a signal. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1028.4s)]
*  That the baby had been taken? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1034.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1036.4s)]
*  And so if he really did move the body, and was paid $15,000 to move the body from the original [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1037.6s)]
*  burial site, I mean, there's a lot of buzz around Dane Greathouse and a few different [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1044.4s)]
*  lines into him. Again, we don't know if they're true. This is just as reflected in the police [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1049.52s)]
*  report. I had someone send me a text message once and it said, this is the person you need to talk [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1053.92s)]
*  to. This person has all your answers. And it was a photo of Dane Greathouse. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1062.16s)]
*  We've tried to talk to him. He is a trip, big time trip. He wanted like thousands of dollars [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1066.4s)]
*  for us to talk to him. I was like, yeah, we're not entertaining this. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  Dane Greathouse did speak with us, telling us he was questioned by police. He told us he knew [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1080.3200000000002s)]
*  who Boris Dubinsky was, but did not actually know the man. He also said he never moved anything, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1086.64s)]
*  nor was he paid anything. We found him living at home with his mother where he was participating [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1093.12s)]
*  in drug court, an alternative to jail that offers treatment and education. Dane followed up with a [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1098.2399999999998s)]
*  text that read in part, I'm glad you guys came over and talked. Honestly, I just hope this can [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1104.7199999999998s)]
*  bring light to the case and in time things get solved. Boris Dubinsky also told us he had nothing [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1110.56s)]
*  to do with Baby Lisa's disappearance. He said he was once in the same jail with Chad Huber, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1117.52s)]
*  that he knows what Huber said about him, but that none of it is true. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1123.52s)]
*  Matt Shaver told us there were indeed photos of the riverbank stored on his PlayStation memory [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1128.24s)]
*  card. He said police confiscated that card and when they did, they told him the photos had originated [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1134.24s)]
*  on Cody Allnut's phone. He says he has no idea if they were pictures of a gravesite. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1141.68s)]
*  As these pictures show, there was a search done along the banks of the Missouri River. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1148.3200000000002s)]
*  Nobody was found. What Cody Allnut saw or did not see, we may never know. We were not able to speak [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1153.44s)]
*  with him. We did speak with his father, Larry, who told us Cody has schizophrenia. Larry Allnut is [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1160.24s)]
*  his son's limited guardian and conservator. He told us the FBI interviewed Cody once around the [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1166.56s)]
*  time Lisa disappeared and never returned. As for Megan Wright, Megan, have you heard the name [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1172.8799999999999s)]
*  Cody Allnut or Boris Dubinsky? Have you heard those names? Those don't sound familiar to me. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1179.12s)]
*  But she does remember Matt Shaver, who gave her a place to stay all those years ago. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1186.0s)]
*  Matt was one of the people him and his wife owned the house I was referring to. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1191.12s)]
*  And what was he like? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  He was a carpet layer, best I remember. So he was always very active, hardworking kind of guy, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1199.04s)]
*  trying to support his family. When I moved in there, they were trying not to lose their house. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1205.76s)]
*  So I was trying to help them get things cleaned up, kind of get everything, move people out, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1212.3999999999999s)]

*  or come to a conclusion about this cast of characters? We don't know because they won't [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1237.0400000000002s)]

*  For sure. I think they realized how big it was and I think they screwed it up really badly. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1287.1200000000001s)]

*  About three months ago, a guy thought he saw Lisa in Las Vegas. He ended up getting the phone [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1317.6s)]
*  number to the police department. He called there and they said, OK, thanks. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1323.28s)]
*  And just hung up. They did not ask him any questions. He gave them the information. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1327.44s)]
*  They don't care. They're not looking for Lisa. They don't give a shit. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1332.56s)]
*  They think that she's dead somewhere. Mom did it. And they're going to. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1335.52s)]
*  Well, they're not even trying to prove that. I mean, they're just done. They're done with it. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1338.16s)]
*  Author Missy Rasmussen. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1342.32s)]
*  If it were me and someone told me that someone told them they saw, they know that a baby was [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1343.92s)]

*  But it is really difficult to get any closer than, say, two degrees. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1362.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, it should be easier for police. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1369.0400000000002s)]
*  Police have all sorts of investigatory abilities and powers that we don't have [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1371.44s)]
*  to figure out who was where, when, what the phone records of that person show and [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1375.92s)]
*  what their actions were. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1380.72s)]
*  It just lacks the right person to come in and be like, we're finally going to do what needs to be [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  done for Lisa. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1389.6s)]
*  Reporter Jim Spellman, who covered the case extensively, has a different view. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1390.8s)]
*  Every indication that I got is that the Kansas City police and the FBI were conducting a very [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1394.8799999999999s)]
*  vigorous and thorough investigation. Every time that I would uncover some new element or another [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1401.6s)]
*  reporter would uncover some new thing, the police had already been there generally a couple of [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1407.28s)]
*  weeks before. And we saw lots of evidence that they were thoroughly tracking down people's alibis, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1412.6399999999999s)]
*  that they were, you know, searching electronically, that they were searching surveillance cameras. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1419.68s)]
*  That would have been an asset for the family. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1426.8s)]
*  And the family ended up treating them like they were the enemy. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1428.72s)]
*  So to those who think, oh, the Kansas City police botched this, you know, they just, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1432.48s)]
*  they failed to investigate properly. We would have found her if we had a more robust police [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1436.88s)]
*  department on the case. You don't agree with that? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't agree with that. I think that they did a very thorough investigation. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1444.16s)]
*  All of the key people that surfaced in the media that surfaced through my reporting had been [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1448.4s)]
*  thoroughly investigated. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1455.44s)]
*  John Jersey-Tanko was questioned by the police at the time. He denies any involvement and the [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1457.2800000000002s)]
*  case remains open. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1462.96s)]
*  Did the FBI ever tell you, Megan, that you were cleared? I realize you only had that one [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1464.5600000000002s)]
*  six hour meeting. Did they ever? Or the Kansas City PD? Megan Wright? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1470.0s)]
*  They told me they'd be in touch if they needed anything else from me. And I haven't heard anything [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1475.1200000000001s)]
*  in 12 years. Never seen anything where they made a statement publicly bringing up my name saying, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1478.72s)]
*  oh, she was cooperative. She came in for an interview and we have ruled her out as a suspect. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1485.2s)]
*  You know, that'd be great to hear. But it's never happened. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1490.16s)]
*  As for Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, it's been dark narratives, 12 years of missing their [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1493.92s)]
*  baby girl and a struggle to stay together. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1499.3600000000001s)]
*  It's really hard to be there for someone else that you love when you're falling apart yourself. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1503.68s)]
*  And we tried to make it work for a really long time. And I think it just got to the point where [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1511.28s)]
*  unfortunately we fell into this statistic. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1519.92s)]
*  Their relationship came to an end in the summer of 2022 and Deborah moved out of their home on [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1525.76s)]
*  North Lister. I had hoped we would beat it, beat the odds, but it's OK because now we have the [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1531.6s)]
*  chance to get better on our own and be better for our family and ourselves. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1539.44s)]
*  You know, the main concern for me outside, second to Lisa, has always been the boys and [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1543.76s)]
*  making sure that they have some semblance of a normal life even with this going on. And I [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1554.16s)]
*  feel that we have at least succeeded in that. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1561.6s)]
*  And you still, notwithstanding the fact that you're separated from Deborah, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1564.64s)]
*  you still believe in her. It hasn't caused you to doubt her. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1568.56s)]
*  No, not at all. It doesn't change the fact. We're talking about my daughter here and we're talking [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1572.08s)]
*  about her mother. So it's the same thing I've been saying for years. If you're going to tell [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1578.8s)]
*  me that Deborah did it, you better tell me what it is and you better tell me a story associated [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1586.32s)]
*  with it. Other than that, I've heard it all and you can't tell me nothing new. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1592.32s)]
*  I think that God put us together because he knew we would be able to [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1597.5200000000002s)]
*  survive long enough to be there for each other in positive ways. And we may not be together now, but [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1603.7600000000002s)]
*  I still trust him and I will always love him because he has my kids. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1612.4s)]
*  You look at the joy that you get from raising two boys and having them go out into the world and [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1619.0400000000002s)]
*  they're awesome young men and they're going to kill it and they have their own life paths and [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1626.08s)]
*  everything's starting to work out for them. But as a man, I was robbed my portion of that with my [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1631.04s)]
*  daughter. I hope one day that tomorrow or a year from now or whatever, I hope that Lisa's found [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1638.8799999999999s)]
*  and that she comes home and we can start over and at 13 years old or 18 years old or however old [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1647.28s)]
*  she is. But it would be nice to start that relationship in which I haven't been able to [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1655.28s)]
*  have this whole time. What if all it takes is just the one person to watch what we're doing now [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1661.84s)]
*  and they're like, oh, this kid looks familiar. It could happen in so many ways. And we've also put [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1671.36s)]
*  our DNAwithancestory.com and 23andMe and I open up my email and I'll see you. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1678.24s)]

*  and we're going to find her. This is for Lisa. We need to find what happened to Lisa. Where the hell [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1704.0800000000002s)]

*  Angela Brown-Kelton Like, how do you make sense of why this happened? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1713.76s)]
*  Jeff Larson There's a lot of tough questions and the answer is free will and evil men will do evil [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1717.28s)]
*  things. Angela Brown-Kelton [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1726.0s)]

*  Lisa My best hope is that she's safe and she's with people that love her and care for her and [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1730.72s)]
*  feed her well and treat her well and she's able to go to the doctor and maybe she's able to go to [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1740.4s)]
*  school somewhere. Angela Brown-Kelton [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1747.2s)]
*  And she just has no idea that she's actually someone else's child. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1748.64s)]
*  Lisa That's what I'm hoping that she's totally ignorant to it and living a completely normal [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1752.32s)]
*  life. That's what I really hope for. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1757.04s)]
*  Angela Brown-Kelton Do you ever wonder whether it would be easier if you knew, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1759.12s)]

*  you know, that you had a confirmation that she had passed, would that somehow be easier? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1769.52s)]
*  Jeff Larson Well, I think if that's my two options, if I were to know that something bad happened or [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1774.3999999999999s)]

*  between the two of them. I mean, it's a nightmare. And statistically, they should have been divorced [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  within months. But their faith in Lisa and themselves kept them together for years. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1814.1599999999999s)]

*  Bill Stanton That this woman has evolved as a person, how she remains resolute. And I wanted [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1839.0400000000002s)]
*  her to be guilty more than anyone because statistically she was. I wanted to wrap it up [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1846.64s)]
*  and get the heck home. You know, they had no reason to accept me in their home. I told them [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1851.28s)]
*  as soon as I got there, I'm not here for you. Meaning that if it's you, I'm coming for you. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1857.44s)]
*  And I said that to them and they looked me square in the eye, helped find our baby. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1863.36s)]
*  Angela Brown-Kelton What did you make of the fact that in my interview with Deborah, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1869.04s)]
*  she was saying, this did jump out at me, she was saying things like there's an example of a mother [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1873.84s)]
*  who found her daughter after 16 years. There's an example of a father who found his kid after X [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1878.4799999999998s)]
*  years. I went to 23andMe and I gave my DNA. I went to ancestry.com and I gave my DNA there just in [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1883.52s)]
*  case she finds it. I realized even somebody who had done something would be smart enough to say [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1888.88s)]
*  present tense, present tense, present tense. So I that's okay. I'll check that to the side. But [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1894.64s)]
*  doing things like that, I believe her that she did searches for a child who came back. Why would you [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1899.5200000000002s)]
*  do that if you knew your child was no longer alive? Bill Stanton No, that's what gets her through the [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1905.3600000000001s)]
*  day. Angela Brown-Kelton What did you make of that stuff, Phil? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1909.44s)]
*  Phil Stanton I believe that she has. But it's also her undoing, I believe. I spoke to her about a [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1911.2800000000002s)]
*  year and a half ago. And when I hung up, I thought, my goodness, the frustration that she's feeling [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1917.84s)]
*  is going to eat her alive. And, you know, I don't want to trivialize it in this comparison. But, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1926.72s)]
*  you know, think for a moment, you're at your house and you're all of a sudden you're looking [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1934.0s)]
*  for your car keys and you can't find them. And how quickly you become frustrated. And you look and [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1937.76s)]
*  you start, you know, you know, hollering at people and, you know, help me find my keys and, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1943.6s)]
*  you know, whatever. Think if that frustration went on for 12 years, how would you how would you, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1948.3999999999999s)]
*  you know, how big would that build that you're looking for this thing that you can't find? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1956.0s)]
*  Angela Brown-Kelton That leads me back to these police reports that you guys have seen, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1961.1999999999998s)]
*  these interview reports that we managed to get our hands on. And they talk about how these alleged [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1965.28s)]
*  petty criminals around this case, allegedly, again, this very much could be crooks trying [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1970.96s)]
*  to lower their sentences and give police fake little gold nuggets. But they talk about having [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1979.52s)]
*  seen pictures of a grave site, pictures of a mound of dirt. Somebody allegedly brought [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1985.3600000000001s)]
*  the baby in a black garbage bag and buried it. Like, there's some of that out there. I mean, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1991.1200000000001s)]
*  it's possible that she did the same thing, that that's that's all made up, but that she did [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=1998.08s)]
*  actually bring the baby out there and that the baby was buried. And this same Keystone cop force [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2002.48s)]
*  just didn't find it. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2007.6s)]
*  Richard O'Connor See, the first thing that comes to my mind, Megan, is that if I've committed a [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2008.56s)]
*  crime as heinous as this this particular crime, I find it hard to believe I'd be running around [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2014.96s)]
*  telling people that we've done this and so forth. And while one person might do it, I think if it [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2022.08s)]
*  were a group effort, that one person would be in hot water pretty quickly with the rest of the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2032.0s)]
*  team, so to speak. Even if they were under the influence of drugs the next morning, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2038.56s)]
*  they would probably be saying to themselves, we need to put a lid on this. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2044.08s)]
*  The greatest thing I think Deborah's got in her favor, you tell me if I'm wrong, Bill, is Phil Houston. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2048.56s)]
*  Bill Houston And for that, nothing to add. Absolutely. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2054.0s)]
*  Meg Whalen Right. I just can't get past the fact that the human lie detector, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2060.0800000000004s)]
*  CIA, 25 years, breaking terrorists, breaking double agents, seeing the deception where [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2064.32s)]
*  no one else could, that that guy got fooled by Deborah Bradley. I don't believe it. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2070.96s)]
*  Bill Houston Thank you for the kind words, Megan. Believe me, like you, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2075.44s)]
*  that either this case has haunted me and I pray often that I'm right and that she's right, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW8-Frrh1eY&t=2079.04s)]
