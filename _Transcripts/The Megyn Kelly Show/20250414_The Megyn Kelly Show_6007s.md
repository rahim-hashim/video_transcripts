Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Walter Kirn and Matt Taibbi, hosts of "America This Week," to discuss Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry, and Gayle King going to space for a few minutes, why it was framed as some big step for feminism, Sanchez' relationship with Jeff Bezos and her bizarre interview when she came back, the ridiculous over-the-top Blue Origin announcers, pretending they actually did "training" for this space visit for two days, the horrifying terror and arson at the Pennsylvania’s Governor’s mansion, how his family was sleeping inside but escaped, details about the suspect and his extremism, Taylor Lorenz giggling about Luigi Mangione in a shocking CNN segment, her disgusting praise of him and those who support him, Bill Maher revealing what happened at his dinner with Trump at the White House, how he surprisingly described him as gracious and a good listener, what this could mean for his future coverage of Trump and viewership, Taibbi suing a Democratic Congresswoman who smeared him in Congress and also on X, the attacks he's faced over the years from the government, and more.

# Inside Maher's White House Visit, CNN's Luigi Celebration, and Sanchez in Space, w/ Kirn and Taibbi
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show and happy Monday and happy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=0.0s)]
*  birthday, Yardley. My daughter turns 14 today. All you moms and dads out there know, it seems like [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  yesterday. It's so crazy how in a blink of an eye, 14 years go by and soon it'll be 18 and then they [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=12.0s)]
*  tell me she might leave me, though I'm in denial about that fact for my daughter and my two sons. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=19.68s)]
*  Anyway, happy birthday, sweetheart. It was a very busy weekend. President Donald Trump was getting [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=24.959999999999997s)]
*  standing ovations at the UFC event on Saturday mingling with Shaq. That was quite a sight. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=30.4s)]
*  Joe Rogan and more. Bernie Sanders and AOC, they were back out on their fighting the oligarchy tour. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=36.96s)]
*  You know, the one that she's been flying first class to and from. You know, oligarchy for me, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=43.76s)]
*  but not for thee is really what she's saying. And then this morning, a bunch of ladies celebrated [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=50.32s)]
*  female empowerment by putting on sexy fake astronaut suits and going up into sort of outer [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=56.72s)]
*  space for 11 minutes through all the engineering and mathematical wizardry and physics wizardry [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=63.2s)]
*  of a bunch of people who didn't get any credit and were behind some control room panel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=68.64s)]
*  I guess we're supposed to believe that like Gail King is an astronaut now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=73.92s)]
*  We're supposed to be celebrating them. Somehow it's supposed to be empowering because not enough [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=77.36s)]
*  women have gone up into space. What we mean is not enough are astronauts. Not enough women are [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  astronauts. That's what we mean. We don't mean please put Gail King in yet another opportunity [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=88.0s)]
*  for her to try to act like a star while she's next to Oprah, who also was there. Of course, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=95.76s)]
*  she didn't get to go up, but she stood there on the sidelines. I don't feel empowered. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=102.48s)]
*  This is like another, it's female White House press corps day at the White House. Remember I [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  told you this during Obama, they were like, it's female empowerment day or whatever. And they [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=114.48s)]
*  invited a bunch of women, including yours truly, some people from Fox to go over there and interview [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=119.28s)]
*  the president. And I was like, no, it's a no. I'll go over when I'm getting asked there because I'm [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  worthy as a journalist period, not journalist with a vagina. Okay. I don't really want to be [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=129.6s)]
*  celebrated for that at all by anyone who doesn't know me. And I just feel uncomfortable about this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=136.16s)]
*  Like why, if they had been six astronauts going up there, then yes, okay. What did they do? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  The one gal is engaged to a billionaire and these are a bunch of celebrities she wanted to befriend. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=150.48s)]
*  Okay. Of course, Lauren Chans has whatever her name had to show off her tits. Okay. It's a little [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=156.4s)]
*  early in the hour to be dropping the T word, her breasts in her little fake astronaut outfit, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=164.08s)]
*  because you know, what's a day if we don't get to see the girls on Lauren Sanchez, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=169.6s)]
*  it's not as offensive as showing them at the presidential inauguration, but I think it's a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=174.16s)]
*  little off message. Isn't it a little off message? We're going to get into all the big stories today. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=178.24s)]
*  Joining me now for the full show, Matt Taibbi, editor of Racket News on Substack and Walter [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  Kern. He's editor at large for County Highway, which I like County Highway. Together, they host [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=188.32s)]
*  the America This Week podcast. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=194.8s)]
*  Insta, Facebook and X. Aren't you tired of the corporate media prioritizing certain narratives [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=202.56s)]
*  over the facts? I was too and too. And that's why we started this show, to have real conversations [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=208.0s)]
*  full of tough questions to get to the truth. And it's why I want to tell you about ground news, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=213.76s)]
*  an independent app and website, not at the mercy of corporate control. They prioritize transparency [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  so you can compare coverage on any issue and think for yourself instead of letting someone else do [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=223.92s)]
*  the thinking for you. They even show important stories that the other side is ignoring. Go to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=228.39999999999998s)]
*  groundnews.com slash Megan and see it in action. With so many outlets suppressing conservative [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=233.44s)]
*  views and ignoring facts, ground news is more important than ever. Track all your most trusted [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=238.88s)]
*  independent sources there so you never miss out on the story shaping our world. Right now, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  you can get 40% off their vantage plan, knocking the price down to just five bucks a month. Go to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=248.56s)]
*  groundnews.com slash Megan. That's G-R-O-U-N-D news.com slash Megan to invest in your ability [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  to think critically about the news. Guys, welcome back to the show. Thanks for having us on. Great [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=260.08s)]
*  to be here. I mean, nothing says female empowerment like getting this opportunity to go to outer [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=268.0s)]
*  space and making sure everyone can see your breasts. I think it's important as they beam this woman into [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=272.64s)]
*  outer space that we answer the question, but what do her breasts look like? Am I wrong? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=280.24s)]
*  Lifted. I hear there's no gravity in space. Space is the cosmic bra [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=287.92s)]
*  that Katy Perry needs to be further empowered. Bothers me. She's already got about a billion [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=294.48s)]
*  dollars and short of Taylor Swift is the most famous pop star and female pop star in the world. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  She needs empowerment says something sad about women because it means that even with a billion [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=308.88s)]
*  dollars, they still need a boost from the space program or Jeff Bezos' private space program. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  They were all oligarchs. Let's remember they were oligarchs in space. They're trying to have their [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=320.72s)]
*  cake and eat it too on the left, I guess. That's exactly right. Katy Perry was quoted as saying, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=327.68s)]
*  we're putting the ass in astronauts. Okay. All right. You go, girl. This is so... [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=334.16s)]
*  This is why she needs empowering because she keeps revealing her stupidity like that and we have to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=342.48s)]
*  boost her back up. It's so cringy. I'm sorry, but I'm like, why are you... Don't show your boobs. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=347.04s)]
*  Don't talk about your ass. Don't get your specially made spacesuits so that we can make sure to see [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=354.16s)]
*  all your curves as you go to outer space. Is that what it is to be a woman? Just show off as much [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=360.24s)]
*  sex appeal, ass and boob as you can. Matt, I'm not sure I didn't catch that page in the female handbook. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=366.0s)]
*  I'm a little bit confused about the political meaning of toplessness now. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=377.04s)]
*  We saw there was that demonstration in Paris where all of the demonstrators were topless. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=383.92s)]
*  I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to look, not look, look furtively. Also, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  what exactly the meaning of that was supposed to be? Was it supposed to be erotic, deeroticizing? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=401.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very strange message now. I think it's supposed to be something about [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  empowerment, but it comes across as mostly confusing to me. I don't know. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=413.76000000000005s)]
*  They dropped the movie Hidden Figures years ago, right? That's a great movie about [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=421.52000000000004s)]
*  women who are behind the scenes. I don't know how true it is, but it's a great movie. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=427.12s)]
*  It's women who are behind the scenes at NASA and contributed to the space program. Okay, that I get. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=431.04s)]
*  What did these women do? Honestly, one is sleeping with a billionaire who created this program [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=435.68s)]
*  and is jetting people into outer space for like 10 minutes, as long as your average YouTube video [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=442.88s)]
*  takes. They came back and they're like, everything's changed. Is it? I don't. Okay. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=451.04s)]
*  They had nothing to do with any of the engineering. Basically, they're just looking for famous faces [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=457.68s)]
*  who could draw attention to Jeff Bezos' weird little rocket. His first little rocket looks [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=462.72s)]
*  exactly like a penis. Exactly. The guy's working something out. I think he's working out his sexual [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=468.32000000000005s)]
*  fantasies on us. This one looks exactly like a breast with a nipple on the top. Look at this one. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry, gentlemen. You know exactly what that looks like. Everyone does. Now look at this one. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=479.04s)]
*  I guess you could say igloo if you wanted to be charitable. To me, it looks like a breast. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=485.92s)]
*  From above, it really looks like a breast with a nipple. Walter. It's a little glands-like. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=489.59999999999997s)]
*  It's a glands-like. I was in terror that we were going to have another space shuttle disaster and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=496.23999999999995s)]
*  that we were going to have to mourn these people for maybe the next 700 years. They did add to the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=501.84s)]
*  space program something that it hasn't had, which is the red carpet and the sort of fashion critique [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=509.12s)]
*  at the beginning. It was a combination of the MTV Music Awards, the Oscars, and the Apollo program. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=515.92s)]
*  I thought it was condescending. I think that's what you're getting at. It was [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=523.76s)]
*  belittling to women. They belittled women with their behavior and their, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=528.8s)]
*  I don't know, antics, I would call them. I was under the impression that most [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=534.4799999999999s)]
*  astronauts were basically mostly women or at least half women now. I didn't... [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=541.04s)]
*  They probably are. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=548.16s)]
*  Yeah. Was that part of their critique that there aren't enough? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=550.56s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=556.0s)]
*  Really? Because it seems like there are quite a lot of female astronauts. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=557.52s)]
*  I know. Lauren Sanchez is saying, I don't know, they're crossing some new frontier for women. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=561.28s)]
*  Here she was in her post-flight interview. Let's hear how she enjoyed it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=567.4399999999999s)]
*  Earth looked so... It was so quiet. It was just quiet. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=573.68s)]
*  Is it what you expected? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=579.76s)]
*  No. No. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=582.88s)]
*  Better? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't think you can describe it because, you know what I was saying? It was like quiet, but then [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=587.52s)]
*  also really alive. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=594.88s)]
*  That's because you're inside a space capsule. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=596.0s)]
*  And you look at it and you're like, we're all in this together. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=597.5999999999999s)]
*  Seeing Jeff before I left, I just went... [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=601.68s)]
*  I had to come back. I mean, we're getting married. If I didn't come back, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=606.8s)]
*  that would be a bummer for me. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=612.4s)]
*  Only you, by the way, would say this to me. You said, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=613.76s)]
*  Jeff, if you don't want to marry me, you don't have to send me to space. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=616.88s)]
*  Don't have to send me to space. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=619.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. We're watching this woman. She was a news anchor like 10 years ago, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=624.64s)]
*  and she married the head of CAA. And then she reportedly cheated on him with Jeff Bezos [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=629.28s)]
*  and moved on to Jeff Bezos. And now we're supposed to celebrate her crossing new barriers for women, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=634.24s)]
*  meaning boinking a billionaire and getting a free ticket to space for 11 minutes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=641.8399999999999s)]
*  It was flat, but quiet. These profundities, Walter. Hold the buckle up. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=646.64s)]
*  But, you know, I actually met a female astronaut once who was on the space shuttle and had quite [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=652.48s)]
*  an interesting conversation with her. And real astronauts are extremely intelligent scientists [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=658.0s)]
*  who've been tested to the limits of their physical and mental fitness. But this was really not women [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=662.88s)]
*  in space. It was stupid people in space. This was the lowest IQ space crew that has ever been [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=668.4s)]
*  launched from Earth. And she didn't even have the wit to have some writer give her lines for when [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  she got back. She tried to make them up. It was so quiet. Yeah. You were in a soundproof space capsule [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=682.16s)]
*  lady. It was a little far out space nuts a little bit. Oh, wait, wait. On that front, can you just [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=687.68s)]
*  watch here? Here are the women dramatically exiting the nipple shaped space capsule. Watch. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=696.8s)]
*  There's the billionaire. See, honey. See what I got you for Christmas. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=704.88s)]
*  Where are my babies? My babies. Like she was almost dead. Here's Katy Perry. Kisses the ground. Right. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=722.72s)]
*  You were in such danger. Gail King, thanking God. And by that, I mean Oprah. Without him, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=730.16s)]
*  she'd have no career. She too. Okay. Kisses the ground. Somebody already, you should be kissing [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=737.6s)]
*  Oprah. Oprah's there. Kiss Oprah. She's worth far more to you than the ground. Thank you, Jesus. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=743.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, truly, it's like they're right back from Nam. What did they do? They got in their special [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=750.24s)]
*  Oscar de la Renta designed suits, laid down in a capsule and came back in 10 minutes, you guys. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=755.84s)]
*  That was one small step for womankind. One giant leap backwards for mankind as far as I can see. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=765.44s)]
*  Or one giant step forward for reality shows. Yeah, that's true. It was a reality show. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=773.52s)]
*  It could be a great concept. Like, you know, dumb celebrities in space. I would watch that. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=780.0s)]
*  Wasn't there at least a little part of you that was hoping they'd get untethered? You know, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=786.08s)]
*  just like, I didn't want them to like die, but maybe just be out there for a while so we could [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=790.72s)]
*  have a break from all this nonsense, especially from Lauren Sanchez. It's like, why are we [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=794.48s)]
*  pretending she's done anything? She is with Jeff Bezos. That's literally why we know her name. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=799.76s)]
*  And again, it was all over the tabloids. They got together through an extra mer- all right, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=807.0400000000001s)]
*  fine, people fall out of love. But like, why are we celebrating this? Like, oh, the love affair. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=811.68s)]
*  They're going to have this bazillion dollar wedding ceremony. And you can tell exactly who [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  they're trying to like cozy up to. They were either on the nipple shaped space capsule, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=822.0s)]
*  or they run cover for them in the press. But it's because we have this obsession with money, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  right? With like, what looks like achievement. And Jeff Bezos is obviously very, very accomplished. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=833.76s)]
*  But to me, it's like, I don't know, Matt, you and I have talked about this before. Like as a [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=840.4s)]
*  journalist, the more people fawn over somebody like Bezos and this, the more I want to run the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  other direction, right? It's like my reportorial instincts are, ew, they're forming clubs again, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=852.24s)]
*  and I don't want to be a member of any of them. Yeah, the more supplicating that goes on, the more [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=858.8s)]
*  uncomfortable you usually get. And there was a lot of that in this one. I guess they did prove [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=864.56s)]
*  that Botox survives reentry into the atmosphere, though. Oh, I thought you said rear entry, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=871.8399999999999s)]
*  which has already been proven. They are astronauts. It's only 13 minutes after. What's happening? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  Walter, you've lost control of this show. Yeah, I have. Why don't they send somebody into space [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=883.52s)]
*  who can actually come back and describe it well? You know, not just a journalist, but a poet or [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=890.0s)]
*  something. I mean, they went to space and we have no idea what it was like, except that it was very [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=895.76s)]
*  quiet. It's quiet. Flat. It was like big and stuff. Maybe Katie will write a song about it, you know. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=901.36s)]
*  But yeah, that was a nullity. That was a publicity stunt that probably cost more money than any in [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=912.0s)]
*  history. The Elon envy from Jeff Bezos is just absolutely conspicuous. Elon will get supermodels [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=918.88s)]
*  and a poet or something interesting for a crew. This was terrible. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=929.6s)]
*  Here is, my team just sent me the side by side. 2021 Blue Origin versus Now, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=935.12s)]
*  which I think was the first flight. There's Bezos and the cowboy hat and three others. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=942.56s)]
*  And now here's the ladies of the new Blue Origin on the right with their sexy, like it looks like [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=948.72s)]
*  something that, remember that original Jennifer Garner movie that made her a star where she was [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=955.36s)]
*  like the spy climbing over the beams of light. And so it looks like something our spies might [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=961.04s)]
*  need to wear. And really it's just, Lauren Sanchez gave this long interview about why they wore this [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=966.8s)]
*  tight outfit over here on the right. Here it is. It's sought 31. Watch this. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=974.0s)]
*  Where's Carrie Anne? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=979.92s)]
*  This is from her Instagram. She's bowing. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=987.52s)]
*  They're comfortable. Again, she went to Oscar De Laurentiis people and she rejected, just so you [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=996.0s)]
*  know, I know, Matt, you were wondering, she rejected pockets on the hips because they didn't [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1001.6s)]
*  want to look too hippie. And then they had zippers put on the bottom of the pants so that she could [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1006.08s)]
*  go flare or not, depending on each woman's preference. And for all that, what did we get? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1012.96s)]
*  It was like quiet, but also alive. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I don't think you can describe [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1023.0400000000001s)]
*  it because like, you know what I'm saying? Like quiet, but then also really like alive. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1031.2s)]
*  And then the takeaway, we're all in this together. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1038.0800000000002s)]
*  No, we aren't. I didn't get to go. You didn't get to go. Matt didn't get to go. 99 and 99% of the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1043.76s)]
*  people who ever lived didn't get to go. They chose these airheads. Bring it. Send a kid into space, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1051.52s)]
*  like an eight-year-old kid who will actually be thrilled and impressed and come back and tell us [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1057.28s)]
*  something. This girl, this Sanchez is so spoiled that even going into space didn't impress her. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1061.6s)]
*  Oh God. Very little will. When you're married to Jeff Bezos and you could literally afford to buy [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1069.68s)]
*  it and sell everyone in America's family. But we're supposed to celebrate her. That's what [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1075.04s)]
*  we're supposed to do. We're supposed to celebrate her because accomplishment, she bagged the billionaire [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1079.36s)]
*  after banging the billionaire after allegedly cheating, at least according to what I read in [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1084.32s)]
*  the national inquirer. But there was a whole lawsuit about it where she accused, they said [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1089.76s)]
*  maybe her brother had sold pictures of text messages between the two of them. Then he claimed [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1093.4399999999998s)]
*  he'd been like falsely attacked by, I can't remember who he blamed it on a foreign government. Anyway, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1097.6799999999998s)]
*  it was a big scandal. Enough of them. Now in other news about deplorable people, some absolute lunatic [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1103.28s)]
*  fire bombed the Pennsylvania governor's mansion where Josh Shapiro and his wife and their children [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1112.48s)]
*  were sleeping. This guy goes in there at two in the morning. I have to say it wasn't exactly [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1121.44s)]
*  like a Jack Bauer entry. It seems like no one really tried to stop him. I don't know what the [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1128.16s)]
*  story is on the governor's security, but I'm underwhelmed that he managed to break the window, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1134.08s)]
*  get into the governor's mansion and start dropping Molotov cocktails. And then apparently it took [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1140.16s)]
*  them a while to actually track him down. That's a separate matter. Look at the devastation [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1145.28s)]
*  inside the mansion. You could hear governor Shapiro came out after the fact and you could [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1150.88s)]
*  tell he was somewhat rattled. Here he is, 21. Last night, we experienced an attack, not just on our [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  family, but on the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania here at the governor's residence. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1165.2s)]
*  I spoke a couple hours ago with director Cash Patel of the FBI. He promised all of the resources [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1171.76s)]
*  of the federal government. He was extremely kind and courteous and thoughtful in his conversation [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1178.64s)]
*  with me. And I thanked him and the women and men of the FBI and the president of the United States [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1185.76s)]
*  for their support. Lori and I are [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1192.24s)]
*  Lori and I are overwhelmed by the prayers [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1205.68s)]
*  and the messages of support that we've received from all across Pennsylvania and all across the [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1213.6s)]
*  United States. Wow. I feel for him. He's got four young kids. I mean, they came pretty close to [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1219.68s)]
*  being killed this evening. And it was by some 38 year old guy, reportedly Cody Bomber is his name. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1229.28s)]
*  He's now charged with attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson. Look at this. This is reminding [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1239.04s)]
*  me of like the Notre Dame Cathedral shots we saw after it burned. Aggravated arson. He may also face [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1245.12s)]
*  federal charges still. This man, Bomber, is a father of at least five, four sons and a daughter, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1252.08s)]
*  according to a 2020 Facebook post. Unconfirmed information on Bomber. Someone found an old [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1259.6s)]
*  Facebook post from him, purportedly from him. These things come out in the days after, and then [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1265.84s)]
*  they sometimes turn out not to be true as an asterisk here. But his Facebook post, we believe, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1270.72s)]
*  says he's a registered socialist. Voting record shows nonpartisan, unaffiliated voter. Social media [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1276.88s)]
*  posts show he supported Black Lives Matter, universal health care as a right, criticized [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1282.8s)]
*  MAGA supporters, Christians, and the Second Amendment. Was also anti-Biden. Had a post that [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1287.44s)]
*  read, knowing as half the battle, the other half is extreme violence. Shared posts supporting [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1294.0s)]
*  mask mandates during COVID, rants, slamming toxic femininity, complained about gas prices, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1299.04s)]
*  supported Kanye West's presidential run, et cetera. I mean, it sounds like this guy started [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1304.72s)]
*  deteriorating. And then the New York Post reports that his Harrisburg, Pennsylvania property was [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1311.68s)]
*  subject to a foreclosure, and he was facing that the sale was about to go ahead and had obvious, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1317.6s)]
*  serious resentments for Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, and his wife, Lori, and their four [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1324.16s)]
*  children, two dogs, and another family who lived there. No injuries. I should have mentioned that [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1328.8000000000002s)]
*  up higher. One last thing. He acted quickly. He got into the home. He was there for less than a [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1332.48s)]
*  minute. And the break-in and setting of the fire happened while the troopers were looking for him. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1340.0800000000002s)]
*  The officials believe he did have a plan, noting how quickly he was in and out of the residence [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1346.72s)]
*  and calling him methodical. In his approach, he exited the property the same way he entered it [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1349.76s)]
*  over the fence. So what do we make of this? Is this a political story? Is this a random [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1355.12s)]
*  nutcase story? What is this story, guys? Walter? Well, Democrats are going to have to be careful [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1361.12s)]
*  because I don't know how they distinguish between different sorts of violence and political violence [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1373.04s)]
*  anymore. If he'd been in a Tesla or had just gotten out of one, it would have been thought [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1379.52s)]
*  to be maybe commendable that someone had firebombed it. If he were Luigi and he were good looking and [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1385.2s)]
*  had actually succeeded in killing someone, he might have been celebrated by Taylor Lorenz and [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1392.56s)]
*  people like that. As it is, he's not a very attractive or a very sane human being, and he [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1399.52s)]
*  nearly killed children. There's nothing to do with him but throw away the key. But we're starting [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1405.76s)]
*  to get into a world of blurred lines around violence. As much as I am horrified by this, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1412.96s)]
*  and I really do feel bad for those kids, they're going to be genuinely traumatized and scared, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1423.52s)]
*  especially because their father has ambitions in politics. But let's lay off the violence [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1428.96s)]
*  across the board or at least lay off the fandom around certain kinds of it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1435.44s)]
*  The Free Beacons, Peter Hassan tweeted out, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1445.28s)]
*  this is exactly why it's so dangerous to lionize Luigi Mangione. If it's okay to hit anybody in [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1448.0s)]
*  power you consider evil, then any politician is fair game. It's an interesting point now, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1453.6s)]
*  because it's not every day you see a governor's mansion firebombed, Matt. This is a striking [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1460.08s)]
*  development in the land of political attacks, and I use that term generically for a reason. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1467.52s)]
*  I don't know whether this guy's in that case. He sounds extreme in his political rhetoric, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1473.6799999999998s)]
*  but I'm not seeing stuff about being abducted by space aliens in his social media that we've [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1478.48s)]
*  unearthed so far. He sounds like somebody was pissed off about his foreclosure. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1484.8s)]
*  I can't help watching this thinking we'd be hearing very different messaging [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1489.92s)]
*  from the Democrat side if this had been Ron DeSantis. I really think we would. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1493.84s)]
*  There'd be an attempt to understand how Ron DeSantis brought this on himself. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1498.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's going to be critical to determine what exactly the motive was here. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1504.16s)]
*  Very often in these cases when people do extremely destructive things, including things like [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1513.44s)]
*  school shootings, a significant percentage of those folks are sociopathic, predisposed to [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1518.64s)]
*  violence of some kind or another, and people attribute motives to them that they assume [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1529.0400000000002s)]
*  because of the way they dress or because of the music they listen to or that sort of thing. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1535.1200000000001s)]
*  In this case, all we have are some superficial indicia. We see a person who is associated with [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1541.0400000000002s)]
*  a lot of traditionally left-leaning causes targeting a Democratic governor who maybe stands out on [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1549.52s)]
*  one or two particular issues as being something that traditional [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1557.84s)]
*  liberals or socialists might not be happy about. But we can't assume that that's the reason. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1566.56s)]
*  Frankly, on the foreclosure front, as somebody who's covered foreclosure courts, I'm a little [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1573.04s)]
*  surprised there hasn't been more violence of this kind dating back to the mid-2000s because I've seen [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1578.9599999999998s)]
*  how enraged people are by being thrown out of their homes. A significant [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1586.64s)]
*  percentage of those people are tossed out kind of unfairly. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1594.08s)]
*  We don't know, but I think Walter's right to talk about the lionization of Luigi and how [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1599.68s)]
*  we're in this space now where a big segment of the media is kind of intellectualizing violence [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1607.76s)]
*  as a logical response to things. That is very scary. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1613.6s)]
*  It's the new version of intellectualizing, looting, and rioting as one of the available options to you [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1619.12s)]
*  when you have some sort of societal upset. You mentioned Walter Taylor Lorenz for a reason. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1626.6399999999999s)]
*  Former New York Times, former Washington Post columnist who is now trying to make it in the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1631.84s)]
*  independent lane, and she sat down with CNN's Donnie, is it Donnie O'Sullivan? I actually don't [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1636.96s)]
*  know this guy, who's got some show about misinformation and had the most remarkable exchange [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1644.96s)]
*  regarding Luigi Mangione, the man who stands accused of gunning down in cold blood the CEO [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1652.88s)]
*  of UnitedHealthcare a couple of months ago. Here it is. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1660.4s)]
*  Hilarious to see these millionaire media pundits on TV clutching their pearls about someone [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1663.8400000000001s)]
*  standing a murderer when this is this is the United States of America. As if we don't lionize [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1670.24s)]
*  criminals, as if we don't have, you know, we don't stan murderers of all sorts and we give them Netflix [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1675.44s)]
*  shows. There's a huge disconnect between the narratives and angles the sort of mainstream [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1682.0s)]
*  media pushes and what the American public feels and you see that in moments like this. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1687.3600000000001s)]
*  The women who batter outside court in New York. So you're going to see women especially that feel [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1692.0s)]
*  like oh my god right like here's this man who who's revolutionary, who's famous, who's handsome, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1697.76s)]
*  who's young, who's smart. He's a person that seems like this morally good man which is hard to find. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1704.72s)]
*  Yeah I just realized women will literally date an assassin before they swipe right on me. That's [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1714.96s)]
*  that is repulsive the way she describes Luigi Mangione as if and not in a mocking way. Not like [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1722.4s)]
*  these these lunatics are going to say the following things about him. She clearly shares in it. She [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1731.2s)]
*  obviously tweeted out something sympathetic about him right after he did it. This is right in her [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1735.6s)]
*  wheelhouse because she claims she's got every ailment known to man and womankind. I don't from [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1740.4s)]
*  the pull pulling out the hair to the nail. I don't she's got a lot of issues so she blamed now she [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1746.16s)]
*  blames them all in insurance companies. So she clearly looks at this guy as a hero and that's [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1750.88s)]
*  her talking about for the audience that doesn't know standing is like you know stalkery fanning [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1756.0s)]
*  like like over the top fandom and she's talking about him as a quote morally good man. He's a [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1761.68s)]
*  person that seems like this morally good man which is hard to find and then laughter. This guy does [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1769.1200000000001s)]
*  no pushback from CNN's correspondent O'Sullivan no pushback whatsoever. Matt [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1775.92s)]
*  I mean there's so many things that are crazy about this that one doesn't even know where to start. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1783.8400000000001s)]
*  Walter and I just a couple of weeks ago we did a segment on Flannery O'Connor's A Good Man Is Hard [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1788.88s)]
*  to Find because it was the 100th anniversary of her birth and here's Taylor Lorenz who is probably [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1795.44s)]
*  the most anti-literate person in media making a reference to A Good Man Is Hard to Find. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1804.56s)]
*  She's someone who if you handed her a hardcover book would be tempted to bite it I think. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1812.56s)]
*  She's probably never read anything in her life and I think she missed if she did know that story [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1818.08s)]
*  she misunderstood the point of it clearly but this idea of Luigi Mangione as a morally good man I [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  don't know how that goes over and what CNN is thinking putting that on the air. It's crazy. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1833.2s)]
*  To your point about the books it reminds me of we love Victor Davis Sands and we have him on all [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1839.76s)]
*  the time. He's truly a brilliant guy. He knows everything encyclopedic knowledge of so many [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1843.6000000000001s)]
*  subjects and we always say like if Victor says it happened it happened because his memory is so good [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1848.4s)]
*  and it's solid but he clearly is an avid reader. I mean he's a college professor many years. He's [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1853.6000000000001s)]
*  an avid reader. He's not really an avid pop culture consumer and on one of the shows one day [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1859.76s)]
*  he referred to the woman who was married to Jay-Z as Beyonce because all he does is read. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1865.52s)]
*  That's all he does is read. To his credit Taylor Lorenz is the opposite of Victor Davis Hansen. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1872.8799999999999s)]
*  She reads nothing. She just pulls out her hair, feels sorry for herself, cries on TV, doxes [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1878.56s)]
*  innocent people who happen to write conservative things and then defend cold-blooded accused [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1886.0s)]
*  killers Walter as good-looking, morally good, famous, revolutionary, smart. It's so hard to find. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1891.8400000000001s)]
*  Well of course this is all a put on and I think Megan your experience in news and opinion [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1903.04s)]
*  reveals that to you too. There were many people they could have interviewed about [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1911.1200000000001s)]
*  Luigi Mangione but they picked Taylor Lorenz because she could be counted on to model this [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1914.96s)]
*  kind of goofy teenage Beatlemania Manson girl fandom that would set the internet on fire. CNN [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1922.88s)]
*  will set itself on fire if it can get ratings at this point and they just did that. She got on my [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1931.2s)]
*  Twitter this morning because I made you know I made adequate fun of this thing and she said I [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1937.8400000000001s)]
*  wasn't talking about myself these aren't my feelings I was just observing what's going on [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1944.32s)]
*  among young women but that's not it at all. What she's doing is she's modeling the kind of [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1949.12s)]
*  reaction that you're now allowed to have to Luigi. Them sort of you know being like they're on a date [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1955.4399999999998s)]
*  joking at the bar about something and you know their dating life or whatever was supposed to [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1963.52s)]
*  show America that you can be lighthearted and fun and teeny bopper about this subject. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1969.52s)]
*  But what they had to say really didn't matter it was the way they said it the way they laughed and [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1975.92s)]
*  the way they made everyone they gave everyone permission to sort of have this strange Tiger [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1981.12s)]
*  Beat feelings about Tiger Beat. Yeah Sean Cassidy and Robbie Benson and John Travolta that that's [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1990.32s)]
*  how old I am guys. It's a lie that she was just parroting what others might say about Luigi. Here [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=1998.48s)]
*  is what Taylor Lorenz said right after the murder. I mean in hours after Thompson was killed Brian [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2006.16s)]
*  Thompson was killed allegedly by Luigi. She got online and expressed her dismay with the health [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2014.08s)]
*  care health industry insurance industry. What happened was somebody posted on Blue Sky, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2020.8s)]
*  Blue Cross, Blue Shield in Connecticut, New York and Missouri has declared it will no longer pay [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2027.1999999999998s)]
*  for anesthesia for the full length of some surgeries. Lorenz replied and people wonder [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2031.4399999999998s)]
*  why we want these executives dead. Following that she went viral for a comment on Piers Morgan [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2036.1599999999999s)]
*  where she said quote I do believe in the sanctity of life and I think that's why I felt along with [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2041.84s)]
*  so many other Americans joy. Unfortunately joy upon learning that Brian Thompson father of two boys [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2047.52s)]
*  had been murdered gunned down in his prime. She made her super joyful. So Walter don't give her [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2055.28s)]
*  one inch. She doesn't deserve it. Oh I didn't give her an inch but I noticed something. She has [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2061.44s)]
*  replies turned off. If she doesn't follow you on Twitter you're not even allowed to talk back at [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2068.1600000000003s)]

*  retarded person who you can't say that you can people at the FDA walk out. I mean it in the [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2081.68s)]
*  classical sense that her growth is stunted. You know not that she suffers from any sort of genetic [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2089.7599999999998s)]
*  syndrome though that's classical. Retarded can mean slow as an actual word like the the process [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=2096.3999999999996s)]

*  they changed the policy about um personal visits to people by the irs so that's that was actually [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3665.9199999999996s)]
*  a positive outcome to that whole thing wow i mean your thoughts then that that that this by trump [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3673.68s)]

*  miles taylor you know he's a character right he was a significant character in the twitter files [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3713.6000000000004s)]
*  we didn't do a lot of the reports on those um but i know that there was talk about investigating [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3719.52s)]
*  him even um even before the end of trump's first term so yeah i'm sure there was by the way there's [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3725.92s)]

*  one and then you get to look at stuff that you're not allowed to talk about um this guy uh may not [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3760.72s)]
*  have talked about uh you know classified information but he did open his mouth [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3767.28s)]
*  very loudly and and you know against his commander in chief at the time or you know his executive [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3773.28s)]
*  and why he would expect that he would not become a target once he's outed the reason he was [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3780.7200000000003s)]
*  anonymous is that he was afraid of what he was doing um then he got de-anonymized and and and [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3786.1600000000003s)]
*  they're looking into him uh that makes him a victim of some kind uh and why do you keep [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3792.64s)]
*  these clearances for life i don't understand that at all i mean i don't get it either [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3798.72s)]
*  they walk around with them apparently they're a great way to earn money because you know [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3804.24s)]
*  there's subsidy yeah there's subsidy to people it's sort of like a an honorary badge that you [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3808.0s)]
*  can use for the rest of your life and people who want you to look at classified things i guess [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3813.8399999999997s)]
*  can have you do that but um i i think they should probably expire and not need to be taken away [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3818.64s)]
*  i agree and then you can get it on a case-by-case basis uh but that seems to be plenty now not not [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3826.8799999999997s)]
*  content to have had your first or at least maybe probably wasn't your first mat but your most [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3834.0s)]
*  recent um appearance before congress results in a scary visit from the irs you went back [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3838.96s)]
*  to congress you've been back a few times and the most recent one was just a couple of months ago [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3844.96s)]
*  i believe whereupon well you got at this hearing called a sexual a serial sexual harasser by some [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3852.16s)]
*  far left california democrat named representative sydney [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3862.4s)]
*  kamlager dove who all stayed up front had zero evidence to support that defamatory claim [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3866.48s)]
*  she just pulled out of thin air to smear matt taibbi in a congressional hearing matt didn't love it [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3875.6800000000003s)]
*  here's what happened watch the majority is relitigating a made-up conspiracy theory [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3882.1600000000003s)]
*  about a part of the state department that no longer exists to distract from the dumpster fire [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3890.48s)]
*  foreign policy this administration is pursuing and elevating a serial sexual harasser as their star [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3896.16s)]
*  witness in the process mr chair i request unanimous consent to enter into the record two articles [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3903.44s)]
*  about the republican witness matt taibbi the first is a chicago reader article entitled 20 [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3910.56s)]
*  years ago in moscow matt taibbi was a misogynist a-hole and possibly worse and a washington post [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3916.48s)]
*  article titled the two expat bros who terrorized women correspondents in moscow [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3923.52s)]
*  so you did what very few people will do when they've been smeared and you actually filed a [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3931.68s)]
*  lawsuit because while she has a congressional privilege to say all that all sorts of nonsense [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3937.04s)]
*  when she's in that seat she repeated the smears on social media i looked into this recently [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3940.88s)]
*  and the privilege still may exist but not to the same extent as it does when they're in their [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3945.92s)]
*  congressional seat she exposed herself by repeating that online and you're suing her for 10 million [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3951.44s)]
*  bucks so what's behind that why did you decide to to do that well when this story first came out [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3957.2000000000003s)]
*  in 2017 it's based on a single passage in a book that i co-wrote with my former co-editor in moscow [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3964.8s)]
*  and it's completely fictional like almost everything else in the exile i mean the exile [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3972.0s)]
*  was a satirical newspaper where everything was basically backwards the whole idea was an [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3978.08s)]
*  un-newspaper so like for instance the corrections always referred to things that had never actually [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3984.96s)]
*  been in the newspaper most of the bylines were of fake people describing fake adventures and in one [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3990.16s)]
*  passage mark described something that it didn't happen it's a massive exaggeration of something [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=3998.08s)]
*  and so all the people who were involved were eventually contacted at that time they recanted [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4006.7999999999997s)]
*  there were corrections at the time i was in litigation with some newspapers at the time [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4013.92s)]
*  that's all been done and finished and nobody's ever accused me of sexual harassment here or in [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4020.72s)]
*  russia not even during the b2 movement none of that stuff i'm you know i'm one of those people [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4027.12s)]
*  who go straight home from work doesn't socialize nothing uh and but i knew in the hearing as soon [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4033.92s)]
*  as she she said that i thought about the speech and debate clause and i realized that she you know [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4040.88s)]
*  she's allowed to say that and then on the way home i i saw um that she was retweeting this i think in [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4046.0s)]
*  an effort to try to get a rise out of me because she said something along the lines of um you know [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4052.72s)]
*  my silence in the hearing was telling uh but i think i think that the privilege is penetrated [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4058.56s)]
*  once you go outside congress and start retweeting on x and blue sky and i'd had enough at that point [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4064.7999999999997s)]
*  of this thing this thing did major damage to my life and career and it's not true and so uh you [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4073.2799999999997s)]
*  know for her to drag this up seven years later it's i i just i just ran out of patience good for you [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4080.0s)]
*  no i remember looking at this uh when i can't remember whether it was dick blumenthal or um [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4086.32s)]
*  tim cain but one of them had said to pete hexeth had suggested that he was beating his wife in the [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4094.0s)]
*  in the hearing or or an ex-wife i mean like the literal like classic defamatory statement and um [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4101.28s)]
*  they can be protected these guys can do whatever they want it's disgusting but then they repeated [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4108.0s)]
*  it on social media and i remember saying you know he should sue and some smart lawyers responded [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4111.839999999999s)]
*  saying well there's it's protected because of speech and debate and i actually spent some time [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4116.88s)]
*  looking into it um because i didn't think social media would qualify and and i did find a lot of [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4120.719999999999s)]
*  big loopholes that you could drive a truck through you are far less protected when you are tweeting as [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4126.48s)]
*  a congressman on x or on blue sky than you are when you're in that seat i think she's in for a whole [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4130.719999999999s)]
*  uh messy legal battle that she didn't anticipate so good for you because no one ever fights back [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4136.8s)]
*  matt no one ever fights back did you have you had any response from her or her team [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4141.92s)]
*  uh well i probably can't get into that um publicly but um what i what i will say is that there was a [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4147.76s)]
*  lot of positive response about this and part of that was from other journalists because [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4154.8s)]
*  uh you know i don't know if you agree with this uh but i think there's been kind of a [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4159.04s)]
*  laissez faire attitude toward outright libel uh in the last eight nine years people just say such [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4165.76s)]
*  crazy things uh online and there's this attitude that we don't have to back it up we don't have to [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4172.400000000001s)]
*  make notations when we make corrections we don't have to leave it on the page to tell people that [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4179.84s)]
*  we made a mistake before um we can say what we want and get away with it most people won't sue [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4186.08s)]
*  and i think you have to because that's the argument for not censoring is is that this [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4192.5599999999995s)]
*  other system actually works and uh you know as somebody who's very against censorship i think [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4198.5599999999995s)]
*  when people do do that that kind of thing you have to try to hold them accountable so matt's too much [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4204.639999999999s)]
*  of a gentleman to say what he really thinks walter but what did you make of that exchange [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4210.4s)]
*  well matt is a gentleman as testified by the fact he's only suing her for 10 million i mean we live [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4213.44s)]
*  in the day of billion dollar lawsuits i think trump just went after uh cbs for billions they [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4221.28s)]
*  you know alex jones coughed up fox coughed up to dominion uh but the damage to matt his family his [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4227.839999999999s)]
*  children you know and so on from that charge which was completely unfounded is worth i think a lot [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4235.2s)]
*  more than that so he's really he's really being a boy scout by asking for so little uh when i heard [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4241.76s)]
*  it uh you know i have a lot of friends who you know watch our podcast and they started texting me [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4247.92s)]
*  saying i can't watch this i poor matt he's sitting up there you know and and i thought to myself well [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4254.0s)]
*  you know he likes it he knows what's going to happen now it's an adventure for him last time [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4260.16s)]
*  the irs came this time they libeled him they might pull out a gun next time i mean he's driving [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4264.8s)]
*  congress crazy yeah it was just it was a hearing on the censorship industrial complex the need for [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4270.24s)]
*  first amendment safeguards at the state department i mean it's really that's that's kind of a no [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4276.24s)]
*  brainer of course we need first amendment safeguards we've been through quite a lot of [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4280.8s)]
*  censorship that's what the ex the twitter files showed among other things and instead of taking [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4285.36s)]
*  any sort of a lesson and listening open-mindedly she decided to go to the politics of personal [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4290.08s)]
*  destruction and it was despicable she decided to do despicable she decided to speak in the one kind [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4294.639999999999s)]
*  of way that actually violates the first amendment i mean exactly you know the irony yeah the irony [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4299.6s)]
*  no censorship for her only for others i guess okay moving on yeah let's just like quickly is that [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4308.400000000001s)]
*  you know from the very beginning you know when i testified about the twitter files you know two [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4314.56s)]
*  years ago uh the the democrats treated me almost like i was worse than a trump supporter uh to the [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4319.280000000001s)]
*  to them they think of me as some kind of apostate but i've been a lifelong supporter of the first [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4327.52s)]
*  amendment i've been a democrat most of my life i probably agree with them about some things if they [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4332.88s)]
*  wanted to open a discussion about what's appropriate for online regulation but they they [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4338.240000000001s)]
*  decided to go completely in a different direction and i the political sense of that escapes me i [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4344.96s)]
*  just don't understand why they well i guarantee you that woman did no research other than on you [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4350.080000000001s)]
*  other than you know smear research uh stuff that she could get to smear you she she didn't she [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4354.72s)]
*  wasn't interested in probing who you actually are what your views are and she was too dumb to know [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4360.320000000001s)]
*  you so you know all of it reflected very poorly on her and i think it will continue to um okay [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4364.64s)]
*  a couple of other things this just in the else the president of el salvador was at the white house [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4370.88s)]
*  this morning um and met with president trump this is the guy who's taking our venezuelan gang members [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4377.04s)]
*  and other illegals into this controversial prison which does not look like a day at the park [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4382.96s)]
*  and um one of the guys that we deported this guy last name abrigo garcia is at the center of the [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4387.6s)]
*  controversy now because the supreme court just to be clear has already ruled that trump can use the [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4397.2s)]
*  alien enemy act alien enemies act to deport these people and what what process they'll get before we [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4401.68s)]
*  deport them the answer is some and we'll figure out how much but i guarantee it's not going to be [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4408.48s)]
*  much it's not going to be much immigrants we're trying to kick out get a very de minimis level [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4413.28s)]
*  of due process it's not like you are the three of us would get in a court of law accused of crimes [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4417.759999999999s)]
*  that's the highest level by the way an illegal accused of a crime who's tried in a court would [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4423.12s)]
*  get the same level of due process in a criminal court as we would too but on deportation hearings [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4426.5599999999995s)]
*  it's a quickie you know what do we know what don't we know get out and then they usually stay [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4432.4s)]
*  okay so what happened with this guy was he was brought over and he was like 15 or 16 [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4438.16s)]
*  by his parents from al salvador and then grew up to allegedly become part of ms 13 [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4442.24s)]
*  here in america down in virginia or maryland around there and um he got uh pinpointed as a [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4449.84s)]
*  potentially you know problematic guy as a gang member potentially and dragged into immigration [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4459.28s)]
*  court and we had an immigration proceeding against him we didn't like have a criminal [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4463.84s)]
*  proceeding against him and then it went up on appeal within the immigration system and two [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4468.64s)]
*  courts the lower court and the upper court found that he had enough gang ties that they were [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4473.52s)]
*  convinced he was a member of ms 13 they took witness testimony from a confidential informant [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4479.2s)]
*  and apparently even al salvador says he was a member of ms 13 so he was ordered to be deported [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4484.72s)]
*  get out now he's in his mid-20s please leave and only this this took a while all these proceedings [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4492.0s)]
*  and only on the eve of his deportation did he say i it was basically an asylum claim you can't claim [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4498.0s)]
*  asylum in the united states unless you claim it within like the first year of being here which [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4505.28s)]
*  you missed but so it wasn't asylum exactly but it was like i need humanitarian relief you can't send [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4508.88s)]
*  me back to al salvador and the reason is that there's this terrible gang there that wants to [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4513.92s)]
*  kill me and my whole family we were making some sort of a food they like to make that food they [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4517.52s)]
*  didn't want my family to make the food my mother my brother me well i'll be dead if you send me [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4521.68s)]
*  back to el salvador and some judge was like okay and gave him this order of suspended removal where [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4526.8s)]
*  he we could still deport him we could send him to any country in the world that would have him [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4535.6s)]
*  but we can't send him to el salvador because of this judge's order at least then if circumstances [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4540.8s)]
*  change you can send him back to el salvador and by the way that gang that was allegedly [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4547.68s)]
*  targeting him that he forgot to mention during two long immigration removal hearings never [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4552.400000000001s)]
*  mentioned once only came up once he lost and he was already deported no longer exists so our [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4558.320000000001s)]
*  government probably very easily could have gone back into immigration court and gotten an order [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4564.0s)]
*  saying the removal suspensions lifted you're going home buddy but now he's like been removed [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4567.200000000001s)]
*  thanks to trump and he's playing the i married an american i have kids one may be special needs [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4572.88s)]
*  this is so wrong i'm just a dreamer forget all those allegations about me being part of ms 13 [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4578.4800000000005s)]
*  that two courts found were real that el salvador says are real it was never found by a criminal [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4583.2s)]
*  court so it can't be real and we think the evidence is sketchy and i i'm an american send [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4588.24s)]
*  me back home which he's not he's an el salvadorian that's uh that's the synopsis by the way the one [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4591.2s)]
*  the media won't give you about this guy abrigo garcia who's become the left wing's poster boy [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4596.320000000001s)]
*  for wrongful deportation deportations uh the left has taken this case up they got an order [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4600.88s)]
*  from a lower court judge saying we have to we have to make sure that he gets deported [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4608.72s)]
*  that we have this already returned returned to the united states from this el salvador in prison to [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4615.6s)]
*  which we were not allowed to to deport him technically and um the supreme court took it [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4621.2s)]
*  up and said all right you have to help facilitate his removal but you don't have to ensure it you [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4627.92s)]
*  don't have to actually execute on it that's somebody else's job but you united states [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4634.4800000000005s)]
*  government you do have to help facilitate his removal from that prison and return [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4638.96s)]
*  and that was a lower burden than the left wanted they wanted you have to make sure he gets back [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4644.8s)]
*  here and the supreme court would not give that so that's where the case stands now as bukele [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4649.76s)]
*  the president of el salvador shows up at the white house and all the left was saying why don't [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4656.72s)]
*  you just put him on your plane put this gang member on the el salvador and president's plane [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4660.64s)]
*  and bring him back well that didn't happen and the news just out of the oval is as follows watch [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4666.96s)]
*  well i kept i'm supposed to not suggest him that i'll smuggle a terrorist into the united states [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4673.280000000001s)]
*  right how can i smuggle how can i return him to the united states if i could i smuggle him into [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4678.16s)]
*  the united states or whatever do of course i'm not going to do it it's like i mean the the [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4684.24s)]
*  question is for postures how can i smuggle a terrorist into the united states i don't have [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4689.76s)]
*  the power to return him to the united states and then now it's a very interesting legal thicket [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4694.48s)]
*  because trump is saying team trump steven miller saying we don't have the authority to go into [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4702.24s)]
*  a foreign government a foreign nation and take someone who is a salvadoran citizen [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4708.88s)]
*  who has no citizenry here and bring him back to the united states we don't have that authority [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4716.400000000001s)]
*  now you hear the salvadoran president saying we don't have authority to take someone who's been [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4722.96s)]
*  said to be a gang member and adjudicated by the by president trump by executive order a terrorist [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4728.96s)]
*  and drop him back off into the united states and that's where things stand now it's getting [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4735.04s)]
*  now it's getting really interesting to me thoughts on it guys [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4739.12s)]
*  well one of the one of the terrible effects of uh unconstrained immigration and illegal immigration [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4745.04s)]
*  is that every one of those people represents a total tie-up of our court system i mean that [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4753.6s)]
*  we are spending this amount of time this amount of care this amount of you know media space on [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4761.04s)]
*  a gang member uh or an alleged gang member but definitely an illegal definitely a deportation [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4768.24s)]
*  order settled illegal is an argument for for there really being a very strict and like you say [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4777.68s)]
*  de minimis process for i think getting him out of here because uh we can't [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4784.88s)]
*  afford these resources we can't afford this divisive argument and this legal quagmire over [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4791.68s)]
*  every single person and uh you know this is not somebody to embrace for the left [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4797.92s)]
*  you know and and and that they want immediate results from a u.s government that takes forever [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4805.4400000000005s)]
*  to get you a you know get you a permit for something or whatever is ridiculous uh these [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4810.32s)]
*  are the kind of issues that no matter what trump does are going to keep the left and the democrats [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4816.96s)]
*  in the minority for a long time matt it's very interesting because trump got an uh order last [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4823.44s)]
*  week late last week from the high court saying the deportation of the columbia university agitator [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4829.04s)]
*  makhmud kalil the guy who was the spokesperson for the on-campus group of columbia that overtook [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4834.88s)]
*  that building hamilton hall and held people hostage and defamed the bill or defaced the building [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4839.6s)]
*  that trump and marco rubio who acted as secretary of state to say his presence here is not consistent [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4847.360000000001s)]
*  with the foreign policy goals of the united states the high court said you're fine you're good there [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4852.4800000000005s)]
*  that was their first poster boy by the way we told you that was not going to work and we were right [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4857.120000000001s)]
*  and now this guy's going down because the supreme court would not order a mandate that we actually [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4861.84s)]
*  make sure he get back here and now we're in this really interesting place where where this legal [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4866.4s)]
*  legal limbo but here's and and that's that works for trump because possession is nine-tenths of the [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4870.879999999999s)]
*  law and he's in el salvador um here is stephen miller i'm going to advancing this now outside [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4876.719999999999s)]
*  of the white house uh and i think it was yesterday but not sure where all these reporters because [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4884.08s)]
*  they're all left-wingers they all think this guy should be released back it was today okay it was [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4890.5599999999995s)]
*  this morning that they all think he should be released back in the united states gang member [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4894.08s)]
*  or not terrorist or not illegal or not and stephen miller who knows the subject like the back of [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4898.24s)]
*  his hand did a little slice and dice in the media watch this let's see if any of you have researched [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4903.44s)]
*  anything about this issue at all can anyone here tell me what would happen to the illegal alien [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4908.72s)]
*  from el salvador if he came back to the net is this does anyone here know anyone want to guess [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4913.76s)]
*  anything he could be with his family he would be arrested he'd be put in confinement he would be [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4918.4800000000005s)]
*  deported the second time to el salvador again because there's no withholding order for an alien [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4924.56s)]
*  who's a member of a foreign terrorist organization number one number two is the gang that he's a [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4931.92s)]
*  member of doesn't exist in el salvador anymore so what you're asking for is to be deported twice [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4935.84s)]
*  but so i'm trying to understand from you all is so if he came back and under our laws he was then [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4940.16s)]
*  deported to egypt or to somalia would you then be saying great i'm so glad that you deported him [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4944.64s)]
*  to another country is that what you'd all be saying or do you understand our immigration laws at all [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4951.200000000001s)]
*  do you know the difference between a deportation order and a withholding order do you know the [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4955.84s)]
*  difference any of you please do you well we're not in the government i what i'm getting from [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4959.6s)]
*  this conversation for me is that one person in the media knows the difference between a deportation [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4965.92s)]
*  order and a withholding order is that a fair statement you're learning this all for the first [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4970.96s)]
*  time right now i guess so okay so the deportation order means the judge has said he must be deported [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4974.08s)]
*  from the country he has no right to remain here any longer he must be removed from the country so [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4981.12s)]
*  his only options are to be deported to his home country or another country that's it there's no [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4987.12s)]
*  other other way that happened he doesn't get to stay here he doesn't get to live here he has no [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4992.64s)]
*  future here he has no right to be here he's an illegal alien that was amazing was it not amazing [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=4996.32s)]
*  that's no it's it's incredible um and it's it's a source of frustration for me because [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5004.24s)]
*  i think all of us in media we often get asked to respond immediately to things that happen [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5013.84s)]

*  bill clinton's monica lindsay [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5714.0s)]
*  and he said you know i've heard from a lot of people who really who really liked that were having [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5720.72s)]
*  this dinner not all but a lot and i said same a lot of people told me they loved it but not all [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5725.12s)]
*  and we agreed the people who don't even want us to talk we don't like you don't talk as opposed to [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5733.04s)]
*  what writing the same editorial for the millionth time and making 25-hour speeches into the wind [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5740.64s)]
*  really that's what liberals have he takes the piss out of everybody else and we can hold ours [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5747.44s)]
*  okay that's my report you can hate me for it but i'm not a liar trump was gracious and measured and [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5753.76s)]
*  why he isn't that in other settings i don't know and i can't answer and it's not my place to answer [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5760.16s)]
*  i'm just telling you what i saw and i wasn't high that's the only part you know i was trying to [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5765.6s)]
*  i was trying to figure out how uh why this doesn't irk me the way the um morning joe trip [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5775.12s)]
*  tomorrow lago irritated me because that one i just felt was performative i really felt like [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5782.8s)]
*  they wanted access to a person in power who they had been so unfair to for years and they just [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5787.6s)]
*  that show in general is just such a lie and so unfair and i don't feel that way about bill maher [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5794.88s)]
*  or his show at all i think he's an honest broker and he he has you know trump supporters on all [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5799.280000000001s)]
*  the time it's just he he isn't one he hasn't been one so i i agree that it was a courageous thing [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5804.72s)]
*  for him to do for both of them to do and i honestly i give trump tons of credit because [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5810.4800000000005s)]
*  maher's been a chief antagonist your thoughts well in addition to being an honest broker and i think [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5815.84s)]
*  believing um what he says and like walter i've been on his show and i've talked to bill [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5823.28s)]
*  uh many times after the show and always enjoyed talking to him he's also a natural comic and i [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5828.5599999999995s)]
*  think one thing that he really struggled with in the last eight years was the sheer quantity of [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5836.8s)]
*  laughable stuff that came out of the quote-unquote left that he was told he wasn't allowed to laugh [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5842.64s)]
*  about and that i think that was a big factor for him uh you know sort of being told that there are [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5848.240000000001s)]
*  things that are off limits and the not so veiled threat that if you even entertain the idea of [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5855.12s)]
*  calling donald trump sane or a normal politician in public that your career is going to be over [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5863.280000000001s)]
*  now bill is just big enough that he can avoid the fate that most everybody else who went there [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5869.36s)]
*  experienced and i i think you know this thing that he did i think it's a significant moment [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5875.2s)]
*  for for media because now there might be some other people who come out of the woodwork and [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5881.679999999999s)]
*  say you know what i'm just tired of saying the same stuff over and over again and not really [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5885.36s)]
*  fully believing it i wonder if it's going to change at all the way he covers the president because [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5890.24s)]
*  he's he's definitely been tough on trump he's he's very tough on democrats too by the way he [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5896.96s)]
*  hates wokeism he's been a very strong ally in that battle but usually on trump he's saying something [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5902.08s)]
*  negative and so i do wonder now if he'll start saying more positive things walter and if so [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5907.28s)]
*  what happens with his audience bill's got a unique relationship to his audience he's always challenging [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5914.0s)]
*  them really i mean every bill marshall has something that's a little uncomfortable for [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5920.32s)]
*  people uh that doesn't play to their prejudices or their you know assumptions so this is the biggest [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5925.44s)]
*  case of that yet and uh i think his audience is going to stick with him and i and i but i [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5932.719999999999s)]
*  i think he'll stay just as tough on trump but it will be more issues based i think he's going to [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5938.16s)]
*  say tough stuff on trump or tough on trump as well he's just you know he he doesn't like trump i think [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5943.04s)]
*  that's still true but i think he saw like a glimpse of the man like that we actually know like the real [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5948.96s)]
*  trump and not the fighter who's out there being attacked all the time who's got to be you know [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5955.92s)]
*  tough and is tough in return and you know bilmar among many others has thrown some very tough [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5960.96s)]
*  punches his way as well so anyway i am in favor of the meeting i feel very differently about it [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5966.64s)]
*  than i did about the mar-a-lago kiss the ring-a-thon by members of the media who make their living [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc1HQZ3r7wU&t=5969.92s)]
