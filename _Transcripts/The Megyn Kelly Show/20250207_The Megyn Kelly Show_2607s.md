Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Howard Blum, author of "When The Night Comes Falling," to discuss how the FBI may have illegally obtained the DNA match from Bryan Kohberger in the Idaho college murders case, whether the defense team may be able to get the DNA match thrown out entirely, how crucial the single DNA match is to the prosecutor's case, the new details about blood from two unknown males in the Idaho college murders house, how this helps Kohberger's defense, a theory about whether Kohberger could have planted this evidence, the “eyewitness” testimony from the surviving roommate of the Idaho murders falling apart as new details emerge, her admitting she had been drunk and unable to identify Kohberger, and more.

# Shocking New Kohberger Details About DNA Match, "Unknown Male" Blood, and Witness, with Howard Blum
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show and today's bonus AM episode. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=0.0s)]
*  Brian Kohlberger, the suspect accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=5.36s)]
*  is set to go to trial in August. But in late January, there was a pre-trial hearing and an [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=10.96s)]
*  important one that revealed shocking new information that we have not heard before. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=16.96s)]

*  savings. You just text my initials MK to the number 989898 today. Howard, welcome back. I have to say [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=107.68s)]
*  it's such a busy news time for us to be doing this. Just shows the significance of what happened at [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=115.68s)]
*  that hearing on January 23rd and 24th. I was like, we've got to get this on because I mean, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=121.68s)]
*  I don't want to overstate it, but it's possible the prosecution's case is falling apart. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  It did not go particularly well for them. Let's start with the DNA. What happened? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=131.36s)]
*  Well, the way these authorities got to Koberger wasn't through any other evidence at the beginning, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=135.68s)]
*  but just a little speck of DNA, smaller than a piece of dust that was left on the button [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=144.0s)]
*  of a knife sheath that was left behind. They use this speck of DNA, they processed it so that they [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  could give it to an FBI laboratory. The FBI laboratory then, after months of not admitting [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=158.56s)]
*  what they had done, it was revealed in the end of January in court that they had taken this DNA [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  and they had uploaded it to two websites, ancestry DNA websites that prohibit law enforcement from [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=171.28s)]
*  using this DNA. The FBI did this not out of any evil reasons, but just out of their zeal. You have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=180.8s)]
*  to go back to the time of the killing. There was a murder of four young children on the loose. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=188.4s)]
*  They had really no clues except for this DNA. Except for this DNA, it was in many ways the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=196.24s)]
*  perfect crime. They had no blood evidence really. They had no evidence of anyone stalking these [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=203.2s)]
*  young college students. All they had was this DNA, so they ran with it. This DNA allowed them to open [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=212.32s)]
*  up many other doors, ultimately having a series of search warrants that led to the suspects, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  Brian Kohlberger's phone, his car, his apartment. But without that DNA, they couldn't have gotten [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=226.24s)]
*  these search warrants. And now the defense is saying, wait a minute, wait a minute, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=232.32s)]
*  this suspect's Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the FBI's going into these prohibited [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=238.88s)]
*  websites. You've been saying this all along. You've been suspecting that the FBI [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=244.96s)]
*  got this match between the touch DNA on the knife sheath and matched it to Kohlberger's father, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=251.92s)]
*  possibly by doing something they're not allowed to do, which is use the commercial DNA websites that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  people like you and I might go to if we're looking for a long lost relative. They have a public [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  database. C.C. Moore, the original creator of genetic genealogy, talked to us about this a long [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=273.76s)]
*  time ago saying, there's only one that's totally public and anyone can upload their DNA and see [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=280.56s)]
*  what's on there. The other two are fee-for-service private companies that are not allowed to be used [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=286.56s)]
*  by law enforcement. Otherwise, nobody would go on there. They'd be like, if I ever committed a crime [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  or have a relative down the line who might have committed a crime, I'm going to get him out of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=296.40000000000003s)]
*  trouble. There's supposed to be this hard wall. You said early on you suspected because the FBI [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=300.0s)]
*  seemed to be very cagey about this whole thing. They didn't want to turn over the results of how [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=309.44s)]
*  they got this to anybody. They weren't allowed to. Go ahead. Not only did they not want to turn over [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=314.0s)]
*  the results, they said literally that they had ripped up the evidence of their research. They [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=322.64s)]
*  said, we just threw it out. Who ever heard of it in a major murder investigation, the FBI discarding [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  evidence? But this is what they did. But the defense kept on pressing and pressing and now they got a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  judge to give them the evidence and it proves beyond the shadow of a doubt it came out in open [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=343.84s)]
*  court that the FBI violated the protocols of these two genetic websites. Now, how is that [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=348.8s)]
*  going to affect the case? The judge- Wait, wait. Before you answer that, let's just show the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=356.64s)]
*  audience what Kohlberger's defense attorney, Ann Taylor, yes, that's her name, argued about this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=362.16s)]
*  investigative genetic genealogy, IgG evidence. Listen to her in SOP 41. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=369.2s)]
*  Your Honor, our position is that the court should suppress the IgG identification and everything [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=374.0s)]
*  that flows from that. This is supported by Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=381.44s)]
*  due process, Article 1, Section 17 of the Idaho Constitution. Your Honor, there was no warrant [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=388.72s)]
*  for several phases of the search that led to the IgG work, investigative genetic genealogy, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=395.36s)]
*  and we think every single one of those stages a warrant was required, none was given, and so this [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=402.16s)]
*  must be suppressed. She's saying all the goods they got after getting that hit have to be suppressed [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=408.16s)]
*  and cannot be used because they're in essence the fruit of the poisonous tree. Exactly. And if you [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=417.68s)]
*  look at what they had before then, there's not much except for one thing. After Kohlberger is arrested, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  he's in a Pennsylvania jail, and they do a cheek swab, and the DNA from that cheek swab matches the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=429.36s)]
*  DNA on the button of the knife sheath. That is pretty substantial evidence, but if they can get [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=437.36s)]
*  that thrown out, that will make a case that seems pretty much a shut case to be more open than shut, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=443.2s)]
*  and there's going to be a possibility of a Frank's hearing. That's a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=452.32000000000005s)]
*  judicial process named after a 1978 Supreme Court case where evidence was thrown out because the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=460.16s)]
*  police had falsified information to get their warrants. The judge has not said he will have [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  this Frank's hearing, but he has raised the possibility and he's asked the lawyers to keep [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=473.36s)]
*  time available to have such a hearing. That's not what the prosecution wanted to hear. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=478.08s)]
*  The prosecution wanted to hear. There's no need for a hearing. This is ridiculous. Irrespective of how [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=482.4s)]
*  we got to Brian Kohlberger's father as being related to the person whose DNA was on the knife sheath, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  we know it is Brian Kohlberger's DNA because we ultimately took a cheek swab that shows it was him. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=494.79999999999995s)]
*  But the problem for the prosecution is the judge is not saying no. He's keeping the door open. He [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=500.96s)]
*  might actually have a hearing on this, so he's at least a little interested. But can I just say [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=505.6s)]
*  this to what you just said, Howard? The DNA matching Kohlberger directly is absolutely [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=509.6s)]
*  devastating. There's no question. It's a terrible fact for the defense. But as I understand her [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=516.5600000000001s)]
*  argument, Ann Taylor's, it's that you would never have been cheek swabbing Brian Kohlberger if you [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=523.52s)]
*  hadn't been doing the shenanigans with the DNA and 23andMe. She's saying you can't even use the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=530.08s)]
*  cheek swab because it too is fruit of the poisonous tree. That is what she's arguing. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=538.72s)]
*  That's part of her argument. But also at that hearing, something else was revealed, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=544.88s)]
*  which is perhaps even more dramatic and makes her case even more substantial. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=549.84s)]
*  Okay. So hold on. But before we get to that, let me finish up this part. I know there's a lot of [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=555.12s)]
*  stuff to discuss. So just so the audience knows, that's what she's trying to argue. She's trying [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  to say everything that followed as a result of you figuring out that Brian Kohlberger's DNA, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=564.32s)]
*  his dad's DNA was traceable from that knife sheath has to be removed. You have to get rid of it, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=568.96s)]
*  including the cheek swab. Now the judge did not seem like he was going to do that. He seemed very [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=576.48s)]
*  into the actual cheek swab and he didn't sound like a man who thinks that's fruit of any poisonous [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=581.84s)]
*  tree. But here he is, Judge Hippler, talking about that DNA match in SOP 43. There's a DNA match [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=585.52s)]
*  between the DNA and the sheath in Mr. Kohlberger. Isn't that probable cause every day and twice on [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=595.12s)]
*  Sunday? Not in this context. Not in this context because of the I.G.G. work. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=606.16s)]
*  That's again, she's saying the investigative genetic genealogy [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=617.04s)]
*  undermines it and makes it unusable. Is that basically what happened? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=620.56s)]
*  That's basically what happened. But also, if they throw it out, there's really not much there. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, in many ways it was a perfect crime except for the leaving the knife sheath behind. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=632.64s)]
*  Consider, the house was, there was so much blood in the house that it was coming out of the sides [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=640.4s)]
*  of the house. It was coming down the foundation of the building at 1122 King Road. And yet, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=647.28s)]
*  no blood was ever found on Kohlberger. No blood was found in his car. No blood was found in his [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=654.4s)]
*  apartment. There is no evidence also of Kohlberger having any connection to any of the murder victims. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=660.16s)]
*  There's no evidence of him talking to any of them, ever being in the house, of him stalking them on [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  the internet. There's no murder weapon. There's no motive even. So without this DNA evidence, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=673.92s)]
*  the case against Kohlberger becomes a lot more problematic. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=683.12s)]
*  Okay. But how about the fact that, I mean, the best fact, I think, other than the DNA match, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=687.68s)]
*  is the fact that when the police went to arrest him in the Poconos in December, this crime was [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=693.3599999999999s)]
*  committed the month before in November. My God, is it 2022 now? I'm losing track. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=702.4s)]
*  Yeah, 2022. When they arrested him in his home, back in his parents' home in December, he was there [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=703.28s)]
*  putting his trash into individual little baggies that were being disposed of in the neighbors' trash [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=709.52s)]
*  can. That is terrible. Very incriminating. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=715.68s)]
*  That is very incriminating, yes. But if she, Anne Taylor, the defense attorney, is trying to get [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=718.8s)]
*  the FBI and the police coming into his house, she's trying to get that thrown out. The terms of [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=727.8399999999999s)]
*  this, she's claiming it was an unlawful assault without the necessary warrants to arrest him in [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=734.16s)]
*  his house. She's raising everything. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=741.12s)]
*  She's toast. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=743.3599999999999s)]
*  Of course, as any good defense lawyer will. But that one's, we've heard her out on the genetic [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=744.24s)]
*  genealogy thing. You were right, and she was right, that there was some funny business going on from [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=748.7199999999999s)]
*  the sound of it. But there's no way she's getting out, the FBI, what they found upon arresting him. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=752.16s)]
*  No way. And it's just a terrible damn fact. But back to your first point, I firmly believe [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=758.0s)]
*  Kohlberger committed this crime. But what's fascinating is how good he was at covering it [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=765.28s)]
*  up, to your point. There's no murder weapon. And she reiterated these points. So these are all [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=771.6s)]
*  updated now. We've been speculating, but she was on the record with they haven't found a murder [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=776.08s)]
*  weapon. They did not find any blood, Howard, she said this, on Brian, on any of his belongings, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=780.64s)]
*  or even anywhere in that car that they practically dissected? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=787.6s)]
*  Yes. I mean, they took apart the break gears. They were looking all over for any blood, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=792.24s)]
*  no blood in his student apartment at Washington State University, nowhere. It was a perfect crime [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=796.8000000000001s)]
*  in many ways, except for leaving behind the knife sheath. Such a massive, massive error. But what [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=804.88s)]
*  about the car and the phone evidence? Because when we read the police affidavit before his arrest, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=813.9200000000001s)]
*  it was white car, Hyundai Elantra, they changed the year once they started to narrow in on [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=819.28s)]
*  Kohlberger because they had had the years wrong. But then they said, Okay, it's 15. It's not just [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=825.52s)]
*  16. Anyway, whatever his car was. And we've seen that car around the murder house many times, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=831.04s)]
*  according to the cops. And also, his phone records show that he was in the vicinity of the murder [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=838.72s)]
*  house over and over, including the night before they didn't have him there during the murder hours [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=845.12s)]
*  because his phone was off. But then the next morning, he appeared to go back before they'd [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=850.64s)]
*  found the bodies in the 9am hour. So speak to that. Here's what the defense is going to say. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=854.32s)]
*  And I think it's a fairly convincing argument, especially in a death penalty case. You have a [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=859.6800000000001s)]
*  white Hyundai Elantra by the house, but you have no proof that that's Kohlberger's car. You never see [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=865.2800000000001s)]
*  the license plate on any of the videos. You never see the man behind the wheel in any of those videos. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=873.44s)]
*  They're all obscured. So there are lots of white Hyundai Elantras around. They can't make that [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  connection directly. Then when you have the cell phone tower triangulation that puts him in the [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=887.04s)]
*  neighborhood of the murder house, well, it's a 10 mile radius in a town like Moscow, 10 miles, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=893.84s)]
*  takes up a lot of territory, a lot of neighborhoods. You never have any proof that he ever parked [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=901.6s)]
*  in front of the house. His car ever came to a halt in front of the house. You can speculate, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=908.3199999999999s)]
*  but you can't prove it. Are these inferences enough to condemn a man to death? It might be hard for a jury. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=916.0s)]
*  What is the seven minute screw up on the timeline by the cops? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=925.68s)]
*  Well, it seems the cops, when they were tracking the white Hyundai Elantra that night, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=931.2s)]
*  made an error. They got the timelines wrong, whether accidentally or deliberately, but off by [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=938.48s)]
*  seven minutes. They put the car that they allege is Kohlberger's closer to Moscow at the time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=944.88s)]
*  The defense is saying that because of this screw up, which no one seems to be arguing that the cops [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=953.44s)]
*  got this time incorrect, this would have allowed Kohlberger to be driving away from Moscow and to [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=958.32s)]
*  this state park where they claim he was at the time of the murders. Stargazing. Yes, stargazing [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=964.88s)]
*  on a cloudy night at four in the morning when the temperatures are a little below freezing. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=972.88s)]
*  My gosh. All right. So it's just a screw up by the cops that won't be helpful to the prosecutors [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=978.88s)]
*  in trying to show this case was done by the book. All t's crossed, all i's dotted. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=984.4s)]
*  All right. So that's some of the stuff. I'm amazed. I'm amazed that at this point in the case, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=989.92s)]
*  she's saying openly there's no blood evidence tying him to the crime. I thought for sure [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=994.0s)]
*  they'd find something that with all the searches they did of his apartment or his car, his clothing, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=998.0799999999999s)]
*  there'd be some speck of the four victims' blood. This is a brutal murder done by knife, K-bar knife [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  in the middle of the night. These four beautiful college students asleep in their beds or in their [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1011.52s)]
*  rooms at least. And he is alleged to have killed them in the course of 12 minutes, all four of them. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1016.16s)]
*  You'd get blood all over you, Howard. There was so much blood in the house that it was, as I said [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1022.72s)]
*  before, coming out of the foundation of the building. And yet make it more, even more [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1029.2s)]
*  interesting, more dramatic. It was revealed that they did find blood in the house, unidentified [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1036.4s)]
*  blood in the house, but it wasn't Koberger's. No, this is big. Oh, wait. So hold on a second [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1041.92s)]
*  before we get to that. That's an important development. But think about it because many [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1046.96s)]
*  of us believe that he had on like a worker's suit because we saw that that was, he bought one via [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1052.64s)]
*  Amazon, like a painter's suit that would cover up your whole everything you're wearing. And that [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1058.4s)]
*  he did that for a reason. He knew he was going to get bloody. But, and maybe he had those little [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1064.72s)]
*  booties that, like when the heating guy comes to fix your heater, he puts on before he walks into [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1070.0s)]
*  your house. But he would have, like, think about it. He's sneaking out of the house covered in [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1075.12s)]
*  blood. Where does he take the stuff off? According to them, the eyewitness saw him, which would have [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1082.56s)]
*  shaken him. He wouldn't have wanted to be hanging out in the house, disrobing, changing out of his [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1088.24s)]
*  workman suit and his booties if he's wearing them. He must have done that in the car. You would think [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1093.28s)]
*  he would have done that in the car and then disposed of this along with a murder weapon on [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1098.08s)]
*  the way home. And we'll get to the eyewitness, which is the most interesting thing of the whole [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1102.08s)]
*  day. But pause there. We'll get to the blood. We'll get to the eyewitness. So if you put, if you got [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1105.52s)]
*  into your car with a bloodied jumpsuit and a bloodied pair of like those slide-on booties, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1110.8s)]
*  there should be blood evidence in the car. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1116.0s)]
*  Yes. And there was nothing in his trunk. They've taken the car apart top from bottom. The only [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1120.56s)]
*  scenario possible is that before he got into his car, he had a garbage bag. He put all the clothes [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1126.88s)]
*  he was wearing in a garbage bag and drove off basically in his underwear that was clean. But [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1133.28s)]
*  where is the clothes he was wearing that night? Where is the garbage bag? Where is the murder [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1142.56s)]
*  weapon? No one can find it. They've been looking for two years now, two and a half years, and they [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1146.96s)]
*  don't have a trace. I mean, he did quite a job of disposing of that murder weapon and those clothes. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1152.3999999999999s)]
*  That's all you need. I mean, it'd be ballgame. He'd be done. He'd be total toast. I've often [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1160.32s)]
*  wondered if he managed to put it up in a tree somehow, like instead of down, instead of digging [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1164.1599999999999s)]
*  ground, which if they'd gotten enough search crews out there might've been identified. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1168.48s)]
*  Is there any chance he went up with it? I think he probably threw it into the Snake River. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1173.44s)]
*  The Snake River sort of came by the territory. He could have just tossed it anywhere near there. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1179.2s)]
*  So risky though to come back up. Or it is possible that he went up to that park that he's using as [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1184.8s)]
*  his alibi. He could have gone to that park after the murder as he's driving around perhaps and then [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  left it somewhere up there. It's just mind boggling. There's so much blood. The house is [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1194.96s)]
*  bleeding. Four dead young 20s and teenagers. In the course of 12 minutes, there would be blood [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1199.2800000000002s)]
*  all over you. How did he get it to the point where there was no blood in the car? That's a big [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1207.3600000000001s)]
*  mystery for me. It's a big question in this case. Okay, but let's talk about- [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a big question for the jury. Yeah. On the subject of blood, what you were going to say [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1216.16s)]
*  we learned about those two other spots of blood. In the course of the hearing on January 23rd, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1220.96s)]
*  Ann Taylor, the Colberger's attorney, revealed that there has been blood found in the house [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1229.04s)]
*  belonging to two unknown males. The blood was found on a banister, a handrail going up to the [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1235.1200000000001s)]
*  second floor and also inside a glove outside the front of the house. Blood from two unknown people. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1241.76s)]
*  Now, this was a party house, so you can imagine there'd be fingerprints on the handrail, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1253.04s)]
*  but what reason is there for blood and what reason is there to be blood on the glove? If [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1257.76s)]
*  they would belong to someone who had gone to the house during one of the parties, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1264.8s)]
*  how hard would it have been for the authorities to track down the fraternity boys who came in and [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1268.3200000000002s)]
*  out of the house and getting blood samples from them? But to this day, two and a half years later, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1274.3200000000002s)]
*  they still have not been able to identify the blood. When the judge heard this, he said in open court, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1279.76s)]
*  are you saying that Colberger had other people working with him? This doesn't mean Colberger [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1286.8000000000002s)]
*  wasn't involved, but there could have been accomplices. Accomplices, this throws out [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1292.96s)]
*  a new mystery into the case, and here is how Ann Taylor is using it. She says the real question [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1299.92s)]
*  is how did the knife sheath get there? She is now going to argue in the course of the trial [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1308.08s)]
*  that these two unknown men, either one of them or both of them, put the knife sheath on the bed. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1315.6s)]
*  They were involved in the murder, and Colberger, prior to the murder, had somehow innocently [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1323.84s)]
*  touched the knife sheath. The DNA on the knife sheath is just touch DNA, and she is claiming, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1329.6799999999998s)]
*  or will claim at the trial that this was done innocently by Colberger. It's [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1338.16s)]
*  a argument that can raise a lot of doubts, I believe, in a jury's mind, and the prospect [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  that there could have been accomplices in the murder further complicates the case. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1351.3600000000001s)]
*  Did the prosecution, did the FBI do any genetic genealogy on the DNA from the blood? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1356.16s)]
*  All I know is what was revealed in the court, and the court referred to it as unknown males. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1364.1599999999999s)]
*  Any theories on how not one but two men's DNA got on this crime scene, Howard? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1374.48s)]
*  Well, I'll throw out a hypothesis, and again, it's just a hypothesis, and maybe it's a sketchy one, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1382.7199999999998s)]
*  but I believe Colberger was guilty. I can't get around the cheek swab DNA that ties in there. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1388.3999999999999s)]
*  So if he was out to commit the perfect crime, if he was a student of forensics, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  he could have taken a vial of blood with him, and he could have put it on the banister. He [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1402.6399999999999s)]
*  could have taken a glove with blood already embedded in it and left it at the crime scene, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1407.4399999999998s)]
*  and he could have done this deliberately to put this police, the authorities, to look for two [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1413.6s)]
*  other people, and he would have, meanwhile, been just got away with it. It all would have worked [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1419.84s)]
*  if he hadn't left the knife sheath behind. It's a fascinating theory. All I could think of when [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1426.32s)]
*  you were saying it was, of course, the famous Johnny Cochran, if the glove doesn't fit, you must [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1433.84s)]
*  acquit. I bet you anything, that glove does not fit Brian Colberger's hand. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1439.2s)]
*  And if this is true, what if he, as this, he's just getting his PhD in criminology. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1446.0s)]
*  He's a TA in criminology. All he does is study crime, and apparently he was very good, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1452.96s)]
*  a very good student of it, very annoying and irritating to everybody he worked with [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1457.76s)]
*  at Washington University. But what if he really did do that? What if somehow he had access to [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1462.48s)]
*  somebody's blood? I don't know how he would have gotten it, but there is some speculation this may [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1468.8s)]
*  not have been his first crime. If this was his crime, it was so meticulous and well handled. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1472.48s)]
*  Perhaps this wasn't his first rodeo. And what if that really was like an homage almost, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1477.12s)]
*  the two gloves, reasonable doubt? Right. And it would have worked. And the police to this [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1483.9199999999998s)]
*  day can't identify whose blood that was. And again, if he hadn't left the knife sheath there, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1491.36s)]
*  I don't think they would have been able to ever get to him. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1497.44s)]
*  My God, such a colossal error on his part. I know this is a weird place to go, but I'd give anything [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1501.1200000000001s)]
*  to have been there when he realized he forgot it. To see the look come over his face when he realized [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  his perfect crime had been foiled by him. Losing something as basic as the knife sheath, as [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1517.68s)]
*  incriminating as the knife sheath, and then just praying to God that all the times he handled it [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1525.04s)]
*  with gloves on protected him from fingerprints or anything that would tie him to it. And yet he [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1530.3999999999999s)]
*  wasn't careful enough. And yet if his lawyers can get the evidence on the knife sheath thrown out [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1536.08s)]
*  because of FBI overzealousness, it would in turn the whole case upside down and an innocent man [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1543.76s)]
*  could be found. I mean, a guilty man could be found not innocent, but not guilty. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1554.0s)]
*  RISA GOLUBOFF Not guilty. All right. Now we have to talk about the eyewitness, but before we do, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1559.28s)]
*  I want to say this. This is the first time I really thought about the DNA now that they've [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1562.96s)]
*  been caught, right? The FBI, they shouldn't have used those private company databases. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1568.88s)]
*  They did. They're obviously much bigger because a lot more people would [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1574.64s)]
*  give their DNA if they knew it was going to stay private and not be available to law enforcement. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1578.32s)]
*  So they did. And that's how they found Brian Kohlberger's dad. To me, there's actually no [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1582.64s)]
*  chance of the judge suppressing the genetic genealogy, the touch DNA or anything because [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1588.5600000000002s)]
*  of that because that is a violation of the terms of service. I assume it's ancestry DNA and 23andme. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1594.88s)]
*  I don't know, but I- It's my heritage. It's my heritage DNA. That was the one site that was [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1601.44s)]
*  cited in court. RISA GOLUBOFF Okay. So that's a violation of the terms of service of that company. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1606.8s)]
*  That company has rules that law enforcement's not supposed to go on there. But I don't think [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1614.08s)]
*  there's a law saying you've broken the law as a cop if you go on there. It's just like the cop [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1619.9199999999998s)]
*  violated a term of service of a private company. So that's between the cop and the company. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1625.68s)]
*  Maybe the cop, the police department gets sued over that. But I don't see how that helps the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1632.96s)]
*  defendant whose DNA was uploaded. I agree with you. I think they're just trying to create as [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1638.6399999999999s)]
*  many arguments as they can to force the defense, trying to force the issue. I do think Kohlberger's [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1646.0s)]
*  relatives, if they wanted to, could sue the police department, the FBI who did this. I think the FBI [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1652.3999999999999s)]
*  agents who did this could be reprimanded by the justice department. Those things could happen, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1659.52s)]
*  but I don't think it will affect Kohlberger's case. But again, I was totally surprised that the judge [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1665.28s)]
*  left open the possibility of a Frank's hearing. And if this happens, if there is a Frank's hearing, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1671.76s)]
*  then it's potentially a whole new ballgame. RISA GOLUBOFF So interesting. Okay. Let's get to Dylan [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1677.2s)]
*  Mortenson, right? Who is the eyewitness. He went in in the middle of the night. He killed four [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1683.12s)]
*  roommates, but there was one roommate. There's another roommate who wasn't there. And there was [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1691.84s)]
*  this roommate, Dylan, shown here. And she is what they called an eyewitness in the affidavit. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1696.7199999999998s)]
*  She said she saw a man of medium build with bushy eyebrows wearing like a COVID mask [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1702.8799999999999s)]
*  that they made eye contact with one another. She was frozen in a frozen shock phase. And he went [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1710.48s)]
*  by her. She went back into her room. She locked the door. She stayed in her room until almost [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1716.6399999999999s)]
*  noon the next day as her roommates were bleeding to death. No one can understand the decision making, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1722.08s)]
*  but no one's been in such a situation. I don't understand what happened with Dylan. No one does. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1728.24s)]
*  But talk about like your witness collapsing. She may not even be able to give the prosecution [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1733.2s)]
*  what I just said. Exactly. What happened was what you related with happened in the first interview [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1741.44s)]
*  the police had with Dylan over that week. And the next week that followed, there were three more [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1748.96s)]
*  interviews. Those three interviews, she seemed to change her story. She said that perhaps it was [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1756.0800000000002s)]
*  sort of a dream she was seeing. She couldn't be sure. Then she said that one of the victims had [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1762.64s)]
*  gone down the stairs and that wasn't possible because the victim had died in her bed. And then [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1768.8000000000002s)]
*  she admitted finally that she was just too drunk. Too drunk was the words that Ann Taylor used [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1775.0400000000002s)]
*  to come to any reasonable consideration of what happened that night. And then finally, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1781.76s)]
*  on the fourth interview, just before they were going to arrest Coburger in Pennsylvania, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1789.44s)]
*  the Idaho cops showed her a picture of Coburger and asked, can you identify him? And she said, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1795.28s)]
*  no, I can't. And that really weakens her use as a witness between being too drunk, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1802.48s)]
*  between saying that she might have been dreaming the whole thing and then not being able to identify [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1811.44s)]
*  the photograph. Well, the prosecution's big witness, I don't know even if she'll testify [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1817.6s)]
*  at the trial. I don't know if she will either. And that may have been the point of her changing [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  her testimony. Picture a scenario in which she's just too terrified to sit in a courtroom across [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1829.6s)]
*  from this guy and also in front of the public, which, I mean, she didn't have anything to do [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1834.8799999999999s)]
*  with these crimes. It's just, there's a fair amount of what kind of a person would go back [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1840.32s)]
*  into their room and not call 911 after she's saying she's so afraid of this person she went [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1844.8s)]
*  into shock. It's just hard to understand. I'm not trying to be unforgiving to her, but maybe that's [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1852.0s)]
*  what's happening. I don't want to, you know, pun her character. I mean, who knows what's going on [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1857.44s)]
*  in anyone's mind? But not only does she not call the police for eight hours, the first people she [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1861.76s)]
*  calls are not an ambulance, not the police, but she calls fraternity people to come and come to [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1867.44s)]
*  the house. They come and they call the police. And they are the ones we believe now, Howard, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1873.92s)]
*  who found the bodies. Yes. There's a new video that's just was released last week and you can [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1880.3200000000002s)]
*  see Ethan's twin brother, there actually were triplets, sitting outside the house the moment [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1888.0800000000002s)]
*  when the police arrived and he's wearing a pink sweatshirt sitting by a dumpster with his head in [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1893.76s)]
*  his hands. It's a very poignant video. Wow. So she, cause that was always one of the big mysteries [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1898.96s)]
*  that it was somebody else. It wasn't Dylan who called 911 when ultimately the authorities were [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1905.44s)]
*  called and we didn't know who it was. But now we believe it was the fraternity brothers who she [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1910.72s)]
*  called to come over to the house. Yes. The fraternity brother, the actual fraternity brother who made [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1915.44s)]
*  the call was Ethan's best friend. And the police had never released that, that 911 call. I imagine [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1920.16s)]
*  it will be played at the trial. That is unbelievable. So she is saying she doesn't know if she actually [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1928.96s)]
*  saw him or if it was her mind playing with her. She conceded that she had a lot to drink and was [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1937.1200000000001s)]
*  too inebriated to remember anything that happened that night with any authority. And when they showed [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1943.68s)]
*  her a photo of Kohlberger after the fact, she failed to identify him as the intruder she had seen. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1949.44s)]
*  These are terrible facts. Not a very good witness. No, no, she's not going to be helpful at all. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1955.04s)]
*  And it's unfortunate there. Case doesn't rise or fall on her, but boy, you'd much rather have her [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1963.44s)]
*  say, I'll never forget those bushy eyebrows. And if I see those eyes again, I'll know them [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1970.16s)]
*  and then say, there they are right there at defense table. Right. And what's making all these [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1975.44s)]
*  doubts about the case have even more weight. There's a bill that's just been introduced in [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1983.52s)]
*  the Idaho legislature. It was at the beginning of January where right now the death penalty [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1989.04s)]
*  is administered through a chemical injection. And then if the chemicals aren't available, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=1996.48s)]
*  then there is a firing squad. Well, the Idaho legislature new bill wants to get rid of the [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2000.8799999999999s)]
*  chemical injections and just make it a firing squad. Wow. They want to, they are demanding [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2006.56s)]
*  their pound of flesh in a sense. And that's going to weigh on the jury too, I think. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2012.8s)]
*  Wow. I don't know. I'm fine with the death penalty. I really am. Like O'Reilly always [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2022.0s)]
*  used to say he was against it because he thought it was too easy on the defendant. He wanted them [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  to suffer in prison. I just feel like if Brian Kohlberger committed these crimes, he killed these [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2032.0s)]
*  four young, beautiful people in the prime of their lives, I'd have absolutely no qualms at all seeing [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2036.6399999999999s)]
*  him shot down by a firing squad. I might actually celebrate it. Well, you might be able to get on [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2041.92s)]
*  the jury then. Well, maybe I'll at least go out there. I don't know. I just feel like I have no [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2047.1200000000001s)]
*  empathy for a person like that. Again, it's not totally consistent with my Catholic faith, but [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2052.32s)]
*  it's just how I genuinely feel. I just feel like those people shouldn't be allowed to roam the [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2056.96s)]
*  earth any longer, but I have to be honest. I don't like the fact that all the supporting evidence is [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2060.64s)]
*  falling apart. When we talk about how the Cheek Swab matched Brian Kohlberger, what we're saying [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2066.32s)]
*  is the Cheek Swab, Brian Kohlberger's DNA was definitely on the knife sheath. That's what that [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2073.44s)]
*  proves. It was his DNA on the knife sheath, but let's be honest. All that really proves is that [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2080.2400000000002s)]
*  he touched that knife sheath at some point. It does not prove murder. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2087.1200000000003s)]
*  Exactly. Anne Taylor's big question and which her defense is all going to be based around is, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2092.16s)]
*  how did the knife sheath get in that bedroom? Who could have put it there? It wasn't Brian Kohlberger. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2098.56s)]
*  Right. If the car evidence is falling apart, it's true that you can never see the driver [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2105.84s)]
*  nor the license plate. You can't see the license plate in any of these videos. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2114.24s)]
*  You can't see the license plate. You can't see the driver. It took the FBI three shots until they [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2117.8399999999997s)]
*  were able to identify the car. Anne Taylor is going to argue it took the FBI three times. Maybe [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2123.52s)]
*  it should have taken them four times and they would have finally gotten it right. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2131.2s)]
*  Then the cell phone hits. They're helpful, but they're not ball game. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2135.68s)]
*  But without a motive, without a connection, go ahead. What are you going to say? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2142.24s)]
*  The cell phone hits are 10 miles in a town like Moscow. You could be in the other side of town [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2146.7200000000003s)]
*  seeing someone. That's what Anne Taylor said at the hearing. Did the prosecution push back on that [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2152.96s)]
*  at all? Because I've definitely heard prosecutors argue, no, they can be more specific than that. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2158.1600000000003s)]
*  What was so interesting to me at the hearing, the prosecution didn't [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2163.1200000000003s)]
*  really argue any of her points. When she said it was an outright lie, that was her words, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2167.76s)]
*  outright lie, that he had stalked any of the victims, they didn't argue. They went along [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2174.0s)]
*  with that. That there was no blood evidence, they didn't argue. There were no dog hairs [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2179.12s)]
*  found anywhere on Kohlberger. They didn't argue. They seemed to be conceding all these points [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2184.0s)]
*  except for the DNA evidence. That's not good enough. That's not good enough because it'd be [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2189.44s)]
*  one thing if his blood were at the scene and that was a match to the Chic Squad. What we're saying [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2194.08s)]
*  the Chic Squad matched was that one piece of touch DNA on the knife sheath, which I realize [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2200.88s)]
*  is a good fact for the prosecution, but it's not ball game. Maybe he somehow touched the knife at [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2206.8s)]
*  a friend's house. Maybe he touched it in a store. I know he purchased a knife on Amazon that appears [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2211.76s)]
*  to have been a K-Bar knife, but maybe somebody stole that knife from him. There's a lot of loops [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2216.7200000000003s)]
*  the prosecution is going to have to close. You're a good lawyer. You're raising all the [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2221.6s)]
*  right questions. Now that unknown male blood has been found in the house, that raises the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2225.36s)]
*  possibility of accomplices, other people there on the murder night because it's not fingerprints [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2231.1200000000003s)]
*  that were found. It's blood. Would you leave blood at a party? I don't know. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2236.48s)]
*  But back to my favorite piece of evidence, the fact that he was shoving his garbage into little [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2242.08s)]
*  baggies for disposal in the neighbor's trash. The cops had already realized he was disposing of his [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2249.84s)]
*  trash in the neighbor's. The night the FBI raided his parents' home in the Poconos back home in [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2254.64s)]
*  Pennsylvania when he went on winter break is just absolutely devastating. Though I will acknowledge, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2258.64s)]
*  it is possible a crafty defense attorney will find some willing family member or someone to say [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2265.68s)]
*  there was a reason for that. He's got OCD. He always did this. He'd done it for years. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2272.56s)]
*  We didn't know why. I don't know why. If he had to put his things in Ziploc baggies, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2279.3599999999997s)]
*  he couldn't have put it out in his own trash, had to go in the neighbor's trash. But that's [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2283.92s)]
*  a terrible fact for the defense. Well, the defense is going to try to get around that in one way, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2287.6800000000003s)]
*  is that Coburger's family, parents lived in a sort of gated community, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2293.52s)]
*  and they had a garbage service. The FBI and the Pennsylvania State Police got Coburger's garbage [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  from this garbage company. The defense is going to claim they did not have a valid search warrant, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2309.04s)]
*  a valid warrant to get this garbage from the private carting company. I don't know if that's [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2316.4s)]
*  going to hold up in court, but that's the argument they're going to raise. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2323.44s)]
*  So the best case scenario there would be they exclude the fact that they found the Coburger's [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2326.96s)]
*  trash in the neighbor's trash bin, but it would not exclude them finding him shoving his trash [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2330.7200000000003s)]
*  into individual Ziploc baggies at the moment of the arrest in the middle of the night. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2338.08s)]
*  That sounds like a criminal with something to hide, not an honest criminology student who's been [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2343.52s)]
*  wrongly accused. I agree, but at the same time, he's a very strange young man. He has visual snow. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2350.72s)]
*  He was a heroin addict. He has strange practices. He goes off at four in the morning to look at [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2358.64s)]
*  stars in a wilderness park on a foggy night. Would he put his garbage into separate bags? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2364.24s)]
*  Who knows? Oh my God. Howard's just giving us a preview of how this is going to sound, a trial. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2370.16s)]
*  It's going to be a very interesting trial. Even the jury selection is going to be interesting. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2376.08s)]
*  And they're going to, like, this is a good preview because Ann Taylor is going to pick apart [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2381.52s)]
*  every piece of the prosecution's case, like every piece. Nothing will be allowed without [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2385.9199999999996s)]
*  objection, without a counter narrative. And all she needs is one juror. She just needs one to say, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2391.12s)]
*  I don't have total confidence. I have reasonable doubt. And in a murder case, you really got to [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2398.24s)]
*  be sure if you're sending someone off either for a lethal injection or a firing squad, you want to [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2403.52s)]
*  make sure beyond the shadow of a doubt that you're doing the right thing. Oh my God, this makes me [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2408.4s)]
*  feel sick. I have like acid in my stomach from this discussion. I just, I wish they had more. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2413.6s)]
*  I know, no, it was an important hearing. You learned a ton. We corresponded privately. I was [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2419.12s)]
*  like, oh my God. Well, we've all been paying attention to Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2423.92s)]
*  Stuff's really been happening in this very important case that, I mean, truly this is, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2428.64s)]
*  we laugh because it's like now it's easier to just talk about the legalities of it. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2432.8s)]
*  But these four beautiful college students, and once again, they are Madison Mogan, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2436.56s)]
*  Kayleigh Goncalves, Xana Cronodal, and Ethan Chapin, murdered right in the prime of their life, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2441.04s)]
*  November, 2022. And their families deserve justice and they deserved it before this August. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2446.56s)]
*  It's been too long. Did they talk at all about moving the trial date or do we think it's on for [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2452.32s)]
*  August? Well, they're trying, I think it will take place. I don't think this judge is going [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2456.32s)]
*  to delay any longer, but the defense is still asking for more time. We'll see if he grants it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2461.2s)]
*  I don't believe he will, but I was surprised he raised the possibility of a franks hearing. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2466.7999999999997s)]
*  That shocked me. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2473.2s)]
*  Yep. The families deserve just let's have a trial. There's nothing that's going to be gained by a [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2474.56s)]
*  delay by the defense or the prosecution, frankly. Howard, you're the best. Thank you so much for [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2480.0s)]
*  your great. Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Unless they can find these two unknown males whose blood was [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2485.04s)]
*  left in the house. If they can find those two people, that would change everything. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2491.04s)]

*  up the phone and get back to them. They can help get your balances reduced, your interest rates [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2555.84s)]
*  slashed. Wouldn't that be nice? Instead of paying 25% interest on those credit cards. And the [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi4HFOiWXzg&t=2560.96s)]
