# Reality of Trump’s Tariff Policies, Pope Francis' Legacy, and Lockdown Lies, w/ O’Leary and Zweig
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Monday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=0.0s)]
*  We begin today with news from the Vatican Pope Francis dead at age 88 [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4.12s)]
*  It's kind of shocking to wake up to even though we knew he was not in good health. He had had double pneumonia [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=10.24s)]
*  And been hospitalized for some five weeks in mid-february. I mean we we knew [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=16.32s)]
*  we knew he wasn't doing that well, but [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=22.12s)]
*  it seemed like he was past the worst of it and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=24.72s)]
*  Maybe was getting a little better or at least on the road toward getting a little better and then Cardinal Kevin Farrell [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=28.32s)]
*  Somberly came out this morning and stated at 7 35 this morning the bishop of Rome Francis returned to the house of the father [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=36.24s)]
*  There's no official cause of death [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=45.36s)]
*  released as of now [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=47.64s)]
*  But as I said, he's been suffering from these chronic lung issues and then beginning in February [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=48.6s)]
*  He was in the hospital for some 38 days with these respiratory issues [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=53.42s)]
*  Amazingly, you've seen this maybe by now [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=57.7s)]
*  Yesterday just yesterday he appeared [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  In in his wheelchair in like the back of the Pope mobile, I don't know what that is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=64.82000000000001s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure the vehicle [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=72.06s)]
*  On Easter Sunday. Look at that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=74.38s)]
*  It's kind of amazing in st [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=77.38s)]
*  Peter's Square and and one of the last people to meet with Pope Francis was vice president JD Vance [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  Pretty incredibly the vice president had a brief meeting with the pontiff yesterday [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=86.4s)]
*  Where the pair exchanged Easter greetings and gifts mr. Vance telling Pope Francis he prays for him daily watch [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  I know you've not been feeling great, but it's good to see you [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  Wow pretty extraordinary [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=110.56s)]
*  This Pope was elected Pope in March of 2013 after the shock resignation of Pope Benedict [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=113.56s)]
*  No, no Pope's resign. They just don't do it [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=120.36s)]
*  The first Pope Benedict, sorry, no Francis from Latin America first ever. Can you believe that given how Catholic Latin America is? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=124.36s)]
*  he was our first Pope from there and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Pope Francis immediately jolted energy and enthusiasm into the church. He was a Jesuit [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=134.44s)]
*  He was a little bit more progressive and this got a lot of people excited [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=140.36s)]
*  The many people thought the church had gone too hardcore though. We stood by some traditional [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Things like an all-male papacy and celibacy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=151.28s)]
*  Among other things the church's stance on abortion which people are kidding themselves if they want the Catholic Church to amend [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  But this is what we hear from young progressives within the Catholic Church. Okay. Good luck with that. Maybe we could get [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, I guess you can still have priests who come to the church married like you can become a priest after having been married [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  That is at least and having like children, but you cannot enter the priesthood and they get married. That's just anyway [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=175.28s)]
*  Here's a Pope Francis his first appearance as Pope on the balcony of the Vatican [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=181.6s)]
*  Wow [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=197.32s)]
*  It's always a sight to behold right he was born Jorge Mareo [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=207.6s)]
*  Bergoglio in Buenos Aires where his mother hoped he would become a doctor [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=212.76s)]
*  But just before his 17th birthday [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=217.32s)]
*  He paused in front of the Basilica of st. Joseph and later recounted [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=219.64s)]
*  He quote felt like someone grabbed me from the inside and took him into the confessional [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=224.26s)]
*  Right there. He said I knew I had to be a priest his mother evidently was upset [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  He would not become a doctor, but he said quote. I'm gonna study the medicine of the soul [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  Can you imagine and then he went on to become the Pope? It's incredible [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  Pope Francis moved the church in a leftward direction. No question and away from [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  Some of the more divisive issues within the church as I mentioned he did not focus that much on abortion [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=249.54s)]
*  But he didn't change the stance [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=255.85999999999999s)]
*  homosexuality [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=258.42s)]
*  Shifting its emphasis to global problems like climate change poverty and he was very big on migration [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  He clashed with President Trump over Trump's immigration policy saying before the 16 election that a person who thinks only about building walls and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=266.98s)]
*  Not of building bridges is not Christian [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=274.94s)]
*  That's this is why he was controversial amongst in particular a lot of Christians here in America who tend to be more [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=278.26s)]
*  Conservative the Trump campaign responded by pointing out that the Vatican is surrounded by walls [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=286.17999999999995s)]
*  We saw that exact thing happened a couple of weeks ago [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=290.78s)]
*  Or once again, he was ripping on Trump's policies when it comes to immigration [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=293.46s)]
*  And once again, we had Tom Homan coming out and saying my response is a lifelong Catholic to this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=297.26s)]
*  Pope is that the Vatican has walls. Why is that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=302.44s)]
*  Ahead of the 2024 election the Pope declined to say whether people should vote for Trump or Harris [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=305.88s)]
*  Merely urging people to choose the lesser evil according to their conscience [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  But in a letter to US bishops in February Pope Francis wrote that mass deportation quote damages the dignity of many men and women [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=315.48s)]
*  And of entire families and places them in a state of particular particular vulnerability and defenselessness unquote [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=323.0s)]
*  Now look this is the problem [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=330.48s)]
*  because not only is that the church's official stance, but the church has been [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=333.0s)]
*  Participating in getting immigrants here and then finding them housing and helping them stay here [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=339.12s)]
*  Irrespective the fact that they're here illegally and Pope Francis didn't have to deal with that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=345.12s)]
*  You know and it's caused a lot of us in the Catholic Church to wonder what exactly we're donating toward on Sunday. It really does [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=349.88s)]
*  It's one thing if you want to help support [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=357.76s)]
*  Your priests make sure that they're well taken care of make sure your church is well taken care of make sure [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=360.2s)]
*  It's got flowers on the altar for Easter mass, but funding illegals coming into the country. They're all they're not all [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=365.4s)]
*  upstanding Catholics and [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=373.88s)]
*  You know a lot of us who are Catholic [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=375.92s)]
*  but lean right [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=378.76s)]
*  felt this tug of war going on between the Pope's messaging and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=380.76s)]
*  What he wanted us to believe were you know deep Catholic teachings and what we understand as Americans who are watching our citizens [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=384.76s)]
*  Murdered in the streets by these people to be true [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=393.4s)]
*  Anyway it look it's on a day like this you pay you you pray you pray for the loss of the Pope and for a very obviously [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=398.59999999999997s)]
*  Holy man who was the leader of the Catholic Church who had enormous challenges on him and pressures on him and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=404.76s)]
*  You know the church is very political too, especially at the top. It's just such a really interesting organization and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=412.12s)]
*  Then also you look at the messaging and you try to understand [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  How he could so misunderstand somebody who is our leader here our political leader here and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=425.0s)]
*  The reason President Trump is so devoted to getting rid of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=431.64s)]
*  These people who Pope Francis just looked at as vulnerable and defenseless [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=436.44s)]
*  Well, you know who is vulnerable and defenseless Lake and Riley [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=439.92s)]
*  you know, it's like I [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=443.24s)]
*  Wish I could have gotten to talk to the pontiff about it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=445.72s)]
*  I really do wish I could have had an interview with him where we talked about things like that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=447.92s)]
*  I'm sure he would have had nothing but empathy for those killed by these illegals [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  But that's the problem in part with you know, the Catholic Church and its approach toward this issue [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=455.72s)]
*  No, no church is gonna satisfy its constituents across the board. This one didn't [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=462.36s)]
*  Pope Francis [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=467.48s)]
*  Didn't Pope Francis didn't but unquestionably a good decent honorable, holy [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  loving man and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=474.8s)]
*  President Trump for his part was very gracious in the wake of the news today posting on true social rest in peace Pope Francis [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=476.68s)]
*  May God bless him and all who loved him [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=482.68s)]
*  Now a public viewing for Pope Francis could take place as early as Wednesday and then a conclave [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=485.64000000000004s)]
*  This is such a big deal whenever this happens [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if for our younger viewers you may not have seen it [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=494.3s)]
*  But I will never forget when we were on the air at Fox and Shepard Smith said that [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=496.44s)]
*  He said he said the Pope had died when the Pope hadn't died. That was it [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=503.84s)]
*  I guess I will forget because my details are pause somewhat fuzzy [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=507.88s)]
*  But we were waiting it was like the Pope was sick and we were waiting to see if he had died [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=511.28s)]
*  Anyway, he got that wrong and it turned out to be a big turned out to be a huge deal [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=517.16s)]
*  We covered these things at Fox News [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=521.88s)]
*  Like they were presidential elections and so they're gonna go through this process now the conclave where they choose his successor the 120 [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=524.3s)]
*  Cardinals will gather they say this typically begins between 15 and 20 days after the papal office becomes vacant [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=531.4s)]
*  So call it two weeks from now or thereabouts we can expect [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=538.0s)]
*  to see [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=542.84s)]
*  That they had actually have a good write-up today in the Daily Mail about it [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=544.2s)]
*  120 Cardinals behind closed doors if you saw the movie conclave, you know where the Pope turns out to be [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=548.52s)]
*  intersex [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=556.24s)]
*  spoiler alert [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=557.6s)]
*  And you have seen a refresher [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=559.04s)]
*  But this article pointing out some differences in real life you will not have [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=563.4s)]

*  Anybody who did that would face ex communication for that offense [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=576.16s)]
*  You're not allowed to talk to the outside world while the Cardinals are in the conclave [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=579.9s)]

*  Nor they say would a dead Pope ever be allowed to be swarmed over by priests nuns and officials nor laid out in his pajamas [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=590.52s)]
*  They say in the real world [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  The Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church declares a pope to be dead in the presence of the papal master of ceremonies [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=599.5999999999999s)]
*  And a handful of other members of the papal household nine days of mourning are then declared in which the body of the late Pope [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=605.7199999999999s)]

*  it will be at least 15 days before the conclave and [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=615.28s)]
*  Then the Cardinals though are no longer physically locked in a building until they've made their decision [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  But they will stay at a guest house within the Vatican's walls known as st [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=625.14s)]
*  Martha's house where they'll have the services of cooks and housekeepers plus two doctors one of whom is a surgeon [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=629.62s)]
*  you know many of these are old guys and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=636.16s)]
*  Then they will walk daily in their blue cassocks and red sashes to the papal palace or the Sistine Chapel [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=638.68s)]
*  Where the voting will actually take place. They will not be allowed to read newspapers. It's like being a sequester jury [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=644.64s)]

*  No decision has been made [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=699.08s)]
*  Good luck to them. This is a big decision [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=702.84s)]
*  We've never had an American Pope, but I'm voting for Cardinal Dolan. I hope they get behind him [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=705.52s)]
*  It'd be great to have we had one from the Americas this Pope Latin America. We haven't had an American would be amazing if we did and [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=710.0s)]
*  Cardinal Dolan is just the best man you could ever hope for for the job an inspirational leader [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=719.52s)]
*  Brilliant [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=727.04s)]
*  It's just I mean all the knowledge you could ever want in a church leader and a man of the people somebody who can inspire [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=728.32s)]
*  Working class and elites alike somebody who knows how to talk to people in a language they can understand [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=736.32s)]
*  And just an all-around dear man [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=741.16s)]
*  He's you know, we've got Catholic radio on Sirius XM. He does a show [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=743.72s)]
*  Every Christmas he has one I was on it a couple years ago [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=748.62s)]
*  Wouldn't it be amazing if we had a pope who had a serious XM radio show? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=752.0600000000001s)]
*  Be fantastic for serious they'd be so psyched [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=758.62s)]
*  In any event prayers [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=762.86s)]
*  With all of the men who will make this new decision and with the one who becomes the next pontiff it's a big responsibility [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=765.82s)]
*  On the subject of illegal immigration, I'm gonna bring in my guest in a minute, but I just want to start with this [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=773.34s)]
*  What an incredibly frustrating series of events that we have been through legally [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=778.82s)]
*  over the past six weeks since Trump started implementing his reforms and [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=783.5400000000001s)]
*  The ACLU became his co-president in [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=789.58s)]
*  Batting them down one by one. It's it is one step forward two steps backward [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=794.1s)]
*  For the Trump administration when it comes to fulfilling the people's wishes to deport not a few [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=798.94s)]
*  not some but all [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  all of the illegal immigrants in the United States right now [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=810.62s)]
*  That's what the people want Harry Enton took this on late last week on CNN [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  You know their data guy. Let me just show you the numbers. Okay, look look at soft 15 [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=821.5200000000001s)]
*  Deport all undocumented immigrants voters favoring the government trying to deport all [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=828.3000000000001s)]
*  11 million of them back in 2016 just 38 percent of voters wanted the government to try to deport all [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=834.0600000000001s)]
*  11 million undocumented immigrants compared to where we are in 2025 [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=841.34s)]
*  56 percent the majority the American people have come a long way on this issue much closer to Donald Trump [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=846.5400000000001s)]
*  And I think that's a big part of the reason why [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=852.6600000000001s)]
*  Americans are increasingly saying the country is on the right track when it comes to immigration policy and why Donald Trump's net approval rating on [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=854.98s)]
*  That issue is in the positive [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=860.7s)]
*  Okay, so it's a clear majority who want all of them gone all of them not just the ones who committed additional crimes [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=864.5400000000001s)]
*  But all of them [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=871.26s)]
*  They want all illegal immigrants in the United States to be deported now that number [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=872.9000000000001s)]
*  How many is that it was said in 2020 or so to be about 10 million between 10 and 11 million [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=877.5600000000001s)]
*  That was 2020 when Trump left office [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=882.72s)]
*  How many have come in in the four years since you go to the Center for Migration Studies? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=885.5s)]
*  They'll say it's only 1.7 million it were added so that we're only up to 11.7 million bull shit [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=890.9399999999999s)]
*  bull that's [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=898.86s)]
*  That grossly underestimates the millions who swarmed into this country under Biden. He was letting in [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=900.9s)]
*  300,000 a month [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=907.86s)]
*  300,000 a month people [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=910.5s)]
*  It's estimated by House Republicans and Customs and Border Patrol [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=912.9s)]
*  Which is in a position to know to be closer to 8 million under Joe Biden 8 [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=918.54s)]
*  Okay, 10 in 2020 plus 8 under Joe Biden gives us almost 20 million 18 million [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=924.94s)]
*  total in the country [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=932.1s)]
*  illegals [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=934.26s)]
*  You don't think that has an effect on the American economy [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=935.26s)]
*  So Trump's got to get rid of 18 million people. That's what a clear majority of Americans want 18 million [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=939.34s)]
*  How are we doing? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=946.9599999999999s)]
*  You've seen Tom Homan out there doing his level best [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=948.12s)]
*  Ice is out there doing their level best and they're doing humans work at the southern border [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=950.92s)]
*  The trickle back into the country has been stopped. It's all been stopped [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=954.7199999999999s)]
*  It's been stopped as much as you can stop without having an airtight wall, which he's also said he's going to work on [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=959.0799999999999s)]
*  But in any event, they're doing a great job now stopping the flow [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=965.12s)]
*  But how are we doing on the deportations on the removals of those already here? Well in February? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=967.52s)]
*  for the month of February [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=973.8399999999999s)]
*  Trump deported just over 11,000 [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=976.32s)]
*  You you've never had an administration more devoted to rounding them up and shipping them out [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=979.84s)]
*  He is doing everything within his power. He has [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=985.24s)]
*  expanded his right of [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=988.8000000000001s)]
*  Rights of removal when you encounter somebody at the border like immediate removal [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=991.48s)]
*  He's expanded that to basically cover the all of the United States. He's using the alien enemies act [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=995.5600000000001s)]
*  He as you know has been getting hit by the courts left and right for not providing these people enough due process and [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1001.26s)]
*  Even with Trump's you could call it, you know cut corners [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
*  He's only gotten 11,000 out in February. I haven't seen the March numbers, but you can assume it's around there [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1012.9000000000001s)]
*  So let's let's say it's double if you add March in there [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1018.5s)]
*  So let's say it's 22,000 that we've got now, but I think it's slowed down in in March [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1021.26s)]
*  All these sanctuary cities trying not to work with Tom Homan [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1026.24s)]
*  You've got these whistleblowers calling up the illegals saying Homan's coming. We saw some of that and [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1029.76s)]
*  Keep in mind Tom Homan said that they were gonna start with the worst first and that means those who have committed additional crimes beyond [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1035.6s)]
*  illegal entry or overstaying their visa [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1041.68s)]
*  Well, how many of those are there out of that call it 18 million? I stole Congress last year [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1044.72s)]
*  It was about not quite half a million four hundred and thirty five thousand illegals who have committed [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1050.0s)]
*  Criminal convictions who are not yet in US custody [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1056.04s)]
*  Alright, so we're starting with the worst of the worst worst first [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1059.36s)]
*  435,000 here illegally and maybe this since Trump took off as we've got now what let's call it 22 25,000 [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1063.84s)]
*  You round up for the couple of weeks of January and April that we have going here. Let's let's just call it 25,000 [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1070.36s)]
*  That doesn't even get us down to 400 hundred thousand of the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1077.56s)]
*  Illegals who are still running around who have also committed crimes and you haven't even cracked a million of the 18 million [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1081.64s)]
*  This is not a rip on Trump. He's trying Tom Homan is trying [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1087.4s)]
*  Tom Homan's jumping up and down saying I need more money because I don't have the resources to do this and on top of that [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1091.44s)]
*  I don't have the facilities to store them even though even the numbers he's getting there's no place to put them [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1096.4s)]
*  Just just today we have this long article about how now the ACLU is complaining that the ice facilities aren't nice enough [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1102.1200000000001s)]
*  That there's some some female migrants are having to sleep on maps mats on concrete floors [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1108.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay, they're complaining that some of the lunch tables don't have enough have enough seats. I mean really [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1114.1999999999998s)]
*  Then get them out go home. You know where they have seats and mattresses back in your home countries get out [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1120.84s)]
*  Okay, but it's all on us it's all on Trump it's all on Tom Homan [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1127.9599999999998s)]
*  It's all on them to find them all overcome the sanctuary city's objections [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1132.36s)]
*  Overcome these mayors who are undermining them overcome the whistleblowers [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1137.16s)]
*  Whatever you call them the leakers who are telling illegal groups when homans groups are coming and now biggest and most importantly [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1141.08s)]
*  overcome the ACLU [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1148.76s)]
*  Which at every turn is going into court and challenging the deportations saying you can't expand expedited removal [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1150.36s)]
*  You can't use the alien enemies act and they just had a huge victory [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1157.08s)]
*  Sorry [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1161.88s)]

*  Stopped him from deporting people under the alien enemies act [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1177.22s)]
*  And buses that were seen leaving the ice detention centers said to be full of venice wailings [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1182.44s)]
*  Had to stop and turn around and put them back in there [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1190.3600000000001s)]

*  And now you've got these courts saying [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1199.48s)]
*  They want due process that looks like it's going to be akin to the due process you get when you're charged criminally [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1201.64s)]
*  How much due process do we have to give each one of these people individually individually? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1207.3200000000002s)]
*  we [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1212.92s)]
*  No due process afforded american citizens as 18 million of them came in [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1213.88s)]
*  As some half a million committed crimes against us stealing from us raping our women [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1218.6000000000001s)]
*  Murdering us along with our children child molestation [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1225.16s)]
*  Did they have due process did the american people have any due process at all? No [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1228.92s)]
*  Now for each one [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1232.8400000000001s)]
*  We have to have due process before we deport them [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1234.92s)]
*  to el salvador or anywhere else and it's starting to look like [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1238.68s)]
*  Just a peppercorn will not be enough to steal a phrase from another area of law consideration [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1243.72s)]
*  it's starting to look like [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1249.48s)]
*  We're actually really going to have to [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1251.64s)]
*  Provide hearings in each case allow these people they're upset their notices that they could challenge it weren't in english [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1253.96s)]

*  I want to talk about the frustration of this scenario as i've just laid it out and and what? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1412.5200000000002s)]
*  How we're ever supposed to get ahead [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1418.92s)]
*  on any of this, you know when the the beat down against everything they try to do is [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1421.48s)]
*  Constant and there are so many enabling judges who will work with the aclu [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1427.46s)]
*  Same as enabling media who will work with his left-wing critics on the tariffs, which I know you defended him on it's just at every turn [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1432.0400000000002s)]
*  These same establishment types that got us into this mess are doing their level best to keep us there [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1439.72s)]
*  New process that's what everybody calls it [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1447.0800000000002s)]
*  I think the bigger picture though is to go back to the mandate that came out of the election and that data [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1451.16s)]
*  That she pointed to earlier 56 of people want this issue dealt with it's one of the reasons that trump got his second term [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1457.32s)]
*  Was illegal immigration and so [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1464.1999999999998s)]
*  I anticipate this will twist and turn through the courts [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1467.08s)]
*  Some good decisions will be made some bad. It depends which side of the equation you're on [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1471.72s)]
*  i've come to the realization now as I deal with all kinds of issues around the administration that [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1475.8799999999999s)]
*  50 of the people I deal with [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1482.34s)]
*  Internationally to have what I call or has been termed trump derangement syndrome and [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1484.9599999999998s)]
*  What I mean by this is it's kind of useless to litigate [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1491.9399999999998s)]
*  Why he's back in the white house as I point out to people saying look [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1496.5s)]
*  I don't show for politicians trump included. I show for policy [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1501.1399999999999s)]
*  And I have to deal with the policy. So why do we have to keep? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1505.62s)]
*  Reiterating why trump's in office? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1510.42s)]
*  I don't care at this point because he is and now we deal with the outcome now we deal with the policy [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1512.66s)]
*  Now we deal with the environment we're in and we want to move forward particularly for me as an investor [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1518.82s)]
*  I care about the policy coming out of the white house. So tariffs is a big deal for me [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1525.7s)]
*  Obviously, I invest internationally and so the narrative I want to have [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1529.68s)]
*  In in foreign countries is look forget about trump. He's not leaving the white house [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1534.42s)]
*  He's going to finish off his second term get over it. Let's deal with the policy [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1538.5s)]
*  That's how I look at it and that tends to be working. It's almost like I have to bring psychiatrists with me [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1542.3400000000001s)]
*  People really get crazy with the trump stuff [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1548.18s)]
*  You know [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1552.26s)]
*  If if the shoe were on the other foot, you know and the trump administration or or trump's supporters were using [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1554.1000000000001s)]
*  Lawfare to stop the joe biden agenda on green energy at every turn [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1561.76s)]
*  We'd be getting all these discussions about how if the supreme court gave them a decision trump [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1567.3s)]
*  They're illegitimate [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1572.82s)]
*  Right, but now now suddenly they're fine with these courts and probably even this supreme court [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1574.1s)]
*  Because they've gotten these late night rulings saying okay, we're going to stop it [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1580.26s)]
*  I don't think I think we do have to abide by the u.s. Supreme court ruling [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1584.18s)]
*  I I think that's very clear. You cannot delegitimize the u.s. Supreme court [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1587.22s)]
*  There's a rule of law in this country and it must be upheld [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1590.98s)]
*  But we're we're heading toward a serious crisis kevin where 56 of the country wants all of these illegals out [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1594.02s)]
*  and when we're only some [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1601.94s)]
*  20,000 into the deportations [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1604.56s)]
*  It's basically been shut down the main tool for deporting most of them [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1607.94s)]
*  The most dangerous has been shut down and you're that's what's going to push us toward a crisis where [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1611.3799999999999s)]
*  The executive branch doesn't listen to the article three courts [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1617.22s)]
*  I think that's the only way to deal with this [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1620.82s)]
*  I think that's the only way to deal with this [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1622.98s)]
*  And I think that's the only way to deal with this [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1625.94s)]
*  Yeah, but there's other ways to deal. I mean your numbers are let's let's let's round it out [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1628.9s)]
*  Let's say it's 20 million total illegal immigrants of which [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1634.1s)]
*  500,000 have been charged with crimes. Everybody would agree that they should go first [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1638.4s)]
*  And I think that's where the focus will be [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1643.88s)]
*  Five to five hundred employees [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1645.96s)]
*  many of these illegal immigrants [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1648.2s)]
*  That have not broken the law are employed in these businesses, particularly in agriculture [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1650.5200000000002s)]
*  And they're those business owners are asking is there any other way to deal with this where we can legitimize their residency here? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1656.5200000000002s)]
*  Because they're actually productive in terms of being workers for some jobs. A lot of americans don't want you've heard that narrative [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1664.1200000000001s)]
*  These are the people that are not [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1671.0s)]
*  Been charged with any other crimes. They came into the country illegally. Yes [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1673.16s)]
*  But they actually found jobs that are being paid by american companies. This is a difficult situation because if you just took [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1677.4s)]
*  18 or call it 20 million people including the 500,000 that have done [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1685.32s)]
*  Crimes and they should everybody agrees they should be gone. I mean they're here illegally and they're not everybody [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1690.04s)]
*  Well, I mean most voters think that's a double whammy that's almost three strikes and you're out [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1696.52s)]
*  I think the trump administration will focus really hard on those 500,000 [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1702.44s)]
*  And one way or another they'll be gone because they are illegal and they did break the laws [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1707.32s)]
*  So they're either going to end up serving time in an american prison when they're caught or they're going to go somewhere else [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1711.8799999999999s)]
*  Back to their native homeland. We'll see how that works out [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1717.96s)]
*  but the dilemma for the rest of them is [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1721.24s)]
*  Is there a process by which they can apply legally? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1725.96s)]
*  If they have a sponsor now this this same issue [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1729.72s)]
*  Occurred in europe years ago when they brought workers in into places like france [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1733.56s)]
*  Where they found a way to give them employment because they were willing to sponsor them [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1739.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to get to that place here because you made the numbers very clear [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1744.84s)]
*  If trump got to a million deportations a month, he still wouldn't get it all done before his term's over [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1749.0s)]
*  Think about it and there's zero chance he's getting to even 100 000 never mind a million [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1755.0s)]
*  I don't think that's unrealistic. I mean you'd have to take the commercial airlines into account [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1759.32s)]
*  You need to be booking seats on every aircraft in america. I just don't see that happening [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1763.24s)]
*  so [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1768.04s)]
*  However, I do see the half a million that have broken the law and he has got a clear mandate from the voter [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1768.9199999999998s)]
*  And by the way, I think this is a bipartisan issue [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1775.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't think there's a lot of democrats saying yeah, this is a murderer that came in illegal [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1778.04s)]
*  Let's keep them here. That doesn't even make any sense. They're fighting over right now [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1782.44s)]
*  He started with the worst [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1785.8799999999999s)]
*  He's starting with the ones he understands to be in gangs [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1787.08s)]
*  And the left is trying to pick every single one who's gangs affiliate gang affiliation. They question [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1790.04s)]
*  Oh, was he really in the gang? Oh, you didn't have all the proof that he was in the gang [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1795.16s)]
*  He's here illegally. He he can be deported like I don't even know we're wasting time trying to argue about the extra crime [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1798.92s)]
*  because [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1806.76s)]
*  It's better. It sounds better. We don't have to prove any of that [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1807.72s)]
*  You're here illegally. You can be deported. Goodbye. That's it [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1810.68s)]
*  Yeah, you're making look that point is probably uh [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1815.48s)]
*  About on a bipartisan basis by a majority of you know, if you check 10 people you're gonna get six of them saying [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1818.76s)]
*  I agree with this how it gets worked out. I mean [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1824.76s)]
*  The administration is it's not just trump the whole administration has to do battle but you cannot go against the supreme court. I mean [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1828.52s)]
*  I mean [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1836.76s)]
*  There's no way we can't ignore that ultimate decision [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1837.6399999999999s)]
*  You ignore the supreme court you become a democrat you become aoc [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1842.44s)]
*  We can't that's we can't let them, you know [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1848.04s)]
*  Make us become the things that we can't stand the the ridiculous morons who have been talking about packing the court and delegitimizing the court [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1850.76s)]
*  That's not going to fly. We we have to we on the right must [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1858.36s)]
*  Abide by the u.s. Supreme court rulings [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1862.36s)]
*  Period while being extremely critical and doing what we can to find the right legal cases to make sure the right cases get tested [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1865.4s)]
*  That's just the way that's dealing with it's an issue [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1872.3600000000001s)]
*  But it's not the only one that people are concerned about right now as we talk the market's down a thousand points [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1875.24s)]
*  There's a lot of volatility in people's net worth why the tariff ripping through there's a lot of stuff on his plate right now [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1881.0800000000002s)]
*  Can we talk about the tariffs kevin? I don't understand them. I never purported to understand them [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1886.92s)]
*  I I hear of course all of the trump deranged people tell me he's an idiot. He's doing it all wrong mark of volatility [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1891.6399999999999s)]
*  Then I hear his defenders say he's playing the long game. It's chess. You don't get it [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1899.6399999999999s)]
*  Like I don't know. I will tell you this a dear friend of mine who is [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1903.48s)]
*  At a very important hedge fund who I really do trust [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1908.12s)]
*  Said that everything is so unpredictable [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1912.28s)]
*  That people are at their wits end who who are in the market that and that's one of the reasons why we're seeing such volatility like [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1915.3400000000001s)]
*  They can't stand the uncertainty and the unpredictability and that dovetails with what mario barteromo was asking trump about face to face [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1921.9s)]
*  So can you speak to that the uncertainty? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1929.82s)]
*  And where are we with the tariffs have? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1932.38s)]
*  Have we settled in a good place right now as we're in like a pause for almost everyone but china and renegotiating? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1935.26s)]
*  Yeah, I think what you're going to see from a pragmatic point of view again [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1940.8s)]
*  Leaving out trump derangement syndrome and just saying where are we at with the current policy on tariffs? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1945.6s)]
*  If you look at the big blocks, which is the european union [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1947.84s)]
*  Switzerland and england which are not part of that union but also trading partners canada and mexico [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1952.56s)]
*  That's about 70 percent [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  Of the what trades, you know, with the trade union [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1962.72s)]
*  That's about 70 percent of the what trades, you know what trump is looking at and what he's saying if you leave out all the [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1966.0s)]
*  bombastic statements [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1974.6999999999998s)]
*  And I always say this about trump you gotta forget about the noise [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1975.84s)]
*  You got to focus on the signal because if you don't understand that after 12 years of trump, you never will so [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1978.4799999999998s)]
*  The noise is all the volatility in the market. The signal is this [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1984.4799999999998s)]
*  What he wants and what his administration wants luthnick wants and bergham wants and all the rest of them working on this stuff is [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1990.0s)]
*  Reciprocal tariffs including zero. So if you think about this [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=1997.1799999999998s)]
*  Take car parts in germany. I always use that example [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2001.9199999999998s)]
*  They had outrageous tariffs on car parts going into germany [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2005.04s)]
*  And american companies want to compete on the componentry of all kinds of cars and they can't because they have some crazy tariff [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2009.52s)]
*  So trump is saying i'm going to throw on the same crazy tariff on car parts from germany coming into the united states [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2017.44s)]
*  right away [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2024.3999999999999s)]
*  Rational minds would say well, that's not going to work for both of us. It's kind of dumb [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2026.0s)]
*  Why don't we take that down to 10 or zero and then we're going to end up [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2029.76s)]
*  This is why i'm an optimist with these giant trading partners [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2034.56s)]
*  At zero tariffs, so we'll open up the border to mexico and canada and have free trade there [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2038.8799999999999s)]
*  Eventually after this gets worked out because there'll be no tariffs in either direction. It's no one. It's nobody's benefit [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2044.6399999999999s)]
*  The case in canada right now. There's an election on the 28th. So it's very close after that gets done. They'll be negotiating germany [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2051.36s)]
*  And england and lots of other ones have already stated openly i'm willing to go to zero to get a deal done [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2059.04s)]
*  So all of these things will get worked out and during this period [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2066.16s)]
*  Lots of volatility because it's not just tariffs today [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2070.08s)]
*  It's trump beating up on the fed and this is an old game that's been going on for every administration including [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2073.76s)]
*  Bipartisanly you always [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2081.1800000000003s)]
*  The executive always beats up on the fed because the fed is independent and you can't job all them into making decisions about interest rates [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2083.28s)]
*  The fed is worried that these tariffs stay on too long particularly with china and they're inflationary [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2089.92s)]
*  Inflation right now is still north of two percent [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2095.26s)]
*  So if I were the fed I wouldn't drop rates either because i'm going to look like an idiot in 90 days [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2098.0s)]
*  When inflation is going up because of tariffs not down, so that's a different issue that adds volatility [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2102.56s)]
*  But my point is all the tariffs are going to get worked out except for china [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2108.0800000000004s)]
*  China's a different deal. We are really getting to the point and everybody realizes this now that we are in an economic [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2113.52s)]
*  War with china they want to become the supreme economy [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2121.04s)]
*  They want to do it by stealing ip from everybody including american ip lots of that [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2125.04s)]
*  They don't play by the rules of the world trade organization and they haven't since 2000 [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2130.0s)]
*  They just don't give a shit and everybody's figured that out [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2134.48s)]
*  And the only way to change their behavior is to show consequence [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2138.7200000000003s)]
*  And we haven't ever done that well this administration has decided there are consequences [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2143.5200000000004s)]
*  To stealing ip and not playing by the rules and not giving access to markets and using our capital markets by not playing by [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2149.5200000000004s)]
*  The rules of gap and all of these things are coming to a head [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2156.24s)]
*  I mean, I hate to use this analogy, but it's a good one [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2160.3999999999996s)]
*  This is like squeezing a teenage pimple. That's what's going on here and they're going to keep squeezing [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2163.52s)]
*  Until the acne is gone and it's going to get ugly [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2168.72s)]
*  But it's going to get resolved because china can't afford [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2172.24s)]
*  Not to have access to the world's largest economy. They just can't otherwise everybody be unemployed there [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2176.0s)]
*  But it's sort of a nasty situation [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2182.0s)]
*  But i'm frankly happy that we're finally doing this as a guy have said this countless times [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2185.38s)]
*  I do business in china and i've been royally screwed and i'm tired of it [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2191.14s)]
*  I'm just sick of it and I speak for millions of entrepreneurs that have been screwed in china for 20 years. We're done [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2195.86s)]
*  Fix it. I'm okay with this volatility. I'd like to get it fixed. I want the other tasks to get worked out [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2203.38s)]
*  Because there's a lot of trade going on there. It's going to happen, but china [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2209.14s)]
*  Squeeze the pimple [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2212.66s)]
*  There um, there was a gal who was on shark tank shark tank not long ago [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2215.06s)]

*  Here it is. Take a listen. I shudder to ask this [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2253.3799999999997s)]
*  What happens to the tariff cost you would bear? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2256.02s)]
*  Once the tariffs go from 104 to 145 [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2260.02s)]
*  229 thousand dollars [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2265.9199999999996s)]
*  Just the tariff you would pay on a hundred and fifty eight thousand dollars worth of product [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2268.88s)]
*  And we would have to come up with that in the 30 to 40 days [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2274.32s)]
*  It takes for the product to get to the u.s. Wow, and I don't I can't get any more loans [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2277.2000000000003s)]

*  In china as soon as it gets to five million in sales domestically [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2326.96s)]
*  The same factories that are making it there knock it off and sell it at a 40 discount because they never have to recoup [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2331.2000000000003s)]
*  The rnd that the company put into making the product in the first place and they get wiped out a different way they get wiped out [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2337.92s)]
*  Uh by china not even they just totally ignore the ip and they can't go back and litigate [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2344.88s)]
*  The crazy thing making is chinese companies use the american legal system [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2352.32s)]
*  To sue american companies after they've knocked them off [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2357.52s)]
*  Why is that okay? Then they so in other words you you are over here as an american company [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2361.6s)]
*  You come up with a design you do all this rnd to make sure it's a safe product. It's a it's an effective product [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2366.08s)]
*  and then [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2372.48s)]
*  You bring it to market here and in china and in here you'd be protected [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2374.16s)]
*  Uh by certain copyright laws or you know, whatever you're using to to protect your ip [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2378.96s)]
*  But over there you don't have the protection so they just knock it off and they start selling it for cheap [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2384.3199999999997s)]
*  That's what you're saying that there's no respect for your ip. Well, it's it's worse [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2388.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe when they're young they're taught this is completely fair to do this [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2392.72s)]
*  You you steal you cheat [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2397.2799999999997s)]
*  It's part of the psyche of how you build your economy [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2399.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter that it wasn't your idea or that you've spent millions of dollars in rnd to create it [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2402.8s)]
*  They simply don't give a shit [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2409.04s)]
*  and that [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2411.52s)]
*  Is what we have to fix because if they want to play with the big boys including trading in europe and everything else [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2413.04s)]
*  stealing everybody's ip [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2418.8s)]
*  And then selling it back into those markets and flooding the markets with the exact same product that usually a 30 to 40 discount [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2421.1200000000003s)]
*  With no consequences [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2427.6s)]
*  Is going to end up in a very bad place for everybody because they can't sustain that forever either and they're look [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2429.76s)]
*  Everybody wants to do business china. I want to do business in china all i'm asking for and I don't think i'm being [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2436.64s)]
*  Unrealistic in this request is give me a level playing field [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2442.3s)]
*  Let me use their courts to litigate trade disputes and resolve them just like they use ours [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2446.08s)]
*  Can you not do that? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2451.76s)]
*  What no you can't and I mean just to [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2453.68s)]
*  Just to give you a sense of of how crazy it's gotten [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2457.12s)]
*  There's a law on the books [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2460.7999999999997s)]
*  That says for chinese companies when they want to raise capital in america [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2463.12s)]
*  They can go to the nasdaq or the new york stock exchange [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2468.08s)]
*  Form a company issue shares to americans that aren't real shares their shadow shares [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2472.16s)]
*  and [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2477.7599999999998s)]
*  What's incredible about this? They don't even comply with gap [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2478.64s)]
*  And so what this law said was it was rick scott who originally got the momentum [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2482.2400000000002s)]
*  The senator out of florida on this deal and said look [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2487.2000000000003s)]
*  We'll give them three years to comply. That's a long time [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2490.5600000000004s)]
*  And then they can stay listed on the exchange and while gensler was the head of the sec he didn't enforce this law [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2494.0800000000004s)]
*  But a new guy a new sheriff's in town named paul acton's just got confirmed last week [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2500.2400000000002s)]
*  And he has made his public statement saying okay i've had enough of this too [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2504.7200000000003s)]
*  Every chinese company that is listed right now that is not complying with gap i'm going to delist them [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2509.28s)]
*  That could be as much as 800 billion dollars of market cap [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2515.04s)]
*  Wow, that should happen because why is it fair for an american company? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2518.96s)]
*  To have to pay for compliance and be compliant with all the regulators here in america to stay listed [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2523.6000000000004s)]
*  Which costs millions of dollars in some case and they're competing with a chinese company right next door to them that doesn't have to [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2529.84s)]
*  Why is that okay under what scenario is that fair? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2537.12s)]
*  And I think that's the kind of question that people like me are raising their hand and saying enough [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2541.36s)]
*  Let's fix this problem once and for all and yes, there's going to be stories of that poor woman situation [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2547.28s)]
*  But these tariffs are not going to be forever [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2552.8s)]
*  This is a game of chicken two economies colliding with each other one cheating and stealing one not [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2555.92s)]
*  At some point you got to resolve the issue and I think at some time in the near future [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2561.68s)]
*  She is going to call trump and say okay [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2566.64s)]
*  Where do you want to meet you want to go to Geneva? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2569.44s)]
*  Is he because whenever you're hearing somebody talk about this who knows china who knows she knows chinese culture [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2572.8s)]
*  They say he'll never call never like they he cannot lose face [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2578.64s)]
*  I mean any communist country leader would be this way and that includes him that they just can't they can't he can't lose face [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2582.88s)]
*  That's the last thing he'll do and now trump has to find a way of going to him [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2590.16s)]
*  But you know trump's kind of like that himself as well [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2593.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, I can assure you within the communist party of china [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2597.2s)]
*  There is a bunch of narrative going on about how long do they want to do this because the only reason you stay in power [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2601.52s)]
*  In a communist society as a supreme leader is everybody's fed [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2606.8799999999997s)]
*  They could take care of their families and they have jobs in factories [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2612.24s)]
*  Now [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2615.6s)]
*  What you could do even though they're not they're not making rubber mats anymore because they're all sitting on the water [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2616.3199999999997s)]
*  No one's going to buy them [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2620.7999999999997s)]
*  You can't there aren't enough markets big enough to replace the american consumer. They just aren't so at the end of the day [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2622.3199999999997s)]
*  You got to start asking yourself. Okay, if i'm cheap do I print money? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2628.7999999999997s)]
*  So that I can pay these workers and then have hyperinflation where a loaf of bread [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2633.3599999999997s)]
*  You know goes up a thousand percent the venezuelan model [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2639.12s)]
*  Or do I work something out with trump so all this stuff we've made can get back into the market including that woman's [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2642.96s)]
*  You know rubber bib [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2650.48s)]
*  I mean somebody's got to buy that there's not enough people around the world to buy that except you got to have the [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2652.08s)]
*  39 percent of the consumers are sitting in america. That's who's going to sell the product [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2657.36s)]
*  That's why I would think at some point because i'm a pragmatic guy again. I look at the policy [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2661.12s)]
*  I know there's a lot of politics here, but if i'm chi i'm thinking okay [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2665.76s)]
*  How do I save face on this deal [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2669.3599999999997s)]
*  What do I do here? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2671.4399999999996s)]
*  To get things going again so the stuff on the boats gets to america with no tariffs on it [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2673.2s)]
*  All the europeans have made the guys in england right now today are saying, okay [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2678.64s)]
*  Let's drop our tariffs on agriculture so we can start shipping grain in both directions or whatever they want out of ag [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2682.48s)]
*  German car parts we talked about that all of these guys are working this out chi has to do that, too [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2687.7599999999998s)]
*  Now is it going to take two weeks? It's going to take two months. I don't know but I guarantee you [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2692.8799999999997s)]
*  There's no scenario where chi can outlast [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2697.92s)]
*  The american consumer because that's really what you're talking about megan [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2702.56s)]
*  At the end of the day, can he really cut himself off from the largest consumer market on earth? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2706.4s)]
*  No [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2711.52s)]
*  and so [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2712.48s)]
*  I'm on the camp that says okay [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2713.68s)]
*  Let's see how long this game of chicken lasts [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2715.92s)]
*  But what I like to resolve this thing once and for all let me speak on behalf of millions of investors and entrepreneurs in america [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2718.56s)]
*  Yes, I want to do business in china. I'm willing to compete with chinese on a level playing field [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2726.0s)]
*  And I want to open the markets up. Yes. I have nothing against the chinese people [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2731.04s)]
*  I don't like their government [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2735.44s)]
*  I don't like their policy and if you're not going to change the government then let's cut a deal to have a reciprocal tariffs or no [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2736.48s)]
*  Tariffs, but definitely access to the markets and definitely got to play by the rules [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2743.12s)]
*  I would like to raise money in hong kong. I would like to approach their markets [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2747.2000000000003s)]

*  But i'm telling you it's time to clean this mess up once and for all and yeah [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2758.1600000000003s)]
*  It's uncomfortable in the ebb and flow and the volatility, but I say to everybody chillax [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2762.4s)]
*  Let this administration get this thing done and let's move on because the last 20 administrations [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2768.88s)]

*  This one is you may hate trump. You may have trump derangement syndrome [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2776.4s)]
*  I feel your pain for that. I don't care because that's not what matters. It's the policy [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2781.04s)]
*  Okay, let me ask you about [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2787.6s)]
*  Uh the tariffs and the effect on some of our international [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2789.6s)]
*  friends [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2793.68s)]

*  Who's a conservative who was the guy eating the apple in that great clip or he was just stone cold against the liberal [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2799.04s)]
*  Journalist trying to get him with the gotcha questions [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2806.24s)]
*  And I think we were all kind of rooting for him and then came the tariffs and suddenly he was losing a race [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2809.04s)]
*  he was winning and now is like something like 20 points behind in the polls to [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2815.68s)]
*  The liberal and so it looks like and some are directly stating that it's the tariff war we're having against canada [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2822.96s)]
*  That's going to lead to justin trudeau 2.0 [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2829.7599999999998s)]
*  When they elect their new prime minister instead of doing what they need which is putting pierre pauliev at the top [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2833.1400000000003s)]
*  Are you are you canadian? Do you have dual citizenship? You've got some connection with canada? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2838.9s)]

*  Trudeau's advisor was mark carney [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2947.86s)]
*  So mark carney comes in with blood on his hands [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2950.58s)]
*  And he has tried to tell every canadian over the last 36 hours [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=2954.02s)]

*  And I think it's people calling bullshit and they don't want more liberals. They're done [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3041.86s)]

*  That is a thorough account of the faulty decision-making process behind the school closures. It's right here [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3150.5s)]
*  I have it in hand and the book is called an abundance of caution [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3155.78s)]
*  American schools the virus and a story of bad decisions a story of bad decisions man, that's [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3159.52s)]
*  Perfectly put david's here to break it all down for us. Welcome back to the show david [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3167.2200000000003s)]
*  So one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you was you're the guy like you are if I think back on the whole [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3170.7400000000002s)]
*  covid misadventure [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3176.96s)]
*  Who who were like there's a couple only a couple of people who all along were like that's bullshit [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3178.6600000000003s)]
*  No, that's not true. No, i've done the underlying research and they're wrong about that too. And for me you were number one [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3185.54s)]
*  Alex baronson was another he was great [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3192.1000000000004s)]
*  um [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3194.42s)]
*  I'm sure i'm missing one or two but like for me you were it [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3195.78s)]
*  And so I know like we we don't like going back over covid people don't like it [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3199.0600000000004s)]
*  I think it just brings up too many triggers [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3203.86s)]
*  It's like I wish I hadn't gotten that vaccine some people feel like I wish they hadn't gotten for their kids [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3205.46s)]
*  They wish they had fought harder against the nonsense [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3210.82s)]
*  You know, we all kind of feel like we're human lab rats now walking around with weird stuff inside of us. Thanks to these [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3213.78s)]
*  Fucking foushee. Sorry [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3219.7000000000003s)]
*  Um, so that we do need but we do need an accounting of what was done and even team trump just last week changed [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3221.7s)]
*  The covid.gov website the one that youtube's referring everybody to it's supposed to be like oh [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3230.3399999999997s)]
*  That's where like foushee and deborah berks are going to give us all their nonsense [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3235.54s)]
*  Now it's officially team trump saying it was a lab leak. That's obvious [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3238.8999999999996s)]
*  Like they're saying all the stuff which is going to send everybody who depended on that into a meltdown [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3242.8199999999997s)]
*  But that's kind of what you're doing here, which is like now that the dust is settled [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3247.54s)]
*  Let's just count the score and let's figure out how we made so many terrible decisions [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3251.7799999999997s)]
*  And maybe how we can not do that the next time so let's just start with this of all the terrible decisions [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3257.46s)]
*  And there's so very many [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3264.3399999999997s)]
*  What was the worst one what stands out? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3266.02s)]
*  Well, my entire book is focused on or at least it's the launch point on the long-term school closures [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3268.8199999999997s)]
*  And then sort of all the decisions that followed in the wake of that the mask mandates barriers on desks [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3275.2999999999997s)]
*  Six feet of distancing all this kind of that's the picture on the front. That's right that to the to the audience again [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3282.18s)]
*  I don't did your kid ever get subjected to this where they have these weird little [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3287.14s)]
*  barriers on the desks that [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3290.8999999999996s)]
*  Did absolutely nothing but my kids had this too nothing at all [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3293.46s)]
*  I mean in the side and these have uh, opaque sides so the kids like horse blinders [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3296.8199999999997s)]
*  So you can't see anybody next to you. Yep [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3301.7799999999997s)]
*  They had that too and you and you launched a podcast called silent lunches right or sub stack. Yeah [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3303.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3307.7s)]
*  Called silent lunches because they had to sit here like during the lunch period not speak to anybody unless their breath infects somebody [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3308.26s)]
*  That's right. You could eat but you weren't allowed to talk. So we had children in meanwhile at the same time [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3314.1800000000003s)]
*  Adults, you know right down the block from the school were dining at a restaurant. You could go to a bar. I mean, right [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3319.7000000000003s)]
*  Alcohol kills the virus, right? I mean, yeah, but yeah children weren't allowed to speak during lunch [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3326.5800000000004s)]
*  In new york city some of the schools the kids were sitting in the winter on concrete outside. Yeah [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3331.38s)]
*  I mean, this is a good sort of launch into discussing this [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3336.18s)]
*  When we talk about it you sort of kind of laugh looking back [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3340.98s)]
*  This was so radical so absurd the idea that children [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3344.5s)]
*  That's if they were in school, but millions of them were not even allowed didn't set foot into a school building for over [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3351.54s)]
*  A year healthy kids. We barred healthy children from school while at the same time malls were open [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3358.8999999999996s)]
*  bars restaurants casinos [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3365.3s)]
*  Adults who were actually at higher risk than children they could carry on but kids were barred from school [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3367.86s)]
*  I mean kids in california, they weren't except for the governor's children. They were they were in school in private school [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3374.7400000000002s)]
*  but everyone else [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3380.42s)]
*  This is such an [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3382.42s)]
*  wild wild circumstance that I don't think it's been fully [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3384.02s)]
*  Reckoned with how insane that is and at the time it seemed insane [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3388.42s)]
*  But a lot of people went along with it [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3393.62s)]
*  And the reason I wanted to write the book was and and this is years of research [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3395.7000000000003s)]
*  Was to try to create a historical record and the and the book is not a cataloging of these are all the harms that [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3400.98s)]
*  Happened to kids. I touch on that. Of course, it's important [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3407.2200000000003s)]
*  The book is like an anatomy of decision making how is it that such an insane decision like that? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3410.1s)]
*  And all the ones that followed after how did that happen? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3417.14s)]
*  And that's what the book does I try to kind of pull the curtain back and show this is how politicians [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3420.02s)]
*  This is how health officials this is how the legacy media [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3425.2999999999997s)]
*  Made its decisions to create a culture where something like that actually happened school closures [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3428.98s)]
*  caused real damage real damage and [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3435.06s)]
*  Look, they damaged all kids across all stratospheres all classes all whatever [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3439.06s)]
*  But the kids who are at the lowest end of the socioeconomic scale got hurt the most [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3443.7s)]
*  They didn't their parents didn't have private tutors. They weren't already at these toady, you know [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3448.26s)]
*  Private schools where their learning level and the challenges and the opportunities were probably advanced to begin with so [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3453.78s)]
*  Some loss would only bring them down to average [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3459.3s)]
*  They were already struggling just struggling just to hit average and they haven't made it back [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3461.86s)]
*  That's that's clear from everybody who's taken an honest look at it. You point you you reveal in this book [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3466.1s)]
*  That loss i mean like all of it may have originated with the idea of a 14 year old girl [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3471.62s)]
*  That's right, so I I [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3478.1s)]
*  Go back and show the the cdc created these guidebooks or playbooks for how to handle a pandemic and there were a series of them [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3480.26s)]
*  But two of them in particular were very very important. One of them came out in [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3488.18s)]
*  2007 and then there was a revision in 2017 [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3492.96s)]
*  These books were mentioned by officials from the cdc at the beginning of the pandemic [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3496.82s)]
*  So there's no ambiguity that these were very important and influential [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3501.54s)]
*  These are the the guidebook on here's what you do when a pandemic comes [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3505.06s)]
*  and [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3509.06s)]
*  One of the astonishing things about these books is they were built on [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3510.02s)]
*  These models and people hear the word model and they might not know what that means [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3514.2599999999998s)]
*  A study is something that actually happened a model is a prediction [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3518.98s)]
*  It's you know, you see a graph where the lines are going to do this over time. It's based on various inputs what and the [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3523.14s)]
*  Um, the researchers get to decide whatever inputs they want go in so you plug the things in and then out comes your model saying [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3530.5s)]
*  Whatever it is you want it to say if you don't like what it says [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3536.9s)]
*  Well, you'll just change the inputs until they show what you want it to show [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3539.78s)]
*  one of the people who [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3544.02s)]
*  Was involved in creating some of the models in these [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3546.7400000000002s)]
*  Guidebooks by the cdc his daughter did a science experiment in school where she talked about [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3550.58s)]
*  It was supposed to simulate the flow of a transmission of a disease [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3557.06s)]
*  within a school [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3562.1800000000003s)]
*  And like all this stuff [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3563.62s)]
*  Was made up like and I go through details showing how and even beyond her that this guy's daughter even because robert glass [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3566.1800000000003s)]
*  Beyond her um his daughter [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3574.9s)]
*  were [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3577.54s)]
*  more [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3578.66s)]
*  august people at places like imperial college of london and ihme these like very very esteemed [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3579.78s)]
*  institutions public health institutions [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3586.4s)]
*  Their models were deeply flawed and because i'm a crazy person [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3589.7000000000003s)]
*  I actually go in and read all of the models and i'm reading the supplement, you know [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3594.34s)]
*  35 pages in in tiny print and one of the things I found was [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3598.58s)]
*  They had had this figure something like 35 percent of of transmission [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3603.38s)]
*  They thought or something to that effect was coming from schools. I'm like, where did this number come from? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3607.94s)]
*  So I look through there's a citation i'm like, oh that's interesting then that citation goes to another citation you go [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3612.7400000000002s)]
*  Eight layers deep and they're in the supplement. It says this number was chosen arbitrarily. Oh my gosh [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3618.26s)]
*  So people need to understand remember at the beginning of the pandemic megan [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3624.58s)]
*  They had the um flatten the curve meme everyone they show if everyone just follows our orders [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3628.26s)]
*  Then it'll go down and then you don't have to worry about the hospitals being overwhelmed [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3633.54s)]
*  And they had all these models saying two million people will die with the next x number of months [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3637.46s)]
*  If you don't do exactly we're told and they show you the graph so a regular person [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3641.6200000000003s)]
*  Oh my god, look what happens with the cases if we don't listen [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3645.0600000000004s)]
*  But if we follow directions, then this will happen and part of those directions was closing schools [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3647.94s)]
*  In part, this was based on made-up figures. Oh debor burks kind of admits that doesn't she in her book? I think she [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3653.86s)]
*  One thing she does admit she sort of touches on that one thing [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3661.78s)]
*  She does admit is that the 15 days she never had an intention of stopping there [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3664.98s)]
*  She purposefully didn't tell the president or the american people and she admits this canted that was to get us on the hook [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3670.58s)]
*  Yeah, let me just like reel them in once they're already locked into it. You know, it's like the frog in the pot [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3676.26s)]
*  They're not gonna oh, we'll just go on so that 15 days people may forget [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3681.7000000000003s)]
*  15 days to slow the spread 15 days slow the spread then it they added another 30 days on right at the end and it was [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3686.02s)]
*  If the man you know same with the gatherings. Yes, we can touch on this. I mean, but um [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3693.14s)]
*  A huge part of my book is is about the media. It's really a work of media criticism [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3698.42s)]
*  Imagine this the entire like master switch for our country is shut down. We have 15 days. Everyone's like, okay, let's let's all do this together [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3704.1s)]
*  This is scary new virus at the end of 15 days. So like we're gonna make it 30 more days [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3711.54s)]
*  Where was any of the questioning from the media? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3716.82s)]
*  Where it was crickets they just were let's keep going [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3720.1s)]
*  There was very there were some but yes, it was very not mainstream [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3724.4199999999996s)]
*  No, and that's a large part of my book was this sort of [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3727.54s)]
*  conjunction between [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3731.68s)]
*  the media and the health establishment and how the media which normally [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3733.3799999999997s)]
*  supposed to be skeptical and normally particularly when you think of um, the liberal media [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3739.06s)]
*  Of which I used to count myself a part of where their entire thing here was [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3745.46s)]
*  Um throughout throughout time. What's the media? What's a journalist job? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3750.98s)]
*  It's to be skeptical of those in power the government the defense department the church, you know [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3754.9s)]
*  All these large institutions big businesses yet that evaporated [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3761.1400000000003s)]
*  In the in the pandemic so you had this circumstance where you had these bogus [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3766.1000000000004s)]
*  Models that we were told if you do these things it's going to affect cases in such and such manner [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3771.54s)]
*  And everyone's like, oh that looks official. It's from these fancy colleges deborah burke. She's wearing a nice silk scarf [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3777.62s)]
*  She looks like she's smart. I'll listen to her. It looks a school marmi. Yeah [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3783.14s)]
*  Fauci is telling us this, you know, oh we'll listen to them, but no one bothered to really investigate [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3786.42s)]
*  What was the underlying information? What was the underlying data that fed into these various models? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3792.74s)]
*  Well, that's how you became a star [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3799.22s)]
*  That's that's really because you you started publishing articles after having done that and those of us who just knew instinctively that this is this is not right [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3800.7400000000002s)]
*  Started paying attention and then you know, you can find a real data hound. It's a gift [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3808.18s)]
*  a couple of things I wanted to follow up on what you just said why why [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3812.9s)]
*  Wasn't the media more skeptical of these claims [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3818.42s)]
*  so [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3822.58s)]
*  I spend a lot of time on this and in the book and what I [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3823.78s)]
*  Believe that I show persuasively is that [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3827.7s)]
*  Unfortunately, this all comes down to tribalism that political tribalism we had such an I shouldn't use past tense [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3830.96s)]
*  Had we have such an acrimonious political environment in our country? And the fact of the matter is [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3838.34s)]
*  most of the legacy or you know prestige media outlets [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3845.22s)]
*  Are are left-leaning almost everyone there most of the people within public health also share that political persuasion [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3849.38s)]
*  and what I show is that [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3856.98s)]
*  Time and again, there's a zillion examples of this that it was this sort of what I call like newtonian physics with every action [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3859.22s)]
*  There's an equal and opposite reaction when trump said [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3865.86s)]
*  Open the schools [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3869.94s)]
*  That was it. He basically ensured that they would be closed you write about the american academy of pediatrics [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3871.46s)]
*  By the way, the book is called an abundance of caution by david so I expelled zweig [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3876.98s)]
*  Um you write about the american academy of pediatrics and its [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3882.12s)]
*  Recommendation that schools be opened. It was the it was july of 2020 and it was saying [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3888.18s)]
*  When we get back to september these schools need to open. That's what's best for children. And then that's right [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3893.64s)]
*  So the american academy pediatrics comes out with this guidance early on saying no matter what let's get kids in school [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3898.44s)]
*  And on top of that, they said don't worry about six feet of distancing if you can do it great [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3904.52s)]
*  But if you can't let's just get the kids in school. This is the most important thing. It was unambiguous what they meant [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3908.76s)]
*  Shortly thereafter trump tweets and all caps with like a million exclamation points as is his way [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3914.6800000000003s)]
*  Schools need to open in the fall [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3920.84s)]
*  Within days the american academy of pediatrics reversed its guidance. It was so stark. It was so [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3923.1600000000003s)]
*  Crazy the reversal that even npr had reported on at the time [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3930.84s)]
*  Gone was any mention of you know, don't worry about distancing that was out [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3935.32s)]
*  Gone was the idea of no matter what gets kids in school. That was out instead [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3939.72s)]
*  The new statement was listen to the experts. Oh god and [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3943.56s)]
*  On top of that something that was missing in the earlier guidance [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3948.12s)]
*  We need money and lots of it if you want to open these schools [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3951.24s)]
*  And here's the last thing that's interesting about the revised statement. It's not what's in the statement, but it's who? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3955.4s)]
*  Authored the statement and it wasn't the american academy of pediatrics by itself. It was co-authored with the two largest teachers unions in the country [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3961.0s)]
*  Is there a bigger villain in the covet story than those teachers unions? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3969.64s)]
*  I think public health and the media are the bigger villains because ultimately the teachers unions couldn't have made [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3974.7599999999998s)]
*  This outlandish list of demands that they did in so many places without having the cover [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3981.32s)]
*  Of the media and public health saying these things and I recount all sorts of stuff in the book [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3986.68s)]
*  There are hacks who behaved like hacks, but there should have been a higher [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3991.48s)]
*  An establishment that was devoted to a higher purpose that didn't buy into it and enable it had anthony fauci [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=3995.7999999999997s)]
*  And everyone else within the public health establishment said [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4002.6s)]
*  Hold on [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4006.12s)]
*  None of this stuff is true that they're demanding [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4007.16s)]
*  I have a whole long section in there about these claims about needing HEPA filters and HBAC upgrades [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4009.48s)]
*  All the no one was challenging that and believe me anthony fauci was in front of a camera every single day [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4014.92s)]
*  Gave a zillion interviews and tons of public health [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4020.28s)]
*  Pundits, you know or there was this one emergency medicine physician who I talk about in the book quite a bit [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4023.32s)]
*  She gave hundreds of interviews constantly on the you know, speed dial at the new york times and other places [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4029.32s)]
*  Even though she had no particular expertise in infectious diseases or any of these interventions. She was now an expert. She was on speed dial [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4035.0s)]
*  None of these people said a word that this that this is completely bogus and the the [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4043.3199999999997s)]
*  most important part that I mentioned in this sort of chronology is that in [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4049.96s)]
*  late april and early may [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4055.7999999999997s)]
*  many many countries throughout europe 22 countries began to reopen their schools [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4058.44s)]
*  Millions of children. We're not talking about like a little school [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4064.3599999999997s)]
*  Somewhere in tibet, you know with 12 kids [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4067.7999999999997s)]
*  Millions of children were going back to school in europe [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4070.52s)]
*  And later that month in may the education ministers met from in the eu [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4074.36s)]
*  And in that meeting they announced we have observed no negative impact from opening schools here [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4080.44s)]
*  A month later same meeting [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4087.64s)]
*  Same announcement here. It is yet a whole another month later [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4090.28s)]
*  We haven't noticed any we haven't observed any negative impact of opening schools millions of children [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4093.7200000000003s)]
*  22 different countries [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4098.84s)]
*  No one in the american media reported on this I did ultimately [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4101.56s)]
*  But when this initially happened, I was so astonished [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4106.120000000001s)]
*  I kept re-clicking the link for the you know for the video because I was like how can this be? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4108.92s)]
*  How is it possible that no media outlets this is this wasn't in a blog? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4113.240000000001s)]
*  This wasn't you know some random or obscure medical journal [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4117.160000000001s)]
*  This is the meeting at the eu and they said millions of kids are back in school [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4119.8s)]
*  And nothing has happened. It's fine [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4124.280000000001s)]
*  This was ignored to me. This is kind of one of the original sins that I point out that happened [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4127.160000000001s)]
*  Once we ignored that or waved it away and we can go through this megan the various excuses they gave well [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4133.160000000001s)]
*  That's europe. That's different. That doesn't count and they gave this list of reasons which were all made up [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4139.0s)]
*  None of them were real. It makes no sense [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4144.76s)]
*  Anyway, I mean the united states of america for the most part has way more land and way more expansive facilities than the than france [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4146.040000000001s)]
*  Does where they're on top of each other no one no one in europe or very few [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4151.72s)]
*  This was not the norm. They didn't have this hepa filters in all their schools. I've spent enough time in europe [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4155.72s)]
*  I know people with the schools. There are not all these glistening oasis, uh, you know of of hepa filtered air [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4161.160000000001s)]
*  Many kids weren't wearing masks [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4168.4400000000005s)]
*  In fact the ecdc that's like europe's version of the cdc recommended against kids in primary schools wearing masks where in you in the u.s [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4170.92s)]
*  They wanted kids as young as two years old to wear masks all day [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4178.84s)]
*  They weren't doing distancing in many instances it was three feet or like what they would say one meter or no distancing required at all [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4182.12s)]
*  A list of things that we kept being told by these public health experts. Well, don't don't look at europe [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4189.64s)]
*  It's almost like a magician. Look away don't look there. That's because and then they would list the things they controlled the virus [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4194.84s)]
*  They did all these things. I still am struggling to figure out why because if you look at take wokeism [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4200.76s)]
*  You know europe is as woke as we are they're gone [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4205.56s)]
*  And truly like the uk is gone [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4208.6s)]
*  So is france it'll i mean ireland gond italy's not as bad. Um [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4211.32s)]
*  So I was thinking maybe it's just this knee-jerk safetyism that we've embraced here in the united states now your safe spaces your trigger warnings [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4216.2s)]
*  You can't discuss certain things you can't say certain terms, but they're just as bad as we are over there when it comes to that stuff [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4223.88s)]
*  So there I think just as sort of safety conscious and I mean that in the most negative sense possible as we are [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4229.400000000001s)]
*  So I don't get it. Why why over there? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4236.92s)]
*  Were there authorities still willing to look objectively at data and over here? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4239.72s)]
*  Ours weren't and also the entire media establishment wasn't either right? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4245.88s)]
*  I mean one of the things to your point that's really important is this was so [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4251.48s)]
*  Coded politically within our country that opening schools or wanting to go to work or go to the beach even or a child playing at a playground [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4257.639999999999s)]
*  That was coded as right wing and to want to you know, and it was virtuous and left wing if you stayed home [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4265.799999999999s)]
*  It's part of trumped arrangement syndrome is what you're saying. It's it was tds [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4271.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because those countries which are far more progressive than the united states [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4274.839999999999s)]
*  They sent their kids back to school and then you have other countries with more conservative governments where they were doing the reverse [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4279.719999999999s)]
*  There was no correlation between the political leaning of a particular government in their countries [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4286.5199999999995s)]
*  And with whether things were open or locked down there was no correlation [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4293.240000000001s)]
*  So the idea but in america people were living within such a bubble of our own sort of [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4297.08s)]
*  world here that anyone who went against trump [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4303.08s)]
*  Was virtuous and anyone who agreed with him was this horrible monster. What do you some right right wing? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4307.160000000001s)]
*  You know asshole you're trying to do your own research. So you had this situation that was [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4313.400000000001s)]
*  So divisive in america and again it comes down to we go back to that american academy of pediatrics reversal [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4319.240000000001s)]
*  Where it was so clear that what was happening was this had to be a sort of reaction against trump [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4326.92s)]
*  And one of the things that I talk about in the book is that after I started writing my articles [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4334.76s)]
*  Which were some of the only articles in sort of what we might consider legacy media or mainstream new york magazine [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4340.12s)]
*  That was shocking. It was like what what i'm actually getting value out of new york magazine later in the atlantic and other places [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4346.12s)]
*  Um and in wired which is you know ostensibly non-political. No, they are left and they are very annoying right? So, okay [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4352.68s)]
*  Somehow I i've managed to get my my contrarian pieces in these publications and and people have asked me why and how did that happen? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4359.4s)]
*  Because i've had other journalists who sort of shared some of my views. How did you do it? I said because I provided evidence [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4367.0s)]
*  Like I think that's what it comes down to but [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4373.080000000001s)]
*  One of the things that I talk about is once these articles started coming out [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4376.280000000001s)]
*  I started getting emails from doctors around the country and regular people too and former cdc officials [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4379.96s)]
*  And these were doctors not just necessarily some random pediatrician in the suburb somewhere. We're talking about people at elite university hospitals [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4387.080000000001s)]
*  At some of our top institutions and they would write me and say [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4395.080000000001s)]
*  I want you to know I agree with you. I think what's going on is crazy [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4398.92s)]
*  There's no evidence of closing schools is going to be beneficial. This is terrible having little, you know toddlers wearing masks [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4402.2s)]
*  Whatever it was. They said I want to agree with you, but this all has to be off the record [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4408.76s)]
*  I can't talk about it publicly and I you know, I was like why how is this happening? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4413.48s)]
*  Because one they knew it was the environment was so clear people aren't stupid that they self-censored and number two [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4418.2s)]
*  They were overtly censored many people were admonished by their superiors some, you know [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4425.0s)]
*  Administrator at the hospital saying don't ever talk about this again [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4431.14s)]
*  And I have a couple stories of that where people spoke out so there was this [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4434.6s)]
*  Environment where no one no one could be seen including, you know a university hospital [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4438.900000000001s)]
*  Um as an institution, none of them could be seen as agreeing with trump [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4445.08s)]
*  It makes perfect sense because you look at what happened with the great barrington declaration in the spring of 21 [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4449.32s)]
*  In jay bodachari and now the head of nih praise god. I was there with jay great martin kohldorf [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4456.12s)]
*  And uh, i'm forgetting the name of the female. Yeah, it's an extra group right from our top top universities [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4463.16s)]
*  They come out with this and what happened immediately immediately they got smeared by fauci and collins like immediately as fringe fit [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4469.0s)]
*  Like there was absolutely nothing fringe about them [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4475.48s)]
*  They were as establishment and respected as a doctor can get in the united states [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4477.24s)]
*  And i'm sure that they were the example, you know, they were maligned everybody else is looking if you can do that to them [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4481.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you can do that to me from harvard stanford and oxford. Oh if they're maligned if they're called fringe [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4487.32s)]
*  Um, I don't stand a chance against this so there was no way [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4494.44s)]
*  That and look i'm sympathetic toward if this is someone how they're making their living [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4498.44s)]
*  To you know taking care of their family they've spent the last 20 years studying [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4503.0s)]
*  In order to work in medicine i'm somewhat sympathetic to the idea that they didn't want to get fired because fauci had his hands in everything [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4508.2s)]
*  Fauci had he controlled all the money. I didn't think I didn't realize that before cove it that how many of these university research programs [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4514.76s)]
*  Are funded by his group i add nih more broadly [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4521.56s)]
*  That's right when you control the purse strings [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4526.12s)]
*  But I would say megan even beyond the sort of any sort of explicit thread of withholding funding [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4527.88s)]
*  People were social creatures and most people [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4534.2s)]
*  Are not really inclined to be in the out group and I talk about this in the book [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4538.04s)]
*  Is that if you think about medicine? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4543.0s)]
*  It self selects generally for a certain type of person a really hard worker someone who's smart [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4545.24s)]
*  These are great traits in a doctor hard worker and smart, but it also selects for rule followers [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4550.52s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't select for iconoclast you go in you do your residency you have to listen to the attending [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4555.08s)]
*  You're not going to start challenging them. They got there by following the rules. These are people who their [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4560.36s)]
*  General nature is not to be an outcast [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4566.92s)]
*  So they don't want to be cast out of that social group and I would argue the same thing as within [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4569.8s)]
*  The sort of prestige media outlets. How do you get to the new york times? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4574.2s)]
*  Well, you got straight a's in school growing up then you went to brown [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4577.48s)]
*  Then maybe you went to columbia journalism school and now you're at the times i'm not saying every reporter there is like this [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4581.719999999999s)]
*  There certainly are plenty who are excellent reporters and who are doing [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4586.92s)]
*  important independent work there, but nevertheless the broader type of [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4591.08s)]
*  Person who gets into an institution like that is the same type of person who's going to get into [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4595.799999999999s)]
*  Um, you know columbia university, you know medical center and these types of places [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4601.32s)]
*  It self-selects for people who got to where they are became successful by being part of an in-group [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4605.639999999999s)]
*  So you have these two institutions health and media that were controlling the narrative within our country [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4612.759999999999s)]
*  Yet the people within those institutions were a certain type of personality and i'm not saying this was nefarious even this is just [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4619.96s)]
*  Kind of a human nature and then you had the small group of them who were coming to me [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4627.719999999999s)]
*  Off the record saying hey, I don't like what's going on. This is wrong, but I can't say anything about it [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4632.679999999999s)]
*  So it's really important for people [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4638.599999999999s)]
*  Listening and watching this program to understand and hopefully they'll read my book and get a deeper understanding [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4641.24s)]
*  The book is called an abundance of caution american schools the virus and a story of bad decisions by david swyde keep going [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4646.44s)]
*  Hopefully they'll have an understanding of how what I try to show is how narratives get created [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4652.2s)]
*  And it's sort of the like how how do the gears turn within our society? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4658.6s)]
*  And like how is it? You know, it's almost like plato's cave like who's looking at the shadows [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4663.48s)]
*  Who's creating those shadows and how do you actually get out of the cave and a lot of the book is about evidence [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4667.48s)]
*  That's the way that we really can arm ourselves [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4673.08s)]
*  To be aware. It's sort of like a media literacy that you can even bring to your doctor [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4676.92s)]
*  I suspect you megan when you go to the doctor, they're not like here's what you need to do and you're like yes doctor [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4681.4s)]
*  You know, this isn't anymore right? This isn't 1955 where you just do what people say [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4685.96s)]
*  And this doesn't mean that we should ignore what quote experts say [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4690.68s)]
*  It doesn't mean that we should dismiss it out of hand [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4694.12s)]
*  But it does mean that you should bring your own skepticism with you and you need to think about evidence [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4696.2s)]
*  Ultimately my book really I think it's about kind of what we might call like epistemology [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4702.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like, how do you know what is true? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4706.92s)]
*  How do you know that this thing is true and over and over again? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4709.16s)]
*  In our country and we still do this now and is every topic under the sun [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4713.56s)]
*  But what I show what happened in the pandemic was such horrible consequence is that the experts [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4717.24s)]
*  Repeatedly told us things without providing any evidence behind what they were telling us and then the media [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4723.7s)]
*  regurgitated this same information without providing evidence and within philosophy [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4730.66s)]
*  That's called what's known as a logical fallacy. This is it's an argument from authority [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4735.32s)]
*  Just because a person is saying something doesn't mean it's true [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4740.04s)]
*  And they never pushed back and said well, wait a minute [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4744.76s)]
*  I know you're saying that they need HEPA filters and we can't open a school until they get the HEPA filter [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4748.12s)]
*  What's the evidence behind this claim? What is the evidence for this? No one bothered to push back a couple of things on it. Um, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4753.320000000001s)]
*  I feel like there's another element to the journalistic failures and I think it has to do with [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4760.92s)]
*  Elitism [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4766.04s)]
*  I think it has to do with a fact the fact that like you look up and down that lineup on cnn [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4767.240000000001s)]
*  And msnbc and all those people are millionaires or close to it [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4771.320000000001s)]
*  And they were enjoying the pandemic [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4775.8s)]
*  Their kids were home. They had a tutor or they had some private school that was basically taking care of them [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4778.280000000001s)]
*  They knew they'd be fine. Their lives were easier. They got to go to work via zoom [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4784.92s)]
*  They got to be out east in the hamptons with all their friends [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4790.6s)]
*  They got to start drinking wine at 1 pm instead of 4 pm, which is a big sacrifice [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4794.2s)]
*  To wait and they didn't want it to get back to normal [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4798.76s)]
*  I think one of the most important and remarkable things that happened in the pandemic that we need to reckon with as a society [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4803.08s)]
*  Is that this was one of the most? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4811.72s)]
*  Classist, you know class-based [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4814.5s)]
*  Policy endeavors that had ever occurred in america [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4817.240000000001s)]
*  It's quite remarkable the people who made the rules [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4821.88s)]
*  Coincidentally fared the best during the pandemic [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4826.34s)]
*  So you have what you know what people today might call the laptop class [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4829.8s)]
*  Who do you think works at the cdc the nih who are these you know? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4833.160000000001s)]
*  Who are these people on television and working at these elite media outlets? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4837.8s)]
*  By and large these people are making six figure salaries or seven figure [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4843.0s)]
*  Their lives are very different from the people millions and millions of people in our country who their [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4847.16s)]
*  Policies and their guidelines were affecting and that includes I mean there were kids [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4853.38s)]
*  Who were sitting in a parking lot of a taco bell to try to get [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4857.5599999999995s)]
*  Wi-fi signal so they could do their you know fake remote learning [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4862.04s)]
*  There are children who are in homes that are unsafe [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4866.36s)]
*  One of the crazy things that happened was there was a drop [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4869.48s)]
*  In um in claims of child abuse early on and you might think oh, that's great child abuse went down [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4873.24s)]
*  It's so heartbreaking what they found was it's not that it went down [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4879.799999999999s)]
*  It's that teachers and educators are the most important line of defense for a child who is in danger at home [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4883.5599999999995s)]
*  Now those kids had no one to talk to and some of them were left home with a monster [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4890.759999999999s)]
*  You had kids who didn't have um their final year there this was their chance to get into college [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4895.64s)]
*  Maybe they were a football player. Maybe there was someone who was a wonderful actor or an artist [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4902.2s)]
*  All those things were cancelled you you're not going to get recruited for the football season [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4907.4s)]
*  To play in a college and get recruited there if there is no season [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4911.96s)]
*  So all these things were happening to kids around the country and I haven't even mentioned learning loss [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4916.28s)]
*  Which obviously is the most overt that people rightfully so are continuing to talk about [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4921.48s)]
*  There are so many things that we're affecting and it's not a small number millions and millions of kids [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4926.44s)]
*  Including we we can touch on kids who have learning disabilities and it's something like seven million of them [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4932.12s)]
*  I think get an IEP which is like a special program that they're required to get by law and some of these things [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4937.639999999999s)]
*  Require them to have physical therapy. You can't do that through a computer screen children with severe autism [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4944.92s)]
*  children with all sorts of [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4951.32s)]
*  physical and variety of neurological [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4953.46s)]
*  Challenges and disabilities these kids unless you lived in a very wealthy family [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4956.82s)]
*  They were screwed and they still haven't come back from and that's why it's so infuriating when you saw [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4961.96s)]
*  those Chicago public teachers unions, uh union teachers [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4968.12s)]
*  Dancing using the dance to try to show us how inappropriate what it was to send them back into schools [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4973.46s)]
*  Like these are totally able-bodied mostly young females like the tik tok videos of everyone [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4980.04s)]
*  Yes, just dancing about to try to show they're upset about having to do their damn jobs [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4986.280000000001s)]
*  And that's why I really think like they're right up there. I agree with you fauci and berks. They're up higher fauci's number one [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4993.320000000001s)]
*  Um, and by the way to your point about the fact that these people at the cdc they weren't going into the office [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=4999.160000000001s)]
*  I was at fda last thursday with marty mccary and we were walking around. It's a huge complex [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5003.64s)]
*  It's in maryland. It's not in dc and even to this day [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5009.24s)]
*  It's largely empty and he's he's right now saying everybody get back in here. It's [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5012.92s)]
*  2025 it's been five years [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5018.66s)]
*  They pieced out thanks to coveted. They were never made to come back in they were all loving it [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5021.4s)]
*  There was a built-in incentive to say it's not safe [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5026.12s)]
*  We need to keep this rolling in the name of safety because they were loving it these teachers [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5029.48s)]
*  They don't usually get to teach from home or do the stupid zooms. That's easier. They're in their pajamas [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5034.04s)]
*  I think [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5039.24s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. It's in the mind of all the teachers [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5040.2s)]
*  Some of them definitely appear to have taken advantage others [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5042.36s)]
*  I think genuinely were frightened by a media that you know if it bleeds it leads [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5044.68s)]
*  And I talk about this in the book the american media was unique in its [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5050.04s)]
*  Dialing the knob up to 11 [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5055.48s)]
*  For hysteria over this and there was some research research out of dartmouth where they sort of do like a content like tone analysis [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5057.8s)]
*  And the u.s. Was off the charts in the way we covered this [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5065.240000000001s)]
*  Phenomena that was happening [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5070.280000000001s)]
*  Whereas and I talk about this there was an article in the new york times that came out on the very that was like hysterical [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5071.88s)]
*  About if schools open this is what could happen, you know, and there's like, you know flames [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5077.64s)]
*  You know practically shooting out of out of the the screen if you're reading the article on the very same day an article came [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5081.96s)]
*  Out in what's known as the bmj [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5087.72s)]
*  It's the british medical journal and the title is something like kids are not super spreaders open the schools [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5089.5599999999995s)]
*  The the dichotomy on this one day of these two articles couldn't be more stark and more emblematic [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5096.04s)]
*  Of the difference of how we were experiencing the pandemic here in america versus other places [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5103.08s)]
*  It's not to say that they were flawless outside the united states, but there was something [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5109.0s)]
*  Uniquely hysterical about the response in america [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5113.62s)]
*  We are a country that was ill-equipped to function under duress and I understand [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5117.8s)]
*  why [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5124.04s)]
*  People felt that trump had poisoned the well to such a degree that that ultimately they had to react in this manner [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5125.16s)]
*  But those are reasons not excuses. That is not like the idea that [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5132.04s)]
*  Someone he was so odious to them such tds as you were saying that it didn't I mean trump could say I love puppies [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5137.240000000001s)]
*  And vanilla ice cream and they would say I hate puppies I hate vanilla. That's right. It didn't matter so [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5143.72s)]
*  He [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5149.64s)]
*  Create there was such an environment created that all these people were terrified [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5150.4400000000005s)]
*  Only a very small portion had the courage like a martin caldorff and others to come out and say you know what trump is right [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5155.8s)]
*  He's right on something. He may be you know, even a broken clock is right twice a day [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5163.160000000001s)]
*  Even if you disagree with him on everything, but they couldn't do it [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5166.76s)]
*  The media just couldn't bring itself to to possibly agree with this man [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5170.28s)]
*  Even on something that he was so clearly right that millions of kids in school in europe [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5174.68s)]
*  It didn't matter they were too busy pumping stories like two teachers have already died of covet [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5179.0s)]
*  Thanks to the reopening of the schools. Meanwhile, then it would come out [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5183.8s)]
*  They died of covet that they got in their communities before the school had even opened like you're trying to suggest the children gave it to them [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5186.52s)]
*  But that's how stories were being styled and presented by places like cnn. That was a cnner [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5193.4s)]
*  Um across the media. I mean the new york times is still that I mentioned that website that trump has got up now that [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5198.759999999999s)]
*  Covid.gov and they're still even after the new york times wrote that ridiculous [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5204.5s)]
*  We were misled on covet a couple of weeks ago like a month ago [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5209.0s)]
*  Um saying oh you the authorities they misled us. They had this long column on it [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5212.92s)]
*  Even even though they're now coming to terms with they were misled [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5217.16s)]
*  Uh, they're writing an article about that website being like oh [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5221.639999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of experts a lot of experts who still believe this was natural origin [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5224.36s)]
*  They they believe that this did not come from a lab like they can't let go of their little darlings david [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5228.28s)]
*  they can't let it go and the idea that [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5234.12s)]
*  That they were misled but your job as a journalist is to ask questions to not be misled [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5238.2s)]
*  And and when it happens to let it be infrequent to not allow [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5244.5199999999995s)]
*  to [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5248.839999999999s)]
*  To simply quote a an expert so to speak an expert on something without asking [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5249.64s)]
*  Well, wait, what's the evidence behind that claim or if you don't ask them then go report it out yourself and dig into it [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5255.240000000001s)]
*  And that's what I started doing from the beginning [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5260.280000000001s)]
*  I was like I thought it was so strange. We kept being told all these things school is dangerous the kids [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5262.4400000000005s)]
*  They might spread it to everyone and all these various claims. I'm like, wait a minute [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5267.64s)]
*  Is that true and I couldn't speak to people in the united states? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5271.400000000001s)]
*  So I started talking to experts in europe and i'm like, let me find someone anyone who knows what's going on [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5274.4400000000005s)]
*  And I was like, well, wait a minute. This is all bullshit. Everything they're saying is made up [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5279.8s)]
*  I know there might be some listeners or viewers who are thinking that i'm overstating things [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5284.200000000001s)]
*  They might think that like this is hyperbole [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5288.280000000001s)]
*  If you i'm telling you if you read the book, it's it's deeply destabilizing [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5290.84s)]
*  but I hope also really instructive to see how [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5295.96s)]
*  Wildly off so much of the information we were given was and it's easy for the media to make these claims [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5300.18s)]
*  Trump's you know, trump said plenty of crazy things himself or he oh the virus is just going to go away [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5307.24s)]
*  And you know and there was they they misquoted him about the bleach thing and whatever else there are plenty of crazy things [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5312.360000000001s)]
*  It's not hard to find something from trump or from qanon or whatever and that's where the media kind of dug its hooks in [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5318.6s)]
*  But what but what no one was doing was looking of course with the mirror at themselves [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5324.76s)]
*  And it's much more upsetting when the experts I don't listen to qanon [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5329.56s)]
*  I don't take my you know guidance on how to conduct myself or what's happening [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5334.36s)]
*  But I used to listen to the cdc I used to listen to the nih and what I show is that these people [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5338.28s)]
*  deeply deeply let us down I um [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5344.759999999999s)]
*  I will defend trump on that. It's just going to go away because I [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5348.679999999999s)]
*  Have a doctor who is an infectious disease doctor [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5352.44s)]
*  That's just my primary care physician happens to be and he's one of the most respected infectious disease doctors in the country [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5355.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's what he said in the beginning too the history of this kind of disease [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5362.36s)]
*  Suggested that when you got to the warmer weather it would kill the virus seasonality [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5366.5s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what a lot of people believed and I think that's what trump was advised early on obviously trump wasn't just making that up [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5371.08s)]
*  He was getting that from doctors and then of course things changed [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5377.08s)]
*  But I remember when he said it being like that dovetails exactly with what my doctor said and I didn't I didn't think [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5379.64s)]
*  Anything of it, you know now now in retrospect it's used against him by his detractors [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5385.96s)]
*  But at the time it dovetailed very well with a lot of what we knew all right stand by there's more to go again [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5389.88s)]
*  It's called an abundance of caution with the yellow tape. It's actually quite well done by david swig [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5395.8s)]

*  It's not really about covet exactly. It's about how [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5534.5199999999995s)]
*  deeply we were betrayed by our public health officials and the media and [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5537.88s)]
*  It's got all the lessons so that we can fight them better the next time [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5543.88s)]
*  I mean there were some of us who were fighting them and some people who fought them at every turn [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5547.0s)]
*  but it was very hard because [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5551.639999999999s)]
*  Part of half the battle was trying to figure out what was true and you just stayed to an evidence-based approach [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5554.12s)]
*  now the problem in doing that is that [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5559.16s)]
*  You had a whole government apparatus that didn't like your information [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5561.5599999999995s)]
*  And even when you david zweig were citing the cdc's own studies like on masking and how it didn't do anything in schools [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5564.759999999999s)]
*  that [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5574.759999999999s)]
*  They didn't listen. They buried the studies. They moved on they tried to diminish people like you [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5575.639999999999s)]
*  And I was mentioning during the break [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5581.16s)]
*  The great movie contagion which I really enjoyed with guanapaldo and matt damon which was made years ago [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5583.16s)]
*  But clearly they used the cdc's blueprint for what they would do in a pandemic was really telling and they [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5588.759999999999s)]
*  even had [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5594.44s)]
*  this like [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5595.639999999999s)]
*  sort of citizen journalist played by jud law now [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5596.839999999999s)]
*  He wasn't like you or alex barron said this guy wound up hawking supplements and trying to make money off of the pandemic [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5600.5199999999995s)]
*  But they did sort of use him as like the one detractor the one lone voice pushing back [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5607.0s)]
*  And in that movie is very interesting because he's they demonize him right like you shouldn't believe the doubting thomas [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5613.0s)]
*  because he's he's a [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5620.2s)]
*  He's a hack who's trying to make money off of you. He's got some angle [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5622.2s)]
*  He's the one person you shouldn't listen to right? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5625.5599999999995s)]
*  You should listen to the authorities and that's what they try to do to alex barron [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5627.72s)]
*  So they try to do to you they try to do to tucker, right? [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5631.0s)]
*  Like try to just ignore or in some cases actively diminish or fringe or ban on twitter in alex's case, right? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5633.5599999999995s)]
*  They didn't like these contrary voices or the great barrington people like fringe try to you know, tramp down on them [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5640.04s)]
*  So that people looking for good information [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5646.04s)]
*  Either couldn't find it it had been stifled it had been censored or had like a sense of [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5649.34s)]

*  Plenty of these types of contrarian pieces and she said well, where's the article? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5739.42s)]
*  Where's it coming out and my wife said it may have been in my my sub stack or the free bet [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5743.58s)]
*  She said well if it's not in the atlantic then I don't believe it and she said but it's david. You you know him [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5747.179999999999s)]
*  He's the same reporter. He wrote other things and she was like, yeah, i'm not interested [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5751.74s)]
*  It's not so to have that like imprimatur of these certain institutions [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5755.82s)]
*  Meant everything. Yeah, and and this the problem is the idea that like [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5761.2s)]
*  Most I think regular people at least some of them or on particularly on the left [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5767.28s)]
*  Saw these things are like it made intuitive sense. It's like well, of course if you're close school [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5772.4s)]
*  So those snot-nosed kids that's gonna help or mask. I think maybe having something in front of my face like [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5777.44s)]
*  The problem is and I give all these like crazy examples through history [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5783.28s)]
*  Our intuitions are often wrong and that happens especially within medicine [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5786.96s)]
*  That's why we need randomized studies. That's why we need actual like a structured what's known as evidence-based medicine [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5792.8s)]
*  But instead during the pandemic over and over we were just told the it's basic physics that masks work [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5799.360000000001s)]
*  But that's not how human beings work. They my child might pull it off. It doesn't stay glued to your face [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5805.76s)]
*  They were using studies done on mannequins where the masks were glued to their face [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5810.96s)]
*  Right and this is the stuff that the cdc and other people were citing as evidence that everyone needs to wear a mask [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5815.04s)]
*  Our intuitions are wrong all the time, but yet we didn't actually look at science [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5821.12s)]
*  We were told we're just following the science [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5826.24s)]
*  There was no following the science [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5828.32s)]
*  It's bad enough when we are seriously hurting children when we're not being allowed to say goodbye to our loved ones who are dying [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5829.84s)]
*  In nursing homes alone and isolated [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5836.16s)]
*  and then came [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5839.4400000000005s)]
*  Like the final insult which was the deceptions around the vaccine [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5841.36s)]
*  And the total unwillingness to discuss the actual side effects that were happening to people including [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5845.92s)]
*  Most importantly to me the myocarditis because that was killing young people that was hurting young people [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5851.5199999999995s)]
*  You know everybody's life matters, but it's there's a different value in somebody who's 90 versus somebody who's 15 [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5857.679999999999s)]
*  and [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5862.96s)]
*  They were seeing actual [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5863.759999999999s)]
*  Myocarditis heart infections happened to teenage boys as a result of the vaccines and you were [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5866.08s)]
*  Basically not allowed to talk about it [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5872.320000000001s)]
*  Even now even now youtube's gonna slap a warning video on this video because I said that and it's a fact [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5873.84s)]
*  And yet they still still want to bill it as though it's somehow misinformation. I always thought [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5880.64s)]
*  That if there's something that wrong with the vaccines the the vaccine makers will come back and fix it [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5887.6s)]
*  They'll own it and they'll fix it. These are the biggest most rich [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5892.16s)]
*  Vaccine or drug companies in the world [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5895.76s)]
*  I never anticipated that they would just deny deny deny deny and let people suffer and even die [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5898.08s)]
*  I mean I was I believe the first journalist in a mainstream publication to interview [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5904.72s)]
*  Juro Mvorac was the israeli physician who initially found the signal of myocarditis [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5909.6s)]
*  in young males [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5915.84s)]
*  And you know again, this is just [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5917.280000000001s)]
*  completely radioactive like you can it doesn't mean that the vaccines [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5920.06s)]
*  Weren't necessarily beneficial for old people and those who are vulnerable. I'm not making that statement [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5924.66s)]
*  I'm not talking about that one way or the other what is true [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5930.179999999999s)]
*  Is that there is this effect from the vaccine particularly for young males not exclusively to them [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5933.86s)]
*  But they were affected far more than any other group and there's reasons for that. We don't need to get into [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5939.46s)]
*  And this was essentially ignored and kind of like buried by the cdc when the signal came out and I give examples of that [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5944.98s)]
*  I mean the thing that's interesting is setting that aside how these sort of danger signals were buried [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5952.5s)]
*  teachers [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5959.38s)]
*  Were prioritized for vaccines in much of the country in many locations [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5960.5s)]
*  Yet they still didn't go back to school in many locations even after that [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5966.02s)]
*  So they were put ahead of sometimes more vulnerable people and you can look this up. This isn't me making this up [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5970.34s)]
*  This isn't a conspiracy theory [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5976.1s)]
*  You can see the different levels of sort of priority that the cdc and you know various [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5977.78s)]
*  Help governing bodies put out they prioritize teachers in many locations. Okay, I got it [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5983.78s)]
*  You want to be protected and they still didn't go back to school [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5989.38s)]
*  But meanwhile and this goes back to what we talked about in the very beginning how class-based [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5992.58s)]
*  The whole entire pandemic response was I only have a minute left. Okay, I gotta interrupt you [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=5997.46s)]
*  Final thoughts on Fauci and what his legacy in all this should be well, he's pardoned. So there's that I I don't [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6002.259999999999s)]
*  I don't suggest that there was criminal behavior. I don't know enough about you know, those angles what I would say is [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6011.62s)]
*  Fauci was sort of the the the figurehead he was the face of the response [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6018.5s)]
*  Um in in our country and anthony Fauci along with many many others [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6023.0599999999995s)]
*  Overstated evidence over and over again and they said kids couldn't go back to school until it was safe [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6028.02s)]
*  With a contrived list of reasons and that there was never any support behind them [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6034.82s)]
*  And not only was there not support for them [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6039.7s)]
*  We had an enormous amount of evidence right across the atlantic showing millions of children in school without [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6041.7s)]
*  Consequence without doing any of this stuff. He funded eco health alliance [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6049.04s)]
*  Which very well may have been behind the research that caused the pandemic [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6052.74s)]
*  He appears to have lied repeatedly to congress while under oath [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6056.18s)]
*  That's why he needed a pardon and yeah, he's villain number one in my view [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6060.18s)]
*  But there's so many to choose from don't forget to buy this book. It's called an abundance of caution american schools [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6064.34s)]
*  The virus and a story of bad decisions david zweig z-w-e-i-g great to see you. Thanks megan [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6069.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay tomorrow the show steve bannon and nancy grace. There's a combo [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq7tfsycKG8&t=6075.14s)]
