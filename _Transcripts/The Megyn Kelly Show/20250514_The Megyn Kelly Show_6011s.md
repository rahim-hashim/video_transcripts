Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Kmele Foster, Michael Moynihan, and Matt Welch, co-hosts of The Fifth Column podcast, to discuss the ongoing rollout of the "Original Sin" Biden book, the left and corporate media covering up Biden’s cognitive decline, new details about what was really happening behind-the-scenes,  real examples of the corporate media’s spin about Biden’s decline for years, their lies and culpability in the cover-up, comedians and non-partisans knowing Biden was mentally unfit for years before it was acceptable to say it, the elite left continuing their Biden lies, Trump's historic speech laying out a new foreign policy vision, his focus on peace and slamming past nation-building from the GOP and America, the disgusting allegations and details revealed at the Diddy trial, whether the prosecution has proven criminality or just bad behavior, and more.

# Biden Cognitive Cover-Up Exposed, Trump's Historic Peace Speech, and Diddy Latest, with Fifth Column
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Wow. What a day yesterday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump currently in Qatar as part of his historic trip to the Middle East, where [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=6.32s)]
*  he's laying out a vision. I mean, he's laying out his foreign policy vision. It's incredible. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=10.96s)]
*  You should definitely go and watch it on YouTube when you can. He, he soup to nuts, said what [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=15.92s)]
*  he believes and why he's doing the things he's doing, that he is after an era of peace [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=23.56s)]
*  and prosperity saying, I don't like war. I mean, it seems like something you wouldn't [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=30.52s)]
*  have to say, but you kind of do. Given the history, let's be honest, of the Republican [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=36.12s)]
*  party in recent years, it's already getting incredible results. We're going to show you [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=42.08s)]
*  the highlights of the speech with the main, which the mainstream media is all but ignoring. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  I mean, it's very little coverage of this in Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, this is like, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=49.92s)]
*  this is a watershed moment. It seems pretty clear to me. This is a watershed moment for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=54.300000000000004s)]
*  our country, the Republican party and the dawn of a new era. Yes, his election, but [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=59.44s)]
*  this is him pointing the sails and letting us know where he's taking the United States. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=65.4s)]
*  And it sounded amazing. I mean, I was really moved by parts of what he said. It was a very [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=73.2s)]
*  honest assessment of some of the things we've done. It wasn't an apology tour like Barack [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=78.88000000000001s)]
*  Obama took. He wasn't saying he was sorry for anything, but he was free about criticizing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=84.42s)]
*  prior U.S. decisions without naming presidential names. I think out of deference to mostly [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  George W. Bush, but also Obama to some extent as well. And he's no fan of Joe Biden. That [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=96.44s)]
*  was kind of mentioned too. Plus the Democratic party's going through hell week with the renewed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=102.16s)]
*  focus on Joe Biden. They thought they were done with him, but now all these books come [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=106.86s)]
*  not letting it die. And the most latest, the most recent book is the one by Jake Tapper [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=112.05999999999999s)]
*  and Alex Thompson. It's called Original Sin. And they're going to be on this show on Tuesday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=117.86s)]
*  I'm actually really looking forward to this. Let me just tell you something about it because [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=121.78s)]
*  I know Jake personally, and I've told you guys before, we're friendly. I help him with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=125.58s)]
*  his veterans charity and I respect the work he's done to help vets over the many years. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=129.82s)]
*  Our politics are very, very different, but I respect him and I respect the work he does [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=135.04s)]
*  in that department and I like him. But it's going to be a contentious interview because, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=139.2s)]
*  well, you know all the reasons why and he knows that. Okay. He knows that. I think he's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  looking forward to the opportunity to defend himself. So he's coming to the right place. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=150.6s)]
*  Somebody who doesn't hate him, who knows all the criticisms about him writing this book, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=156.28s)]
*  who will raise them. Don't worry. I will, but am also interested in the contents of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=162.24s)]
*  the book, unlike the left, which doesn't want to discuss them or to the extent they do want [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  to discuss them. They only want to use them to say, Kamala could have won Kamala. She [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=171.36s)]
*  would have had it in the bag had it not been for the evil Biden. Well, we have a different [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=177.72s)]
*  agenda, which is truth. Kamala would not have won if Biden had dropped out earlier. I have [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  She's a uniquely horrible politician. And so I don't buy that spin, but I think Jake Tapper [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=186.76s)]
*  and Alex Thompson, and you know, I've been critical of him too, getting up there saying, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=193.84s)]
*  we missed it. You know, he says, I covered it, got this award. We didn't miss anything. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=197.84s)]
*  Right? So we're going to go over all that. There's nothing, there's no holds barred. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=203.84s)]
*  There's nothing off the table. And I predict it will be the most interesting interview [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=207.6s)]
*  they give on their book day launch, which is again, this Tuesday. Joining me now for the full show today, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  guys, I know you love, and that's my friends from the fifth column podcast, Camille Foster, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  editor at large at Tangle News, Michael Moynihan, host of Two Ways, The Moynihan Report, and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=223.44s)]
*  Matt Welsh of Reason Magazine. Find their work and subscribe at wethefifth.com. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=228.44s)]
*  Next, since President Trump's election, the eyes of the nation have been on Mar-a-Lago [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=241.84s)]
*  and the free state of Florida. It is a thriving, booming place. South Florida is a special [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=246.0s)]
*  place because of its amazing water for boating, swimming, fishing, and drinking. Well, today, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=251.12s)]
*  clean water is endangered by toxic algae. Did you know that? You may have heard of red tide [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=256.16s)]
*  or blue green algae. It can be dangerous and it can be gross. In his first term, President [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=261.68s)]
*  Trump signed a law to solve the problem with a new reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee to keep [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=267.2s)]
*  clean, fresh water flowing constantly to South Florida. President Trump said after years of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=273.76s)]
*  rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. Washington can finish the job in next [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  year's budget and keep President Trump's promise. The Everglades Foundation, our advertiser, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  says that would be very good for Florida and good for the Everglades. Learn more about [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=290.48s)]
*  President Trump's Everglades support project at EvergladesFoundation.org. Hi, guys. Great to have [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=295.52s)]
*  you. Hi, Megan. Thanks for having us. So do you think I'm doing the right thing by platforming [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=302.64s)]
*  Tapper and Thompson on their book? Absolutely. What are we even doing? You know how you love that term. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=309.84s)]
*  Thankfully, it's 2025 and people have kind of quietly dropped that for the most part as a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  stupid criticism. Now you have like the New York Times and Ezra Klein like, hmm, maybe we should [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=322.8s)]
*  talk to Steve Bannon after all. So yeah, you're doing the right thing and give them hell. And we, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=327.92s)]
*  I would say, speaking for the three of us, we like and know Alex Thompson especially, but also Jake [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Tapper. And it should be a thorough going exchange of ideas. Yes, I think it will be. And I, no one's [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  under any pretenses that it's going to be anything else, right? It's like, what I say about Jake and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  Alex and them writing this book, it goes out of this microphone. It's not like I'm just whispering [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=351.44s)]
*  it in Doug's ear. You know, I've been pretty open about my thoughts on the media cover up of Joe [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=355.76s)]
*  Biden's problems. So we'll do all that. But I will say if you're looking for it to be done through a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=362.08s)]
*  hateful lens where I just emerge with these two left in a puddle of blood, that that's not going [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=367.2s)]
*  to happen. I mean, I will be respectful to them as I am to anybody who does me the courtesy of swinging [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=372.64s)]
*  by the podcast. You know, it's going to be contentious, but it's going to be robust and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=377.28s)]
*  meaningful and honest and unsparing, but hopefully cordial in a way that makes them feel respected [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=381.11999999999995s)]
*  and glad they came, but makes the audience also glad they came by. You know what I mean? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you can also say that people were, shall we say, very, very slow on this story [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=395.11999999999995s)]
*  that over the fifth column we figured out in 2021, maybe 2020. Maybe this guy's a little too old to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  be president, but I'll give our friend Alex Thompson some credit because when he was doing it, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  you know, regardless of the speech at the correspondence dinner, which I didn't listen [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=415.67999999999995s)]
*  to the whole thing, so I can't really comment on, but he was telling us off the record then, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  and I think on the record now, that he was like being attacked pretty brutally by people [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=423.67999999999995s)]
*  within the administration for the reporting that he was doing starting in, I think, 2023 about the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=428.88s)]
*  See, I'm interested in hearing that. I am interested in hearing him elaborate about that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=436.08s)]
*  So he's got a lot of stories about that. Yeah. Yeah, they went after him pretty much. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=439.52s)]
*  That's the thing, and I also do want to hear the stories like, as much as we're all like, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=442.24s)]
*  oh my God, how is Jake Tapper writing a book about, you know, that I do want to hear what [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  Jake Tapper found because I think he's probably got sources a lot closer to Joe Biden than I do, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, so it's almost like you need these media figures to do this to some extent because [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=456.16s)]
*  I'm not that we didn't know, but aren't you interested in the details of how bad it was? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=462.96000000000004s)]
*  I am. I'm reading all these excerpts, not just from this book, but from them all the four [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=467.36s)]
*  voraciously. I'm like, I just feel so validated. I'm sure you guys feel it too. It's like, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  we knew, right? And then now you get the specifics of how right you were. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=475.6s)]
*  Yeah. And I haven't read the book yet, so I feel a little bit at a disadvantage trying to comment [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=480.48s)]
*  on it, but I do plan to, and as the guys have mentioned, we've talked to Alex about this [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=484.96s)]
*  number of times during the period when he was getting a lot of criticism from outside. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=488.88s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to understate the consequences of groupthink and its ability to make you not see [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=493.2s)]
*  things that you don't want to see anyways. So that is almost certainly a huge part of what happened [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  in DC. But from the excerpts that we read already, the coordinated effort on the part of the Biden [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=504.96s)]
*  administration to try and obscure the fact that the president was in fading health and just kind [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=510.48s)]
*  of waning in terms of his actual capacities towards the end, but really throughout his [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=515.76s)]
*  administration is one, again, not surprising to us, but is really revealing to kind of read out in [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=521.36s)]
*  the open like that. The disagreements between George Clooney and others, the kind of exercise [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=528.08s)]
*  of going through writing that letter, the fact that people were privately saying one thing about [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=533.44s)]
*  Joe Biden and what they knew was wrong and publicly saying quite another thing. It's not [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=537.52s)]
*  just politics as usual, or perhaps it is, but that should make one very cynical and deeply concerned. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=543.04s)]
*  I think there's been a lot of kind of suggestion that the blame here is with the party who lied [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=548.96s)]
*  or with the administration who lied. But as we've all pointed out already, a lot of the blame is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=553.84s)]
*  with the mainstream media who just did not do their jobs for whatever reasons. And those reasons are [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=559.12s)]
*  often complicated and can't simply be boiled down to, I don't think, contempt for Republicans or [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=564.0s)]
*  conservatives more broadly. It's a little bit more complicated than that, I think. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=570.08s)]
*  So this is what the value, I think, the book's bringing, this book and the others. None of us [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=574.48s)]
*  is going to soften on the media. I mean, I think that's the reality. Like, we know. Anybody who's [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=581.6s)]
*  an independent journalist or right-of-center knows exactly what the media did with this story. We know. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=586.24s)]
*  But I personally would like to see some sort of congressional investigation, like an actual [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  commission looking into who was president, how bad was it, who covered up, who lied about the mental [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=596.24s)]
*  fitness of the sitting commander-in-chief who had access to the nuclear codes. We need a serious, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  maybe even bipartisan commission to actually get to the bottom of this. And so big books by [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  Democrats and their media enablers are helpful in that particular regard. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=616.4s)]
*  The left does need to be aware that, I know they weren't willing participants in the lie, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=621.36s)]
*  but they need to be aware of just how bad it was. And this needs to be shoved down their throats [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  so that they can't just be like, oh, it's backward looking, which is what they're saying now. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=632.56s)]
*  Fuck you when you're backward looking. We had a sitting president who was a vegetable. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=635.92s)]
*  We need an investigation. No, you can't just dismiss it and pretend like it didn't happen [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=639.84s)]
*  by saying backward looking. It's here right now. And I realize it's brand damaging for the Democrats. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=644.24s)]
*  I don't care if it has to be just a singular party investigation, then so be it. But we do need to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=649.36s)]
*  get to the bottom of it. In line with what you just said, Camille, here's Jake Tapper speaking. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=654.8s)]
*  The book, they published an excerpt in The New Yorker and the advance copy was obtained by [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=660.8s)]
*  The Guardian and Axios has a piece of it. That's where Alex Thompson's from. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=668.64s)]
*  And so the news reports are already hitting. So Jake gave an interview on his own network CNN [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  speaking to the lies. That was his word yesterday, Sat 1. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=677.44s)]
*  Well, Alex Thompson and I were on the case as were lots of other reporters trying to figure out what [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=680.88s)]
*  was going on behind the scenes. But the bottom line is the White House was lying not only to the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=686.32s)]
*  press, not only to the public, but they were lying to members of their own cabinet. They were lying [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=692.4s)]
*  to White House staffers. They were lying to Democratic members of Congress, to donors about [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=697.04s)]
*  how bad things had gotten. And in fact, Alex and I started writing this book after the election [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=703.12s)]
*  of 2024. And we spoke with more than 200 people, most of whom, almost all of whom were Democrats [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=709.12s)]
*  and almost all of whom wouldn't be honest with us or wouldn't be candid with us until after the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=717.04s)]
*  election. And then after the election, we found out all of these things that when you looked at [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=721.84s)]
*  what was going on with President Biden at the time, it probably doesn't surprise you the extent to [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=727.52s)]
*  which he was deteriorating. But now we have anecdotes and facts about what was really going [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=732.4s)]
*  on behind the scenes with details that Democrats wouldn't share with us until after election day. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=736.64s)]
*  Is anyone shocked? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=744.64s)]
*  I mean, and let's keep in mind also that a lot of the quotes, at least that we've seen in the New [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=746.4000000000001s)]
*  Yorker piece, are still anonymous. Which is like campaign operative said and high profile Democrats [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=751.44s)]
*  said, we're not going to get anywhere close to fixing the ills and the rot that allowed this to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=758.72s)]
*  happen without some actual accountability and honesty. I think there's an interesting comp of [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=765.2s)]
*  a book that's out now. Megan, you interviewed David Zweig, as did we, at the fifth column, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=771.84s)]
*  about his book, An Abundance of Caution, which looks back at why did we basically close schools [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=777.04s)]
*  when the rest of the world had figured out that we shouldn't during COVID? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=781.4399999999999s)]
*  Boiling it down very quickly. But the media was very complicit in that. The elites were very [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=784.88s)]
*  complicit in that. And part of his approach and understanding is like, hey, look, this can happen [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=790.3199999999999s)]
*  again in a different way. We need an autopsy of this so we can figure this out. Historians are [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=795.68s)]
*  going to be looking at this for a long time, just as they did with FDR's 1944 election, when he was [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=800.64s)]
*  dying of congestive heart failure with Woodrow Wilson having a stroke in the White House. We had [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=806.4s)]
*  Dr. Joe Biden chairing cabinet meetings. And then the few that Biden was chairing, they put the names [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  so that he could see them. But we need to know exactly the habits of mind that allowed that kind [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=819.12s)]
*  of delusion. I'm reading the New Yorker story and I want to throw brick through my own window. It's [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=827.76s)]
*  making me so infuriated because what is happening here? This is less than 12 months ago. Her report [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=833.68s)]
*  is already out in February saying that he's an old man and he's feeble. The Wall Street Journal [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=841.5999999999999s)]
*  is doing good reporting. One of the only outlets out there doing good reporting. And they are [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=846.4799999999999s)]
*  getting absolutely slammed by the Joe Scarboroughs of the world and a lot of other people besides on [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=850.4s)]
*  cable news and elsewhere as like, oh, well, it's Murdoch owned and they're bad and we can't be [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  trusted. We were literally talking 12 months ago about cheap fakes. People who were in the audience [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=860.64s)]
*  when Joe Biden had no idea where he was, where Barack Obama is guiding him off, oh, okay, this way. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=867.28s)]
*  And when Fox News and other right of center organizations were pointing out like, wow, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=873.92s)]
*  that looks bad. They're like, oh, that's selectively edited cheap fakes. It is those [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=879.28s)]
*  habits of mind among journalists, let alone Democrats that we need to sort of re- [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=883.84s)]
*  Let me show one. Let me show one. Here's Brian Stelter, June 19th, 2024. We are five days [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=889.92s)]
*  before the debate, which I believe was June 24th if memory serves, but we are within days of that [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=900.88s)]
*  fall down debate. And here's Brian Stelter trying to dismiss all these terrible videos of Biden with [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=907.04s)]
*  his aggressively deteriorating decline. Sat 15. We've been worried for years about AI deep fakes [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=913.28s)]
*  that computer generated images are going to trick people into believing something that's totally [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=919.36s)]
*  false. Cheap fakes are a little bit simpler. They're cheap. They're just distorted, out of context [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=922.72s)]
*  videos, chopped up in certain ways. The Biden administration, the Biden campaign is so worried [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=927.6800000000001s)]
*  about right now, but make no mistake, they are worried about this. This is a real problem. This [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=932.08s)]
*  is not some made up fiction. The videos are oftentimes made up, but the problem is real. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=936.16s)]
*  Oh my God. No, it's a made up problem. That's in fact a made up problem, Brian. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=942.24s)]
*  He said that. I'm sorry to point that out to you. Yeah. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=948.8s)]
*  It's amazing he said that. They actually were spinning. The debate was the 27th on CNN and [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=951.28s)]
*  elsewhere, not just there, MS of course, that really the problem here is not at all Joe Biden. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=957.6s)]
*  It's these terrible right wing cheap fakes that are manufactured and not believable fake videos [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=964.72s)]
*  of the alleged decline. It's incredible. This is not long after that Clooney fundraiser, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=972.24s)]
*  which is detailed in this new book. It's horrifying. Again, we knew that, we knew that, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=978.0s)]
*  but more details about just how horrifying it was. Let me just give you a couple and then I'll give [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=984.24s)]
*  back to you, Moynihan. Highlights. Biden did not recognize George Clooney at this June 15th [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=990.0s)]
*  fundraiser. To me, it's so funny because this is of course what led George Clooney to be like, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=996.4s)]
*  oh my God, he's really too far gone. He doesn't know me. Everyone knows me. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1000.88s)]
*  But I mean, in his defense, he is world recognizable. Okay. Biden hobbled out from [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  around the corner. Clooney knew the president had just arrived from the G7 leaders summit in Italy [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1011.12s)]
*  and might be a little tired, but holy shit, he wasn't expecting this. I'm quoting here. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1015.52s)]
*  The president appeared severely diminished as if he'd aged a decade since Clooney last saw him in [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1019.2s)]
*  December, 2022. He was taking tiny steps and AIDS seemed to be guiding him by the arm. It was like [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1023.52s)]
*  watching someone who was not alive, recalled a Hollywood VIP. It was startling. We all looked [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1028.4s)]
*  at each other. It was so awful. Thank you for being here. The president said to guests as he [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1033.4399999999998s)]
*  shuffled past them. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. Clooney felt a knot [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1037.6799999999998s)]
*  form in his stomach. As the president approached him, Biden looked at him. Thank you for being here. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1041.6799999999998s)]
*  Thank you for being here. You know, George, the assisting aid told the president gently reminding [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1046.8s)]
*  him who was in front of him. Yeah. Yeah. The president said to one of the most recognizable [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1053.04s)]
*  men in the world, the host of this lucrative fundraiser. Thank you for being here. Hi, Mr. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  President. Clooney said, how are you? The president replied. How was your trip? Clooney asked. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1063.8400000000001s)]
*  Fine. The president said, it seemed clear that the president had not recognized George Clooney. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1069.92s)]
*  It was not okay. Recalled the Hollywood VIP who had witnessed the moment that thing, the moment [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1075.44s)]
*  where you recognize someone, you know, especially a famous person who's doing a fucking fundraiser [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1080.16s)]
*  for you. It was delayed. It was uncomfortable. George Clooney, the aid clarified for president [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1085.2s)]
*  Biden. Oh yeah. Biden said, hi George. Clooney was shaken to his core. By the way, he would not come [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  out with his story until after that debate, until after it was clear Joe Biden was imploding and [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1097.92s)]
*  wouldn't step aside. He's a fucking coward. Sorry. A lot of F-bombs. My apologies. The president hadn't [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1102.24s)]
*  recognized him, a man he had known for years. And then they go on to say other June 15th, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1107.68s)]
*  LA fundraiser attendees were also concerned. They described Biden as slow and almost catatonic. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1114.24s)]
*  There were obvious brain freezes and clear signs of a mental slide. It was to some of them, quote, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1122.8s)]
*  terrifying. Obama, who was there, decided that the fault lay with Biden's busy schedule. But [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1129.04s)]
*  Obama would come to realize the scheduling was not the fundamental problem. Okay. Go ahead, Wynne. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1136.32s)]
*  I love the included detail that he's known George Clooney for years. It's George Clooney. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1143.04s)]
*  He could have known him for five minutes. It's like the guy's in Ocean's Eleven. It's not like [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1150.08s)]
*  Michael Thomas from Miami Vice or something. It's George Clooney. You can't recognize that. You can't [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1155.04s)]
*  run for president. It's done. It's over. It's funny too, by the way, is it pointing out this [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1160.24s)]
*  like BC and AD thing about the debate? I looked this morning at a bunch of stuff from [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1165.36s)]
*  after the debate, immediately after the debate. Biden calls in to Joe Scarborough, like a phone [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  call. Please listeners to the Meg and Kelly show, go find these because everybody there is David [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1179.1999999999998s)]
*  Folkenflick on NPR. And they were like, Biden came back roaring. He was full of them and he was angry. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1186.56s)]
*  And it's like, so Teddy Ruxpin doll wasn't repeating, thanks for being here. Thanks for [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1192.32s)]
*  being here. He got angry for about five minutes. And they're like, I think it's done. But the [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1197.6s)]
*  best thing about this, and to Alex Thompson and Jake Tabber's book, to do this reporting [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1201.9199999999998s)]
*  of what's going on behind the scenes, you can't do in the way that they've done or appears the way [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1208.96s)]
*  I've done. I haven't read the books, I've read the excerpts in real time. You do it afterwards. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1213.76s)]
*  You do the reporting, you figure out what happened. So that is incredibly useful. But what is also [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1218.48s)]
*  useful, and I am maybe alone in this, is I'm happy that the press did what they did. I'm 1000% [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  happy and overjoyed by it. And the reason is, is because I have eyes, I have a television set, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1232.0800000000002s)]
*  I have ears, I have the internet, and all of us fucking knew this. It's not like they were hiding [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1238.72s)]
*  something that we couldn't see. So we saw it. So what is the result of this? Well, we see that the [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1244.88s)]
*  people that are stumping for him in the media are doing something, they're lying directly to you, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1250.4s)]
*  and they're saying, you're seeing something that you're not saying. You're gaslighting. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1256.0s)]
*  It's true gaslighting. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1259.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm happy. Because it's not like we wouldn't have known this otherwise. We knew it. There's a poll [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1260.64s)]
*  in 2021. 2021 goes to eight months after Biden became president of, I think it was a Pew poll, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  an American saying that they didn't think he was very sharp, that he had lost a few steps. I can't [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1273.52s)]
*  remember the phrasing of the question. But the thing that makes everybody angry, it makes people [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1277.92s)]
*  maybe come to the Megyn Kelly show and get pissed off at the media, is not that they're saying, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1283.36s)]
*  all right, well, you know, I think he can tough it out. It's the fact that Joe Scarborough said, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1288.0s)]
*  in May of last year, I've never seen him better. This is the best I've ever seen him. When did you [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1293.68s)]
*  meet him? Two days before? What are you talking about? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1299.92s)]
*  Best you've ever seen him? He's falling asleep on stage. He doesn't know who anyone is. It's like, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1303.92s)]
*  I feel bad for the guy. But you're saying he's the best that he's ever been. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1308.72s)]
*  Here's a little more, a little more. They say in this book that Biden's limitations got worse [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1312.16s)]
*  throughout his presidency and he was worse in private than he was in public. You mean it wasn't [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1318.48s)]
*  true when Corrine Jean-Pierre and the others were saying and Jen Psaki, they couldn't keep up with [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1325.6s)]
*  him behind the scenes. I'm shocked, shocked, but still I enjoy reading it. The real issue, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1330.72s)]
*  they write, wasn't his age per se. It was the clear limitations of his abilities, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1336.08s)]
*  which got worse throughout his presidency. I mean, I agree with that because President Trump is, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1340.32s)]
*  you know, 79 years old and he's doing just fine. What the public saw of his functioning was [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1344.08s)]
*  concerning. What was going on in private was worse. While Biden on a day in day out basis could [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1350.88s)]
*  certainly make decisions and assert some wisdom and act as president, there were several significant [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1356.4s)]
*  issues that complicated his presidency, a limit to the hours in which he could reliably function [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1361.52s)]
*  and an increasing number of moments when he seemed to freeze up, lose his train of thought, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1365.8400000000001s)]
*  forget the names of top aides or momentarily not remember friends he had known for decades. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1370.48s)]
*  Not to mention impairment to his ability to communicate ones unrelated to his lifelong [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1375.68s)]
*  stutter. An unnamed democratic strategist says Biden stole an election from the Dem Party and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1381.2s)]
*  guaranteed Trump's victory. It was an abomination, said the strategist, abomination. He stole an [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1385.44s)]
*  election from the Democratic Party. He stole it from the American people. And then they go on to [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1391.92s)]
*  say one of the people he forgot, he didn't forget his name, but he forgot why he was calling him, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1396.64s)]
*  was Chuck Schumer, then the Senate majority leader. Sometimes the president would call him and [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1402.64s)]
*  after some chitchat, admit, I'm quoting here, that he had forgotten why he called. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1409.92s)]
*  Sometimes he rambled, sometimes he forgot names. Schumer wasn't concerned about Biden's acuity, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1416.0800000000002s)]
*  but he was worried about the optics. Biden talked sluggishly. His voice was not just slower, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1421.2s)]
*  but oddly quieter, reminding Schumer of his mother who had had Parkinson's. His gait was slower. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1426.16s)]
*  And Schumer gets asked about this on TV, CNN, yesterday in SOT6. Listen here. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1433.28s)]
*  Because you lost a presidential election. And is that not Joe Biden's responsibility for deciding [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1463.28s)]
*  to run again? We're looking forward. Forward. That's it? That's it. All right. Senator Chuck [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1467.92s)]
*  Schumer, I know you got to go. I appreciate your time today. See you soon, I hope. Thank you. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1475.6s)]
*  Take care. Oh my God. Is that going to fly? I mean, this is another reason why I like the books [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1480.24s)]
*  being out. It is leading to some awkward moments where Democrats are being as Democrat and Democrat [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1487.52s)]
*  blood, right? Dem on Dem violence, Camille. Well, there's so much culpability to go around here. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1493.2s)]
*  You could talk about Joe Biden's responsibility and the fact that he shouldn't have run and that [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1499.68s)]
*  his administration tried to protect him. But Schumer and other prominent Democrats were well [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1503.44s)]
*  aware of Joe Biden's deficits very, very early on. We were having conversations about this back in [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1507.8400000000001s)]
*  2016, to be totally frank. There were questions about his ability to keep up with this job, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1513.28s)]
*  to do this job, to run an effective campaign. He did manage to squeak one out prior, but four [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1519.04s)]
*  years later, no one was surprised when he couldn't really do it. Had Schumer had the courage to say [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1523.76s)]
*  something, the opportunity to get to field a better candidate wasn't after a debate. It was [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  during the primaries and they didn't do anything. You heard radio silence from prominent Democrats. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1533.52s)]
*  I don't want to hear any of the nonsense about, well, he's the president. He gets to make the call. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1539.28s)]
*  You people are supposed to be in leadership positions. You're supposed to be dedicating [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1543.12s)]
*  yourselves to a life of service. And if you see someone who is clearly incapable of doing the job [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1546.48s)]
*  in a meaningful and serious way, fielding this person anyway, is going to have consequences for [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1551.84s)]
*  your party as it well should. You should be out of power. You should find yourself in the wilderness [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1556.56s)]
*  for a period of time and certain people should probably get fired. Speaking of Dem on Dem blood, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1560.8s)]
*  Chuck Todd weighed in on Chuck Schumer as follows, shot seven. He is among the people that are [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1566.56s)]
*  responsible for this. The leaders of the Democratic Party, the staff of the White House. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1576.4s)]
*  And I have to say, I find everybody now talking to these authors, get out of here, go home. You're [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1581.52s)]
*  part of the problem. Now you tell us. So I just, and I find, you know, the reason why the Democratic [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1587.8400000000001s)]
*  Party has less credibility today. Here's an unpopular president and the Democratic Party [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1593.52s)]
*  has a worse rating than the Republican Party with this catastrophic governance that we've seen over [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1598.0800000000002s)]
*  the last 120 days. And yet why is the Democratic Party in worse shape? Because of this distrust, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1603.92s)]
*  because of this, frankly, what the public feels as if the party leadership let them down and let them, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1609.52s)]
*  let this happen. He's as responsible as anybody else. He was a leader in the party. He could have [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1616.96s)]
*  said something sooner. What is Jonah? Chuck Todd had a show last year. He's like, he's not working [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1622.64s)]
*  Baskin and Robbins or something during the first administration. It's like, dude, you had a fucking [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1631.76s)]
*  TV show. Sorry, I'm just swearing. It's amazing. It's more gaslighting. Thanks for telling us now. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1636.0s)]
*  Thanks for telling us now. I know you don't have a show anymore, but you did then. I mean, this is [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1642.8799999999999s)]
*  insane. And also the Chuck Schumer thing, which I love. I mean, what journalists have to do, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1648.16s)]
*  and again, let's just ignore the fact that they ignored it in the past, just for a second, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1654.48s)]
*  and say, yes, it's your job right now to prosecute the case against the current Democratic [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1659.04s)]
*  leadership, especially somebody like Chuck Schumer, and push them on this. Tell the American people [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1663.68s)]
*  what you did. Tell the American people why you handed that election to Donald Trump. I think he [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1667.76s)]
*  probably would have won anyway. I mean, depending on, I don't think the Democrats could have run a [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1673.12s)]
*  candidate that would have beaten Trump, I mean, he won the popular vote, et cetera. But at the same [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1676.96s)]
*  time, it's like, he says, we got to move forward. We got to move forward. I mean, imagine being on [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1680.8799999999999s)]
*  trial for murder and going in front of the judge and it's like, I don't know, Your Honor, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1685.92s)]
*  I just want to move forward with everything. I don't want to dwell on that thing that I did. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1690.4s)]
*  It's like, no, you have to. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1694.0800000000002s)]
*  You have to live in the present. My therapist says that's what's best for me. It minimizes my [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  stress levels. It's amazing. I mean, actually, like Chuck Todd is going to go along with this [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1699.76s)]
*  fake gaslighting. Again, that word gets overused, but it's truly what's happening. With the Biden [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1703.68s)]
*  decline, they were actually saying, don't believe your lying eyes. Don't believe your lying ears. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1708.5600000000002s)]
*  He's fine. You're being lied to by cheap fake videos that aren't real. And now that, you know, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1712.8799999999999s)]
*  all of us who said that's bullshit, he's deteriorating have been validated and confirmed [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1719.2s)]
*  to be right. They're saying, we can't believe we were lied to. These are lies. They're to blame. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1723.76s)]
*  They're to blame. Except the fundamental problem with that position is that half of us in the [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1729.44s)]
*  media ecosystem, those who are independent and or right leaning, all saw it and reported on it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1737.68s)]
*  It cannot be a coverup if half of the journalistic ecosphere saw it and reported on it. Right? Like, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1745.52s)]
*  the fact that the first half is now pretending they never saw and are outraged because they [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1754.0s)]
*  were lied to doesn't excuse them because they've uttered the words coverup. That's what's so [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1759.44s)]
*  galling about the dynamic at play here. Also, like, you know, it's not just half of the media [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1765.92s)]
*  ecosystem. It's two thirds of Americans in 2022. Like, it's too old. More than half of registered [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1773.28s)]
*  Democrats consistently said, as of 2022, dude is too old. We should have other people running [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1780.3200000000002s)]
*  for president. That would be a better thing to do. And so, I mean, Kyle Smith, the great [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1786.0s)]
*  movie reviewer for National Review, Wall Street Journal. I love him. He's great. Had a comment [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1791.1999999999998s)]
*  yesterday in the wake of all of this tweeted out something like, you know, I guess there's a market [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1797.28s)]
*  for books where journalists try to figure out what Americans already concluded two years ago. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1802.08s)]
*  Part of what Chuck Dodd, I've seen him in the past. You know, I'm glad that he's on his discovery [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1811.04s)]
*  tour. It's ELO 1979 here. But it's part of it is that he he's one of the people who have said, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1816.08s)]
*  and I've heard this a lot, like, you know, I can't believe that the I trusted the insiders who told [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1824.08s)]
*  me he was doing well. I couldn't believe that they would. I feel burned. No, dude. Like there's when [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1829.1999999999998s)]
*  you are critiquing and covering power. And this is true of critiquing and covering Donald Trump as [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1835.1999999999998s)]
*  well. Different store set of stories. But you can't just take the word of people who are very [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1840.96s)]
*  near the throne of power that they're that they're not going to be operating according to their own [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1846.48s)]
*  sort of response to the incentives of wielding that power. You have to treat all of that with [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1853.28s)]
*  skepticism. You have to treat like I love the unnamed person who said that Biden totally screwed [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1857.3600000000001s)]
*  us. They left the unnamed person named David Plouffe. That's who that was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1861.44s)]
*  That my life savings, which admittedly isn't that much that that was David Plouffe. And of course, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1866.0s)]
*  he's the guy who squandered a billion dollars trying to elect Kamala Harris by not having her [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1870.24s)]
*  give a single. True. I mean, he's been he I have to say David Plouffe has been pretty rich in these [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1874.72s)]
*  excerpts of the book. Like they asked us they absolutely F'd us. Of course, he's looking to [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1880.16s)]
*  pass the blame on his colossal historic loss, his absolutely terrible implosion as he tried to sell [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1885.44s)]
*  this lady. Yes, you do. You got to take responsibility for what happened in your [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1894.64s)]
*  campaign to Plouffe tried to sell that lady to us as the next Obama, right? He's a liar too. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1903.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, but like his gaslighting is just as bad as the others. Like we could have done it if we [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1910.24s)]
*  had more than 107 days. No, you had honestly one of the probably the worst presidential candidate [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1915.0400000000002s)]
*  in U.S. history. Sarah Palin looked like an Einstein next to that total moron who tried to [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1922.0s)]
*  sell to us. You know what? One thing I think is important to mention here with respect to [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1928.96s)]
*  like the Correspondence Association and the speech that that I stayed there is that that they're [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1935.1200000000001s)]
*  them finding religion and him saying clearly we make we missed the mark here. We made some mistakes. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1940.5600000000002s)]
*  It's not obvious they don't have to do this. There's a world where you just try to ignore this [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1947.52s)]
*  when you just don't talk about it anymore. That's the world that we live in when it comes to a lot [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1953.04s)]
*  of the mistakes made during the pandemic. That's the world that we live in when it comes to the [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1957.12s)]
*  insanity of 2020 from that's true. That's a good point. May on through the end of the year. In fact, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1960.3999999999999s)]
*  right up to January when we had some similar craziness on the right, which we seem to imagine [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1966.72s)]
*  happened in a vacuum, but no, we all kind of lost our minds there and we do not talk about it. We [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1972.1599999999999s)]
*  don't talk about the political failure. We don't talk about the failure of the media during those [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1977.4399999999998s)]
*  periods. Those are things that happen and have still continued to happen. So the fact that people [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1980.48s)]
*  are actually talking about this, that some of them are even willing to look in the mirror, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1985.6799999999998s)]
*  accept some responsibility for having gotten this wrong is important and worthwhile to bear in mind. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1989.9199999999998s)]
*  And again, it's why I say that I think it's a little more complicated than just saying, well, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1994.8s)]
*  it's obvious, you know, political bias is what motivated this. Well, political bias is motivating [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=1998.48s)]
*  that other thing too, at least in part, but we don't talk about it at all anymore. So I do think [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2002.8s)]
*  that especially that what you suggested earlier, Megan, an actual inquiry from this officially, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2007.84s)]
*  formally something bipartisan and trustworthy, something that's transparent, that's more [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2012.88s)]
*  interested in getting at what the hell happened than just finding someone to blame is really [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2017.2s)]
*  valuable and would be valuable for all of the aforementioned things. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2022.56s)]
*  We did what you wanted us to do in part, and we found President Biden calling into Morning Joe [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2027.12s)]
*  the day after that June debate. Here we go. Let's take a listen. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2033.6s)]
*  Fiery Joe. Yeah. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2036.8799999999999s)]
*  I am not going anywhere. I wouldn't be running if I didn't absolutely believe [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2038.3999999999999s)]
*  that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024. We had a democratic nominating process [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2043.52s)]
*  for the voters. So clearly I won 14 million of those votes, et cetera. So I just want, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2049.44s)]
*  I'm not only believe that from the beginning, but I wanted to reassert and demonstrate that it's true. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2056.16s)]
*  And I'm going to be doing that all through this weekend from here on. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2061.92s)]
*  So we noted yesterday that it was quite a contrast. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2067.04s)]
*  All right. Well, that didn't have a piece in it, but you got it. He was calling in to do his rehab [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2073.76s)]
*  tour and they rolled out the red carpet for that. I mean, anybody who watched the Megan Kelly show [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2077.6s)]
*  the night of the debate, we did live coverage immediately after, knows I said within seconds [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  of popping up on YouTube live, his presidential campaign is over and serious sex time too. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2087.8399999999997s)]
*  It ended tonight. No matter what they tell you, no matter what happens, he's out. He will not be the [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2093.44s)]
*  nominee. And what you had on MSNBC was that. And you had, it was a bad night. Everyone has a bad [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2098.64s)]
*  night, which was the official line that Kamala Harris used and Obama used and Joe Biden eventually [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2105.84s)]
*  used. And all of his enablers pushed the same bullshit cover for him lies until they started [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2110.88s)]
*  to get the first polling back, which showed the American people had had it. You know, to your [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2118.1600000000003s)]
*  point earlier, they knew they knew for years and then their noses were rubbed in it by Joe Biden [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2124.48s)]
*  live and they were done pretending that it was a possibility he could do it. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2130.88s)]
*  I remember Matt and I, I know we're together the night of that debate at a friend's apartment. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2136.8s)]
*  There's a lot of people there and I had about 17 vodka sodas. I was pretty well in and I just [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2146.96s)]
*  remember looking, the crowd was looking across like, I mean, it was a pretty bipartisan crowd. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2154.32s)]
*  People was like, what is going on? And right when he said, I killed Medicare, I was like, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2159.04s)]
*  no, you just killed your campaign buddy. We finally beat Medicare. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2165.2s)]
*  We finally beat Medicare. It's like you beat your campaign to death. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2168.4s)]
*  Oh, we have that. My team cut that. They knew you were coming and they baked this cake. Here it is. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2171.12s)]
*  I love that. That's my favorite bit. That's fantastic. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2175.44s)]
*  One of the things we need to do, child care, elder care, making sure that we continue to [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2177.44s)]
*  strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we're able to make every single solitary [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2182.56s)]
*  person eligible for what I've been able to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2187.36s)]
*  everything we have to do with... Look, we finally beat Medicare. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2196.48s)]
*  Thank you, President Biden. President Trump? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2205.04s)]
*  Well, he's right. He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death and he's destroying Medicare [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2207.92s)]
*  because all of these people are coming in. They're putting them on Medicare. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2212.1600000000003s)]
*  Trump's no dummy. Oh my God. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2217.76s)]
*  I heard you. We've been over on the phone. We've been critical of Trump a lot recently, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2221.36s)]
*  trade war stuff in particular, but let's go back and say something positive about him. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2228.6400000000003s)]
*  He was... Everyone said, he can't restrain himself. He restrained himself in such an amazing way [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2232.8s)]
*  during that, in the best, most subtle line. And it's not even that subtle, but for Trump it's subtle [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2239.52s)]
*  when he said, I don't even know what he said. I don't think he knows what he said. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2244.48s)]
*  And that was it. It was amazing. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2246.88s)]
*  It's like, wow, that was actually brilliantly done. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2248.64s)]
*  Look at this one. Okay, the same debate, people forget this happened. Watch this exchange with [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2252.48s)]
*  the understanding that also revealed in this book, the Tapper Thompson book, is the fact that [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2258.4s)]
*  his aides were having serious discussions about how he needed to move into a wheelchair, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2264.0s)]
*  but they knew they couldn't move him into a wheelchair even though he needed to [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2269.04s)]
*  during the campaign, that it just had to wait until he won reelection. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2272.8s)]
*  They had already done the short stairs on Air Force One. They'd switched him over to the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2277.44s)]
*  sneakers. They were shortening the walks he had to do publicly. They were trying to put more hand [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2281.36s)]
*  rails wherever he had to do stairs or wherever he could get them in general. And on top of all that, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2287.28s)]
*  they recognized that he was going to need to go into a wheelchair. He was having, among other [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2293.6800000000003s)]
*  problems, severe deterioration in his spinal column, which they lied about and said was an [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2298.0s)]
*  ankle problem. They wouldn't reveal that he had severe arthritis and degeneration in his back. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2302.64s)]
*  So just all part of the lies. Nothing could be just, no one could be honest even about a physical [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2308.64s)]
*  deterioration, which isn't arguably as concerning as a mental in any event. So watch, that's the [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2312.64s)]
*  conversation they were having behind the scenes as you watch this clip. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2318.96s)]
*  I had my handicap, which when I was vice president, down to a six. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2328.16s)]
*  And by the way, I told you before I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2333.6s)]
*  Think you can do it? That's the biggest lie that he's a six handicap of all. I was at eight handicapped. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2339.04s)]
*  Eight? Never. But I had, you know how many, I've seen your swing, I know your swing. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2345.92s)]
*  Let's not act like children. President Trump, we're going to turn. Let's not act like children. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2351.2s)]
*  Incredible. Trump is saying let's not act like children. I love, I've seen his swing is the [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2358.72s)]
*  best line in the history of presidential debate. I've seen that swing. And by the way, he's like, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2363.28s)]
*  you know, I have a handicap, but it's not, no, clearly you do. And it's not, I mean, if you're [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2368.56s)]
*  talking about golf, apparently, but that kind of whispering thing. And it's funny because you go [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2373.28s)]
*  back and you try to remember what he was like in like 2021. It's like, was it, and you know, you [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2379.28s)]
*  realize something. Megan, you've had on- Let's play some, as Moynihan speaks, let's play some [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2385.92s)]
*  VOs. Let's please play V1, him falling at Air Force graduation V2, repeatedly falling up the stairs [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2389.6800000000003s)]
*  onto Air Force One. Oh yeah, I can narrate this if you want. Yeah. You talk and we'll watch. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2395.2000000000003s)]
*  Down he goes. There he goes. He got shot there. Oh my God. He looks like it. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2400.64s)]
*  He should get up with, you know, his hand in a clenched fist. No, you've had on the show, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2408.64s)]
*  Megan, one of America's greatest and most underrated comedians, Kyle Dunnigan, who does [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2414.16s)]
*  hands down the best Joe Biden impression. In Kyle Dunnigan's impression in 2021 was Joe Biden not [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2420.64s)]
*  being able to say a coherent sentence. And if you're a comedian and it doesn't ring true, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2427.92s)]
*  it doesn't work. So if it's clearly like we forget about the fact that even Dana Carvey too, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2432.64s)]
*  was doing that impression of him, like just rambling and mumbling in 2021. And it's like, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2438.72s)]
*  you can't do those impressions if that wasn't the person that we were seeing every day. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2444.56s)]
*  And also, remember too, I mean, some of us are old enough to remember Joe Biden when he was [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2448.64s)]
*  just a yappy Senator, right? And he played there too. But he was yappy. He would love to [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2454.9599999999996s)]
*  hold court and talk and come on, man. And I know this, we got to split Iraq into three different [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2463.3599999999997s)]
*  provinces, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's not the whisper guy. The New Yorker piece, the excerpt was [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2467.68s)]
*  infuriating also shout out to the great filmmaker, Steven Spielberg and the whatever he is, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2474.72s)]
*  Jeffrey Katzenberg, because in the year of our Lord 2024, they were out there adjusting the [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2480.08s)]
*  microphone levels. They wanted to make sure that he didn't sound like he was, which is, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2487.04s)]
*  I got to say this now. The opposite of what he used to be. What are you doing? Right? You people [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2492.7999999999997s)]
*  are great filmmakers, Spielberg is, and you're trying to basically use the magic of Hollywood [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2499.12s)]
*  cinematic arts to pull a fast one over on the American public. That ain't cool. Super not cool. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2506.56s)]
*  There's a thing that we do with, if we love our elders and our elders, which is when grandpa says [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2514.48s)]
*  he can still drive as Biden was asserting Joe Scarborough, you say, well, you can't. So give me [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2522.56s)]
*  the keys. My sainted mother, who's sharp as a tack, she's voluntarily stopped driving because [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=2528.7999999999997s)]

*  Okay, I lied. I got, I got, let me just go through this because I was setting it up, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3237.44s)]
*  what his message was. So he follows up on that. No more bombing each other, right? Like let's [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3241.2s)]
*  cooperate. Let's have cooperation and not chaos and commerce and not chaos. South 26. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3245.92s)]
*  As I said in my inaugural address, my greatest hope is to be a peacemaker and to be a unifier. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3252.08s)]
*  I don't like war. We have the greatest military, by the way, in the history of the world. You know, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3259.12s)]
*  I rebuilt our military in my first four years and rebuilt it into the most powerful military [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3264.16s)]
*  there is. And you saw that when I knocked out ISIS in three weeks, people said it would take [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3272.88s)]
*  four years, five years. I did it. We did it in three weeks. Just days ago, my administration [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3277.76s)]
*  successfully brokered a historic ceasefire to stop the escalating violence between [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3283.84s)]
*  India and Pakistan. And I used trade to a large extent to do it. I said, fellas, come on, let's [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3289.28s)]
*  make a deal. Let's do some trading. Let's not trade nuclear missiles. Classic Trump, the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3295.6s)]
*  negotiator, because he sees everything as a possible deal. That's been his approach domestically. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3304.64s)]
*  It's been his approach to foreign policy. And last but not least, here is the shout out against the [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3309.92s)]
*  neocons. South 25. The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3315.8399999999997s)]
*  nation builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3322.96s)]
*  dollars failing to develop. Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities. Instead, the birth of a modern [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3329.76s)]
*  Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves, the people that are right here, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3340.08s)]
*  the people that have lived here all their lives, developing your own sovereign countries. In the [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3345.52s)]
*  end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more nations than they built. And the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3350.96s)]
*  interventionalists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3356.4s)]
*  That last one is so big. And to me is so right on. I have to say, like, I was almost standing on my [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3367.12s)]
*  feet cheering for it because I feel like when I was on Fox News, all we did was cheerlead these wars [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3377.68s)]
*  and kind of dismiss or express disdain for people who had serious questions about them, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3385.3599999999997s)]
*  most of whom were Democrats. And in retrospect, with the benefit of all this hindsight, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3393.44s)]
*  that was wrong. We cheer to let ourselves right into two forever wars in which we expended [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3399.6s)]
*  countless lives, blood and treasure. And for what? Now we have the benefit of hindsight to [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3407.12s)]
*  look back and say, for what? Yes, there was some good. ISIS is no more. And we didn't get attacked [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3413.2799999999997s)]
*  again domestically for 20 years. You cannot say that's nothing. But I think like a lot of the [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3419.3599999999997s)]
*  troops who were over there, I have serious questions about whether any of it was worth it [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3425.12s)]
*  or whether that thing should have ended when George W. Bush declared mission accomplished [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3429.92s)]
*  after the opening bombing campaign in Afghanistan, period, and not 20 more years and not Iraq and [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3436.4s)]
*  all that stuff. So to hear the sitting president, a Republican, right? 24 years later. I mean, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3442.1600000000003s)]
*  truly like officially declare it a failure and say we're going in a different direction. We cannot [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3449.92s)]
*  nation build the greatest nations that have thrived over that time period have thrived thanks to [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3457.36s)]
*  their own ingenuity. Yes, America has supported Saudi Arabia in large measure, but he's saying [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3462.4s)]
*  thanks to yourselves, your desire to improve your community, not thanks to the great hand of America [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3467.6s)]
*  that came in and tried to impose democracy on you. And it's just to me like a before and after line [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3473.12s)]
*  where he's declared the past approach over and not successful. And it's him saying this is the dawn [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3478.56s)]
*  of a new day. We're taking the world in a new direction. It says, you know, the head of the [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3486.16s)]
*  greatest superpower on earth still for now. What are your thoughts? I think some of that was is [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3491.7599999999998s)]
*  aspirational. You know, the dawn of a new day. It's possible. Like it's possible. You can get a deal [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3497.52s)]
*  done with Iran, which would be great. But a lot of people have thought such things were possible in [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3502.48s)]
*  the past. So I think you're right to point out that this is kind of a needle scratch on American [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3507.2799999999997s)]
*  policy and that also it is refreshing to hear someone say that like nation building didn't work. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3514.72s)]
*  I do have questions about of course, Trump can't just leave it there, right? He does name names, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3524.56s)]
*  he named Biden in particular. And it is weird. I'm old enough to remember 9-11, that 15 of the [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3529.68s)]
*  19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. They were there. It's not a small thing. The Wahhabist ideology [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3536.3999999999996s)]
*  or strain of Islam is baked in Saudi Arabia. The family of bin Laden was. But wait, can I just say, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3543.84s)]
*  I don't have my finger on the pulse of Saudi Arabia, I readily confess. But there have been [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3552.32s)]
*  reforms there. They really have been pushing a crackdown on jihadism over there and trying to [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3558.16s)]
*  send the message, you know, the king and the crown prince, no more of that shit. Like they are trying [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3564.64s)]
*  to turn a page into more of an economic based society without so many radicals, you know, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3569.92s)]
*  festering the jihad in the ranks. But keep going. That's true. And they are also still one of the [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3576.32s)]
*  most dictatorial regimes on the planet. They repeatedly come in the bottom 20, oftentimes the [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3582.8s)]
*  bottom 10 on people who make such stuff. Yes. I don't want us to bomb them. I don't want to. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3588.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no. But wait, this is an important point because this is another before and after [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3597.68s)]
*  moment pivot point because we one of the reasons we got ourselves involved in so many conflicts [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3603.2799999999997s)]
*  around the world is because we have approached the world as we are this superpower and we know [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3609.6s)]
*  better. We will be the arbiter of who's committing human rights violations. And frankly, we haven't [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3615.04s)]
*  been wrong. You know, I mean, in most of these businesses, we're totally right. It's not like [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3620.96s)]
*  the Chinese Uyghurs are having a great life and we should just look the other way, though we are. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3625.12s)]
*  Right? So like there are real human rights violations happening in other countries. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3630.56s)]
*  But Trump also offered a new entry point on thinking about that. Here it is in [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3633.92s)]
*  SOT 22B. In recent years, far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3640.56s)]
*  that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3647.7599999999998s)]
*  For their sins, they loved using our very powerful military and now it's really the [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3655.7599999999998s)]
*  most powerful it's ever been. We just are getting a budget approved one trillion dollars highest [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3661.7599999999998s)]
*  budget we've ever had in history for military one trillion dollars. And we're getting the [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3667.44s)]
*  greatest missiles, the greatest weapons. And you know, I hate, I hate to do it, but you have to do [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3674.7999999999997s)]
*  it because we believe in peace through strength. You have to have the strength. Otherwise bad [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3680.48s)]
*  things could happen. But hopefully we'll never have to use any of those weapons. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3684.8s)]
*  I believe it is God's job to sit in judgment, my job to defend America and to promote the fundamental [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3690.48s)]
*  interest of stability, prosperity and peace. That's what I really want to do. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3698.6400000000003s)]
*  So I don't believe this. I'll give you the floor, but I just want to say one other thing. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3705.92s)]
*  I really believe this because Trump came under fire for doing deals with Saudi Arabia and being [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3709.92s)]
*  open to Saudi Arabia after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, American reporter. And the messaging [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3714.48s)]
*  back from the administration at the time was basically like, we don't love it. Okay, we don't [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3722.96s)]
*  love it, but we actually need to get along with them for all sorts of reasons, not least of which [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3728.08s)]
*  is we have a mutual foe and that's Iran. And, you know, like Trump all along is the dealmaker. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3733.68s)]
*  He looks and he's like, it's not great. I don't love it, but it's more important to me that [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3741.3599999999997s)]
*  at the 30,000 foot level, we're getting along with them because they can be helpful to the United [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3746.16s)]
*  States and not getting along with them is too big a disaster. Okay, now I'm done. Go ahead. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3751.7599999999998s)]
*  I wish that he would have put it like that, Megan. Instead he says, you are great. And the [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3756.16s)]
*  crown prince, super great. One of the greatest man I've ever seen blow smoke up his skirt. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3760.0s)]
*  And I don't like that as an American. I just don't, especially at a time when you're praising their [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3764.64s)]
*  record and their friendship. And you are also acting kind of like a Dick to Denmark, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3770.96s)]
*  which is an actual ally because we want to be in there for some reason. You're referring to Canada [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3776.7200000000003s)]
*  as the 51st state. So yeah, we're going to be totally friends with everybody. And we might act [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3781.92s)]
*  like a jerk if you are in our hemisphere and in our sphere of interest. So of course it's going to [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3786.16s)]
*  be inconsistent. I loved his last line, but he rightly pointed out that, you know, let God sit [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3790.0s)]
*  in judgment. My job is to protect the United States. That is the national interest. That is [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3795.12s)]
*  the job of the president. And I think too many presidents, and he's right to point to this out [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3799.2s)]
*  as are you. And I would just point out that libertarians are in addition to Democrats, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3803.2799999999997s)]
*  who have been skeptical of many of those wars. I mean, engagement. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3807.3599999999997s)]
*  And I like the libertarians better, so I shouldn't have left them off the list. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3810.64s)]
*  There's not many. But anyways, but Saudi Arabia has always been skilled for 80 years in a [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3813.6s)]
*  bipartisan way, though, tilting more towards Republicans of inserting themselves into American [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3821.68s)]
*  national interests, whether they need to be there or not. So they're hosting the Ukraine-Russia talks. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3826.72s)]
*  Do they have a direct interest in that? Not really, but they know that Trump cares about that. And I [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3831.8399999999997s)]
*  think you're also right. And I think this is very underrated about Donald Trump. I think he is very [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3835.9199999999996s)]
*  sincere about wanting his legacy to be as a peacemaker. I think he sincerely has a revulsion [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3840.24s)]
*  towards war. And people who like to dismiss Donald Trump, and I criticize him every waking [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3846.0s)]
*  hour of my life, in my head, at least, they underrate that. He is sincere about that. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3851.36s)]
*  Whether he's going about it the right way, whether he's going to lead to that [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3857.6s)]
*  vision that he sketches out, completely different question. But it is interesting. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3861.2000000000003s)]
*  And we should take, I think, him a little bit at his word, because it's consistent with what Marco [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3865.28s)]
*  Rubio told you the first week of this presidency and what the United States foreign policy wing [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3869.6s)]
*  has been doing in the second Trump administration. You guys remember when Hillary Clinton tried to [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3875.76s)]
*  press that big reset button over in Russia, and it was spelled wrong, and it was a disaster. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3880.0s)]
*  It was a nightmare. She was Barack Obama's secretary of state, and she completely fumbled it. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3886.32s)]
*  They were looking for a reset with the Russians, like, let's be friends again. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3890.24s)]
*  That's what this is, only it's sincere, and it has the potential to actually be effective. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3893.84s)]
*  I mean, Trump's basically saying, can we just get along? Literally saying it to everybody, like Iran. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3898.4s)]
*  Like, we don't want to bomb you. We will totally bomb you. But we have this. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3904.48s)]
*  Here's a little bit of it in Sa'at 23. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3910.2400000000002s)]
*  So he's like, Iran, we can get along. He lifted the sanctions on Syria. He announced that yesterday, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3933.84s)]
*  which is big, saying, we're going to try to help you succeed. Now, you who have taken over [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3950.32s)]
*  for Bashar al-Assad, you with like weird al-Qaeda background or terrorist backgrounds. But you know [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3954.7200000000003s)]
*  what? Let's give you a chance and see how you can do. He's trying to foster peace between Ukraine [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3960.32s)]
*  and Russia, way more so than the last administration. He's trying to foster peace in Israel and Gaza, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3966.88s)]
*  like working tirelessly through Witkoff and others to try to get those two sides to come to the table. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3972.0800000000004s)]
*  He did. The United States and Trump in particular was very instrumental in settling, for now, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3976.8s)]
*  the India-Pakistan war that started a couple of days ago. He's bringing home hostages, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3981.76s)]
*  American hostages from country after country. I mean, Trump, truly, he is devoted to finding [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3986.72s)]
*  peace in the world and to saying, I know these people have done awful things. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=3994.72s)]
*  It's 2025. We're turning the page. We're willing to give you kind of a pass, a bye, without blessing [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4000.9599999999996s)]
*  it to try to go forward in a better way, to try to say, you could be business partners with the [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4009.68s)]
*  hottest ticket in town, the United States of America. We'll do business with you. We'll help [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4015.12s)]
*  your economy get better. We'll help you have skyscrapers like they have in Riyadh. But you're [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4020.56s)]
*  going to have to back off the killing all the Jews thing and the terrorist thing. And we'll see [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4025.7599999999998s)]
*  whether that's cool with some of these actors. But to me, it's so refreshing to hear somebody [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4030.64s)]
*  state the mission as like an actual reset and the thought of possibilities. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4035.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, the words are fine. I mean, the words are good. I think they're slightly naive in some [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4042.4s)]
*  places and slightly aspirational, as Matt said, and others. But I'll say a couple of good things [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4048.16s)]
*  first and not be entirely negative. But the Abraham Accords was an enormous success. And it actually [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4054.16s)]
*  managed to kind of hold through October 7th, which was what a lot of people who care about the region [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4060.32s)]
*  were worried about. And so giving him credit for that and that lasting success is something [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4065.52s)]
*  that no one was willing to do the first term. And most people forget about now. But what a lot of [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4072.24s)]
*  this stuff is contingent upon is I mean, I think that it's also mostly true that people don't [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4076.88s)]
*  love war. I mean, there are some I mean, I know that there's this idea of that these bloodthirsty [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4084.48s)]
*  warmongers, but I think by and large, that's not the case. Yeah, I mean, there's John Bolton. I mean, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4088.96s)]
*  Donald Trump, of course, hired John Bolton. But which was a weird thing. And then also, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4093.7599999999998s)]
*  look, and also, you know, he's I mean, yeah, I mean, you're talking about the evolution of [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4098.72s)]
*  politics. He's talking about this Iran deal and praising this Iran deal, the potential is around [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4102.0s)]
*  deal, which most of the observers of this stuff and the JCPOA basically say, pretty much the same [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4106.72s)]
*  thing, which, you know, very similar. And he called the Obama deal the worst deal in American [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4112.080000000001s)]
*  history. So I think he's probably moved on a lot of these issues as his son has moved on. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4116.56s)]
*  And he's John I mentioned, I mentioned John Bolton, who, yes, worked for Trump for a short time. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4121.52s)]
*  But like he this is a blatant condemnation of the Bush administration. I mean, it's it's, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4126.16s)]
*  it is a tear. It's it's Donald Rumsfeld. It's Dick Cheney. It's Condoleezza Rice. And it's John [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4130.4s)]
*  Bolton. It is all of them, Colin Powell to on the coals without calling them out by name saying that [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4137.2s)]
*  era is done. And Trump's felt it for a long time. He was very critical of the war in Iraq. It's one [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4143.92s)]
*  of the main things he's he was saying when he first ran about how wrong that war was. And he [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4149.04s)]
*  was saying it at the time he said it on Fox and Friends. He said it elsewhere. Like he's had this [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4153.92s)]
*  general aversion to the knee jerk march toward war for I think his whole life. No, I don't doubt that. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4158.32s)]
*  And I think that, you know, what he did in 2016, when it came to Iraq, was actually open that lane [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4165.84s)]
*  up for people to criticize it. And actually now to say the opposite of that would be surprising [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4171.6s)]
*  to hear a Republican say on stage or not debate. So she was the first one to do it. And then everyone [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4177.04s)]
*  kind of followed suit after it was like, okay, here's a signal that that part is gone. But what [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4181.2s)]
*  a lot of this relies upon, I mean, again, the rhetoric is fine. And, you know, I don't want wars, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4185.679999999999s)]
*  either. The what it relies upon, though, is our enemies or our new comrades and allies. It depends [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4191.44s)]
*  on them. It depends on you know, there isn't a peaceful Middle East. That's not happening right [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4199.2s)]
*  now. Russia, Ukraine hasn't settled. Hasn't settled. And, you know, also to say like he made a deal with [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4203.679999999999s)]
*  the Syrians. And there's some interesting things about that. As you point out, Al Jelani was a [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4210.24s)]
*  leader of the Al Nusra Brigades, which was an Al Qaeda affiliated organization. And he was arrested [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4216.32s)]
*  by the Americans in Iraq. I mean, he's affiliated with Al Qaeda. So after 911, that remembers it. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4222.0s)]
*  It's not great. I mean, we remember it. Not good. Not a great Al Qaeda's bet. But the thing about it [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4227.599999999999s)]
*  is we remember this stuff. The Taliban is in power in, you know, sitting on American Abrams tanks. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4232.24s)]
*  You know, there's a head of Al Qaeda that is running Syria right now. No change in anything [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4240.24s)]
*  in Iran. We always promised these sort of new liberal leaders. Qatar giving Trump possibly a [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4246.48s)]
*  jet or being an ally, despite the fact that they fund Hamas and encourage Hamas. And by the way, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4253.04s)]
*  we saw this. And this is Trump. You're talking about getting hostages out. He negotiates that [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4259.36s)]
*  without the Israelis involved with Qatar. And Qatar says, Okay, here's the American, meaning [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4263.5199999999995s)]
*  that the Qataris have the power to get rid of get all those sausages back, or actually quell [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4269.84s)]
*  some of the stuff. So there's a lot of problems. He doesn't get caught up in that. There's a lot. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4274.0s)]
*  But when he steps back, I mean, one of by the way, this is an interesting point I haven't seen [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4278.96s)]
*  anyone make. But I wonder what will happen to Europe. Now that the Trump administration has said [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4283.6s)]
*  to Syria that they're going to lift all the economic sanctions. The response to that in Syria [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4288.88s)]
*  was people on the streets, cheering, flying flags in a million Syrian refugees are in Europe. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4293.6s)]
*  And do some of them come home now? Because the funny thing is you said about the Saudis, Megan, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4300.400000000001s)]
*  they know how to speak Trump's language. What did the former head of al Qaeda in Syria say to Trump, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4305.52s)]
*  you can build a Trump Tower in Damascus. That's what literally what he said. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4310.88s)]
*  Sanctions lifted. He clearly lifted the sanctions on Syria as a [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4315.76s)]
*  at the request of the Saudis. He said that in speech. As soon as he said I'm lifting the [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4324.0s)]
*  sanctions on Syria, he looked at the Crown Prince and he goes, Oh, what I do for you, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4328.08s)]
*  the things I do for you. He's not trying to hide anything. But that's the transactional Trump other [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4332.96s)]
*  than we had trans Trump, and we have transactional Trump. I prefer transactional. Interestingly, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4341.200000000001s)]
*  a virtue that I don't I don't know that I've ever attributed to Donald Trump before in this [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4348.400000000001s)]
*  particular context is modesty. Like the the foreign policy disposition here appears to be [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4352.96s)]
*  that I understand that interventionism and foreign policy context is going to be of kind of limited [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4358.8s)]
*  potential and has very recently resulted in pretty profound failures. We probably need a [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4365.6s)]
*  different approach. And one that's centered on finding opportunities for mutually beneficial [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4371.2s)]
*  exchange is probably a way for us to have some meaningful influence here. Does it mean doing [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4376.4s)]
*  really difficult things like trying to carefully select your words in public when talking about [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4381.44s)]
*  someone who you're you're looking for a partnership like this with while behind closed doors, we hope [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4386.32s)]
*  having sober conversations about the things that they're doing that are unacceptable? Yeah, it [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4390.799999999999s)]
*  means that does it also mean acknowledging that the world is complicated? That while you're you're [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4395.28s)]
*  exchanging the stick for the carrot in the context of Syria, you also have really severe problems [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4400.0s)]
*  that you're still dealing with. I think was the Houthis attacked like during the speech. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4404.799999999999s)]
*  So the the real world problems still exist, but the limitations of the the previous disposition [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4408.8s)]
*  towards trying to to reshape the Middle East by way of US policy as opposed to finding ways [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4415.4400000000005s)]
*  to to gently in in entangle our shared interest from an economic standpoint, I think is really [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4422.4800000000005s)]
*  important. I think this is probably one of the better moments of the second Trump presidency. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4429.28s)]
*  The challenge, however, is that it is somewhat overshadowed in certain context by the appearance [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4434.0s)]
*  of corruption. The scandal with respect to the Qatari plane is one thing, but also the fact that [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4440.24s)]
*  his son says zero chance Trump ever steps out on that plane. He's not that's probably not going to [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4444.64s)]
*  happen to much. But his sons came out yesterday saying no, it's not you're not getting congressional [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4449.44s)]
*  approval for that. So John Thune, I don't know that he's known for really standing up against [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4455.44s)]
*  Trump when the chips are down. We'll see. But he Halpern says, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4459.76s)]
*  Don't have a congress. I didn't know we had. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4463.12s)]
*  We'll see how much Trump wants to fight for the plane. But I also think the fact that his sons [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4467.280000000001s)]
*  have been in the in in these same countries in the weeks before in days before the president got [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4472.4800000000005s)]
*  there essentially striking deals for the Trump Organization. Again, is there anything explicitly [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4478.4800000000005s)]
*  corrupt about any of this? Does any of it suggest that there is necessarily some sort of quid pro [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4483.84s)]
*  quo? No, I haven't seen any evidence of that. But as we said repeatedly, when we talked about [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4489.12s)]
*  Biden and Burisma, the appearance of corruption is often as important and consequential as actual [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4494.08s)]
*  corruption. And I think that that is a material concern. The plane is a tough one. But if the [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4499.68s)]
*  quid pro quo is for us, the United States is a different story. You know, if he's getting things [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4504.4s)]
*  for the United States is a different story. This is what I was saying when Trump was running that, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4509.2s)]
*  like, yes, he's a narcissist. All presidents are narcissists. I mean, very, very few, I think, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4514.0s)]
*  are the exception to that. But I was saying, like, you look at him and you think, well, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4518.8s)]
*  that could be very useful to us if the payoff is not exactly like if Trump's ego is served, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4522.64s)]
*  not by compliments. Yes, of him, but not just by that, but by wins for the United States. If [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4529.28s)]
*  we can get the the United States lined up with Trump's ego, this could be very, very beneficial [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4534.64s)]
*  for us. And I really think that's what's happening. But I think as a foreign policy matter, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4540.08s)]
*  this is the declaration of a win for the restrainers, you know, for the JD Vances of [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4544.32s)]
*  the world, for the Tuckers of the world, who have had enough and even Marco Rubio, who's a much more [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4550.24s)]
*  interesting figure because he's become he talks restrain her. He definitely gets it and he's on [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4554.48s)]
*  board with it. And I talked to him myself about that. But he's got a neo con past, you know, he's [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4559.2s)]
*  he understands that other wing of the Republican Party that, you know, where he says, it is terrible [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4564.88s)]
*  what's happening in Gaza, and every single one of those deaths is the fault of Hamas, right? Like, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4570.88s)]
*  that's what the neo cons want to hear. Like, there's a clear understanding of morality in the world [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4575.52s)]
*  from the United States of America, and they're willing to tow the line to make sure the right [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4581.2s)]
*  side is supported, right? Like, that's kind of so he's a more of a hedge bet. In any event, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4586.56s)]
*  it was fascinating here, Trump just spill it out. At the same time, he's saying we're going to reset, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4591.4400000000005s)]
*  we won't hold the past sins against you. We're not going to try to import culture, you do your thing. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4595.76s)]
*  It's for God to judge your decisions, not for me. At the same time, he's like, we might invade [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4600.0s)]
*  Greenland, and Panama, and might have to take Canada to just like easy. I mean, Greenlanders, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4604.96s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty simple. But the thing is, Megan is that what the I think what the difference is, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4613.92s)]
*  is that this has been the kind of unwritten policy of America and Americans for a long time, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4620.0s)]
*  but it's non interventionist. That after Iraq was just not going to happen for a long time. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4626.32s)]
*  The I think what's will be interesting, particularly vis a vis the array Israelis who [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4631.5199999999995s)]
*  are kind of mad at Trump right now that the hostage negotiation happened without them, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4635.44s)]
*  his cozying up to the Qataris in any way makes them makes them angry. So I mean, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4640.32s)]
*  we'll see how that relationship because you know, the Tucker wing, they they can't stand [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4645.28s)]
*  Israel, they can't stand that Yahoo. So I'm interesting to see if that relationship [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4649.92s)]
*  fractures at all. But I think the real thing, I don't think it's fair to say Tucker can't stand [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4654.4800000000005s)]
*  Israel, but but they're critical of Israel. He's a he's a very, very strainer. He's become more [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4658.56s)]
*  skeptical in recent he just did an interview with the comedian Dave Smith, where they were not very, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4663.92s)]
*  not very positive on Israel. But I would say that it's a matter of what do we do about foreign [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4670.8s)]
*  funding of things like so funding the Ukrainians funding the Israelis. And look, there was a [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4677.28s)]
*  something that happened in Israel the other day in the Knesset about stopping all American military [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4682.08s)]
*  aid, which has been something that's been floated by a lot of Israelis. Cool. You know, our friend [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4688.08s)]
*  Jake Segal, who is a big Zionist, you know, writes for tablet, wrote a thing Matt has written about [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4693.52s)]
*  this too, of like, okay, it's enough of this, it's not going to stop the people who say that [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4699.68s)]
*  we're still close to close to Israel. But if that is the next phase of pulling American support out [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4704.08s)]
*  for allies in a military way, that would be really shocking to me. That would be that would [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4710.8s)]
*  be a very big development. But you know, we're talking about how you the United States did the [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4717.68s)]
*  the forever wars, you know, the Iraq disaster, staying too long in Afghanistan, not knowing, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4723.04s)]
*  you know, not having any plan training all these troops, then leaving all of our tanks behind all [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4727.76s)]
*  of it's such a nightmare. But we have been messing in foreign policy throughout the world for a long, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4731.52s)]
*  long time. You know, we're talking about Ukraine and Russia, we of course, were over there under [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4737.84s)]
*  the Clinton administration. You know, we were we were there under the Obama administration, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4741.84s)]
*  Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton was over there, trying to make regime change happen. I think [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4745.76s)]
*  this is Trump saying, we're done with that. We may invade you, but we won't quietly try to change [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4750.16s)]
*  your your leadership. Like we did in Ukraine, like, you know, we clearly would some would like to do [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4756.4800000000005s)]
*  in places like Russia. He's like those days are over. So the verdict was in the day he was reelected. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4762.96s)]
*  But this is him really spelling it out. And I'd love to find I'm sure we can, who wrote that speech, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4770.16s)]
*  because that was a barn burner. And Trump, he delivered a fine. He was a little quiet in the [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4775.6s)]
*  messaging. I think he was tired. There was video of him maybe falling asleep, the White House denied [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4780.16s)]
*  it. But I didn't blame it was like, it looked very, very hot and kind of boring in there to some [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4784.96s)]
*  extent, because we saw this from Trump. Here it is. Watch. Yeah, stand by. Watch this. V five. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4790.32s)]
*  So he's not actually asleep. This is from Fox News. But he's doing the old close my eyes for a minute. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4801.599999999999s)]
*  This is boring. I don't know what he's listening to. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4808.0s)]
*  Joe Biden to point out. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4809.92s)]
*  It's not the middle of the speech. So I gotta say, there's a difference between boredom and [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4812.32s)]
*  infirmity because he didn't look over at Marco Rubio at the event. And did you guys see this [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4818.96s)]
*  picture of him yesterday? It's amazing. Look at him. Marco audience. If you haven't seen it, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4823.52s)]
*  it's him with like the leg spread out the hands crossed. He's got literally gaping mouth. He looks [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4833.68s)]
*  kind of sweaty. He's got a little bit of a belly there with all due respect to Marco Rubio. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4839.92s)]
*  And he looks so tired and so like, get it over with. It's hilarious. I think there must be [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4844.959999999999s)]
*  something about this room that was like, hot and not that stimulating guys. I don't know. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4852.0s)]
*  I mean, if I was over there, I probably would have adopted the local garb for that event. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4859.28s)]
*  Personally, the what? The garb? Yeah, the local garb instead of the suit. I think that would have [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4863.5199999999995s)]
*  been a better look for Marco in that moment. For sure. You wouldn't have seen the belly. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4867.679999999999s)]
*  I think it was a successful visit. And I think it's the beginning. It's the dawn of a new day. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4874.48s)]
*  I feel that. And we'll see. We'll see whether we have partners who are willing to turn that page [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4887.36s)]
*  and join him in this new good faith effort. In some instances, there's like a religious fervor [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4891.839999999999s)]
*  that we're never going to get past. There will be no Mara Gaza. That's not happening. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4896.48s)]
*  They're just too dug in on their very bizarre ideology of trying to wipe Israel off the face [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4901.04s)]
*  of the map. I don't think anyone can solve that. I don't know what to do about that. Like most [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4907.84s)]
*  humans on earth. I don't know what to do about that. But I think with the Saudis, I don't know [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4912.240000000001s)]
*  about the Iranians. I really don't know about the Iranians. Trump even complimented the Houthis. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4916.320000000001s)]
*  He's like, you know, the Houthis, like, we resolve that. They stop bombing us. He's like, boy, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4920.56s)]
*  they're tough. They're tough. He's like, throwing out the nice compliments. So like anybody who [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4924.5599999999995s)]
*  comes to the table, he's like, I'm willing to look at you anew, which is not a bad trait. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4932.48s)]
*  All right. Stand by guys. Got to take a quick break. We'll be right back with the fifth column, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=4936.879999999999s)]

*  it's just like, I want to stress again to the audience, we must distinguish before we get the [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5111.68s)]
*  legal instructions between disgusting, filthy, pervert, cad, asshole, and criminal. That's [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5117.04s)]
*  really what this trial is about. I think even the defense seeds point one. They have to, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5126.16s)]
*  they have to, there won't be a juror in that room that can stand Sean Combs. But the question here [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5133.200000000001s)]
*  is whether he broke the law and even your humble correspondent is open minded to being persuaded [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5139.6s)]
*  that there wasn't a technical legal violation. I, I really want to see the, I haven't looked up the [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5143.92s)]
*  proposed legal instructions, but we'll get them jury instructions on what the law is. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5149.4400000000005s)]
*  Because I'll tell you, like, I've got questions. I'm horrified by the testimony, but I've, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5153.68s)]
*  I've got questions about whether they're going to get a conviction. Okay, I hope they do, but [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5160.64s)]
*  that's just because I can't stand him. Okay. His, the star witnesses, Cassie, his, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5164.96s)]
*  she was a singer, Cassie Ventura. She signed with him and she was 18 years old or right around there. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5171.759999999999s)]
*  She became a singer. She said she signed like a 10 record deal with bad boy record records, which is [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5179.44s)]
*  his. And within like two years, he started having sex with her. And he was with a different woman at [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5184.32s)]
*  the time, but shockingly, he wasn't faithful and started sleeping with Cassie. And then she [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5191.84s)]
*  testified how in the beginning, by the way, when she took the stand, she was eight and a half months [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5198.24s)]
*  pregnant yesterday. His side was so worried about that, making her look overly sympathetic, sympathetic [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5202.400000000001s)]
*  that they asked if she could be brought in and put on the stand without the jury in the room. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5206.96s)]
*  Look at this. I mean, like apparently they're not exaggerating. She had that enormous belly that we [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5211.92s)]
*  all get in the very, very last few days, which is where like, it's just, it becomes like voyeuristic [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5215.2s)]
*  to even look at a woman at that point. It's just out of control. God bless you, Cassie. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5219.84s)]
*  So anyway, the judge overruled that and said she can walk in her full pregnant self. And she did. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5225.84s)]
*  And she testified about how he started very early on telling her he wanted her to participate in [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5230.96s)]
*  these freak offs. That's what he called them. And these things, I mean, it's the right word for them. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5238.64s)]
*  I mean, they're absolutely depraved behavior where he would hire these male sex workers. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5242.96s)]
*  And she's testifying, this is all, you know, her testimony that they would come over and that [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5247.6s)]
*  Sean Combs would be there watching and directing everything. And that there would be multiple sex [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5253.120000000001s)]
*  sessions within the one freak off, which could go for days. But even if it went for hours, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5257.84s)]
*  there'd be multiple sessions in which she would have to perform with these male sex workers, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5263.04s)]
*  including in like outfits and fish nets and masquerade masks and hooker heels is how it was [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5267.52s)]
*  described. Then he would tell him exactly what sex acts he wanted and how, and then he would [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5273.84s)]
*  participate in some of them. We talked yesterday, forgive me listening audience about how he [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5278.64s)]
*  allegedly both himself and through the male sex worker urinated on her. And I guess in her mouth [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5282.4800000000005s)]
*  to where she testified she was gagging, she thought she was going to throw up. She testified [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5289.4400000000005s)]
*  that the freak offs quote became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5293.84s)]
*  and to just feel normal again, that they could go from 36 hours to as long as four days, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5298.96s)]
*  that they took a big chunk of my life. Sometimes on a nearly weekly basis at the end of the sessions, [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5304.56s)]
*  the hotel linens were off often very soiled with baby oil residue, as well as bodily fluids, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5310.4s)]
*  including blood and urine. And his staff keep in mind, he's being accused of like racketeering, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5315.92s)]
*  like the way a mob boss does where he has an enterprise of criminals around him. That's why [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5320.4s)]
*  these details are important that his staff would both set up the freak off rooms and clean up the [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5325.76s)]
*  freak off rooms that eventually they graduated to adding like television lighting, like Klee lights [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5330.64s)]
*  in there that would have red, red lighting coming out of them. There were blue lighting coming out [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5335.84s)]
*  of them to set just the right mood. Choking back tears, she testified reading here from New York [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5339.76s)]
*  times. She testified the freak offs made her feel disgusting and humiliated. If he wasn't in the [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5345.2s)]
*  room, he would sometimes watch over FaceTime. He began recording the freak offs. Side note, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5349.92s)]
*  the media has now filed a request to see the videotape of the freak offs. And the parties [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5355.52s)]
*  are objecting saying they don't need to see everything. And they're like, Cassie doesn't [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5361.84s)]
*  want them to see it. But then Diddy doesn't want them out. And the judge says he's leaning towards [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5365.12s)]
*  releasing them because there's a little thing called the first amendment. But of course, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5369.2s)]
*  the media is like, we want to see the freak offs. Show us the tape. That's what the media's position [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5373.12s)]
*  is. She lists the drugs that he provided to the participants, ecstasy, cocaine, marijuana, ketamine, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5379.2s)]
*  mushrooms, whatever was the drug of choice at that point. She says she took the drugs for [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5386.0s)]
*  disassociating and to have some kind of buffer from what she was experiencing. She talked about [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5390.639999999999s)]
*  how he beat her repeatedly. She talked about that one incident we saw at the hotel intercontinental [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5395.2s)]
*  where he dragged her and beat her on the ground. She was trying to escape a freak off. Like it was [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5400.24s)]
*  just a day ending and why she was like, that's kind of Yeah, that we did that all the time. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5405.68s)]
*  And he would beat me sometimes. And that time I made a run for it. And I stayed on the ground [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5411.280000000001s)]
*  once he knocked me down. Because it was self defense. I thought maybe he wouldn't be able to [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5417.12s)]
*  hit me as easily. If I stayed down. I mean, he's just an absolute disgusting, hideous pig, awful [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5421.4400000000005s)]
*  man. She said she stayed to keep him happy. When you're in love with someone, you don't want to [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5427.76s)]
*  disappoint them. But as the years passed, even as she still sought to please him, she recognized [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5433.12s)]
*  he had become increasingly abusive beating her and orchestrating ever more degrading sessions [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5438.96s)]
*  that made her feel like her career was no longer music, but performing in his sexual for his sexual [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5443.44s)]
*  satisfaction. Here's the thing. She testified that she was asked across has begun about why [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5449.04s)]
*  like whether she told him that she didn't want to do it. And the testimony is I understand it [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5459.2s)]
*  thus far has been basically no, she said she would do it. And they have text messages of her [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5464.5599999999995s)]
*  saying to him like, I can't wait for the next freak off. I can't wait to like I might not be [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5471.12s)]
*  able to do it today because I have a red carpet. And she testified about how she had to get all [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5475.76s)]
*  drugged up and also he would beat her. And it's like she did have to go to the red carpet with a [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5479.84s)]
*  black eye. I think it was after that intercontinental one we saw, but they, the [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5484.48s)]
*  defense has text messages from her being like, can't wait. I love it. Like when's the next one. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5488.719999999999s)]
*  And so this has the real danger for the prosecution of morphing into a Harvey Weinstein S case where [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5494.959999999999s)]
*  it's, it's only a crime if there, if he forced you, if, if you guys are just freaks in bed who [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5500.48s)]
*  wanted to do this stuff. Yes. There's a question of the prostitution element, but he's not being [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5510.08s)]
*  charged with abuse of like with assault. And I, a lot of the viewers wrote in after our discussion, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5515.2s)]
*  yesterday saying, what do you mean he beat her? It's on tape. Yes, I know there. No, he's not [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5519.6s)]
*  being charged with that. That's not one of the charges. The charges relate to solicitation [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5522.5599999999995s)]
*  of prostitution or like arranging the transportation of a prostitute and Rico racketeering a criminal [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5527.5199999999995s)]
*  enterprise. So it's relevant if there's a crime of prostitution and relevant if there was a crime [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5532.5599999999995s)]
*  on which the statute of limitations has run called assault, but they don't have to actually [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5537.28s)]
*  prove any of that. And he's not exactly being charged for that. He's, but if this is consensual [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5542.08s)]
*  sex, or at least if Sean Combs believed that it was consensual sex, he could skate legally. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5546.4s)]
*  And that's, that's my impression so far. That's I very open-minded to be this going another way, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5555.679999999999s)]
*  your thoughts on the cultural impact of this trial and just thoughts on what we're learning [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5561.28s)]
*  now about one of the most famous people in America. I mean, he should skate if that's, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5568.16s)]
*  if that's the case, right? I mean, there's, it's, it's not criminal and to be part of a [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5573.599999999999s)]
*  criminal enterprise if you're a scumbag. And sometimes it's very hard to separate those [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5579.76s)]
*  things in situations like this. I mean, I saw the tape from the hotel. Nothing about that surprises [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5585.12s)]
*  me considering what we know about his character. And as you said, Megan, it's, it's like we can [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5591.92s)]
*  disassociate these things and say, you are a horrible, horrible monster. And that is clear. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5596.8s)]
*  And his life is over. I mean, whether he goes to prison or not, there's no way he's going to be [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5602.48s)]
*  allowed back into the, to the club of celebrity. It just can't, I mean, recalling that he had these [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5606.32s)]
*  white parties and the Hamptons, you know, Martha Stewart is going to these things. This is not [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5611.68s)]
*  something that's just in the hip hop world. And that is gone for him forever. But whether or not [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5615.92s)]
*  he's been in jail, I don't know for a year or something in Brooklyn, whether or not that is [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5620.64s)]
*  justified. I just, I haven't paid really close attention to this because I have a life and I [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5625.4400000000005s)]
*  try to limit my, my ditty puffy, whatever the hell he's called, consumption. But there is a thing [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5630.4800000000005s)]
*  that at the last, the sort of heel end of that kind of me too movement where it was getting a [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5638.96s)]
*  little troubling. And I'm not saying that this is comparable, but there'll be times when people [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5646.16s)]
*  were feeling salemy. Yeah. Well, when it was, when it was feeling salemy in the sense that, well, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5650.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, that was a bad relationship or you, that person was a jerk. And it's like, there's, that's [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5655.12s)]
*  not a legal kind of thing. This is a next level of that. And it's gross. And you know, my freak [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5660.16s)]
*  off sounded like this at all. I mean, we all, I have an iPad where I'm in two minutes at best. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5666.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, it's very fast. Yeah. You know, I'm like Woody Allen. I'm like, you know, maybe a [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5671.76s)]
*  minute and a half, you know, and that's, and it's done and everyone's happy. And we like read [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5677.12s)]
*  afterwards. It's like a book club. But if that, if this stuff, yeah, we do. We're, we're, we're [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5681.76s)]
*  reading Willa Cather's My Antonia now. It's great. There is a moment when you look at this stuff and [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5687.52s)]
*  you say, you know, the text messages, we saw that with army hammer. We saw that with the picture [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5694.24s)]
*  from the Dodgers. So many of these things, the text messages always come out and paint a different [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5699.28s)]
*  picture. And you know, we have to hold off on that. But if it is just having gross sex parties [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5703.5199999999995s)]
*  and maybe hiring a male prostitute or whatever, it's like the feds, this big raid him in jail for [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5711.04s)]
*  it could be that there's a lot more to this. Not, not alleging any force. He texted, he testified [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5716.639999999999s)]
*  that he there was a male prostitute or whatever escort. I don't know how he goes by saying she [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5723.2s)]
*  was the one who would text, who would text me saying, come over for the freak off. She was the [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5729.5199999999995s)]
*  one who would pay me. She and I developed like a friendship on the side. And he did say, I grew very [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5733.679999999999s)]
*  concerned for her. I said, you know, you've got to leave him. He beats you. He testified you heard a [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5738.96s)]
*  beating, but like the beatings are as horrific as they are. And they are criminal in their own [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5742.8s)]
*  right. Though the statute of limitations may have run on assault. I haven't actually looked that up, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5748.0s)]
*  but there's a reason he didn't get charged with those. And certainly the one at the [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5751.36s)]
*  Intercontinental. Oh, and by the way, the, the, the testimony by this one guy who was a security [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5754.96s)]
*  officer at the hotel Intercontinental where that beating took place was that he saw it. He went up [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5760.88s)]
*  there and this was a Friday. He went home for the weekend. And when he got back on Monday, the tape [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5766.16s)]
*  was gone. The tape was gone. They paid somebody a hundred grand for it. Well, no, did he offered him [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5770.4s)]
*  a hundred thousand dollars in a wad of bills saying here, please make this go away. And I think the [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5776.16s)]
*  testimony was like, he was like, no, I'm not doing that. That's not how this works. This guy's LAPD. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5781.2s)]
*  No, but I think he was legit. But when he got back on Monday, the tape was gone and he did, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5785.84s)]
*  but he didn't call the police because she didn't want him to. She didn't want to test him. She [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5791.12s)]
*  liked it. Most domestic violence victims do not want the police called unless they're actively [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5795.5199999999995s)]
*  in fear for their life at that second. And then they almost always live to regret it. And we can't, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5800.24s)]
*  it's terrible. It's terrible dynamic. You know, Gabby Petito, we saw a similar thing when, when [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5804.32s)]
*  she could have saved herself in any event. I don't know because all that testimony about how the, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5809.12s)]
*  the escort willingly came, Cassie was the one who reached out to him. He seemed to enjoy it. He [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5814.24s)]
*  thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. Like no one, I don't know how we've gotten [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5819.36s)]
*  to like, she's being forced by like the equivalent of a mob boss yet. Yeah. I mean, I think I've read, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5823.28s)]
*  I have read some accounts of this. I do have some interest in the story. We also talk about [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5830.0s)]
*  these things professionally and everyone's in a while. And look, Cassie, the Cassie situation is [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5834.48s)]
*  Kamil's joining the motion to see the freak ops. How can I talk about this? If I don't watch at [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5839.92s)]
*  least a little bit, you know, I don't mind maybe pixelated if you want to find that I'm going to [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5850.64s)]
*  with the lighting. At least give me the sound. You know, sorry, keep going. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5854.56s)]
*  Yeah, then they come for your freak ops. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5858.72s)]
*  But, but I do think, you know, Diddy clearly a violent person, dangerous. I think deviant [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5863.360000000001s)]
*  are words that apply here. I agree. I mean, the, the federal Rico attempt, I'm still to my knowledge, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5869.92s)]
*  there isn't anyone else who's been charged. And the whole thing seems kind of unusual in that [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5876.56s)]
*  regard. One imagines that as you said, Megan, the rest of those charges couldn't be brought in [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5882.16s)]
*  some of those other situations. But I mean, the things that were alleged in that civil suit that [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5887.44s)]
*  he settled with Cassie, that he had blown up, yeah, but that he blown up kid Cuddy's car. I mean, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5891.5199999999995s)]
*  these are extraordinary, extraordinary allegations. This is a guy who sounds like it sounds like he [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5898.32s)]
*  believes he is above the law and can get away with just about anything in stories about his violent [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5904.32s)]
*  temper and his capacity to attack even other superstars. I mean, there's, there's a pretty [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5909.52s)]
*  notorious story about him beating up Drake at some point. Drake is a really big star. It's, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5914.72s)]
*  it's nutty stuff. One one, I'm very interested to see where the case goes. But I shared the [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5921.6s)]
*  kind of skepticism of the federal prosecution here that I think they may have overreached. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5927.360000000001s)]
*  But we'll have to see what else they've got in the holster there. What's crazy is SDNY does not [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5932.240000000001s)]
*  normally lose. They do not normally lose the feds. And in federal court, they don't bring the case [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5937.36s)]
*  unless they've got you. I mean, that's, that's why it's so awful to be indicted by the feds. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5944.24s)]
*  So, but so I've been underwhelmed by so far by what they say they have all like the some of some [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5948.799999999999s)]
*  of the worst stuff was in these, let's not forget complaints brought by a guy who seemed like a [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5955.36s)]
*  questionable lawyer who was called out as a questionable lawyer by a judge. But that guy also [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5962.56s)]
*  represented Cassie, I think if memory serves, and she got an eight figure payout. And then what he [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5967.6s)]
*  wrote about her turned out to be true. I mean, or look, at least she's backing it up and she got paid [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5972.4800000000005s)]
*  eight figures. So Sean Combs was scared. So anyway, we'll continue to watch it and see where this [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5976.96s)]
*  goes. I think this has cultural implications well beyond P Diddy. I mean, who knew how many in [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5982.96s)]
*  Hollywood covered it up? Who didn't give two shits that he was allegedly engaging in the serial [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5987.84s)]
*  abuse of women, not to mention these parties with you know, as we worry about Justin Bieber and [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5992.32s)]
*  others. We'll leave it at that for now, guys. Thank you. Great to see you tomorrow. A first time [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=5997.04s)]
*  guest on the program, Teamsters president Sean O'Brien. See you then. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dspX81dOBVQ&t=6001.92s)]
