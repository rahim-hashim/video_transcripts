Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by retired U.S. Army Special Operations Sergeant Major John McPhee, founder of SOB Tactical, to discuss how he got into the Army, the people who misjudged him along the way, why he loved basic training, his rise to the Army Rangers and Delta Force, his experience in Afghanistan killing hundreds of terrorists, what really happened with bin Laden, whether he could have been killed or captured just months into the conflict, the political implications of war, why Hegseth and Trump are right to fix the military, the keys to leadership, why Jiu Jitsu is a core element of keeping him sane and in survival mode, his tough childhood, living in a brothel, his relationship with his parents, and more.

# Delta Force Operator John McPhee on Afghan War Stories, Keys to Leadership, and America as a Friend
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. On this Memorial Day, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=0.0s)]
*  we honor all of the brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep the United [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4.4s)]
*  States of America free and prosperous. As we do every Memorial Day, we are bringing you the story [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=9.44s)]
*  of a remarkable veteran and what a story this vet has. Joining me today is retired U.S. Army Special [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=14.48s)]
*  Operations Sergeant Major John McPhee, aka the Sheriff of Baghdad. John served our country for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=20.8s)]
*  over 20 years, specializing in various special mission units and combat experience across [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=27.84s)]
*  multiple theaters, including Afghanistan and Iraq, where he hunted both Osama bin Laden and Saddam [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=32.32s)]
*  Hussein. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=38.0s)]
*  and X. I would like to introduce you to a new brand of Angus beef. You can order it directly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=45.44s)]
*  from Riverbend Ranch, which is located just a few miles from West Yellowstone, Montana. Riverbend [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=51.04s)]
*  Ranch raises their cattle a lot differently than most ranches. For example, they never use [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=57.36s)]
*  artificial growth hormones or antibiotics. They track the health of every animal from the day it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=61.84s)]
*  is born and can guarantee that it has been healthy every day of its life. And they handle their animals [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=67.2s)]
*  humanely and with respect. But most important is the quality of the beef. You'll find it as tender [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=72.56s)]
*  and flavorful as the finest restaurants. And that's because they have spent the last 35 years selecting [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=78.8s)]
*  cattle for tenderness and flavor, aging their beef to perfection for 21 days. The result is some [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=84.24s)]
*  of the most tender and flavorful beef you have ever tasted. You cannot buy beef like this in a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=90.16s)]
*  grocery store. And since it is shipped directly from the ranch to your home, you get a much better [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=95.28s)]
*  price than going through the middleman. Order directly from Riverbend Ranch dot com. Use promo [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=100.24s)]
*  code Megan to get 20 bucks off your first order. That's Riverbend Ranch dot com code Megan and be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=106.0s)]
*  prepared. Once you taste it, you're going to be coming back for more. Again, that's Riverbend Ranch dot com code Megan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=113.6s)]
*  John, great to have you. Thank you. How you doing? Pretty good. Pretty good. Quite a lead up there. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=121.36s)]
*  Well, my God, I mean, you've done a lot. I've tried. I tried. When I say that, when you hear that intro [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  read, given all the time that you spent, you know, serving the country, what's the one that like you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=131.44s)]
*  focus on? Like, that's the one thing that really kind of defined the service in my mind. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=135.84s)]
*  Um, man, kind of none of that, I guess, you know what I mean? Like, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=139.68s)]
*  later in the war, as leadership, like, that was a challenge, you know what I mean? Those like the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=145.84s)]
*  Battle of Tora Bora, I was a new guy, like, let's go kill everybody. You know what I mean? And then [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=152.88s)]
*  the war rages on, you learn, you're more experienced. You just learn. As it goes on, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=158.56s)]
*  you're going to learn different lessons. Everybody's going to do this. And I think [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=165.92s)]
*  the lessons I learned as a young guy, weren't the lessons I needed. Really? Yeah, everybody [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  learns, right? I thought everyone makes mistakes. When I read your bio, I thought the opposite, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  because you had a very rough childhood. And I thought it made him one tough sob. Maybe. Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, capable of doing what needed to be done in like the darkest days of Iraq and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  Afghanistan. Yeah. And so I'm a regular, I tell everyone this. I'm a regular guy. I do everything [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=193.92s)]
*  everyone else does. I joined the army. And I think when, when 9-11 happened, I was too far in to like [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=203.11999999999998s)]
*  choose a different life. You know what I mean? Let's start back at the young John, south side of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  Chicago. Yeah. Only white kid in the class. Yeah, for a long time. How'd that happen? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=220.72s)]
*  I don't know. You get in fights. You go to ding dong. They call it ding dong school. That's where [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=226.32s)]
*  kids that fight all the time. And you end up there. How did your parents settle in a neighborhood [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=232.88s)]
*  where you would wind up being the only one white kid in class? That's where we lived. Like, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=238.48s)]
*  it's South Chicago. It's where we lived. You know what I mean? I would say the South Chicago [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=243.04s)]
*  with the seventies eighties was like a different place. So I know that you were very badly bullied [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=248.8s)]
*  on the bus every day. I heard you telling our pal Sean Ryan about that. I mean, it was every day [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=257.44s)]
*  they beat you up daily. Well, no till they got me a cab. I mean, it must've been bad for the South [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=261.68s)]
*  Side of Chicago school system to get you a cab every day to school. I think. Yeah. Yeah. It cost [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=267.12s)]
*  it. Well, it cost them a lot of money because the police would have to come to the bus on the side [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  of the road. They'd have to break up the fight and then the seats were broke. A window was broke. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=276.96s)]
*  And then the school's got to pay for all of that. And then by the time we get to school, school will [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=283.12s)]
*  be over. How old were you? I don't know. Sophomore, freshman, maybe sophomore. So sad. I have a freshman [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=286.64s)]
*  and the thought of that happening to him every day is upsetting. I mean, it's heartbreaking. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=295.67999999999995s)]
*  Your parents never intervened. Did they know? Oh, they knew. Yeah. Did they do anything? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=301.04s)]
*  What are they going to do? Get you out of there. That would have been a good idea. They probably [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  never thought of that. That's a good idea. So what was the story? Were they just young [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=314.0s)]
*  with substance abuse? Yeah. No, I think my parents were young. I think my mom was, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=318.32s)]
*  I don't know, maybe always kind of maybe just bitter as a lady. You know what I mean? She was [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  like the main divorced lady most of the time. And I just think that's how people thought their [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=328.56s)]
*  lives should be. I don't know. Do you have siblings? Yeah, I have a brother. Is he older or younger? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=337.52s)]
*  Older. So did he go through this too? Yeah, but he's just a little older than me. Yeah. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=342.72s)]
*  But I just can't imagine a mother allowing this to just keep happening to her child. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=347.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, here I am. You know what I mean? What are you going to do? Did you maintain, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=352.56s)]
*  I know you wound up living in a brothel, which is another interesting story, but did you keep [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  contact with your mom? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My whole life. Is she still around? No, she died, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, a while ago. So were you close? I mean, yeah, as close as you could kind of be [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=367.6s)]
*  with someone that you know is always mean, bitter. Wow. You know what I mean? What happened in her [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=375.04s)]
*  life that left her there? I don't know. I don't got the energy to like hang on to that much shit. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=381.04s)]
*  Yeah. Good. Yeah. So no, we always joke my husband's brother, they're Presbyterian. And he [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=387.44s)]
*  always jokes when you're thinking about something like that, push it down, push it down. Yeah. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=393.6s)]
*  He's not wrong. I mean, on some things. You got to let it go. Like letting it go is the better way. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? But the beatings, that would be tough to let go. I mean, I just feel like did [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  that create any resentment in you? I don't know. Yes. I mean, of course it did. It did. It didn't. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=408.8s)]
*  I mean, look, I look at it this way, I turned out the way I turned out. And I think anybody in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=420.72s)]
*  the situations I was in would come out the same way. And then you have to realize like, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=429.12s)]
*  you got to want to choose good, you know, it's easy for people to be bad. And I say this all the time, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=435.68s)]
*  no one has bad intent, but shit gets fucked up. Oh, can I say that? Yeah, you can. Yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=440.96s)]
*  I wouldn't have had you on if you couldn't say that word. That's your favorite word. Yeah, I know, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=447.04s)]
*  right? I'm trying to be nice. But shit gets fucked up. So, you know, I don't think my parents have [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=450.64s)]
*  bad intent. I don't think they were bad people. I think they were young. I think they drank, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=457.28s)]
*  anytime you drink like, you know, I used to drink a ton. But anytime you drink, like, you know, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=462.08s)]
*  of course there's going to be drama. It takes your filters away. You know what I mean? Like, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=469.36s)]
*  it's probably a better way to deal with and telling someone just to fuck off. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=475.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? So I think it's just like a product of being young. I don't think anyone had [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=479.28s)]
*  a bad intent. I just think it is what it is. And I tell you, it's generational. I mean, I'm not the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=484.24s)]
*  only one. You know what I mean? But I would say it's generational. And I'd say there's kids in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=490.48s)]
*  the same neighborhoods living about the same life and their parents were probably in school with me. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=494.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, and I think that's just how it works. It's like a cycle. Does it create [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=499.92s)]
*  like a resentment toward black people? If you have black schoolmates beating you up every day? No, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=505.6s)]
*  I can see how that would cause some eyes. The easy target, like, you know, later in school, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=510.8s)]
*  I didn't get beat up every day because I realized I learned to fight. I could protect myself. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=517.6s)]
*  And like a lot of the actual gang leaders in that, like they respected that. And so I didn't [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=524.4s)]
*  really have, I had to earn my way in, I guess. But once I earned my way in, it was fairly easy [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=531.12s)]
*  for me. I mean, and I look at it this way is like, you know, look, you could be the victim. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=537.84s)]
*  Okay, great. What's next? What's that going to do you? How long are you going to do that for? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=544.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? I'm guessing that given the way you describe the school system there, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  you were not on the college track and you knew that. Yeah, yeah. Did you know you're going to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=554.4s)]
*  wind up in the armed forces though? Was that a whole, you know, I knew I wanted to join. I kind [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=558.9599999999999s)]
*  of joined late. I was almost 21, but I wanted to join, but I didn't know like when, you know [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  what I mean? And then one day I was just like, bucket, let's go. Okay. We'll get to that, but [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=571.84s)]
*  I've got to spend a minute on the brothel. So as I mentioned it, how does, how did two guys, two kids [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=576.64s)]
*  wind up living in a brothel? Well, I don't know. You know, they say hookers have a heart of gold. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=581.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? Is that what happened? A hooker took you in? Yeah. Yeah. And we weren't [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=587.76s)]
*  the only kids, you know what I mean? But, yeah, no, who else was in there? How many kids did they have? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=594.72s)]
*  She had kids and like, so me and my brother helped raise other kids, stuff like that. Well, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=599.44s)]
*  what happened to your parents? Me and my brother decided we would be better on our own. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=604.08s)]
*  How old were you here? I don't know, 12, 13, maybe pre high school. So you went back with your parents [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=609.84s)]
*  by 15 when the bus situation was happening. No, I went to school myself. Okay. Walk me through it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=617.2800000000001s)]
*  So you're growing up, you're with your parents until around 12 and then you wind up living in [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=623.6s)]
*  a brothel. Me and my brother, yeah. How did you get connected with this woman running the brothel? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=627.52s)]
*  Well, I was living with my, I guess my stepmom. Anyway, it's a mess, you know, but I was living [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=631.68s)]
*  with my stepmom and then me and my brother just moved over there and they were nicer to me than [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=638.16s)]
*  anyone else I knew. You know what I mean? And was that, you were there for the duration until you [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=643.12s)]
*  hit 18? No, I was only there for a little bit. Let's see, what else happened? I don't know. I [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=648.16s)]
*  didn't live there that long. Like just, I don't know, high school, most of my high school years, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=655.76s)]
*  but that was it. Okay. Yeah. So now you got to find a direction once you hit 18, right? You got [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=661.12s)]
*  to do something. Well, I always worked. I've been working since I was a little kid. I was a welder. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=666.08s)]
*  I worked on trucks. So that's another thing I did is I always showed up to work on time, put myself [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=670.4s)]
*  to work, like earn money. You had a couple of skills that are completely foreign to me, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=675.76s)]
*  like being good with an engine and being a good navigator. Yeah. I don't, I think you're born [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=681.28s)]
*  with that. You're not born with that. Am I wrong? I don't know. Maybe. Did you always have that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  ability, that sense of navigation? Cause you talk like you really needed it. It would very become [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=692.24s)]
*  very important to you. It would. I am very good at navigation. I don't know. I guess you're born [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=696.0s)]
*  with it. Cause I would have never thought I've never not been good at it. Have you, have you, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=701.52s)]
*  do you get lost a lot? Never. I've always lost. You don't understand when you don't have this gift. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=705.44s)]
*  It's so frustrating. I'm at the point when I drive, whatever my instinct is, I know to do the [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=710.96s)]
*  opposite. Like a George Costanza situation. I just know, do not, whatever my instincts are telling me, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=715.36s)]
*  it's wrong when it comes to directions. I'm missing this chip. You could get a GPS. Well, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  I do. Thankfully I live in 20, 20, 20. Yeah. Nowadays, like I could get lost. Nowadays I'd [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=725.6s)]
*  say that only because like I just listened to the lady on my phone turn left. Okay. Yes. So, but no, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=730.64s)]
*  I have a pretty good sense of direction. Like maybe it's natural. I don't know. So what during [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=737.52s)]
*  these formative years, before we go off and join the military, are you, do you dating? Is there a [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=741.76s)]
*  special woman in your life? No, not really. Nobody. No, like you hadn't been in love yet. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=747.28s)]
*  Yeah, no, I pretty much avoided people most of my childhood. You know what I mean? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  Did anything happen in the brothel that would deflower you or? No comment. Okay. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=759.28s)]
*  I just saying, it seems like, it seems like an obvious thing to do. Okay. So you originally [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=765.36s)]
*  wanted to join the air force. Why? Yeah. Well, I was a mechanic, right? Very mechanically inclined. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=774.88s)]
*  I was a welder as well. I fixed a lot of semi trucks, broken frames, dump trucks, whole wall [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  collapse stuff. And it'd take me like weeks to rebuild these trucks, but it's kind of what I did. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  And then, and then, yeah, I figured I could do this for the air force. You know what I mean? And [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=793.92s)]
*  then the biggest thing was like, my hands were like always black, like cracked fingers, like you're [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=800.4s)]
*  always welding. It's always dirty, greasy, dirty stuff working on these trucks. Right? And like, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=807.5999999999999s)]
*  honestly, my thought was no girl is ever going to let me put my hand in her pants if she sees my [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=815.36s)]
*  hand. You know what I mean? There's just, it's not happening. You know what I mean? Does that stuff [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=821.68s)]
*  not come off with the right soap? I don't care how much soap you got. Like when you work like that, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=824.8s)]
*  like your hands are black. So, yeah. So I figured I got to do something else. You know what I mean? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  Like I just can't do this forever. You know, only because I was always dirty every day and you [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=836.4s)]
*  couldn't, you couldn't like not be dirty. Like even your days off, you couldn't wash and you [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=841.92s)]
*  weren't clean. You know what I mean? So I figured, well, maybe now's the time to join the army. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=847.04s)]
*  And so what happened at the air force? They said, I didn't have high enough skills to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=852.7199999999999s)]
*  be a mechanic, which I was. They told me I could be admin and I'm like, okay, what's that? Maybe [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  I'll do this. What's an admin? And he was like, well, you type memos, maybe process awards. And [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=867.52s)]
*  I was like, my mom's a secretary. Like that's what that sounds like. I'm out, you know? Yeah. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=873.76s)]
*  Talk about misjudging a man. Yeah. And they're like, hey son, have you talked to the Marines [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=879.6s)]
*  of the army yet? And I'm like, uh, no, I didn't even think of it, you know? So I went to the army. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=884.56s)]
*  Why the army? Well, a buddy of mine was an airborne ranger and said how great it was. So I just went [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  down there and told him I wanted to be an airborne ranger. Did they give you a hard time? Oh yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=896.24s)]
*  They did too? Oh yeah. Yeah. Everyone's giving you a hard time. Oh yeah. Like, well, I had like a, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=900.4s)]
*  so first off I had a mullet, like, okay, but who didn't have a mullet? You know what I mean? What [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=904.56s)]
*  year are we in now? We've got to be like, uh, 80, no, 90, 89. Yeah. Yeah. You're my age. I think. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=909.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, I had a mullet and they're like, you know, guys like, yo, Bob, hey, this guy wants [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=916.72s)]
*  to be a ranger. And they come out and they like laughed at me. I mean, don't they shave your head [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=923.1999999999999s)]
*  anyway? What do they care what your hair looks like? I don't know. But, uh, yeah, I was just like [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=927.6s)]
*  this skinny mullet head kid, you know, and, uh, they didn't believe in me, but I didn't care, you know. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=931.28s)]
*  Right. You might've been used to that feeling. Yeah. Yeah. I figured, I figured, well, Bob was a [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=937.28s)]
*  fat bald guy anyway. So like, you know, Bob, you're not impressive. And the guy I was talking to [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=941.84s)]
*  seemed like a dullard. So it's not like these guys impressed me. I just knew there was more to the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=947.28s)]
*  army. You know what I mean? So this is all before 9 11, you know, you're, you're signing up, but you [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=951.76s)]
*  don't know exactly what you're signing up for. I assume it's just, I want to be part of the military. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=956.32s)]
*  Yeah. I had no idea. I didn't know if I was doing like in my day, it was like, you sign up for the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=961.2s)]

*  both my grandpa's, my great grandpa, world war two. Like, so, uh, it turned out a lot of people, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=981.52s)]
*  my family were in the service and like, no one really talked about it. You know what I mean? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  That's pretty cool. Yeah. So you escalated up the ranks. It seems to me pretty quickly. You, like, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=992.4s)]
*  you got moved from thing to thing challenge to challenge, some of which were a surprise to you, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=998.8s)]
*  but it didn't sound like you had a lot of failures as you were making your name tons. You did [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1003.36s)]
*  Pfft, daily, daily failure. Oh yeah. They fail quick. Let's get it over with. Maybe we'll get [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  it right by the end of the day. How did you do in like the military setting? Because I would think [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1015.04s)]
*  with your background, you weren't exactly big on rules. I don't like rules. Yeah. So how'd you, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1018.88s)]
*  I mean, that's gotta be a problem in basic training. Um, not really. I mean, it's a game, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  you know what I mean? And their trash talk was great, man. Basic training. Like you enjoyed that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1028.0s)]
*  Oh God. They would like yell at people and like, I just be, I'd be like not even getting yelled at [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1033.2s)]
*  and I'd start laughing and they'd just be like, uh, my drill sergeant called me Maffey and he'd [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1040.16s)]

*  military wise and childhood wise. I mean, you know, like you gotta look, if you want stuff, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1064.0s)]
*  you gotta do it yourself. It's called responsibility. It doesn't matter your age. I call it adulting. I [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1070.3999999999999s)]
*  hate it, but I've been doing it for a long time. So if you want something, you gotta put in the work. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1075.52s)]

*  everybody. You know what I mean? Like, do you like everybody? No, no. It's such a long list [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1085.12s)]
*  of people. I just like, see, there you go. I cover politics for a living. So it's nice. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1089.4399999999998s)]
*  Your list is longer than mine. Very long. Okay. So let's go back. So then you meander over to the [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1093.76s)]
*  army. They take you. You're going through basic training. People are getting yelled at and you're [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1099.4399999999998s)]

*  Explain what ranger is. The ranger regiment is its own unit in the army. Their infantry, basically. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1114.88s)]
*  And nowadays their tier one unit, back in my day, they were just like specialized infantry or [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1128.64s)]
*  whatever they called them. Right. But yeah, the ranger regiment is a way of life. And then back in [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1136.0s)]
*  my day was RIP is what they called it. And basic training was a joke. We jog in the morning and [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1142.16s)]
*  sing songs. It's like summer camp. In RIP, some random looking dude just takes off faster than [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1148.88s)]
*  you've ever seen another human being running. You're just like, holy shit. These guys do this? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1157.28s)]
*  Let's go. Yeah. Real talk. And then the whole time, I didn't know if I was going to make it or not. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1164.3200000000002s)]
*  I was just doing my best. How long is the training? It was three weeks back then. Okay. But it's [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1170.56s)]
*  intense. Yeah. Back then it was. Yeah. And back then it was more about creating guys that won't [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1174.96s)]
*  quit than it was like training you at your actual job. Now from there, you joined special forces. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1180.32s)]
*  How long did that take? I did five years in ranger battalion. And then like the sergeant major at the [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1187.52s)]
*  time was like sending people to like Korea or some random army shit that I wanted nothing to do with. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1194.0s)]
*  What did you want? Not that. Not that. You know what I mean? Never wanted to go to Korea. I heard [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1200.48s)]
*  it's cold and like, anyway, never wanted to go there. Sorry. No offense. Where were you in the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1208.72s)]
*  States? I was in Savannah, Georgia. Okay. Yeah. See what I'm saying? Yeah. I hear you. Yeah. So [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1213.3600000000001s)]

*  right? And I didn't want to go anywhere. So I figured I'd hit special forces selection. At [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1224.88s)]
*  least it would like give me a path where I might control my ending. Can you talk about that? Because [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1229.44s)]
*  as a civilian, you hear special forces and you think, oh, it's cool. Something cool is happening. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1235.76s)]
*  Like he knows shit. Like he's done stuff. What did it mean to you? Oh, I don't know. I mean, like, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1240.8s)]
*  it's okay. I like special forces. It was a good time. Like when you were back a ranger, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1248.0800000000002s)]
*  considering what was the lure. I don't know. Like the John Wayne shit when I was a kid, right? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1251.92s)]
*  Yeah. Like Rambo, right? Like that's what I thought. Kind of in the middle nineties, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1258.24s)]
*  not really what was happening, but later on it got better more towards a GWOT. Everything got better. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1263.12s)]
*  What do you mean? You thought it would put you in charge of your own? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1269.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, if I went to special forces selection, I know I would go there next versus like coming [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1273.28s)]
*  down on orders for Korea one day. You know what I mean? Just like, Hey, guess what came some [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1279.4399999999998s)]
*  paperwork for you Korea. Holy shit. No fucking way. Right. Yeah. So I wanted to like avoid that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1284.24s)]
*  So how do you get into special forces? You got to go to selection. They got a selection. Like [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1291.44s)]
*  it's like a try out. Yeah. Try. What does selection mean? It's not a lot of stupid shit. You know what [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1295.68s)]
*  I mean? Like is it one day you show up? Oh, no, it's like a run. No. Okay. Special forces selection [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1301.76s)]
*  kind of works like this. It's based off a team and you got to work in a team, right? And it's [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1307.92s)]
*  12 guys in a, in a a team, a special forces a team, right? And then so you're kind of grouped in [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1313.68s)]
*  12 guys and then like you do like random stuff. Like you got to build these. They'll give you like [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1321.6000000000001s)]
*  one wheel, some pipe and a 500 pound barrel. And it's like, it's you got to take it 20 miles that [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1328.24s)]
*  way. Go. It's very MacGyver. Very MacGyver. Right. And then you have the right background for this [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1335.1200000000001s)]
*  too though. Yeah, but you're not in charge every day. And then if someone bads in charge and they [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1340.4s)]
*  talk about, they do stupid shit, you're stuck doing their stupid shit all day long. As on the worst [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1345.6000000000001s)]
*  team ever, I think in selection. Oh no. There's some of those guys might be listening to this [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1351.3600000000001s)]
*  right now. I don't care. They were pussies. You know what I mean? Like I do not give a shit. You [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1355.2s)]

*  They're bringing you down. Trying to hold me back. So you, you made it though. You got select. So you [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1364.0800000000002s)]
*  get selected to then train into special forces. Yep. And then they call it the Q course. And is [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1368.8s)]
*  what's that like the qualification? A lot of, I was an engineer. So that's the explosives, but [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1374.8799999999999s)]
*  we do a lot of other stuff like building stuff. Like basically you're a general contractor for like [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1381.52s)]
*  houses. They teach you that stuff. And then, yeah, yeah, yeah. Super useful. Right. And then [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1387.36s)]
*  explosives and a lot of explosive stuff. What, what's Delta Force? And when did you try out? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1393.68s)]
*  Oh, so yeah. The mid nineties special forces, you know, the Bill Clinton army kind of sucked, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1399.76s)]
*  no ammo, no training, no money. Right. So a buddy of mine, I was at his house. I don't know, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1406.72s)]
*  I was on leave. We were drinking, smoking cigars and he just gave me a yellow sticky with a time [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1416.32s)]

*  Mogadishu guy and I went and that's it. I passed. Yeah. So that was you in special forces trying to [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1441.2s)]
*  make it on the Delta Force, which is yet another sort of next elite level. But in my day, you didn't [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1448.8s)]
*  know what Delta Force was. Like if someone went there is a black hole. You just never seen them [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1453.8400000000001s)]

*  show up at six AM? What else was I going to do? Sometimes I do my best work hungover. What's that? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1462.64s)]
*  How hard was the tryout or the? Oh, so first off, it ain't easy. I'm going to say that. But at the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1472.16s)]
*  same time, it's fucking great, man. They leave you alone. You walk through the mountains like, yeah, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1477.92s)]

*  forest? I'm already sweating. That's making me nervous. I know. It's probably the worst thing [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1489.1200000000001s)]
*  you want to hear. I would never make it. But like you'd have maps and they're like this big [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1492.24s)]

*  even before Bin Laden knew where you were going to wind up, but that was perfect training for what [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1513.6s)]
*  ultimately would be asked of you. Yeah. 100%. I was ready. Were you in Delta Force when 9 11 happened? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1519.68s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. So you're doing your training. What? Still down in Savannah? I was at Bragg, Fort Bragg. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1524.88s)]
*  Okay. And then, well, 9 11, I was trying to skydive to go to a free fall jump master school. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1530.4s)]

*  like, it looked like a little plane crashed in. You know, I didn't know some drunken idiot in his, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1548.0s)]
*  little plane crashed in. Right. And then the second was like, oh shit. And then we were grounded and [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1554.0s)]
*  that was it. You know, then you knew it was like something bad. You knew, but unlike the rest of us, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1559.04s)]
*  you actually were going to have to answer the call. I mean, does that, is that exciting? Is it [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1564.6399999999999s)]
*  nerve wracking? Is it everything? It's a lot of things, but I would say this is, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1569.92s)]
*  uh, I was too far in not to go. You know what I mean? I was excited. I was nervous, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1575.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, like the whole, I say this all the time. People are going to have a thousands emotions [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1582.0800000000002s)]
*  today. Right? Like it's just how people work. You'll have a thousand emotions. Don't let it [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1587.52s)]
*  stop on the bad ones. You know what I mean? I know what you mean, but it's harder to do than actually, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1592.0s)]
*  you know, it sounds maybe, I don't know. You know, people get stuck, they get stuck in sort [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1597.8400000000001s)]
*  of obsessive thinking, especially if their life might be on the line. Uh, yeah, people get stuck. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1602.72s)]
*  So how do you rejigger that if that's you and you get stuck on something, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1607.6000000000001s)]

*  I need that. You know what I mean? Snap them out of it. So what, what, what was the first word you [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1614.08s)]
*  had that you were getting deployed and to where, um, well, there's a lot of things happening between [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1619.04s)]
*  9 11 and before we deployed. Uh, I think the original plan is we were supposed to save some [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1626.32s)]
*  hostages in Kabul. Uh, and then we ended up doing the Torah Bora thing. So what we trained for and [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1632.56s)]
*  what happened were completely different animals. You know what I mean? Do you know why? That's the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1638.72s)]
*  way to cookie crumbles. You know what I mean? Like, follow what they go. You know what I mean? You're [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1644.96s)]
*  not in charge. Someone else is making the calls. You just got to do your best when the time comes. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1649.9199999999998s)]

*  talk about it. It sounds, I mean, like you were looking for bin Laden. Yeah. So yeah, we were [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1665.84s)]
*  looking for bin Laden. Um, the Torah Bora was like a stronghold, uh, for bin Laden, Al Qaeda, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1670.72s)]
*  whatever they call themselves. Right. Um, and the Russians could never get in there. Right. And, um, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1679.36s)]
*  I think somebody, I don't know who said it, but, uh, it was 10, it took 10 of us 10 days [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1686.9599999999998s)]
*  to do what? To get everybody out of those mountains, either kill them or have them come [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1692.56s)]
*  out and surrender. But it took 10 of us 10 days. The Russians never took it. They had 10,000 [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1697.36s)]
*  soldiers, you know? So how we do that? We bombed the shit out of those guys. You know what I mean? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1703.04s)]
*  Thanks to all your explosives training? No, there was more like air force stuff. You know what I [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1709.36s)]
*  mean? Unfortunately, not my, I mean, if I had to blow them up one at a time, like that would be [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1714.3999999999999s)]
*  awesome, but, uh, we bombed them. So it was more of an air force thing. We had a call on the radio [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1720.1599999999999s)]
*  for bomb. Was that deployment that, that moment when you showed up in Torah Bora the first time [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1725.52s)]
*  you ever killed a man? Um, yeah, yeah. War like let's go. We killed hundreds of people on the first [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1730.7199999999998s)]
*  day. Like I can't tell you how many people died or, you know what I mean? There's just everywhere, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1737.52s)]

*  Russians included. And then what? Well, Bin Laden wrote a death letter. He wrote a death letter. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1814.96s)]
*  It's on the internet, but he wrote a letter. He thought he was going to die. Is this the one [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1822.16s)]
*  where he was, this is a different letter from the one that the morons were circulating on TikTok [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1826.4s)]
*  about a year and a half ago saying, this is amazing. He's so smart. He's got such good reasons for [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1830.24s)]
*  attacking us. That happened. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. You really wouldn't, you should stay [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1834.32s)]
*  off the internet and you should not get to know Gen Z. I don't think you'll be happy. I don't do [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1839.92s)]
*  any social media. Well, so what happened? Cause you, you didn't find Bin Laden there, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1844.4s)]
*  but you found all of his henchmen. Yeah. He killed them. Yeah. And then are you like done? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1848.96s)]
*  Because Bin Laden is still out there. A fucking ceasefire, a fucking ceasefire. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1852.8000000000002s)]
*  Someone called a ceasefire. And I would also say, there's a couple of helicopters flew over to [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1858.3200000000002s)]
*  battlefield, which I still to this day don't know who they were. Oh, you think he was escaping? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1864.0800000000002s)]
*  I look at it this way. If, if the first 10 days of the war, 10 guys kill Bin Laden, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1868.8s)]
*  where's the war on terror at? Oh, this is interesting. The checkbook would have never [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1880.56s)]
*  got open. Oh, that's really interesting. That's what I think. So you're pretty cynical about our [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1885.44s)]
*  military industrial complex. I wouldn't say cynical. Like, I mean, I enjoyed my time. I [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1891.6s)]
*  love grenades. You know what I mean? But I do think like the rug was pulled out from under us. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1898.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, I mean, it definitely was at the end, but are you talking about right here right now? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1907.04s)]
*  When you're trying to find Bin Laden, you don't think that the military brass wanted you to find [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1911.04s)]
*  him. They wanted it to go on and on. No, I think someone else intervened and put him in hiding. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1914.9599999999998s)]
*  Someone who owned helicopters. Regular people own helicopters, who owns helicopters? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1921.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? And then how come I've never heard about this anywhere else? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1930.08s)]
*  I don't know. No one wants to talk about this. I know, right? See what I'm saying? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1934.24s)]
*  But I mean, are you talking about, like I say, the military industrial complex, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1937.76s)]
*  like one of these big contractors, or are you talking about us, us, us? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1941.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, you can make your own guesses. You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1945.4399999999998s)]
*  But I would say this is like, okay, where's the story between where he lived in Pakistan [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1949.2800000000002s)]
*  and Tora Bora? Where's that story also, by the way? I want to know that story. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1953.92s)]
*  Do we know? I have no idea. You? No. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1957.5200000000002s)]
*  You ever heard anything? No. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1960.3200000000002s)]
*  We need this like these JFK files. Let's go. You know what I mean? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1961.92s)]
*  You actually have a shot at it right now with this administration. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1965.44s)]
*  Well, there you go. You talk, you know these guys. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1968.0s)]
*  I got a friend over at the Pentagon. There you go. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1969.92s)]
*  I mean, we can get to the bottom of that. There you go. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1972.24s)]
*  Well, that's, I mean, unfortunately, and totally understandably, so many of our veterans [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1975.28s)]
*  are asking these questions now, including Sean. You know, I talked to him at length about [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1981.44s)]
*  his questions about who are the good guys. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1985.12s)]
*  And we're not. I don't think we are. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1988.6399999999999s)]
*  You don't. I don't think we're good friends. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1991.28s)]
*  Why? I think we deal on a short timeline, a four-year timeline. And I think everyone else [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=1993.6s)]
*  has been in charge for 50 years. You know what I mean? And they've seen us flip-flop [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2003.28s)]
*  back and forth and we pull, we push, we tug a war with the rope. It never ends out good. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2009.04s)]
*  We're not good friends. And then as soon as you don't do what we want, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2015.6s)]
*  we're going to chuck you under the bus and move the fuck on. You know what I mean? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2019.52s)]
*  Give me an example. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2022.8s)]
*  I don't know. Tons of stuff. You know what I mean? I'm giving you an example right now. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2025.76s)]
*  Where are these helicopters at? Where's the story of Bin Laden from Abbottabad? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2029.52s)]
*  That's where the officers are trained in Pakistan. Interesting, right? And how did he get out of [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2036.8s)]
*  Afghanistan? He's on dialysis. You mean this guy walked over 14,000 foot mountains in the snow [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2043.36s)]
*  with his little woolen blanket and his dialysis machine, but left all his people behind. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2051.7599999999998s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? But I think George Bush said that are alive and I think the Pentagon was [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2059.68s)]
*  risk adverse. And I think that's where the disconnect was at that time. But I think someone [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2069.44s)]
*  else stepped in and took Bin Laden into hiding. And when we found him in 2010, in my exact time, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2076.48s)]
*  it was 2011. I was on maternity leave with my daughter. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2085.12s)]
*  It was an election year. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2087.52s)]
*  So you think that was by design? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2089.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2091.92s)]
*  He was more useful. He was more useful dead. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2094.56s)]
*  Obama needed to get reelected. It's time. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2097.12s)]
*  And so allowed him to be killed. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2100.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2103.68s)]
*  So is that just your gut having been in the army for 20 years or? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2105.2s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2109.12s)]
*  I mean, that's like, that's the worst possible like take on our commander in chief and what [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2111.2s)]
*  they might do like endanger, continue a war where guys are getting killed and their limbs blown off. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2117.28s)]
*  What to improve your so you can get the election under your belt. It's just so. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2123.2000000000003s)]
*  It's the way it works. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2129.0400000000004s)]
*  Oh my gosh. It's so horrible to even consider. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2130.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's the way it works. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2133.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, if I had been over there and seeing my guys blown up, I think I'd be very angry. If I believe [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2135.52s)]
*  this, I'd be very fucking pissed off. Are you angry? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2141.84s)]
*  I mean, I mean, being angry wouldn't get me a cup of coffee. You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2146.2400000000002s)]
*  I know, but either you feel it or you don't. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2151.6800000000003s)]
*  If you, you know, I look at it this way. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2153.1200000000003s)]
*  I had a great time. I did everything I could. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2157.76s)]
*  I did as much as I could every time I could. And I always try to do the right thing. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2162.0800000000004s)]
*  At the same time, like, I can't control everything. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2167.0400000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? And then does it make me mad? Sure. Do I hate that? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2170.96s)]
*  Like, you know, the politicians disagree on something and it costs your son his life, right? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2175.92s)]
*  Like ridiculous, right? But at the same time, like I was having the time of my life, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2187.2s)]
*  so I wasn't questioning shit. You know, anytime you drink from the bottle of hindsight, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2192.56s)]
*  everything gets clearer. You know what I mean? But at the time, like, I didn't question it. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2197.28s)]
*  I just want to, I was onto the next, like, war was my life, you know, and I was good at it. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2201.84s)]
*  And I saved lives. I saved a ton of lives in war. All those things combined kept me back, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2207.6000000000004s)]
*  coming back to it, whether it's right, wrong, indifferent, like, these are things that I can't [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2215.1200000000003s)]
*  control. So why even dwell on it? You know what I mean? It's almost, it's, and then you'll get [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2222.48s)]
*  stuck in there. It's muddy water. You'll get stuck. It's quicksand. You'll sink in it. Like, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2227.92s)]
*  why this? Why that? Like, why ask why? You haven't been through therapy. This is just your own [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2232.08s)]
*  thinking. I don't go to therapy. You know a therapist? I do. I actually know a really good [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2238.0s)]
*  one, but I don't think you need him. You got your head on your shoulders. I try. That's life [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2244.48s)]
*  therapy right there. I don't know. It's somehow you manage to get like a really clear view on [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2249.6s)]
*  all of this, but so many guys I've talked to them come back traumatized. Well, I call it the [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2254.88s)]
*  last chapter. They're stuck in the last chapter. You know what I mean? Like they can't get out of [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2261.92s)]
*  that chapter and whether, but what really happens is like the story's not over. You know what I mean? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2267.6s)]
*  I was under the age of 40 doing all that stuff. Well, I've had a lot more years like, so your life [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2274.4s)]
*  never gets better. You're never going to enjoy anything again. Like get out of that chapter, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2281.2000000000003s)]
*  right? And write a new chapter. Is it the, in part, like the adrenaline rush that you miss? Like [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2286.4s)]
*  it's tough to recreate that in civilian life. Yeah. It's more than the adrenaline rush. You [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2292.0s)]
*  know what I mean? It's so much more. I mean, when you're really good at something, it's all you want [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2299.12s)]
*  to do. And when you know guys are really good at something, I could, you could save lives by sending [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2306.08s)]
*  guys that are really, really good at this. You know what I mean? So I think it's just one of those [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2313.12s)]
*  things where it's, it's a calling and it's not really your choice. You know what I mean? But at [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2318.24s)]
*  the same time, it's a choice you got to make. When were you in Toro Bora? I don't know, December of [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2324.88s)]
*  90 or no, oh one. And then you went back, right? Yeah. I went back to Toro Bora. Yeah. When'd you [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2332.56s)]
*  go back? Two, just a few months later in 2002, I went back. And was that your like solo? How did [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2338.56s)]
*  you wind up solo in Toro Bora? Pretty easy. I needed pop tarts. Okay. I heard that you mentioned [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2348.0s)]
*  this on shot, right? I was getting pop tarts. So I need to clarify this. You wanted the pop tarts [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2356.16s)]
*  and there's something else. What was the other thing? Beef jerky? Beef jerky. Okay. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2361.6s)]
*  You needed this. So you convinced them to send you on some mission back to like the chow hall [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2365.28s)]
*  to get the stuff? I just told my boss like, Hey, we doing anything tonight? I'll schedule the [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2370.0s)]
*  helicopter and I'll go to the chow hall. I'll have their guy fill our truck. Okay. Then I got lost. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2374.4s)]
*  What happened? Like you never went back with the pop tarts and the beef jerky? I did. Weeks later. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2381.28s)]
*  But it seemed like you got sucked into this unit that had the good food. Yeah. And then you were [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2386.88s)]
*  off to the races. Well, it was where everyone was. It was where all the guys were. You know, I mean, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2390.7200000000003s)]
*  okay, first off, the defo, when they deployed, like they have beef jerky, they have the defo. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2394.88s)]
*  What's that? Delta Force. Delta Force. The Divo. I'm like, who was he? But anyway, like, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2404.4s)]
*  you're the highest army unit. You have beef jerky. You have pop tarts. You have, you know what I mean? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2412.88s)]
*  Like stuff army guys like might see once a month, we should be getting every day. Cause like they're [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2417.92s)]
*  serving cappuccinos. Yeah. And then like the food is really good because we have our own cooks and [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2423.36s)]
*  they care about what you eat. You know what I mean? So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the army system, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2428.4s)]
*  but it's within the army system, which makes it a little better. Right. So I was just going to go [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2434.32s)]
*  get some pop tarts and really it's just a resupply run. So I drive my Toyota truck on a helicopter. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2439.28s)]
*  They fly me to Bagram. And then one of the commanders, the guy that wrote kill Bin Laden [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2445.36s)]
*  was like, Hey, what are you doing? And I'm like, I'm stealing pop tarts. Right. I'm here for food. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2450.48s)]
*  Yeah. And, uh, he was like, you want to go on a mission? And I was like, yeah. I was like, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2455.84s)]
*  well, you gotta call my boss. And he's like, okay, I'll call him. And he did. And then, um, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2460.56s)]
*  I was like, what is it? You know what I mean? They're like, we want you to go out alone. And [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2464.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, this sounds risky. Okay. Just happened. Like you were just there getting the pop tarts [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2468.08s)]
*  and they were like, you know, you're, you'd be good for this. Yeah. Wow. And you, this is what kind of [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2472.48s)]
*  you wanted to do anyway, be on your own, make your own decisions. Oh, I didn't know if I wanted to, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2477.92s)]
*  like never thought about it before then, but it, it turns out something I do. So what was the [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2483.36s)]
*  mission? Why did you have to go out by yourself? Why couldn't you have others? Well, uh, this goes [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2488.2400000000002s)]
*  back to the, the politics of it is the general at the time wouldn't let us to do it, to hit a target [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2492.56s)]
*  in Afghanistan. We needed us eyes on. Makes sense. So how do you get us eyes on? You have to send out [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2501.36s)]
*  reconnaissance guys. And that's what I did. Right. Uh, and then, um, but you can't, no one can leave [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2509.52s)]
*  the wire. What's the wire, the perimeter, the base you can't. So, so that's, so the general's like, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2516.16s)]
*  no one can leave the base, but you got to launch reconnaissance to get us eyes on someone's going [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2522.8s)]
*  to have to leave the base. So we're going to have to leave the base. And that was you. Was there [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2527.68s)]
*  another guy or is it just you? Well, the only reason they sent me is they, uh, they kept me in [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2531.6s)]
*  because I was coming from one base to another and outstation to a major base. I was in transit. So [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2536.4s)]
*  they just kept me in transit for weeks. Yeah. You're like, who knows? We have no idea what John [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2542.08s)]
*  basically they had a lie about what I was doing to make really on a search jerky, right? You're not [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2546.56s)]
*  giving up. No, the guys back in the original place were probably like, where the hell are the pop [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2553.6800000000003s)]
*  tarts? They were in my truck. So, okay. Get them later. So then how long is this solo mission [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2558.4s)]
*  back through toro borough? Just probably took me 10 days ish. Why are you going back there when we [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2564.64s)]
*  already blew up the people? Uh, well, the last guy to supposedly help bin Laden out of the valley [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2569.92s)]
*  just came back from Pakistan with him and his sons, with bin Laden and his sons or with his own, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2576.7200000000003s)]
*  his own sons. Like supposedly during the battle of toro borough, because he lived near there, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2583.2000000000003s)]
*  uh, there was, he was the facilitator of getting people in and out of there. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2589.8399999999997s)]
*  Okay. So we wanted to kill him or we wanted to capture. We wanted to capture him because we [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2594.7999999999997s)]
*  thought maybe he brought bin Laden out of there. Okay. So the last lead for bin Laden was this guy [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2600.08s)]
*  because we have everybody else, all his people, his bodyguard, his cook, his everybody. So do they [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2607.44s)]
*  tell you where you're going? And then it's just up to you to get yourself there. Yeah. Like, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2612.24s)]
*  did they show you that spot on the map and you're like, I got to figure this out. Yeah. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2617.44s)]
*  All right. So they, they're like, we believe we know where he is. Yeah. Now good luck to you. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2621.68s)]
*  Yeah. Go find him. And did. How pretty simple. Like he's, it's only one valley. Like, and there's [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2625.6s)]
*  only, you know what I mean? There's only, I had already been there. That's one of the things is, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2633.44s)]
*  so I kind of knew the area. I knew the terrain, right? And it's like, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2637.44s)]
*  are there bad guys trying to kill you everywhere? Everywhere. Yeah. So how do you get past them? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2640.64s)]
*  Bad guys, like in checkpoints. Yeah. You act like a retard. Like an American though, right? They [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2646.88s)]
*  knew you're an American. No. They thought you were one of them. Yeah. What? Yeah. How's that [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2652.7200000000003s)]
*  possible? You're just pasty as I am. I have a big, because of Russians, rape people, people look [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2657.6800000000003s)]
*  like me in Afghanistan. Lots of them. Oh, wow. I didn't think of that. Yeah. So you would act like [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2663.2000000000003s)]
*  a local and like a nutcase and they'd let you walk right by. All the time. What would acting [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2669.2000000000003s)]
*  like a nutcase look like? Well, so like this guy, the first time happened to me, this guy like [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2675.84s)]
*  jams his AK in my chest and it's like, I'm supposed to say something. And I just figured [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2682.48s)]
*  if I speak American right now, I'm dead. That's it. You know what I mean? So I figured, well, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2690.0s)]
*  I'll act like a retard. And I figured, okay, how would a retarded guy sound? First off, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2696.0s)]
*  it'd be volume 11. Right? So loud, you don't even want to listen. And then it'd be Mongoloid stuff. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2704.08s)]
*  So I was just kind of like, move along. Yeah. Did you have your AK? Yeah. Did he know that? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2710.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, so he knew like, it's not unusual to be armed there, even if you're not everybody's [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2721.2799999999997s)]
*  arm. Okay. That's incredible. Yeah. So you find the destination and did you get eyes on the guy? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2725.84s)]
*  Yeah, videotape to my record. And that's that was the mission. Not don't take him out. Don't [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2732.64s)]
*  try to kidnap him. Just tell us if he in fact is there. So now you got the evidence. Was that a [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2736.72s)]
*  moment like when you saw him, you're like, Holy shit. Did you know it was him? First of all, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2742.96s)]
*  or you just could be some rando? Well, when I was, I was in a truck, I said with a bunch of people, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2745.8399999999997s)]
*  no one knows I'm American. I, as we drove by, I put my video camera under my arm, and I video [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2752.24s)]
*  camera the house and like dude was on the front porch. Luckily. So you got a good shot of him. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2761.04s)]
*  All of it. Yeah. All of it got everything I needed. Are you sure? Because I would imagine [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2766.72s)]
*  in the moment I've been sort of not in this circumstance, but I've not long ago did this [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2770.96s)]
*  undercover video of somebody and I was like, Oh, I hope I got the shot. You don't know until you can [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2774.88s)]
*  go check it later. But this is a very important shot to get dude was on the porch. It was perfect. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2778.64s)]
*  You knew you had it. Yeah. Did you recognize him? No, I didn't know. Okay. I didn't know. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2783.04s)]
*  You found out later that you did in fact get the guy. Yeah, correct. So then did we get him? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2790.16s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. And do you think it was instrumental in getting us to bin Laden? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2795.12s)]
*  No, it wasn't. It was not. Madam CIA analyst whose name we still don't know was not using [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2801.68s)]
*  that particular information and figuring out where bin Laden was. I don't know what any of that means, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2808.08s)]
*  but it did not help. He had no idea. Okay. All right. So what does that mean for you? Anything? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2814.48s)]
*  Does that make you feel disappointed about it? Or like, well, I always thought, well, I thought at [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2822.56s)]
*  the time, like, a, they were going to find out he was like dead in a cave later. You know what I [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2826.16s)]
*  mean? I just figured we boom the smithereens. It might be hard to find the parts. You know what I [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2832.08s)]
*  mean? So and then I figured one day the truth will come out. I kind of always knew that. So [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2837.92s)]
*  well, when you heard about the raid and you saw Barack Obama on television that night, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2843.84s)]
*  what was your reaction? I thought it was great. You did? Yeah. I thought it was great. I mean, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2848.7200000000003s)]
*  for whatever reason Obama had, I thought it was great. And then I can tell you this, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2854.32s)]
*  if I was commander in chief, the minute I heard that I'd be like, go smoke that fool now. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2859.28s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yep. End of discussion. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2865.0400000000004s)]
*  Since president Trump's election, the eyes of the nation have been on Mar-a-Lago and the free [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2873.36s)]

*  be gross. In his first term, president Trump signed a law to solve this problem with a [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2896.0s)]
*  new reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee to keep clean, fresh water flowing constantly to South [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2900.72s)]
*  Florida. President Trump said after years of rebuilding other nations, we're finally rebuilding [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2906.08s)]

*  Danielle Pletka Rob O'Neill was our first [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2929.12s)]
*  Memorial Day in-depth interview back when we launched the show. We didn't even have a video [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2932.88s)]
*  yet. It would have been Memorial Day of 2021 right after the show launched. And that story was just [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2937.12s)]
*  unbelievable just to hear it told firsthand. He's controversial now. Some people don't think he [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2943.12s)]
*  should have said it was him, blah, blah, blah. What do you think? Rob O'Neill Seals, you know what I [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2947.2s)]
*  mean? It's always fucking drama with those guys. You know what I'm saying? Danielle Pletka I adore [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2951.68s)]
*  him. I really admire him so deeply. I'm not buying into any of that drama. All right, so now [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2957.2s)]
*  it wasn't done. You're not done. The war's still going on. And then you wind up going to Iraq. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2964.08s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that was like the, they were gearing up. You know what I mean? We're trying [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2968.3999999999996s)]
*  to do this. They were gearing up for Iraq. I mean, that's a nightmare. When you look back on that [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2975.6s)]
*  one, what do you think? Iraq? Yeah. I loved Iraq. What? No one says that. Why? I don't know. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2980.56s)]
*  I mean, you have an interesting take on it. And I love to hear your take on Saddam Hussein because [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2987.8399999999997s)]
*  you're making some good points I hadn't considered. Saddam, man, like we should have left him. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2993.12s)]
*  We should have killed his bastard sons and told him play along or you're next. Uday and Kusay. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=2998.08s)]
*  Yeah, them dudes needed to go. But he was kind of a fan of the Christians. He was. He was. His [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3003.68s)]
*  inner circle was all Christians. The people that touched his food, washed his butt, like, oh, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3009.7599999999998s)]
*  Christian, all inner circle. And it's because of the martyr thing. You know, if you're a Muslim, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3016.48s)]
*  you kill yourself, you're a martyr, you go to heaven. You know what I mean? As a Christian, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3022.0s)]
*  you kill yourself, you go to hell. So he surrounded himself and put up with the Christians. That's why [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3027.04s)]
*  Iraq was actually pretty Western even back then because he allowed Christians to have their own [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3032.32s)]
*  areas, do their own things. Right. And then, you know, ISIS allows none of that. You know what I [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3039.04s)]
*  mean? Yep. And then we had to mess with it. So did you, you did go on a mission where you [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3044.56s)]
*  tried to get him. Tell me again what it was. It was like a woman, his affair partner's husband. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3051.36s)]
*  Yeah. We rolled up everybody that met Saddam. You know what I mean? And then we used to say, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3056.64s)]
*  look, we're in the army, like, you know, in the, you know, our intelligence agencies, they give [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3064.72s)]
*  polygraphs and they determine their rating as sources. And like, they'd be like, this is an [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3070.08s)]
*  unreliable source. You know what I'm saying? And we'd be like, I'm in the army. I'm pulling every [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3076.16s)]
*  thread. Let's go. I don't care. And we go check it out anyway. Most of the time they were wrong. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3080.96s)]
*  Yeah. Go figure. But yeah, Saddam had like a favorite sex lady. I never even heard of this. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3086.72s)]
*  I heard you saying she was not hot. Yeah. Like, like, I don't know what they got going, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3097.04s)]
*  but like, who knows what she was doing when I closed doors. Yeah, there's no talent. She must [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3102.56s)]
*  have been a real pro. You know what I mean? That's all I could think. She had to know something about [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3106.8s)]
*  something. But like, you would think like, I don't know, like, you would just assume she would be [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3112.08s)]
*  attractive. I don't know. I didn't know what to assume. Everyone pictures the affair partner as [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3118.1600000000003s)]
*  somebody who's very hot. The wife could maybe or maybe not. None of that happening here. Maybe [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3122.0s)]
*  had some hot ones. I didn't see them. Yeah. Different taste. Maybe she had a routine. We [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3127.44s)]
*  have no idea. She obviously had something. Okay. So, but it wasn't her you were looking for. It was [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3131.44s)]
*  her husband. She was married. We were, we couldn't get to her because it's hard to get to women in [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3138.08s)]
*  Iraq. So we had to get to the husband. See what I'm saying? And what information could we get from [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3143.68s)]
*  the husband? I don't know. Maybe Saddam kind of, you know, was honey potted a little bit. He told [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3148.8s)]
*  his favorite honey pot, I don't know, something, you know, and as an army guy, not an Intel guy, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3155.44s)]
*  I'm like, let's go. Let's look into this. I'll do it. Yeah, I don't care. And do we get him? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3162.48s)]
*  Yeah, we got him. Yeah. Did he know anything? Yeah, they didn't know shit. You know what I mean? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3167.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, they didn't know shit. But we did get him. And yeah, it was, okay, this is, this is kind of [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3172.2400000000002s)]
*  legendary. But I was across the street in a minivan and I was kind of watching this shop. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3178.16s)]
*  I had two Iraqi guys that I would use. And then I had the assault force kind of park [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3187.52s)]
*  on the corner close to the shop. And then enough time went by. We were just waiting and waiting. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3195.2s)]
*  I told my guys to start fighting in front of the store if too much time went by. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3203.2799999999997s)]
*  So they start a fistfight in front of the store. And then people come out like what's going on out [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3207.76s)]
*  front of the store. And the dude came out and literally put his back to like the van door, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3213.44s)]
*  the assault force. And I'm like, yo, open the door. It's that dude right there. And they grabbed him. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3218.8s)]
*  And then it was over and people were like looking for him. No one even knew he was [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3224.6400000000003s)]
*  everyone had been watching the fight. Wow. And then later, my boss was like, man, we're so lucky [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3229.36s)]
*  that dude started a fight. I was like, I was like, that was our guys. I was trying to speed this up [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3235.2s)]
*  a little bit. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's hot in the back of the van. So you don't have to do [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3241.2s)]
*  the interrogation or you do? I've done a lot of them. Okay. They don't always send in like the [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3244.72s)]
*  dark arts guys from the CIA to do that crap. Like that's, that's us too. Those guys are chump change. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3250.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? They're the Gitmo only. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So how do you make a guy like [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3257.68s)]
*  that talk? And by the way, easy. How do you communicate with one another? You have a translator [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3263.12s)]
*  there. Yeah. You gotta have a turp people to speak the language. But yeah. What do you mean easy? How [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3267.3599999999997s)]
*  is it easy? Oh, everybody talks. They do. Oh, are you kidding me? You torture them? What do you do? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3272.16s)]
*  You don't kind of do shit. It's easy. What? Yeah. Fear and common sense is a powerful tool. You know [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3277.52s)]
*  what I mean? Most of the time, like what? Okay. Think about this. Okay. This is every human being. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3282.96s)]
*  This is me. This is you look, there's stuff that you're going to die with that you ain't telling [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3289.44s)]
*  no one about. Everybody does that. Right? Does that make sense to you? I don't know. I'm kind [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3294.64s)]
*  of an open book, but okay. Yes, I am too. But there's secrets people keep to their grave. Right? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3300.8s)]
*  That's basically what I'm saying. Right. And then there's other shit like what's your cousin's car [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3306.4s)]
*  look like that you just ain't holding? It ain't worth like getting beat over. It ain't worth [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3311.76s)]
*  fighting over. Like, it's a little white car. This is a small point of order, but did he know [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3319.0400000000004s)]
*  that the wife was having an affair with Saddam Hussein? The entire time. He did. What do you do? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3324.7200000000003s)]
*  Was he okay with it? I'm just kind of curious what the sex dynamic was. I would imagine he felt [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3330.2400000000002s)]
*  lucky to be alive every day. Right. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. He'd be a very easy guy to get [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3334.8s)]
*  rid of and then you could have the side piece whenever you wanted it. But I guess he could [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3340.32s)]
*  anyway. So what's the point of killing the husband? I don't know. So he gave up whatever info and did [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3345.2000000000003s)]
*  we find Saddam Hussein after that? Shortly after that. Yeah. We were, look, we had to run all the [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3351.2000000000003s)]
*  manhunting is like a sweater. When like you have a yarn on a sweater, you pull it. Right? One of [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3358.0s)]
*  those threads is going to, the arm's going to come off. One of those threads, you pull it out forever. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3364.56s)]
*  It doesn't do nothing. You know what I mean? So we're going to pull every thread. This is the [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3369.2s)]
*  process. Yeah. So when you, was that the biggest thing that you did when you were in Iraq? Would [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3373.12s)]
*  you say like the most serious thing? No. No. What else did you do? Zarqawi was serious days. Oh my [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3378.48s)]
*  God. That was dark. That was the dark stuff. You're over there with all the beheadings and all that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3384.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh my God. I mean, does that scare you? You're only a man. You're a man. I mean, I don't know. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3389.7599999999998s)]
*  I wasn't really scared, but I did get a sword off a Zarqawi truck that was like a Roman short [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3395.76s)]
*  sword. And I'm like, there's pictures of me. I got my shirt off. I'm like, I don't know if you've [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3402.32s)]
*  ever seen this, but I wanted to, I would have cut one of their heads off. You know what I mean? Like, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3406.88s)]
*  but no, it didn't scare me. You know, Zarqawi was a bully and he liked to pick on the weak. He didn't [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3412.1600000000003s)]
*  want to pick on us. You know what I mean? And then, you know, yeah, the Zarqawi days were great. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3419.76s)]
*  Foreign fighters was great. I mean, I don't know. I loved it all, but like the foreign fighters, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3427.0400000000004s)]
*  like you just show up in front of the house, have my guy get on the bullhorn. They'd start shooting. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3432.4s)]
*  We'd level the house, you know, like those days were great. I mean, I think those days were great [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3437.76s)]
*  because that's when the military finally let us take the gloves off and be like, okay, you guys [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3445.44s)]
*  do this your way. You know what I mean? What year is this now? 06, 07? Yeah, Zarqawi was 6. You know [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3451.12s)]
*  what I mean? But they'd finally start to let the gloves come off. You know, I think, like, I think [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3457.52s)]
*  we were, we were throttled a lot through a lot of stuff, but I feel like through the Zarqawi days, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3462.48s)]
*  no one gave a shit how we were getting it done. You know what I mean? So how long were you over [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3469.6s)]
*  there or how many deployments do you have? I think I got 10 and then like, I got a bunch of like the [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3474.48s)]
*  surge and the stay late and shit like that. You went back and back? Yeah. 10 deployments? Yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3479.28s)]
*  And then as a Sarm major, I spent a lot of time there, but it didn't really count as a deployment. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3485.36s)]
*  I was back and forth. Oh, wow. So then what, like, how does it end for you? I don't know. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3490.88s)]
*  They just send you back home before the fight is done or did you fight all the way to the end of [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3499.28s)]
*  the- No, I was a Sarm major. I retired in 11. You're getting older. Yeah. They don't let you [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3503.2799999999997s)]
*  serve forever. Really? Right? Oh man. You're only young so long, you know, but I'll tell you what, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3508.0s)]
*  with stem cells and shit, I could have stayed another 10 years if modern science was heading. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3513.12s)]
*  It's so interesting to talk to you and hear you talk about how fun it was because it seems like [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3517.68s)]
*  the hell of war and the trauma that guys have the PTSD, but there's something about like, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3522.32s)]
*  what is it? Is it working with your comrades in arms? Is it like doing the thing that you've been [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3528.0s)]
*  told to do and you're really good at it and you love that? Is it all like, what is that? What is [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3532.48s)]
*  fun? I mean, why be ashamed of trying your best no matter what that is, I think. Right? And I think [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3536.4s)]
*  that's really what it boils down to. I mean, yeah, I could be ashamed. Did a lot of people die? Yeah, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3551.04s)]
*  a lot of people died. Did some of the wrong people die? Sure. You know what I mean? Did innocent [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3555.68s)]
*  people die? Sure. But like, this is war and essentially war is you kill the bad guy and [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3561.2s)]
*  break his shit so he can't use that shit against you. If I was told to go do that, why am I the bad [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3566.24s)]
*  guy in this? I'm not. You know what I mean? I'm just doing my best on a daily basis, you know? And [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3573.04s)]
*  at the end of the day, I always seen it as I'm in the army, I take orders, let's go. And a lot of [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3579.04s)]
*  times I like those orders. You know what I mean? What was the brotherhood dynamic? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3584.0s)]
*  Oh, man, you would think it's kind of interesting. You would think the brotherhood would have been [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3589.44s)]
*  strong. But like the war like builds bonds, you can't get anywhere else, I guess. You know what [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3596.32s)]
*  I mean? Like, you'd think like there's always a brotherhood, right? Well, we talk about the [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3606.32s)]
*  brotherhood, but we just joked about seal drama. You know what I'm saying? So having said that, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3611.92s)]
*  I think there's like guys that I'm like, I was in combat with that we have a bond. I think there's [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3618.1600000000003s)]
*  certain people I have bonds with over different stuff. But I think that bond, the brotherhood is [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3625.36s)]
*  just, you know, the experiencing the best and worst of humanity at the same time. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3631.76s)]
*  Mm hmm. And when your life is on the line, it just adds, I don't know, so much more to it, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3638.48s)]
*  I would think, like you're risking it all together. And any one of you might not be there the next [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3643.92s)]
*  night. Yeah, I mean, I always say like, I always say, well, I said this to my guys, too, but I, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3650.16s)]
*  we all gave Uncle Sam a blank check. Get ready, don't be mad if it gets cash. But don't be mad [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3656.4s)]
*  for somebody when their check is cash because they died doing what they loved. Can't be mad [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3663.28s)]
*  at that either. Were there any women in your unit? Maybe you're not allowed to tell me. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3668.48s)]
*  I don't know. Can women be Rangers? I don't know. That's a good question. I think so these days. I [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3677.44s)]
*  don't know. Like, I don't know how it works. Did you ever have to deal with that dynamic out in [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3683.2000000000003s)]
*  the field? Like men and women serving together? Yeah. It just seems so weird to me. I don't know. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3687.12s)]
*  I know nothing. I think women have very niche roles and can have very niche roles. I've worked [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3692.64s)]
*  with women. I've had women partners. They were great. But I think there's a role for them and [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3703.3599999999997s)]
*  they're not like the one you send, you know, get Zarkawi, right? There's other stuff they do. So, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3710.64s)]
*  yes, we have women, always have women. I think there's more women on the planet than men. I [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3717.7599999999998s)]
*  don't know why that's shocking. Well, I'm curious about, I'm back to your dating life now. Can you [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3725.04s)]
*  meet a woman somehow? How do you fall in love? How do you like? Man, I'll tell you this. I started [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3730.24s)]
*  out married at 9 11. I've been divorced several times. It's a hard life. You know, I don't think, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3736.08s)]
*  I think it's a hard life because no one understands like your level of commitment. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3743.7599999999998s)]
*  And I say that in a way like you're choosing something that might cause your death over and [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3749.7599999999998s)]
*  over. People don't see that as rational, but they don't understand. You know what I mean? But [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3758.24s)]
*  so I would say, I always say this is like being married was like being in prison. You could call [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3764.88s)]
*  home. You ain't going there anytime soon. You know what I mean? That's just how it works. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3770.32s)]
*  What do you mean? I don't think I get it. I don't get it. That's how marriage works in the army. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3775.36s)]
*  Like when you deployed a war, you could call home, get your one phone call. Yeah. Call home like once [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3779.92s)]
*  a week or something. You're not going to be together a whole lot. Yeah. But you ain't going home. You [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3786.0s)]
*  know what I mean? And that's tough on anybody. I would, I would say this [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3790.32s)]
*  only guys that had perfect relationships, their marriages survive the war. You know what I mean? [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3795.1200000000003s)]
*  And I'd say the bulk of guys end up divorced. Do you have kids? I do. How old are they? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3801.1200000000003s)]
*  I stopped keeping track when they turned over 21. How many kids do you have? I have two. Okay. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3807.04s)]
*  Yeah. Are they good? Yeah, they're good. They're good. They're good people. Are they going into the [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3813.52s)]
*  into the military? My son was in the army and works for the army now. Okay. So when it all winds, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3818.8s)]
*  when it ends, you know, Iraq eventually ends Afghanistan ended disastrously and recently. Yeah. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3825.44s)]
*  Is that a moment for reflection on what it meant? What role you played, whether it was worth it? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3833.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, or no, is it just, I'm a soldier. I did my job next chapter. Well, it wasn't worth it. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3837.76s)]
*  I mean, everyone can see that, right? It's not just me. I don't think it was worth it at all. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3842.56s)]
*  I had a great time. I would say none of it was really worth it in a strategic sense, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3846.32s)]
*  in a tactical sense. You know what I mean? Like, honestly, but the reality is, is like, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3854.0s)]
*  man, I had the time of my life and I, I would want anyone to know, like people, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3859.52s)]
*  people like to thank me for my service. And it's like, I did whatever the fuck I wanted. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3866.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't actually need any thanks. You know what I mean? Like a kid who was like a cook getting [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3870.56s)]
*  mortared in fucking wherever in Iraq nightly, that kid needs to be thanked. Like I just, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3875.76s)]
*  I was just doing what I do. Well, how do you reconcile it with stories like, you know, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3883.6000000000004s)]
*  Marcus Luttrell and what happened to him and he's definitely got some lasting PTSD from that. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3889.0400000000004s)]
*  It's been a rough ride back home. Yeah, I don't even get that. I was out alone all the time. Like [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3893.84s)]
*  I was out alone in Afghanistan. I don't get how being the lone survivor, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3901.28s)]
*  I just don't understand that story only because I was out alone all the time. It didn't happen to me. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3905.6000000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? Cause the decisions I make on the ground. Well, you're not blaming him. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3911.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. I'm just saying it's so that's so foreign to me. I don't even understand it. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3916.32s)]
*  Cause I can tell you this, the Taliban could come after me. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3921.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, there's one of the worst stories of the war and what he went through is [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3924.48s)]
*  Stoffel and it's not just him. You know, I was at last year and it was two years ago. We talked to [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3939.6s)]
*  Dakota Meyer. He's doing great now. But you know, he came back. He won the was awarded the medal of [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3944.08s)]
*  honor and wanted to kill himself. Like he, there are tough, tough guys. Not these are not weak men [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3951.44s)]
*  who they don't process it the way you do. I think if you could somehow teach this, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3959.2000000000003s)]
*  it would be extremely valuable. I could teach anybody this. I feel like anybody could use this. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3965.6s)]
*  People who have different traumas. It would start by me locking you in a room and beating you first. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3970.88s)]
*  Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I know exactly. I might sign up for that. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3975.7599999999998s)]
*  I think people would. Don't touch the moneymaker. No, of course, of course. No bruises, no marks. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3981.2s)]
*  I'm a pro. Like I've done a bunch of interrogations. I got this. I mean, like, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3986.08s)]
*  is there some sort of toughen you up? John Camp? Oh, no, there isn't. I mean, the shirt, what does [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3990.72s)]
*  it read? Team SOB. I called you tough SOB. Same thing. So this is not something I can sign up for [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=3997.04s)]
*  or I can go learn. I don't have any classes like this. You're missing an opportunity. Leadership, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4003.8399999999997s)]
*  right? Leadership. Can it be taught? I think so. I think so. Like most of my guys, if my guys [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4010.16s)]
*  killed somebody, I brought them all in a room. I made everyone have a drink. I made sure I told [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4018.72s)]
*  them they did exactly right. You know, this was expected of them, right? Like this is your job. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4023.7599999999998s)]
*  Like someone should thank you. And I think if all that happens on the spot, you're less likely to [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4028.48s)]
*  carry the guilt with you later. So I believe a lot of this is framed up poorly a long time ago. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4035.36s)]
*  And then I believe guys ride the hall pass for a long time. And I call the hall pass booze, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4044.32s)]
*  but some people do drugs. Some people do, I don't know what people do, but for me, my hall pass was [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4050.72s)]
*  booze. You know what I mean? And then still drink or no, no more. Well, I'm training for worlds right [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4056.32s)]
*  now. So I am currently not drinking worlds in what jujitsu. Oh, wow. Are you ex military guys? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4062.32s)]
*  Why is that? I don't know. Jujitsu. It's an hour of my day where I don't have to look at the phone. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4070.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a, sometimes there's minutes where someone's actually like choking the living shit out of me. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4079.28s)]
*  And the stubborn side of me is like, I'm not giving it to them. You know what I mean? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4085.68s)]
*  Isn't it involuntary? No. What? No. When they choke you out? No. Yeah. No. It's not involuntary? [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4089.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. I gotta learn those moves. If you make me give it to you, I'll give it to you. Otherwise, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4097.28s)]
*  you could choke the shit out of me and I'll just ride it. But when I'm in real survival mode, [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4101.6s)]
*  someone puts me in trouble. I got to think about what's next. My leverage, my everything, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4107.6s)]
*  control my breathing, my heart rate. I call that real survival mode. I'm so thankful for that. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4113.12s)]
*  It's a clarity of some time. Oh, I'm envious of it. Yes, I hear you. So it's like, you know, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4122.0s)]
*  like people talk about runners high. Like, you know, I do cardio. It doesn't make me high [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4126.32s)]
*  ever. I've always hated it. But like jujitsu is, I don't know, sometimes when I'm in real [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4132.0s)]
*  survival, I don't got to think about my phone. I don't got to think about my life. Are you always [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4138.0s)]
*  going against somebody who knows what they're doing? Is it usually an instructor or another [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4141.76s)]
*  like, participant? Because I travel, I hit, I think 28, 30 different dojos a year. I just walk in and [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4145.76s)]
*  I do worry about like out matching somebody to the point where you're going to hurt them and [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4155.76s)]
*  get sued or not going to hurt any cause permanent damage. No, I'm a recovering lawyer. This is how [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4160.08s)]
*  I think about these things. Oh, no, not as you jitsu. Like, look, this is an arm hurting somebody. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4164.88s)]
*  There's not, there's hurting somebody. I'm not gonna. Well, yeah, but you stop. Is it like, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4170.88s)]
*  yeah, as you get better at it, right? Like this is the point of submission. If you thought I was [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4174.88s)]
*  going to hurt you, you could tap. Okay. So that's your escape button. That's like the, the safe [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4180.32s)]
*  gesture. Don't, don't hurt me anymore, please. I've had enough. Yeah. You just tap. So what [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4187.76s)]
*  are you doing now? I'm training for worlds cut and wave. What are you doing for money? Oh, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4192.88s)]
*  I teach people to shoot. Okay. Oh yeah. Cause you were a sniper. We didn't even get, we didn't [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4197.68s)]
*  go over that. No, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. How many guns do you own? Seriously? I couldn't count more [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4202.88s)]
*  or less than JD Vance's mamaw had in her house when she, I don't even know how many that is. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4212.08s)]

*  about it. They created a tasty and delicious tortilla chip with just three ingredients and no [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30XUyqtRF4&t=4544.4800000000005s)]
